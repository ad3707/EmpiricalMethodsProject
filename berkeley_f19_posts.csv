I wrote a blog post helping international students find jobs in the USA - let me know what you think..,"Hey bears,

I just graduated this May with degrees in Environmental Economics &amp; Philosophy. I was an international student and found it really hard to get a job (but I eventually did!). I wanted to write [an article](http://shikharsachdev.com/how-to-get-a-job-as-an-international-student-in-the-usa/) giving advice to other international students on going about the job hunting process. 

I think [the article](http://shikharsachdev.com/how-to-get-a-job-as-an-international-student-in-the-usa/) can be useful to almost any student, not even just international students. Specifically, if you're a humanities major, this article may be helpful in terms of breaking into the startup world.

How panicked should I feel over this recent 100A midterm?,"I'm an *intended* economics major and might get a public policy minor if I ditch being premed. I have Acland for 100A. 

Anyway, I need a B- and C+ in Stats 20 and Economics 100A to meet the cap (they can be interchangeable) but based on distributions/averages it looks like it'd be more likely to get a B- in Econ 100A and a C+ in Stats 20 because the average in 100A is a B and the average in Stats 20 is a B-. 

I kind of wanted to get higher because premed (and maybe law school) but oh well, I'm not that great at econ.

Anyway, I felt a bit shaken walking out of the midterm because I struggled a bit with the last problem (and definitely BS'd the last 5 points and more likely than not made other errors) but at the same time I don't think I *totally failed* (as in I didn't feel like I made *everything* up and didn't write BS down for *every* problem). 

So my questions are:

1) Is it doable to kinda fail every exam and still get a B- or C+ in the class?

2) Does Acland curve generously? 

3) If you're also in 100A right now, how did you feel about it?",1569379522,0,0

second year at berkeley and ive never felt this lost,"Freshman year I was so happy. The newfound freedom, the constant state of being surrounded by people, the way all the freshmen around me were so eager to make friends and have new experiences---I gained so much confidence and felt that this was really the beginning of the better part of my life. 

It was a slow and gradual buildup, but second year rolls around and I can feel the real anxieties taking over. I'm constantly thinking of how I don't have the professional or research experience to get the cs experience that I want. I really do love programming, but I'm struggling a lot in my current cs course. I know it's always hard to get your foot in the door for this kind of career, and I know I shouldn't compare myself to other people, but seeing my peers doing amazing work and having a great time with their clubs puts a small ache in me because I'm afraid I'll never have that. 

It feels like I'm always playing catch-up, chasing deadline after deadline, but nothing good is coming out of it. I cant find the time or motivation to do the personal projects I want to do, or apply for research that interests me. Every moment that I spend talking to friends or exercising or just laying still, there's always an unsettling guilt sitting in my chest. It's scary because every thought that runs through my head now is sprinkled with anxiety and guilt, and I really don't want that. I just want a chance to pause everything for a second and catch my breath, renew my perspective, but deadlines are still deadlines and time passed is still time passed.

[The Parousia] Chancellor Christ is doing her second AMA in our subreddit! Here are the rules and guidelines I'm enacting in order to ensure a successful AMA.,"**[Link to the AMA from last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/)**
-

**[Link to the AMA coming this Wednesday, Sep 25th](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/d8cvx2/i_am_uc_berkeley_chancellor_carol_christ_ask_me/)**
-

-

-

Our last AMA went so well, Christ is coming back for another!

The Chancellor's reddit account is /u/carolchrist. This is not the actual AMA thread. The actual AMA is pinned to the top of the subreddit, and Christ will start answering questions in two days' time. You will have these two days to think of a question and post it in the thread. 

Please read the [previous AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/) to see which questions were already asked.

-

-

**THE ACTUAL AMA**
-

* **No questions are off-limits. But keep it respectful and formal.**

Christ does not want to limit any sort of questions *at all* for this AMA. Nothing is off-limits. However, you must stay respectful and formal. Make sure you remain respectful and your question will not be removed. 

Joke questions *are* allowed. 

* **The AMA thread will be in contest mode until the actual AMA start time.**

This is because I don't want people to start long discussions before the AMA has begun. We also need time to promote this event on different channels and make sure everyone affiliated with the campus has time to create an account and post their questions. 

The Chancellor will start answering questions this Wednesday at 5:00PM. 

* **Parent comments only**

The Chancellor does not have enough time to read through chains of comments. We want original questions posted as *only* parent comments. If you want to piggyback off of another parent comment you liked, you may refer to it in a parent comment of your own. 

This may seem odd, but we want people to have as many chances as possible to get their questions answered, and we want the AMA to feel like an actual back-and-forth discussion between our community and the Chancellor. 

**All children comments will be deleted until Christ starts her actual AMA. After which children comments will be allowed.** 

Once the Chancellor comes in, I want her answers to be the only child comment to each parent comment. That way, even after this two day delay, you won't have to go hunting for Christ's answers, and you can follow-up on her answers more easily. 

In a future event, we may be able to have the Chancellor answer question that arose from discussions, but I don't want those long-winded discussions to start prematurely. 

-

-

-

---

---

Again, please be on your best behavior. We may have even more events in the future, and maybe the Chancellor would be open to coming to a subreddit meetup. This will only be possible if this AMA goes well. 

Stay respectful, ask your best questions, and 

**GO BEARS!!!**

I am UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ. Ask me anything!,"Hello, Reddit! /u/michaeldirda from the campus public affairs office here. With /u/lulzcakes‘s support we’re bringing back UC Berkeley’s chancellor, Carol Christ, for another Ask Me Anything session this week. We hosted an AMA with the chancellor [for the first time last October](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/), and she loved the format and the opportunity to field so many questions from the campus. 

Some brief background about Chancellor Christ: She first came to Berkeley just shy of fifty years ago to serve as a professor of English, and aside from a stint as president of Smith College from 2002 to 2013 has spent her whole career here. She was appointed Berkeley’s first female chancellor in 2017, and since then has worked extremely hard to fix the campus’ budget, develop a ten-year strategic plan for the campus, address the housing shortage, build community and improve the campus climate for people of all backgrounds, and more. You can learn more about her [on the chancellor’s web site](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellor-christ/biography).

I’m starting this thread now so you can think of questions and start voting on them, and she’ll begin answering on **Wednesday, September 25th at 4 p.m.**

As with last time, I'm just here to help the chancellor navigate Reddit’s non-intuitive interface; she’ll be responding to all questions herself. She says she’ll be happy to talk about whatever the community is interested in, though if there are areas that she does not know well enough she might ask me to circle back on a question if she doesn’t feel that she can fully answer it. 

Thanks so much and ask away!

Business Insider wants to know what a day in the life of a Berkeley student is like,"Hello everyone!

I’m a reporter at Business Insider and I’m working on a project that I thought some of y’all might want to get involved in. **We are interested in writing a feature story that would focus in on what a day in the life is like for an average Berkeley student.** We wrote a piece similar to this about an Oxford student in the past. (link included below). If any of y’all are interested, we would love to work with you to tell your story!

All we would need is about **10 to 15 photos of you documenting your day as a student.** These photos can be as mundane or as crazy as you like. I would also want to briefly chat with you about it all since I would be writing the story. This would be a great way to get your name out there in a major publication and tell the world a little bit about yourself.

Separately, we are also **interested in students who might be willing to share a copy of the essay they wrote that got them into Berkeley.** If you are really proud of your essay and still have a copy, we would love to be able to publish it. **We’d be willing to pay you for your essay.**

If either of these sounds of interest please let me know! Thank y’all.

For a long time I've been wanting to learn to ride a motorcycle to ride the 15-mile roundtrip commute from home. Right know, I commute by car and the cost per semester is really expensive if you ask me. I have to pay for a $400-ish dollar parking permit plus about $120 on gas per month (excluding all services involved). To me personal mobility is key, so I cannot rely on BART or the Bus system, but I want to reduce commuting costs and why not, traffic and footprint. Having said that, I have no clue how hard it is to get a parking spot, or if you have to get a student permit, and all the nitty-gritty details regarding to motorcycles on campus. As a side node, I have zero experience so how can I get started?

TL:DR: What is you experience riding a motorcycle to campus?",1569205608,2,0

Does anyone else here feel like no one goes to college to learn? Instead people go here to demonstrate how smart they are.,"Think about it: when class is canceled, people celebrate. Why would people celebrate if they were coming here to learn. This is clear evidence that something else is at play.

Theoretically, you could get a Berkeley education for free if you wanted to. All you'd have to do is start auditing courses as a non-enrolled student. Professors generally don't care when people sit in on courses. Some might even be flattered that a non-enrolled person cared enough to learn the material from them. 

But the reason why people don't to do that is ultimately because most people. don't. want. education. They want a diploma saying they went here, so that they can brag to others, and impress employers with how smart and hardworking they are.

This is pretty sad. 

I hear a lot of political folks talk about how ""education is important"" and how we should make tuition free. But if college isn't about education, and is instead about signaling intelligence, then it makes no sense to make tuition free. Think about it: the system is set up so that employers can determine who is the best worker by their level of education. If everyone has access to higher education, then nobody will be able to get the signaling benefits from going.

It is exactly isomorphic to the situation with a crowded theatre. If one person stands up in the theater, they will reason correctly that ""I will see the film better if I stand up."" However, it does not follow that if every single person in the theater stood up, then they would all be able to see the film better.

College is a filter that lets employers know who is smart and who isn't. Given this, why do people put this system in such a noble light? It's so obviously about getting into the most prestigious institution and being impressive. College has essentially nothing to do with the actual learning.",1569187302,0,0

Question about parking in RPP zones,"Hi!

I am a grad student from Europe who will be doing a research stay at UC Berkeley for a couple of months starting this October. I will arrive in the US a couple of weeks earlier and was planning to visit some places in California (a couple of friends from home are coming with me for this ""tourism"" part).

Long story short, I'll have a rental car which I plan to drive to Berkeley and have it with me for the first 3 or 4 days to help carry my move-in stuff, baggage, do the first ""big"" shopping of things for my apartment, etc. Then I will return the car and walk or bike to campus for the remaining of my stay. 

All of this is to say that please bear (go!) with me since I have never lived not only in the US but in any city the size/type of Berkeley.

I have read the parking section on the City of Berkeley's website as well as several posts in this sub, but I still have some doubts. My apartment is located in RPP area J, so I assume I cannot park the car on or around my street Mon to Fri from 8am to 7pm, for more than 2 hours. However, how is this enforced? Does it mean 2 hours a day? What if I park the car for 2 hrs and then move it to a different spot on the same street (or the same RPP zone) and leave it there for another 2 hours, is this allowed? What does ""that block"" refer to in the following sentence from the [city's website](https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Customer_Service/Home/RPP_Residential_Preferential_Parking.aspx#enforcement) ""Those without an annual or visitor permit can park for a total of two hours on either side of that block""? In the same way, I assume that if I park the car at 7pm then I wouldn't need to move it until 10am the following day (8am to 10am being the 2-hr allowed free parking).

I have another question on the boundaries of the RPP areas. Looking at the [map](https://www.cityofberkeley.info/uploadedFiles/Public_Works/Level_3_-_Transportation/RPP_R(1).pdf), I understand the different areas marked with letters and colors. However, what does the gray line that surrounds the whole map mean? It says ""RPP-boundary"", so I assume that outside this boundary there is free parking on the street (apart from any kind of particular restrictions on particular streets). What about the white zones inside the ""RPP-boundary"" that don't seem to belong to any area? Is there free parking there? For instance, I see there's a big zone west of Adeline St that may be convenient for me that seems to not belong to any RPP area. Is parking there free and unrestricted?

Finally, apart from all these regulations and ticket avoidance, what about the safety of the car? Do you guys believe it is safe to park a car overnight without supervision in any of the areas that I've mentioned (all of them seem ""quiet"" and residential)?

MCB 102 Disc Quizzes,"Hi everyone,

I'm taking MCB 102 this semester and have a couple questions about the course. There are 2 pop quizzes for each section of this course. The first section (pKa, pH, protein structure, etc.) is being taught by Merchant this semester.

2) If you've taken the class, do you have any advice on how to study for these quizzes?

3) If you're currently taking the class, what resources are helping you understand the material? So far I've been reviewing the webcasted lectures and looking through the book, but I feel like there's probably more I can do.

(Hopeful) Berkeley Transfer Student,"I’m having a bit of a dilemma. 

Last year, I applied to Berkeley as a media studies major and was accepted. Unfortunately, I failed my chemistry class which led me to revoke my acceptance because I could not fulfill the admission requirements. My GPA went from a 3.6 all the way down to a 3.0 because of that chemistry class. 

I plan on reapplying again this year, though my GPA won’t be as competitive and will only be a 3.4 or 3.5. It’s been stressing me out how drastically my GPA has dropped all because of one class (I’ve gotten A’s and B’s only besides that one F). My biggest question is: do I still have a good enough chance in getting into Berkeley? From what I’ve read online, to be accepted to Cal, you must have a 3.6 GPA, however for media studies major, the lowest GPA accepted is 3.2 so I’m hoping that this major isn’t super competitive to get into.

finding housing after dorm life,"just curious, but I wanted to know if it was a good idea to live outside of Berkeley in a relatively safer city and commute about twenty min each way per day to go to classes and if people do this often. 

i live in the dorms this year, which is fine, but i feel genuinely uncomfortable in berkeley, especially with its high crime rates. i come from suburbia, so i'd be looking to go back and find a small apartment in a suburban city, where i would be comfortable going to stores/out alone and would be able to safely store my car inside my garage (AKA less of a housing crisis)

of course, as a freshman, i really don't need to worry about this right now, but these past few weeks, i've started thinking about this more and more. i would love some advice from people who have lived off campus!!",1568096510,0,0

Supporting the Homeless,"Sorry if there's been other threads on this, but I live on Southside and so I see a decent amount of homeless people every day. I feel bad when I walk past them, especially if I'm leaving TeaOne with a $5 cup of boba in hand and they may not even have enough water for the day. 

I've always been stuck on how to help them (I couldn't do Suitcase Clinic because I had a UGSI thing for chemistry one semester). I donate food to pantries and stuff if I have extras.

I also can't really help *all* of them individually (either through giving them money or food) as I'm also a cash-strapped college student. If I see them with kids, I give them money because I don't feel that their kids should have to suffer, but unfortunately if it's just them, then I usually don't donate :/

Does anyone have any ideas on how I can help them besides Suitcase and donations to people with kids?",1568081940,0,0

Club Rejections + Case Interview Advice,"This is probably the 100th post on this subreddit about club rejections, but I just got rejected from Phoenix Consulting (yes, throwing shade at them cuz, well, screw you all :)))) during their latest interview round.

I guess I just really fucked up the case interview, lmao, which kinda sucks because I did practice a bit with Case in Point and McKinsey's sample interview questions. 

This was my first experience with consulting and business, ever, and I was actually amazed to see that I actually sort of like case interview questions. I'll admit that this rejection dampened my passion for consulting a bit but I'm mainly trying to improve from this. 

I guess I suck at thinking on my feet and didn't give a strong recommendation at the end for a strategy going forward.

CNR freshman in need of serious advice,"Hello,

I am currently having trouble with my next semester schedule. To provide some background, a general counselor for my college told me that my AP credit can cover all of my breadth requirements (I've heard mixed things about this). This semester I was planning on taking Chem 32 because of my weak chemistry coursework in high school (not AP Chem), but due to some schedule changes I had to drop it. Now knowing its not offered in the spring semester, I am hesitant to take 1A but will be studying the topics on my own. 

I am still not sure how to complete my 2nd semester schedule considering I am done with breadths (?). So far, I'm thinking Math 16B for sure, along with Chem 1A **or** Math 16B and Stats 20. I don't think I could handle all three. Aside from that I'm thinking a DeCal or a class to fill my units, since I am on financial aid. In order to fill my units I was thinking a Freshman Seminar or a one unit intro class to my major. If it comes down to it, I'm also willing to take simple breadth classes just for interest and the unit req (could also use recommendations). I'm also taking an R1B course so I'll hopefully be done with R&amp;C this semester.

CS/Art Double Major??,hellooo I’m currently a freshman CS intended major. I’m interested in graphics and ultimately want to go into animation/CGI/video game graphics or something along those lines. In have enough AP credits to graduate a year early but I kinda wanted to use that extra time to explore another subject. I considered minoring in art practice but the minor somehow disappeared?? Apparently art practice is only offered as a major now.

I have no calculus experience. Kind of. The one time I was in a calculus class was about a year and a half ago and I dropped it after two weeks.

FAILED MY FIRST MIDTERM AS A FIRST YEAR. WHAT SHOULD I DO? (ASTRO C10),"very clickbait-y title but also 100% truthful. I know my question is a very naive freshman thing of me to ask but: 

I am taking astro c10 for my physical science breadth. I love the professor, do the homework and labs, and I study of course, but even after feeling like I understood the material I still failed the midterm. (The way the questions are phrased are also more conceptual than I'm used to)... many I'm not studying properly for this midterm? 

Besides study more, PNP the class (which I am probably going to do), what other advice do you have for me? I am worried about not even passing the class if I do poorly on the final especially. I need this for the L&amp;S breadth requirement and I don't know what I'd do if I don't pass it. Has anyone else been in this class before in a similar situation? Also are there any tutoring resources for this class, besides generalized physics tutors? It's silly because I feel like I'm learning in the course, I enjoy it, and I don't care about having to PNP it; however, I understood this is supposed to be one of the easier physical science breadths yet my midterm grade did not reflect this obviously.

Bombed CS 70 Midterm... not sure what to do now,"I actually bombed the first CS 70 midterm.

I know people do DS as an alternative sometimes, but I'm really not interested in data science. I just feel so terrible right now and don't know where to go from here. People will say to work hard and ace the midterm and final, but realistically, I just know that's not happening. Even if I do slightly better on the next exams (which is unlikely), the weight of this bombed midterm has already destroyed a huge part of my grade. With this midterm grade, I can't get the grade I need to declare CS and I'm totally lost right now. I don't want to do any other major :(

The other option is appealing, but I have no idea if people actually get in through appeals.

How hard is 61A for somebody with ~8 years of CS experience?,"Hey,

Chem Bio major here. So I’ve been doing CS as a hobby since I was like 9 years old, and programming is one of my favorite pastimes and I’d consider myself to be pretty good at it.  I am considering minoring in CS, but not if it’ll leave me with no time to take the classes I wouldn’t have the opportunity to learn about otherwise. (You can easily learn CS online, but not Drugs and The Brain for example).

So I’m concerned because adding 61A would bring my unit schedule up to 19 units, which for a lazy guy like me seems like a lot. 

For somebody with ~8-9 years of CS experience, how easy would CS61A be? Is attendance in lecture mandatory? Can somebody provide me examples of projects/homework y’all gotta do so I can get an idea of whether or not I could breeze through it?

Help me choosing classes?,"Hello fellow bears, i’m a freshman trying to declare CS and Math double major. I’m currently taking Math 54 and CS 61A and are doing... not terrible but not too good either(projected B+ for 61A and A- for 54)

Anyway, I’d like to take from 16-20 units next semester. Besides either EE16A or EE16B+EE47D, i’m also thinking about taking 61B and either CS70 or Math 55. I’m also thinking about a easy writing class(according to berkeley time)

So my question are as the following:
Give that i’m doubling in math and CS, 
1, should i take math 55 or cs70? imo 70 has better professor but heavy course load(especially with 61B cuz i wanna do well and have a better GPA), while 55 has shitty professor but comparatively lighter course load.
2, should I take 16A or 16B + 47D? taking 16A would be easy for me bc im taking 54 this semester, but it might waster some of my time, especially when I’m trying to double major and graduate in 4 years; on the other hand, 16B and 47D(if i can get enrolled) does put me on a faster pace, but might result in heavier course load and less stable foundation
3, i’m taking 15 units this semester and really want to catch up. one of the reasons i’m not doing ideally this semester is because i tried out a lot of clubs which kind of used up part of my time(as well as the adjustment). i’m wondering if 3 techs + 1 writing(16U) or overall a 16-20 unit schedule is doable.

neurobio careers/jobs without med school?,"im a first year intending to major in mcb neurobiology, but i REALLY dont want to go to medical school. im interested in studying the brain and everything, but medical school is just too much for me......but im worried the only jobs in that field require medical school. everyone else i know in mcb is pre med, and when i look at the peer advising page, all the peet advisors intend to go to medical school.

i was thinking about maybe switching my major to cogsci if im trapped to medical school with neurobiology. im more interested in humanities side of things anyways, but that worries me too because 

1. my first semester would have kind of gone to waste, trying to do pre-reqs for mcb instead of cogsci (or any other major for that matter)

2. cogsci (and other majors i've looked into) is impacted, so i might not even get in. what if i make all this fuss and switch majors for nothing

"Stressed over CS170, need advice on what to do please","Hi guys, I've been quite stressed over 170 lately and need your advice. I’ll need to provide some details for context, but please stick with me if possible.

I did pretty bad on both midterms, and  now I’m on track for a B-/B. Although a B is an ok grade imo, I am very stressed because I am planning to apply to the 5th year CS  Masters programs (so 170 is important for application purposes) and I strongly dislike all the material in 170. Specifically, I get really really bored and stressed out when reading 170 notes/watching lectures. Tbh, I feel like I’m just learning a bunch of theory that I won’t realy use (I know DP/LP/etc are often tested during coding interviews may be tested during interviews, but I still feel like 170 goes way too deep). **I also studied my ass off for both midterms, but still scored \~0.5-1 std below avg.**

I have a late drop form available, should I P/NP, drop the class, or continue taking it? To provide more context, I am currently also taking Data 100 and 61c, and am on track for A’s in those classes. I have also taken 2 other upper divs in prior semesters and received A-/A’s in them.

I called my sister (an EECS grad) for advice, and she is adamant that I should continue with 170 even it hurts my GPA. She also mentioned that theres only a few weeks left so I might as well just finish it. However, I don’t think my sister understands how much I dislike the class and how stressful it will be for me to study for the final. Please anyone have advice?

Looking to Create a Mastermind Group of College Entrepreneurs,"Hey bears!

This is my first post on reddit, I figured it would be a good place to look for like-minded people! I believe forming a mastermind would be hugely beneficial for students here making more progress in their passions and encouraging each other to keep up.

What I had in mind was forming a small group of people who would meet weekly to discuss things we have been working on, set goals, and work together. This way everyone in the group can grow together and we can all accomplish more faster! 

If you are interested in joining the group, please message me or post a reply and let's get it going! 

Thanks in advance!",1573413861,1,0

1827 He's standing there in shock.

1827 Peter Buttgieg: I feel soulless right now, maybe I'm better off that way.

1827 Sean? Porter: Buttgieg's actually laughing about it.

1843 Gigi Hadid: The first time DeBlasio fucked a kid...

1844 ?: Retarded observation after what just happened to that kid.

1847 Gigi Hadid: Buttgieg is dancing around \[celebrating\] he killed his first kid.

1903 Donald Reeves: There's not gonna be anymore of that disgusting shit. Buttgieg made him \[the boy\] eat his own shit.

1905 Peter Buttgieg: What's the deal Christopher?

1905 Christopher Porter: That's Buttgieg, wants to know if that kid is still alive.

Possibly, but you are scab for crossing the larger student strike and possibly funding her vile anti intellectualism. Just out of curiosity, I researched some of her quotes. Does anyone think this actually is becoming of a top university that promotes a safe space for students?

I'm taking EE16B next semester, but my worry is that because this wasn't a pure Maths course the Math 54 kids will have a better understanding of Linear Algebra than I do.

Because of this, would it be a good idea to take Math54 and EE16b concurrently next semester, or is it just a waste of a class?

Instead of that option, would perhaps taking Math110 in my sophomore or junior year be perhaps a better idea? Can EE16AB satisfy the Math 54 prerequisite for this class?

Coulter event,"I can’t believe some of you condone and even support Refuse Fascism and ANTIFA’s actions while wanting lower tuition and cheaper housing for everyone. The more encouraged and welcomed they are, the more the University has to chalk up in security fees and reparations, and the University is using your money (and eventually raising costs) to pay for it. Regardless of whether you’re on the right or left, you should be conscious of this as a Cal student.

Peaceful protest is respectable, but these groups are incapable of that and their respective histories speak for themselves. I don’t care who’s coming to campus - if they’re coming to speak at a public institution they should be allowed to speak without such impediments. Sure, if a speaker has said reprehensible things, then educate people with reason. When you engage with violence and force then you automatically lose all respect amongst the rational, reasonable person whom you are trying to educate.

As Cal students, we should be actively speaking out against these types of groups and let them know that they are not welcome here, whether right or left wing, since we have to foot the bill in the end.",1574354821,1,0

"After 2.5 years of doing CS, I hate academics and CS in general. I want to be a musician. Would it make sense to drop out of Berkeley or should I tough out a degree?","Hey guys,

So throughout high school, I was super passionate about music. I was heavily involved in the music program, being in my schools orchestra, marching band, jazz ensemble, and even choir. But I also focused and did well in academics. I strongly considered a music performance major, and either going down the music performance route or being a music teacher. I play violin, marching percussion (like marching snare), and electric guitar. But I caved to the pressures of my Asian parents who made it clear they were not okay with me pursuing music and I should pursue a more lucrative and practical profession, like CS. So I focused on that, and got into Berkeley.

I've been at Cal for 2.5 years now, and I'm doing kinda well academically while pursuing my CS classes. However, I genuinely hate it. Music is my true passion and what I love, and it would make me happy to drop out and pursue music full-time. I want to be a guitarist doing jazz stuff mostly, and hilariously enough, I wish I attended Berklee school of music on the east coast over Berkeley. 

However, I know quitting college and trying to make it as a musician is reckless financially, and a lot of aspiring musicians, even super talented ones, make ends meat by driving uber and lyft, doing retail jobs, etc. And if I tough it out in CS, and get the degree, I could have a CS job, even though I hate it so much, as a backup that pays pretty well and devote my entire free time to music and making that work, and I could work part-time in CS too to get some dough while trying to get an avenue into music. It's just I love music so much and hate academics and school despite being competent at academics and caved into Asian culture/parent pressures, but you need to put food on the table somehow.

Cosmic Pluralism Studies,"MESSAGE TO EDUCATORS

Hello,

I am writing to educators, academics, and academic institutions to encourage the adoption of a course of study related to the issue of “ufos” (the most commonly used term though the United Stated government and many others today prefer the term “unidentified aerial phenomenon” or “uap”).

Despite the “breaking news” on this subject since the NY Times report of December 2017 (when they identified a Pentagon UFO study program and released Navy pilot film), signs of a continued avoidance to addressing this subject remain.

Nevertheless, there are beginning signs of a growing recognition of the need to address this, no matter where this leads. In September 2019, Politico’s Bryan Bender noted an interesting statement by the Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee, Matk Walker (R-NC). Walker had been making inquiries in a partially frustrated attempt to determine whether the Chinese or Russians have made an extraordinary and dramatic leap in technology. It appears he may be realizing something else may be happening:

“In a recent interview, Walker, a former pastor, also acknowledged that he is open to the possibility that there are no easy explanations—or the answers could change how humanity perceives the known universe.”

Since preparing a course of study for a long-ignored subject may be a difficult and confusing process at the start, I want to identify a resource that can serve as a good starting point for that:

THE UFO ENCYCLOPEDIA, 3rd Edition, Two Volumes, edited by Jerome Clark. (Make sure you get the 2018 released 3rd edition; published by OMNIGRAPHICS.)

There are very limited UFO courses in a very small number of academic institutions; these may serve as helpful models.

There are also a few expensive online UFO courses of study.

Since I have had 50 plus years of intermittently engaging in a concentrated study of the subject, I began in late May 2019 to write educational content for different aspects of this subject:

http://cosmic-pluralism-studies.academy

As stated there, the material can be freely adopted, or utilized in any way, without attribution.

Finally, it would be great to see academic institutions as a safe refuge for encounter experiencers to relate their experiences in a setting that adheres to strict standards in research, something often lacking in the uncredentialed arena of ufology.

Thankyou for considering this.

"CS/Math double wanting to switch to CS/Data Science, but I took Math 55","I'm a CS/math double who took Math 55 instead of 70. 

I've heard I have to take CS 70 to transfer into CS. This is fine by me because I'm currently in Stat 134, so I know a lot of probability. Also I'm probably gonna take EE 126 next semester so I'll know way more probability. Also I need a B in 70 to declare which is apparently below the mean. Long story short I'm not *that* worried. 

I'm wondering if anyone else has been in this situation. Or, if anyone can give insight on what it's like to take a class but ""not receive credit"" for it. 

On that note, would you recommend taking EE 126 and CS 70 (and another CS upper div) at the same time, just so by the time I get to the probability part of 70 I'll get an A on it because it'll be so easy to me? 

I really wanna take EE 126 next sem bc I love the content. I just don't wanna overload my schedule, end up failing 70, and then suddenly I'm no longer a declared CS major.",1575531611,1,0

I'm also pretty sure EE16A is the only EECS class that does this.

Why do they do this? There are soooo many innocent freshman tweaking hard over their grade and where they stand in the class. Why not implement a more transparent (and not dishonest) grading system, potentially one that actually has set pre-defined grading bins which has a proven track record (see: CS61A).",1575432241,1,0

I guess I also got a little bugged when she kept trying to see what I got right/wrong on the exam as well. However...the biggest issue is that it doesn't really help if both of us are stuck on the same kind of problems and not sure why they thought we would somehow help each other. I feel like I study pretty hard and there are people I do enjoy studying with but occasionally I'll come across people who want me to send my hmwk answers to them or for me to teach them everything I know--which is quite unfair to me.

I'm currently a 3rd year CS student, and am trying to come up with my class schedule for next (my final) semester at Berkeley. I am trying to get more experience with AI and have taken 188 this semester. 

I was planning on taking 162 next semester because I have heard it is very important for a Software engineer, but also some people have spoken differently, saying depending on your focus as a Software engineer. I'm trying to decide between 162, and taking 189 with 182 (if that's even possible/recommended). 

From those with work experience, how important is 162? I'm not planning to remain a software engineer for too much of my life (trying to move up to project manager ASAP, as pretentious as that might sound) and am wondering which class combo will give me the best way to reach that path. (I would also be more interested in AI development both for engineering as well as product management)

Thanks in advance!

Best housing option for a grad student who is staying for just a semester? Advice desperately needed!,"Hi, friends - grad student from another institution who is likely to do a semester here. Very ignorant to the area housing and was overwhelmed/disappointed with what I saw thus far in terms of sheer availability. I've survived similar climates before such as NYC, but apparently this is a whole different ball game, huh?

What is the best way for someone who is staying in the area in an ideally furnished place for all of four months? airbnb? Hostel? Housing groups? Any dos or don'ts in terms of which area/city to live in? I've joined a few groups on FB but can't seem to find the right situation--I'm fine sharing space with others, but would probably prefer slightly older people/roommates who are not traditional undergraduate students. I obviously have no personal issue with young undergraduates, but as someone who's been teaching this age group for a bit now, such a situation would feel a little awkward and intrusive on my part since it's just not my world anymore.

Any suggestions would be enormously helpful, I've been kind of left hanging out to dry here by those who initially said they'd help me. Thank you!",1576674077,1,0

Any Grads Pursuing Masters in EU? Advice Please!,"My daughter did her senior year at Lund in Sweden. She wants to stay there and start her masters in the fall. She has to get a statement of completion by February 1st into Lund. Her international courses from the past semester won't be adjusted and entered until like March. Her degree won't be posted for 6 months. Her GPA is 3.92 and she's Phi Beta Kappa, so getting accepted into a masters program isn't the problem. There is no person to discuss this with at Lund. There is no registrar, just a central office for all the universities that processes all the applications.

Has anyone encountered this before? Does anyone know of a way she can get Berkeley to send some kind of statement that she's satisfied her degree requirements and her GPA before the last 18 units are factored in is 3.92?

Ego and reflections,"To preface, I'm a freshman LS CS.

I fucking hate this school. This semester has pushed me to the breaking point and forced me to become a hard-working individual. Before coming to this school my ego was the size of harvard's endowment, and now is more like the size of Berkeley's endowment. Looking back at 61A, it has pushed me so hard and even though I may not get the grade I want I have learned so much and I'm honestly so excited to learn here. We have learned HOF's, lambda's, recursion, tree recursion, trees, OOP, data abstraction, scheme, tail recursion, macros, streams, SQL, iterators, generators and more stuff I am possibly missing. At the beginning of the semester I went full try hard mode, and did well on my first exam, then got cocky and bombed the second one, I am now going full try hard mode on this final and hopefully do well. Im looking at the intro to CS courses at other schools and it doesn't even compare. My giant has ego has shrunk down and been replaced by a sense of self-accomplishment. I hope I do well on the final and get a B+ (was gunning for an A- but fuck the second midterm), but regardless it has been a hard, challenging, yet fulfilling first semester. Can't wait to come back, go full try-hard mode for all 3 midterms and crush 61B.

[Advice Needed] Medical Emergency,"I apologize for any spelling mistakes or errors, I have had to use voice dictation.   


During RRR week, I was involved in an accident that caused bilateral 2nd and 3rd degree burns on my hands.

To make matters worse, I still can’t even write. My hands are shaking so much from the neuropathic pain that everything I write looks like gibberish.

Stat 140 math 1a/1b,"Hi,

I want to take stat 140 with Adhikari next semester, but they specify that the prerequisite and corequisite for the course are data 8, math 54 and one year of calculus at the level of math 1A-1B or higher.

I have already taken data 8, and I am planning to take CS 61A and Math 54 for spring semester, but the problem is I did not take Math 1A-1B because my intended major does not require to take them if I have taken AP Calculus BC

What I am curious is as to whether Professor Adhikari asks to those with no Math 1A-1B experience to drop the course. Can someone clarify on this?

Thoughts on getting a minor in CS while majoring in Physics,"I am currently a freshman and just completed my first semester at Cal. It wasn't as cumbersome since I had taken just one technical course (Math 1A, I'm an international student and didn't know about APs till the end of senior year) and got done with a couple other breadths and university requirements. I'll be taking Physics 5A along with Math 1B next semester. I'm planning to pursue a PhD program after graduation and mostly get into academia after that.

What I have observed from my exposure to the field of research (in physics at least) is that there is a growing need of programming skills for analysis and other purposes. Because of this I was planning to do a minor in CS, hoping that it would help my cause as I pursue higher studies. But what I have heard is that CS courses at Cal are super time consuming and upper division courses are extremely hard to get into even for CS majors. I am also planning to get a double major in Astrophysics for which the lower div prerequisites are the same as that for Physics but except for CS61A, there aren't any course overlaps between CS and Astrophysics. I have 6 more semesters (and 4 summers) for which I have just made a tentative schedule.

I'm dead set on majoring in Physics but not so sure about the Astrophysics and CS part. Is it a feasible path to take? I would love to hear from people who have taken a similar route to this one and advise me on how to manage my schedule. If anyone wants additional info to help me decide, please let me know. Thank you! :)",1577725876,1,0
Should I take 188 or 110 along with 126 and 127?,"Definitely taking 126, 127, breadth, reader (13 units), but was wondering whether to add 188 or 110 on top of this.
 
Reasons for 188: I likely want to do ML stuff in the future and really really wanna get started in AI stuff, which is why I wanted to add 188. Maybe will do some fast.ai this break. (Is this relevant for 188?) One point of caution though is that I want to get an A+ to maybe get into BAIR in the future, which may be harder considering this schedule.
 
Reasons for 110: Due to time conflict with breadth I will not be able to attend 188 lecture at all. Also I am self studying Axler (linear algebra done right textbook) over break for fun and I feel like I might as well take 110 to get credit for that as well (Is there strong overlap?)
 
Reasons for another breadth instead: Want to bump my GPA up a little bit and less work. I don't wanna push myself too hard though because last semester I struggled with 61c and 170. Did p well in the classes but found myself working way harder than I thought I would. However this might be because I am bad at project classes and significantly better at math classes, which is better for this intended schedule. Overall, I don't want to work more than 10 hours a day (ideally much less) for the sake of my mental health. In this case, then I will take 188 + 189 + 110 in fall instead of 189 + 188/110, both along with recruiting.
 
Any advice is greatly appreciated!",1577725748,1,0

Just wondering if any of you have any tips for coping(?) with one’s first time getting below a B in college (and ever). Like how do I not see myself as a complete fucking failure? Do I try retaking it after I take Math 1B next semester? Do I switch my Math 1B course with a Math 1A for next semester? Do I just forget even trying to be an Econ major?

Help.",1577510213,1,0

Kraft award question,"Are L&amp;S students still eligible for the Kraft Award for freshman if they're taking 13 units, but their one P unit is a semimar (i.e. no choice, not a graded class taken P/NP). I took three 4-unit classes and a 1-unit seminar, so 13 units total but only 12 ""Graded"" but it's not like I P/NPed the seminar because I did poorly, all seminars are PNP. 

The language on the site is unclear (or if it is clear, it feels inconsistent since I would be eligible if I were in COE/CED).",1577503734,1,0
sproul tabling for club recruitment,"if y'all are part of clubs that do upper sproul tabling during the first 2.5 weeks of school, how would you feel about tabling regulation that:

* bans tents for the first 2.5 weeks of school
* only allows students to start reserving spots on upper sproul at 7:00AM

the reasoning being that tents take up too much space, and some clubs camp out at 3:00AM for those prime GBC-facing spots. i realize these are pretty small changes, but the lead center doesn't have enough resources to support actual solutions like an electronic sign up system :( 

seeing as how every semester is getting worse and worse, and i want to make some change for spring 2020 (less than a month away!), i want to start some \~tabling discourse\~",1577499103,1,0
[CAUTION] Needles Scattered Near Telegraph/Haste Area,"There have been needles seen scattered throughout the lower Telegraph Haste area, especially near People's Park. I saw some with my one eyes while walking, and while it is a safety hazard, especially since they are not properly disposed of, it did not hit me as an urgent issue until I heard about a student who claimed to have been stuck by one when walking down the sidewalk in sandals. Be aware of where you are walking and wear closed-toed heavy soled shoes when possible. This is exactly why a need disposal is needed, especially in certain areas of the city. This is a threat to the health of students, residents, and even the users themselves. Something needs to be done.",1577498649,1,0

just feelin like shit,"Man, I just got back my data8 grade and it was a C+. This class was supposed to be an easy A for me, and I aced all the projects but messed up the midterm, and did alright on the final.  But the main reason it feels so bad is because:

1. I have already taken the 61 series in its entirety and 70 and gotten B's and B+'s in those classes
2. I am taking upper division CS and EE classes starting next semester, and dont really know what this means for me

I dont really know what happened or how it happened, but Ive always felt wildely inconsistent as a student, and just cant seem to find a groove at all since starting college. I just feel like nothing I do to better myself as a student has worked, and am just getting tired of constantly saying to myself ""This semester Ill improve."" Ive never blamed my poor performances in anything on anyone except myself, and Ive always been optimistic. But this time it just really hurts because I tried to stay consistent this semester and it really was looking up until about the midpoint of the semester, when everything really started to kick in. I just dont know how to feel, and I feel my morale is just getting kicked down over and over again, and dont really know how many more times I can get back up. I have had strong highs in many of these classes, but I feel tired of not being able to hold on to it consistently. Its just been feeling like ive been inching towards a more depressive attitude, and the only thing thats been stopping me is my optimism. I just dont know how much longer I can do it, and I feel like im just gonna crash in a semester or two. I dont really know what im looking for in this post, but I thought maybe venting a little would help. I honestly felt like crying in some of my finals this semester because I felt so inadequate and know I could've done better, and felt that I had to put in 100x the amount of work to scrape up mediocre grades. I feel like I have had the right attitude towards improvement, but I can just never deliver. I dont just feel like a bad student because of this, but it makes me feel like someone who may never been adequate at anything.",1577488234,1,0
