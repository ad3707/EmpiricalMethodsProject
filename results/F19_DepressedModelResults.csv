I'm planning on EDing to NYU and i basically have 2 weeks to figure myself out. some insight to myself: i'm kinda clueless on what to major on, well not really clueless but i'm stuck between many different majors. i wanted to apply to stern but i know it's extremely competitive, but i also want business to be my major (plus idk if my stats r good enough). i'm also interested in environmental science and psych, but i dont want to just do those. idk how gallatin works but i know that you can choose different classes from diff colleges and combine them into a meaningful ""major"".  i have a 3.76 gpa and my highest sat score is a 1390. my next SAT score is coming out in 2 days(praying i get past 1400 lol). my extracurricular list is pretty dead lol. but do you guys think gallatin is a good choice? both in general and considering my reasons. also to current gallatin students, do you think it's better to focus on an already given major or is having this freedom something that's pretty neat?

For those   student leaders who are interested, all we ask is for your time,   leadership, compassion, and we will take care of the rest. Our members   are represented at multiple universities and medical schools across the   country and would also be willing to provide mentor-ship throughout the   process.

I would also want to briefly chat with you about it all since I would be writing the story. This would be a great way to get your name out there in a major publication and tell the world a little bit about yourself.

Separately, we are also **interested in students who might be willing to share a copy of the essay they wrote that got them into Berkeley.** If you are really proud of your essay and still have a copy, we would love to be able to publish it. **We’d be willing to pay you for your essay.**

118,"Hey guys! So in the Spring, I took a W in a class that's somewhat related to my major, but not a requirement. I originally took the class since it was a prerequisite for a major I was originally thinking of switching into. I was doing well in the class, but I realized I wasn't really interested in the subject and wanted to focus on my newfound passion for my original major. Fast forward seven months and I'm thinking of dropping another class this semester that's completely unrelated to my major. Due to scheduling conflict in Phase II, I didn't end up with all the classes I wanted and had to take a humanities course that I expected to be not too difficult and somewhat fun. However, two weeks into the class I realized it has a very heavy workload (essays every week - I didn't know this since I wasn't even registered for the class on syllabus day) and the subject is so boring to the point that I fall asleep every other class. I would much rather spend my time with major classes, research, or just getting exercise hours in.

Problem is it's always a dream of mine to be a professor and going into academia. How much will PhD programs here at Tech (or similar schools) care if I have these two W's on my transcript? I've been reading posts about this and I'm getting mixed results; some say they won't care at all and others say it may hurt. I know graduate schools care more about experience, recommendation letters, GPA, and GRE, but it seems like with the exception of a high GPA, I don't have a particularly strong application compared with other students here.

135,"Hey y’all, the title pretty much says it all. I feel like a complete loser and what makes it worse is that I’m not a freshman. I’m a transfer student who is very familiar with the quarter system.

I feel so dumb struggling like this because I feel like by now I should be used to this. I’m going on my 4th year of college and I still have no clue as to what I want to do with my life. Fall quarter was extremely rough me having to do deal with being far away from home, the loneliness, struggling class despite putting my hardest efforts, issues with tuition and just overall my poor mental health. 

In cc I was struggling as well because I was in a major that I was unhappy in. But I had Davis as my largest motivation. Prior then, I visited the campus multiple times, met with many advisors and I overall felt safe and excited to one day be coming here. I wanted to attend Davis because I wanted to do well academically and just be in a space where I was happy in. In addition to transferring into a major I was working hard towards. 

Now that I’m here, I’m just reminded of how much of big loser I still am. I’m struggling so much in my classes, I’m having trouble making friends, my plans for covering tuition is falling apart to the point where I have no clue on how I’m gonna pay for next quarter’s tuition, and I’m approaching my last few years of college with no clue as to what I want to do with my life. I’m so scared for my future y’all, all I want to do is call it quits and just go home. I’m starting to think I made mistake coming here despite my initial pure excitement and joy of being accepted here. 

But I’m too terrified of doing that as well. Any advice is much appreciated. I’m just tired of crying every night in my apartment.",1,LABEL_1,0.9998868,0.00011317586,0.9998868

138,"Hello fellow bears, i’m a freshman trying to declare CS and Math double major. I’m currently taking Math 54 and CS 61A and are doing... not terrible but not too good either(projected B+ for 61A and A- for 54)

Anyway, I’d like to take from 16-20 units next semester. Besides either EE16A or EE16B+EE47D, i’m also thinking about taking 61B and either CS70 or Math 55. I’m also thinking about a easy writing class(according to berkeley time)

So my question are as the following:
Give that i’m doubling in math and CS, 
1, should i take math 55 or cs70? imo 70 has better professor but heavy course load(especially with 61B cuz i wanna do well and have a better GPA), while 55 has shitty professor but comparatively lighter course load.
2, should I take 16A or 16B + 47D? taking 16A would be easy for me bc im taking 54 this semester, but it might waster some of my time, especially when I’m trying to double major and graduate in 4 years; on the other hand, 16B and 47D(if i can get enrolled) does put me on a faster pace, but might result in heavier course load and less stable foundation
3, i’m taking 15 units this semester and really want to catch up. one of the reasons i’m not doing ideally this semester is because i tried out a lot of clubs which kind of used up part of my time(as well as the adjustment). i’m wondering if 3 techs + 1 writing(16U) or overall a 16-20 unit schedule is doable.

I was recently admitted into NYU Tandon for the BS in STS. I have read all of the posts on Reddit/CC and others about life at Tandon but many are old and aren’t super relevant. I am super excited about the range of classes that are available for STS majors to take as well as the really cool research/general opportunities available on the engineering campus and at NYU. 

After reading a lot I have some worries about the social life/ability to be active on the WSP campus. I have heard that with the shuttle/subway it doesn’t take long ~15 minutes to get to WSP but I am just curious. How do you guys feel the social life is at Tandon and is it relatively easy to be active/social on both campuses, and how hard is it to make friends at Tandon?

I have a bit of an unusual request related to my own research and Master's thesis. First of all, allow me to quickly introduce myself. I study at Leiden University in the Netherlands and am currently writing my Master's thesis in Public Administration. I research the crowding in - crowding out framework of welfare states regarding civil society behaviour. Essential to my research is the so-called World Giving Index, which is a framework by the British Charity CAF that tries to measure philanthropic efforts all over the world. They utilize data provided by Gallup, stemming from their World Poll. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the issue. We do not have access to the Gallup World Poll and I am pretty much stuck without their microdata - also I was not able to get access via my previous jobs. I know that NYU has campus-wide access to the database (at least that's what it says on Gallup's website). I am looking for someone who could spare an hour to go over the data with me, extract them and send them to me - it should be fairly quick. Please feel free to PM me or answer in this thread. I would really appreciate the help. Why NYU? Well to be honest I have very fond memories of NYC and have always found the people to be very helpful in their own wholesome way when I lived there. I will make sure to show some form of German-Dutch-American appreciation!

My high school was super rigorous and prestigious, it's ranked very highly and all my courses from there count as APs.

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: I got the following information from the internet, so... yeah.

Here's the current TA salary breakdown from the SOE website:

&amp;#x200B;

|Position |Workload|Monthly Salary|Hourly Wage  |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TA, 25%|10 hours per week|$1181.83|$29.55 |
|TA, 50%|20 hours per week |$2363.66|$29.55|

&amp;#x200B;

(Additionally, TAs receive ""remission for in-state fees"". I will ignore this in the calculations.)

The proposed cost of living adjustment of $1,412 would increase graduate student wages (for 50% TAs) to (2363.66+1412.00)/(4\*20)=$47.20/hr. (it's a lot higher for 25% TAs)

For reference, Undergraduates working at the dining hall have a starting wage of $12/hr.

Tuition costs are roughly equivalent for graduate students and undergraduate students, as are the costs of housing.

I support the right of the grad students to share their discontent with their situation, and completely disagree with the university's categorization of the strike as ""illegal"". However, it seems like if anyone needs a pay bump, it's the undergrads. Why should students working for $12-15/hr with the same housing and tuition costs as their TAs be subsidizing a further pay increase to over triple what they are making. 

Degree programs, especially those of graduate students, shouldn't be thought of as cheap or break-even endeavors. The promise of a degree (or at least the hope these days) is to increase future earnings by foregoing current earnings. In a perfect world, both sets of students get raises, but I just don't understand the humanitarian need for TAs to get a $47/hr wage before undergraduates come even close to $20/hr.

Our last AMA went so well, Christ is coming back for another!

The Chancellor's reddit account is /u/carolchrist. This is not the actual AMA thread. The actual AMA is pinned to the top of the subreddit, and Christ will start answering questions in two days' time. You will have these two days to think of a question and post it in the thread. 

Please read the [previous AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/) to see which questions were already asked.

-

-

**THE ACTUAL AMA**
-

* **No questions are off-limits. But keep it respectful and formal.**

Christ does not want to limit any sort of questions *at all* for this AMA. Nothing is off-limits. However, you must stay respectful and formal. Make sure you remain respectful and your question will not be removed. 

Joke questions *are* allowed. 

* **The AMA thread will be in contest mode until the actual AMA start time.**

This is because I don't want people to start long discussions before the AMA has begun. We also need time to promote this event on different channels and make sure everyone affiliated with the campus has time to create an account and post their questions. 

The Chancellor will start answering questions this Wednesday at 5:00PM. 

* **Parent comments only**

The Chancellor does not have enough time to read through chains of comments. We want original questions posted as *only* parent comments. If you want to piggyback off of another parent comment you liked, you may refer to it in a parent comment of your own. 

This may seem odd, but we want people to have as many chances as possible to get their questions answered, and we want the AMA to feel like an actual back-and-forth discussion between our community and the Chancellor. 

**All children comments will be deleted until Christ starts her actual AMA. After which children comments will be allowed.** 

Once the Chancellor comes in, I want her answers to be the only child comment to each parent comment. That way, even after this two day delay, you won't have to go hunting for Christ's answers, and you can follow-up on her answers more easily. 

In a future event, we may be able to have the Chancellor answer question that arose from discussions, but I don't want those long-winded discussions to start prematurely. 

-

-

-

---

---

Again, please be on your best behavior. We may have even more events in the future, and maybe the Chancellor would be open to coming to a subreddit meetup. This will only be possible if this AMA goes well. 

Stay respectful, ask your best questions, and 

**GO BEARS!!!**

I have a friend who may not have had the most traditional childhood and was only able to obtain an associates degree between work and other life issues.  Now with stuff under control, my friend is looking to finish undergrad and obtain a Bachelor's degree at the age of 23.  My friend got accepted into Northwestern SPS and I just want to make sure my friend isn't getting taken advantage of as I don't know anything about the program.   My friend will be taking out a loan to go to school.

I have read some yelp reviews and while I understand that the instruction may be of less quality than the regular NU program, does my friend still get to put BS or BA from Northwestern University on the resume?  Or does my friend need to specify it is from the SPS program.  Additionally, I understand how much you get out of the program depends on how much you get in, but is the education (knowledge taught) on par with most undergrad programs around the area like UIC, Loyola, Depaul, etc..  Northwestern was chosen because of the evening classes as my friend needs to continue to work to pay bills and afford school.  Some schools like UIC do not offer evening undergraduate classes.

396,"Been single for 20 years. Decided 2019 was the year I changed that status before the new decade came around. 

Became friends with a very beautiful lady along with a group of other Bruins. Struggled through the same classes and also partied through the highs and cried through the lows. Summer school together was only bearable because she was there taking the same classes as I was. 

Decided it was time I make a move and reveal that my feelings have ignited, starting from a small spark into a huge fire. But what could I say or do? Blurting it out is no fun. I can't sing for my life nor do I have the money to hire a singing coach. Can't really play guitar as I can only play the basic chords. Hmm...

I remember vividly the day she shared her life story. I could hear the sadness in her voice, but it was the silent emotionless expression of sorrow on her face that screamed the loudest. I could rarely see the smile on her face throughout the days, yet when she did, it was the prettiest thing she wore. 

And thus, I embarked on a ruthless journey, to re-ignite my childhood passions of drawing and coloring, and draw a portrait of her, smiling. Not that I was good at drawing, but I was determined. I saved up whatever amount of money I could gather through my summer job to purchase a Strathmore 400 Series Drawing Paper Pad, some colored pencils, and art pencils for shading. Contacted my art major friend to teach me the basics and help me correct the imperfections of my lines and shapes. Fall quarter goes by, she doesn't suspect a thing. 

Through many trial and errors, many hours of preparation, I finally completed a fairly accurate portrait of her, smiling, and nice sunny UCLA background. 

I didn't want to distract her from her studies as it was the peak of the latter weeks of Fall Quarter. We got through finals and it was finally time. I tell her that I have a gift for her as a congratulations to getting through another quarter. Knees weak, arms heavy, heart pounding, I lead her to my place where I unveiled the product of my labor. 

She looks stunned and laughs, laughing with the same smile as the one I had produced with pencil and paper.  I tell her it was for her, that her smile was beautiful and it makes me happy. Was it a success?

She turns to me, laughing, and says ""Thanks bro, you can keep it though since it makes you happy and I don't have much space in my room!"" At this point I revealed my true intentions and it turns out she actually has been talking/dating someone else from a different school (a school close to UCLA, but not as good as UCLA if you know what I mean ;) ). She said that perhaps if I told her a couple weeks earlier, things would've been different but now it's too late. At least for now because she's fully committed with her current relationship.

We're still friends (rip), I have no hate towards her at all, it's her decision and I respect it. We hung out over break a couple times. I will probably smack myself for the rest of the year for trying to be a romantic fool but you live and you learn. I let her tell her friends the whole story and she let me tell the story to all of my friends. It's been weeks since it happened so we all laugh about it now and nothing is weird between any of us so it's chill.

Anyways, Bruins, don't be like me and waste your quarter learning how to draw for a girl. Just let her know asap. I will retire on my artistic endeavors and never draw again :). Press F in the chat.

Podcasting can still be up to the professors, yet certain discussions like Warren Writing where your participation is majority of your grade, can still remain mandatory. Say, if x% of the overall grade is based on participation alone, attendance can be chosen to be mandatory by the instructor.

There are plenty of classes that are podcasted, yet I-clicker points count for every lecture. That would also save you $70. Shouldn't knowledge of the material be far more valued than showing up and listening to the lecture live? I can't even stand my favorite sporting events live sometimes. Plus, many of them choose to sleep through lectures anyway. Why should reliability issues regarding transportation, rather lack of, be a factor in determining your grades? If the professor chooses to share important information before the podcast to reward those who make it to lecture or punish those who don't, such as relevant material on the final exam, then be it. The students' loss. (Of course location and other material should be posted somewhere in case of a student happening to miss class when crucial info like that is announced).

The whole ""legality of funds"" for parking argument doesn't matter imo, because it was the school's choice to get rid of S spots and designate more A and B spots. I'm sure the school can choose to open up more S spots without running into legal trouble.

482,"Hello, I'm going to be moving to los angeles soon to start at UCLA as a graduate student this coming winter quarter. I'm looking to get a move-in date for an apartment in early december (at least a few days before the 18th - I already booked christmas flights back to family, and am looking to get moved in before I fly back for that). My advisor can fly me out for a week to find an apartment and help set up the new lab in early november, which to my understanding is about how far in advance you want to apartment hunt in LA. I have a lot of questions to this end:

Do you guys think it would be better to hunt during the week of Nov. 3rd, or Nov. 10th?

Where's the best place to find a roommate? I'm in a bit of a tricky situation with this one. For the first 6ish months, I would be a non-full time trans woman still going by my old name, and sometime during the first year I would be looking to go full time. Maybe I'm being overly cautious (I grew up in north carolina, did my undergrad in virginia), but I need to make sure whoever I'm rooming with is going to be alright with that. It's tricky to use social media (like the facebook page) for this purpose as I can't be direct in posts without outing myself to extended family

Any tips for apartment complexes? I'm looking for a place that has a rent &lt;1300/person (preferably closer to 1100) that has a good amount of available bussing to UCLA campus, as I won't have a car. Grocery stores and such located nearby would also be a huge plus. So far what I've been looking at is the area that the University Apartments South complexes are located - I applied too late to have any chance in the housing lottery, but even without going through the university there seem to be a good number of two bedroom apartments in that area that are within my price range.

Other nice things would be if washer/dryer were located as nearby as possible (I think that in LA in-unit ones are pretty much impossible at my price point, but on the same floor would be great. Per building would also be fine, but I would really prefer to avoid needing a separate location for laundry), and if the lease/sublet was monthly as that would make it a lot easier to potentially switch into cheaper university-affiliated housing in the future.

I don't really care about roommate gender. Past experience with my current, male roommate suggests that the whole bras and boobs thing can be awkward for guys to live with. I'm pretty quiet most of the time (headphones not speakers, etc), my room is often messy, but I keep common spaces relatively clean. I tend to clean in bursts. I'm fine with alcohol / marijuana as long as it's non-smoking. I myself don't drink very often (around once per 1/2 months in the past) but have been known to get fairly drunk at times, and would probably want to try (legal) marijuana at one point or another. I'm not a fan of parties, but would be fine as long as I had a bit of notice.

If you have any tips at all for getting a good apartment for not too much money, or know someone that's subletting a space or looking to move into a new one this december, please let me know!",1,LABEL_1,0.9998627,0.00013726809,0.9998627

Pros: 

\-In NYC

\-#4 ranked PH program in the nation

\-Alumni network/career services/connections

\-Is a quality program (in my opinion), which gave me the skills that I needed for my job today

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\-Too friggin EXPENSIVE

\-Not as diverse as they make it out to be (at least in Epi and Biostats, there were virtually no Black people. I have nothing against people of other races/ethnicities, but being the only Black person in a lot of the classes for your department/certificate was isolating. People constantly talk about health disparities and issues that affect people of color, yet they talk about it from an abstract sense, have no friends of color, refuse to walk past 169th street in Washington Heights, act as if Africa and South Asia are the only places with people suffering from health issues, etc. It was very irritating.

\-Restrictions for certain certificates

\-More condescending/arrogant people compared to my state school (which I KINDA feel like I should've gone to)

\-We were charged all of this tuition, but received a ridiculously small summer stipend ($250), little to no scholarships, barely any free food at seminars lol, etc.

552,"Hey NYU peeps,

Some friends of mine are running a BYOB variety show this Friday and Saturday and would love for you to come!

Both shows are in the heart of Greenwich Village at New York’s oldest still-operating record store: The Music Inn. The store has been open since 1958 and has been used as a location in such shows as “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”.

TONIGHT! Friday 10/18, Midnight Confessions is a show where we ask the audience to anonymously write down a confession, true or false, and place it into a hat. The performers then take the confessions and act them out. Between confessions, we have sketches, some of the best up-and-coming musicians, and stand up comedians perform.

This is a great way for students to let off steam. I also believe this show provides a nice catharsis for students to anonymously share a secret, or their feelings about being new to the city, or the anxiety/stress they feel as a student and to have it externalized and acted out comically.

Saturday 10/19, “Live at the Inn”: a variety showcase with comedy, music, and live sketches. Tomorrow's show will be a classic Who-Dun-It Murder Mystery! 

For each show:

Tickets are only $10 and it's BYOB.

Address: 169 West 4th St, New York, NY

Doors open at 8:30pm Show starts at 9pm. Get there early for a good seat.

Trains: 1 to Christopher St.

A, C, D, F, M to West 4th St. NJ Transit is just a few blocks away.

I have a 32 ACT, but I have an pretty low GPA (3.4W, 3.2UW) as a result of taking on too many difficult classes and not being able to properly manage my time, had an upward trend though as I got used to it. I heard that I might have a chance at NYU if I answer yes to the Liberal Studies Core program. I did some research on the program, and it seems like a bunch of philosophical-based, but easy prereq classes that you fulfill in your first two years before transferring easily into CAS. Doesn't seem too bad, though..

1) Do these ""prereq classes"" need to be fulfilled by CAS students eventually as well? If so, is the only difference that they have the freedom to choose when they fulfill them?

2) How is the transition between LSP to CAS Econ + CS? Is the program worse off for STEM/Math related majors? Am I still able to do the double degree within CAS or do I have to choose just one?

3) Not specifically about the program, but how good is Econ + CS (or separately) at NYU? I've heard great things about CS and Econ, but just wanted someone to maybe elaborate on the program.",1,LABEL_1,0.99986434,0.00013569776,0.99986434

Recently I have received complaints about the frequency of ‘chance me’ posts and suggestions to ban them from this subreddit. I personally agree because

* An application is a wholistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the best
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's applications

For this reason I was seeking community input in regards to the following:

* Should 'chance me' posts be banned from the sub? Application questions, advice and help will still be **allowed**, but posts explicitly asking what someone's chances of getting into NYU are would not.
* If individual 'chance me' posts are banned, should I make a megathread? Should this megathread be stickied?",1,LABEL_1,0.99986964,0.0001303234,0.99986964

I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago because the stress from our responsibilities (classes, extracurriculars, work) were starting to take a toll on our relationship.

801,"With all the riots currently going on in HK, I thought I’d chime in with my two cents as well. Any objective onlooker would probably say that China has fared quite well in the past few decades. This assessment seems sensible. Back in the 80s the USA’s economy was more than twenty times the size of China’s, but today China has never been closer to overtaking the US as the world’s largest economy. Not all is well for China tho. I personally think that it is not a matter of ‘if,’ but ‘when,’ that the communist government will collapse, and with all the increasing power that the government wields thanks to artificial intelligence, we should expect a cataclysmic upheaval when that collapse eventually occurs. 

There’s one crucial difference between capitalism and communism: in real life, the former works and the latter doesn’t. My main goal here, however, is not to explicate the impossibility of central planning to achieve the efficiency results of capitalism in the long run. Rather, I’m trying to show what would structurally emerge from a system of long-term central planning, and hopefully convince you of the inevitable collapse of communist regimes. 

Contrary to Western popular belief, the communist party is not a band of villains trying to take control of the coercive apparatus of the state and utilize it to their own benefit at the expense of oppressing the citizens. The vast majority of communists are genuinely nice people looking for a centrally planned socioeconomic order based upon common ownership to establish a more egalitarian state. But the task is complex: any systematic central planning necessitates an immense amount of unbridled power. In fact, its very success depends on the extent to which the leaders achieve such power. So the desire to maximize power is not a cause, but a consequence of the desire to centralize decision making. 

Unfortunately, this perpetual need for absolute authority turns out to be highly dangerous, not least because it directly paves the way for totalitarianism. A totalitarian rule is and has always been a long-term logical consequence of an unscrupulous and unrestrained system of central planning. 

Note, however, that totalitarianism isn’t a synonym for failure (think the New Deal period -- not exactly a totalitarian rule, but you get the idea). That being said, totalitarianism is certainly a recipe for disaster in the long run. Everything seems fine when the economy is booming. But when something goes awry (say an economic mismanagement resulting in a national famine), everything goes south. We basically wind up with a vicious cycle, where a government crackdown on a disgruntled public leads to more public disapproval which in turn leads to more government crackdowns. And the fact that China has been making massive leaps in artificial intelligence is even more cause for alarm. One could only wish they would not be there to witness the bloodbath.  

If capitalism is the “extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work for the benefit of all,” then communism is the equally extraordinary tragedy where men with the best of intentions will somehow lead us all to a hellish political, social, and economic existence. Hayek had it spot-on when he said, “Is there a greater tragedy imaginable than that, in our endeavour consciously to shape our future in accordance with high ideals, we should in fact unwittingly produce the very opposite of what we have been striving for?” A great tragedy indeed.",1,LABEL_1,0.9998714,0.00012864632,0.9998714
802,"I'm going to graduate either spring 2020 or fall 2020, so I'm looking for summer 2020 internships, and to be honest I have no idea how people get jobs. Specifically I'm looking for data science/analytics positions, and all but one of my previous internships have been via connections. My background is: random quantitative undergrad + CS coterm and previous intern experience is:

* freshman summer: big tech company/software engineer (via Handshake);
* sophomore year: financial services firm/data scientist (Stanford-funded program)
* sophomore summer: research institute/quantitative analyst (via connections);
* junior year: large retail company/data scientist (via connections);
* junior summer: random startup/data scientist (via connections);
* senior year (I have not yet decided if I will accept the offer): large media corporation/data scientist (via connections), but they have no plans to hire another data scientist full-time;

I also don't really want to return to any of the companies I previously worked at, so that is an issue. I guess I can think of a few possible ways to get jobs, but I am not sure if any of them are effective.

Career fairs: I went to all the career fairs (fall general fair, engineering fair, spring fair, random BEAM center fairs, social impact fair, etc) every year and gave out my resumes, but I didn't really get anywhere, so I'm not sure if I was doing the process wrong, or if now that I'm a senior, companies will take me seriously. Do people actually get anything from these routes? Also, a lot of companies just say to apply online.

Handshake: I did get a small handful of interviews and 2 software engineering internship offers freshman year after applying for 300+ software positions on Handshake (it was awful). But I tried to apply for positions during sophomore year and junior year (although they were more stats/data science focused) and never got invited to interview anywhere. Also, a lot of companies just redirect you to apply on their official website, which never leads anywhere.

Company talks: tech companies come give a presentation on campus and hundreds of people pack the room and drop their resumes. The recruiters/company engineers just get swarmed with a bunch of people. Are these ever effective?

Referrals/connections: Most of my friends are not working in tech (yes, surprising), or I have already gotten referred by them. I am only close with a few professors, so that is another option.

The condition is that the application must be made before August 31 of the year in which the grant is required (2020 in my case). I wish to apply for both Spring and Fall of the coming year as I have received external funding for both semesters.   
Right now, the form is for ""2019 Tuition Incentive Program"" (link: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewHgch6Bwa5CgYES2TzOnPXocoRdk\_-I3gbzoyPq9cuiXJVw/formResponse?pli=1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewHgch6Bwa5CgYES2TzOnPXocoRdk_-I3gbzoyPq9cuiXJVw/formResponse?pli=1)). 

So if I want the grant for Spring 2020, do I need to fill this form (maybe this isn't just for 2019 but for 2019-2020? I am confused as August 31 is already gone) or wait for 2020's form to be made available? In case of the latter, any idea when the form will be made available? Also, if the form is up after start of term (January 27, 2020), I will have no choice but to apply after already started with my classes. In that case, will I be granted funds?

Please advise.

Thank You.",1,LABEL_1,0.999827,0.0001729679,0.999827

Woke up this morning and felt sick to my stomach, so I elected not to go to class, and ended up falling back asleep. Woke up again and realized I had missed the submission deadline for a research paper by about 20 minutes, and the assignment on canvas was closed.

Immediately I sent an e-mail to my professor and TA with a copy of my paper, apologizing and asking them to please consider my paper in spite of the professor's ""no late papers policy"" due to how little I had missed the deadline by. Waiting to hear back from them now.

This is a pretty big bummer, because I did well on the midterm and thought I did a good job on the paper, so I was hoping to get an A, but now it's possible I won't even pass... I'm a senior and applying to law school to boot, so failing could hurt me pretty badly.

I was just wondering if anyone here had any advice on how to proceed? I know that I messed up badly, but it feels like a huge punishment for an honest mistake.

969,"Hello everyone!

It’s 1am in the morning as I am writing post because I’ve been so stressed out and sad ever since I turned in my UC applications. I am a third year CC student and I applied to UCI, majoring in Biomedical Engineering so I just want to ask for advices/tips as well as the chance of me getting accepted. I currently have a UC transferable GPA of 3.49 so I think Im qualified for TAG? I also was an engineering intern at a medical company so i don’t know if that will increase my chance of getting accepted or not. The main reason why I’m stressed out is because I heard BME is quite competitive and Im fear for my life that my GPA will drop below a 3.4 (bc of physics and calc) by spring quarter. Another thing is that I have like 125 quarter units so I don’t know if that will ruin my chance or not. I don’t know if this might increase my chance of getting accepted but I wrote a pretty solid UC essay. If you know any CC applicants who got accepted into BME OR any stories about BME, feel free to share! Thank you so much you guys!",1,LABEL_1,0.999862,0.00013793027,0.999862

​
The class got a large amount of complaints last quarter and at the end some students and I volunteered to work over summer to help fix a lot of the problems.
​
I wanted to give an update to how the class is now for anyone thinking of taking it next quarter or at any future offerings.
​
If you guys have any questions feel free to leave a question and I can get back to you.
​
# Updates
​
### Homework
**Last Quarter:** The homework documentation went through a large amount of changes after they were assigned. On top of this some homework assignments gave too many tasks.
​
**Fix:** We updated all the homework documentation, removing contradictions and errors, and have since remove some of the tasks to make them more simple and manageable.
​
### Test Cases
**Last Quarter:** The test cases where either given right before the assignments were due or not at all. Usually when the test cases came out there where still problems with the test cases themselves. This also came with the tests being run on Postman making them very difficult to read or create new tests.
​
**Fix:** We created a Test Suite that contains all the tests. All the test cases are JUnit tests and can be run against the homework assignments easily. It also JUnit so its much easier to read and work with than Postman.
This quarter the tests were not provided at the very start, but the current plan is to release all the complete Test Suite at the start of the class.
​
### Grading
**Last Quarter:** The grading changed during the quarter in order to help students, this included increasing deadlines, and added additional regrades. During the regular grading schedule we had to request for regrades when problems where coming up with fail compilations or simple mistakes in our code.
​
**Fix:** Besides the creation of the Test Suite to ensure better scores we are also creating a Testing Service that you can call to grade your current assignment at any time before the deadline and will give you your score and you can request as many grade requests as you want before the deadline. This change is tentative at the moment as it is still being proceed and should be ready by next quarter. We also added a fixed date for all homeworks to be regraded so students don't need to worry about requesting them.
​
### FrontEnd
**Last Quarter:** The FrontEnd last quarter was made in JavaScript, and was a lot to work in in the week we had to complete the FrontEnd.
​
**Change:** More of a change that an actual fix is now the FrontEnd is done in React, and comes with starter code to help the start of the assignment.",1,LABEL_1,0.9998482,0.0001517914,0.9998482

I checked Albert and there was no information but they did receive my FAFSA and CSS. Did I just not get any aid? There is a chance of that since my EFC was very high but NYU is still expensive for me and my financial situation has changed since the timeframe for the FAFSA so I was going to ask for reconsideration. Is it just taking a while to process or should I assume that I got no aid and contact them now?,1,LABEL_1,0.9998858,0.00011419428,0.9998858

1040,"Hi all. I'm a transfer student, trying to decide is taking Math 1B in spring at UCB is wise after struggling a lot in Math 1A at CC (came out with a B). Math 1B is notoriously difficult and I already struggle in math (worst subject by far) so I'm trying to evaluate if it would just be smarter to either take it over the summer or at a CC. I realize if I take it at a CC when I apply to grad school or if I really felt compelled, medical school, this would be seen as a bad thing and I would be ""less competitive"". I have to take Math 1B, not taking it is not an option.   

On the flip side Paulin has a great reputation and it's not as if I'm not willing to put in the work. I just get a lot of anxiety during tests and even if I practice perfectly fine I will often not perform as well on math tests. I just don't want to ruin my gpa over this.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're planning to take any courses that involve programming in C/C++ or are taking any now, you'd probably be aware of how annoying Segmentation Faults are to deal with. \[Stensal\]([https://stensal.com/](https://stensal.com/)) is a free-to-use cloud IDE that has built-in functionality to help users debug segfaults in their code. If a segfault occurs during program execution, the built-in console will output a straightforward and informative message about where the segfault occurred and why, which makes debugging a breeze. You can even upload your own files and assignments to the IDE as well, so you can have a uniform work environment for your assignments. The tool was developed to help CS students and C/C++ learners in general have a less frustrating and more rewarding experience with C/C++, so hopefully some of you guys will find it helpful!

If you have any questions/comments/concerns/etc, feel free to join the \[Discord server\]([https://discord.gg/3dzgKZH](https://discord.gg/3dzgKZH)), which was created as a community for C/C++ learners and students like yourselves. Happy coding!",1,LABEL_1,0.9998256,0.00017443561,0.9998256

He proceeds to tell us how we will have “M^eat” on the te^-st. And how “we have the meats”. 

At this point, I’m confused. Where is he going with this? Is it a metaphor for the limitations of what “exponentials can kill?” 

He goes on to tell us about how his wife gave him a plaque labeled “Stephen Strogatz: Over Explainer”. He was so proud. As he shed a tear, he unzipped his pants and sat the biggest penis I have ever seen right on the table at the front of the lecture hall. 

“I told you it was bigger than Trump’s.”

The room fell into silence. When he showed us the graphs of near-resonance frequencies of forced vibrations, no one ACTUALLY believed his dong was that big. Then everyone erupted in applause. I had never seen anything like it. 

Now, I’m reeling. I don’t know what to think of it all. My brain is in shock. I can’t process anything. I think I need to break up with my boyfriend because nothing will ever match what I saw on that lecture hall table today.

I was recently accepted to Columbia College in the class of 2024, and I'm so excited!

As a part of the financial aid package, I'll be doing Federal Work-Study. I don't know if I'm putting too much info out in the open, but I'm expected to make at least $3,090 dollars + min. Student Contribution of $2,400 to pay my Student Responsibility.

I have questions!

What type of jobs are available? 

Are there jobs that could cater to your major? (I listed Sociology, Comparative Lit &amp; Society, &amp; English as potential majors.) Or even interests (for me, that would be things like writing, history, and music)?

Are the off-campus jobs like the stores near off-campus or is it that you would be going off-campus to do these jobs? (hope that made sense...)

How many hours would you recommend working as a freshman (sophomore, junior, senior...)?

Are there jobs you would recommend more? Or jobs that you wouldn't recommend at all? Are there good beginner worker jobs?

How is the general community within these jobs? I'm an introvert, but I'm curious as to if the work environment is more solo or united... (I'm sure it probably depends.)

Did you have wiggle room in your finances for personal expenses, shopping, or going out?

Were you able to maintain a balance between work-school-social lives?

How do/did keep track of your finances overall?

Any reflections or tips in retrospect? I know that a lot of students do work-study or something along those lines, so I'd love to hear different perspectives!

Sorry if I sound kind of ignorant, just trying to learn as much as I can to make this experience affordable and smooth sailing! I'm coming from a background virtually no work experience other than tutoring on and off at my school during the school year. 

I'll also be working on scholarships &amp; getting a job in my town toward the summer to pay the minimum contribution of $2,400 before school starts, so maybe I'll have more experience by then.

Can I go to someone higher than him and bring it up? 

Here’s the deal, this professor doesn’t have point rubrics, so basically everything he grades is based on his personal opinion and mood.

However, ECs are heavily geared towards business: started an incorporation with 16,000 sales six fig annual revenue -- 450k followers on ig -- interns @ media company with a snapchat story with over 2 million daily viewers -- production manager at a museum, creates 1,000 products for retail and museum showcase, manages 10+ employees -- intern at a science museum -- leader &amp; founded 2 clubs @ my school -- sports team 

Not sure if I should shoot my shot and apply to stern, although I know the pool for ED2 stern is probably gonna be all ivy rejects with killer stats. Or should I apply to ECON or LSP, work my ass off, then transfer to stern???? I'm aware the transfer process is crazy competitive. Has anyone had any success transferring from econ/LSP to stern? How was the process? 

My ultimate goal is to end up at stern since I want to work in IB or chain supply/logistics management. 

I'm extremely conflicted right now, and I don't know what to choose. Anyone have any advice?

I was informed by a school-board member that many graduate students seek out research topics regularly, so I thought I'd start by posting here. I'm not sure exactly what information you'd want to know, but I'll start here and add more if there's any feedback.

**Topic:**
Health/Technology

**Description:**
https://www.higenemonkey.com/

We've built an interactive handwashing platform that uses an automatic faucet and a screen. We just took it to the Philly Maker Faire, so there's plenty of pictures/videos for you to check it out but feel free to reach out too. Anyway, we'd like to measure it's effectiveness.

**What the device is capable of measuring**
* Length of time a person washes their hands
* Average amount of people who do/don't wash for 20 seconds (CDC recommended length)
* How many people skip out altogether
* Effectiveness of device compared to nothing at all

**Research Questions**
* On average, how long do people wash their hands?
* Does the device increase the number of people that wash their hands on a daily/weekly/monthly basis?

**Facts:**
* Handwashing is the #1 method for disease prevention
* 95% of people don't wash their hands the correct amount of time
* 1 in 5 people skip washing their hands

Either that or I had to withdraw from UCI, which is fucking stupid. 

Anyway, I worked my ass off during the summer and passed 51B, 51C, and 51LC. (Definitely don't recommend anyone to do it because learning two o.chem courses in five weeks each isn't fun lmao)

My official, passing grades were up on Sept. 19th but by then my classes dropped, including BIO100, a prerequisite to literally all of my upper divs. Basically, I can't finish my degree unless I get the class. The class has no waitlist and it is IMPOSSIBLE to find an open spot. I went to the BioSci counselors yesterday and they were SO HELPFUL when they basically told me to fuck off and keep checking WebReg. 

I get that they can't help every student and that they can't do anything with the WebReg system, but that's literally the last thing I wanted to hear and I'm so fucking tired of dealing with their shit I'm sorry. I made it this far into my upcoming senior year and I've jumped through their hoops with dealing with two back-to-back o.chem courses (and lab) during both summer sessions and I really can't deal with having 0 units right now.

I'm also making this because I am trying to decide whether to apply to Tisch or Steinhardt for musical theatre. I will compare them below. Based on what I've read online, I'd say that: 

***Steinhardt...***

* is singing-based, offering more vocal training and less acting/dancing training than Tisch
* also trains musical theatre majors in classical singing, allowing them to be experienced enough to audition for Broadway or opera companies 
* accepts less people than Tisch, but their applicant pool is much smaller than Tisch's
* usually has better quality productions than Tisch
* more camaraderie between students
* has less alumni on Broadway, but has less alumni in general due to consistently being a smaller program

&amp;#x200B;

***Tisch....***

* is acting-based, offering more acting and slightly more dance training and less vocal training
* has more industry-professionals teaching
* accepts more people than Steinhardt, but has a much larger applicant pool
* has worse productions than Steinhardt, grad students get priority in casting
* students develop a more independent attitude, which can be helpful for transitioning to NYC life and pursuing an acting career after graduation
* has more alumni working on Broadway, but has more alumni in general due to consistently being a larger program

Just your local insomniac with a little pick-up. It’s 2:45 am as I’m typing this, and I don’t think I’m gonna sleep. I have the urge to write this, probably just God’s plan at work (shoutout drake).

You’re doing fine, you’re gonna do great on your finals. And even if you don’t, it won’t matter, because you’re a great person. You’re unique. There’s literally no one like you. You’re smart. You’re a complex design that was meant for something in this world. A grade is not going to change that. You’re loved, Even if you don’t know it. I promise you are. Someone has thought about you today. You crossed someone’s mind. I get it that you’re focusing on studying right now, but just take a second to ponder that. You might be a little blip in this meaningless (or meaningful as I see it) existence, but without your presence, the universe literally could not function.

I know this might seem huge right now, but in a few years you won’t regret it. Get some caffeine in your system if you need it, and keep grinding kid. You got this.

1387,"Hey everyone, looking for some help with an issue that just came up. After the first round of Immunization history back in July, I got some messages saying I had some issues with a few. No problem I thought, I'll just go in and get the doses I need. However, my doctor said that two were likely in error because of my time abroad as a child: My Varicella and MMR vaccines. They gave me the one dose they thought I needed and a letter saying that they could vouch for my immunity. The school did not accept the letter, and recommended that I go back and get a blood titer for MMR and Varicella. So I set up another appointment a week later, go in, get my blood drawn, and await results. I got what I was expecting for MMR, immune, but for Varicella, I was notified that I was not, in fact, immune like I was told. Once again I thought that I would just make another appointment and squeeze it in just before the due date. Except that you need two doses 20 days apart. Which means my second dose will be passed the deadline. So I guess my question is will they be ok if I upload proof I am undergoing inoculation? Or will I be penalized in some way?

1400,"I posted a version of this as a response in another /r/northwestern thread but I thought it deserved it's own thread since the original thread was based on a faux ""news"" source.  I'm writing this as a far left progressive worried about the future of our cause adopting ""purity tests"".  This is counterproductive, especially in this situation.

Here are some facts:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If you don’t want to be contacted via the university directory then you can opt out.

&amp;#x200B;

2. If you are in a public space then you have no expectation of privacy.

&amp;#x200B;

3. If you’re protesting something the point of the protest is to garner attention. Therefore, you should expect attention if you protest. (This is usually how you change opinions.)

&amp;#x200B;

4. A reporters job has two basic functions, observe and report. 

&amp;#x200B;

5. \*\*History has shown that “traumatic” photos can sway public opinion for the better.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

6. Life is messy, protesting is messier. If you protest then be prepared, things may not go as planned. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

IMO, adding intermediate steps to item 4 either turns journalism into propaganda or it makes journalism complicit in censorship.  

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I believe that “traumatic”  photos, such as those of police  brutality should be reported.  \*\*History has shown many times that “traumatic” photos can sway public opinion toward rectifying harmful practices\*\*.  This happened when children laborers were photographed near the turn of the century, it ended the practice of child labor.  Photo and TV images of the Vietnam war helped sway public opinion.  Etc. etc.  I can see the point that rating hungry news agencies have taken the tack of publicizing salacious stories, but that is not the case at all here. Finally, I don’t understand the statement from the girl who asked to have her photo changed.  It was something along the lines of “we wanted national attention.”  So b/c the daily NU was not “national” then it was not ok to photo police brutalizing her and the other protesters?

I've known for years that I struggle with anxiety and occasionally depression, but I never thought I had ADHD until now. We are still in the process of testing me and figuring out what medication and accommodations are best, but that will take 1-2 months, so until then, does anyone have any tips for succeeding at Cornell when you have this disability? I, as with just about everyone here, did really well in high school, and cruised by without studying because I went to a very easy, low-income public school, and while my teachers picked up on some issues that I had, they still gave me As and turned the other cheek because they had students with far far greater problems to worry about.

I have a 3.7 gpa weighted, 3.5 unweighted, and got a 30 on my act. I am still working on the short story, here is one of them if anyone has feedback:

The Search for Josephine
“Let’s keep looking,” the lieutenant urged. “This could be our biggest bust and you want to just give up?” Florence Valmonte was the only female detective in her department, and because of this she agreed to continue her search, even though she knew it meant risking everything. 
    Four years earlier, when Valmonte was exactly twenty-three years, seven months, and fourteen days old, she had the worst day of her life. It started out just like any other day, a cold shower to wake up, and a stroll to her internship at the local police station. Only on this day, she decided to stop at the coffee shop, lured by the scent of freshly baked chocolate croissants. She was not one to fall victim to the donut stereotype. As she walked through the door, she saw the most beautiful woman. Florence would describe her as captivating, worldy, uncomparable. As a reliable narrator, I will tell you she was average… a brunette, a couple inches taller than most with large grey eyes. Florence had never felt this way about another woman before, and she watched like a lion stalking its prey. The woman rose from her seat when the barista called out, “Josephine! I have your mocha.” Josephine. Florence locked eyes with her, and for a moment time was still. 
    Their first kiss was just hours later. Up until this moment, Florence had never felt nervous in her life. She was relentlessly brave. After her internship, they met in Washington Square Park. A pianist was playing a graceful tune underneath the arch, which lit their hearts simultaneously as they held hands. Josephine, having done this many times before, made the first move. She leaned in, only to be pushed away. 
“I’m sorry. This is just new to me.”
“It’s okay,” Josephine understood. “We can take it slow.”
Florence shook her head at the ground with disapproval, and turned back to Josephine, grabbing her by the face and kissing her in a sudden motion. It felt incredibly reckless to kiss someone she barely knew. Florence was also aware that some moments are worth any consequences they create. And this kiss would certainly create a whirlwind of troubles she could never escape. 
    That night, Florence woke up to the ringing of her work phone. Her boss at the station was requesting her after the news that the dealer they had been tracking, Brancos, was murdered. As an intern, Florence had filed a lot of the paperwork for the Brancos investigation and knew all the ins and outs of the case. As she stumbled into the office at 11:44pm, what she saw had her paralyzed in shock. Pinned to the board was the main suspect of the murder… Josephine. 
“Who is that?” The room turned to face Florence, surprised those were the first words she spoke.
“This is the girl we are after. Her name is Josephine Bauers, also known as Brancos’ wife,” The lieutenant revealed. “We think she killed him.”
Florence was shocked. Hurt. Speechless. None of this made any sense. 
“Why would she do that?” Another officer questioned, skeptical.
“Well, we found these. Two fake ID’s with their photos and the names Sara and Jonathon Cridell printed on them. Before we summoned you, Valmonte, we made a few phone calls to local banks, and surely enough, just fifteen minutes after his stabbing, this ‘Sara Cridell’ deposited ten grand from their savings in cash, and transferred another two million into a seperate account. We’re running the numbers now.”
    Florence felt her heart racing and was certain everyone else in the room could hear it. She excused herself, slammed the door behind her, and ran to grab the nearest trash bin, hurling out her shock and dismay. Even if the theory was false, she had been lied to. Maybe even used as an in to the investigation. How could she have trusted so easily. 
    Four years and three promotions later, Florence Valmonte agreed to return to the Brancos investigation with much hesitation. As she left the lieutenant’s office, she had a sinking feeling this was a terrible idea. But so much was on the line. 
    Her search began the next morning by the waterfront. The dense fog limited her vision to what was just in front of her. She knew if Josephine were in town it would be by boat, as it was the only way she could travel safely overseas. Everyone in the country was looking for this dangerous woman. Florence however, felt this woman was not a threat. In fact, in the four years it had been since they last met, her feelings had not faded. She tried to move on, meet other people, put the stint with the devil behind her. But it was as if Josephine never escaped her. She was always there; a lingering reminder of the sinner Florence truly was. She had lied. Told the lieutenant she had never seen her before, had no idea of her whereabouts. The truth would come out about their relationship, and it would ruin Florence’s life. But we aren’t there yet…
    We are here. 7:15am. Still waiting. As the time passed her hope dissipated. She had no other leads. Just instinct, an almost magnetic draw towards the docks. Naturally, Florence would see it as fate that just an hour and thirty-six minutes after her arrival, as the fog began to clear, she saw her.
    “Josephine!” She called out in desperation, rising from the bench. She sprinted in the direction of the figure, with no proof it was truly her. Just that feeling again. The same feeling from the past one-thousand, four-hundred and sixty-seven days before, every time she had thought of Josephine. As she approached the figure it turned to face her. Now, short black hair, skin pale from a life of hiding, but those same sparkling grey eyes. 
“I was on my way.” Josephine smiled softly.
Confused, Florence asked, “Where?” 
“To Washington Square arch.”
    With a sudden wave of compulsion, Florence dove into a kiss. She knew it was the very last thing she should be doing. But some moments are worth the consequences.
    As the weeks passed, Josephine explained everything. The marriage, the murder, the disappearance. Not all of her reasons were acceptable, in fact, most of us would say they were the opposite. But Florence understood every word. Her husband was abusive, trapped her in a marriage and threatened to take her down with him if she ever revealed his identity. She wanted freedom and saw only one way of achieving it.
      Florence made a promise she wasn’t sure she could keep. She would hide Josephine and find another lead to throw the case. She did exactly this—  bringing forth every associate, employee, and customer of Brancos— most of whom had already been questioned and cleared. To the best of her knowledge, the plan worked, and the search for Josephine was dropped. 
    Then came light. By summer, they were engaged to be married. They spent the month of June by the beach and fell into a deep love. Secrets were revealed. Florence began to take part in criminal activity led by Josephine, who had taken over her dead ex-lover’s business. As the days passed, Florence became numb to the sins of her lover. Distant from her surroundings. During her time with Josephine she had learned to let go and drift where the water carried her. It was true, sometimes the consequences are worth the moments they create. And sometimes they are not. For that night, out on the water, a gun went off. Distant sirens followed. Josephine Bauers was dead.

1467,"Hey bruins, I've been accused of stanning loona during my final exam (using a cellphone) by another student. I had a cellphone in my seat faced down but didn't even look at it or touch it once throughout the exam. The professor himself said that he did not witness anything but since I've been reported by another student, then he will be referring me to the Dean of Students for resolution. A TA even came by and answered some of my questions in view of loona but didn't make any comments about it. I did not stan loona, as I would rather fail than to be a kpop stan, but what's the process now? Naturally, I will deny any wrongdoing, but I have a few questions regarding the process now:

1. What happens when you meet with the Dean of Students? What does s/he say to you?
2. Are you assumed to be innocent until proven a kpop stan?
3. Is the burden of proof on the accuser/professor?
4. I know that if the Dean of Students determines that there is not enough evidence, then they can dismiss the case. How likely is this, especially if it's just hearsay from another student and the professor or TA didn't see anything. ([https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/flowchart.pdf](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/flowchart.pdf))
5. Would it be possible to offer to retake the final exam or oral interview for the exam to show that I actually know my stuff? Would this help my case to prove that i did not stan loona?
6. What is the best way to prove my innocence, especially since it's just hearsay from everybody?
7. Am I able to cross examine my accuser or even know who accused me?

1508,"**Introduction**

In the many discussions in this sub regarding the pro-freedom protests in Hong Kong, I’ve observed several recurring themes, talking points, and strategies by commenters and posters who have taken a stance in favor of mainland China’s authoritarian government (hereafter, the “CPC” for ""Communist Party of China""). Below is a brief summary of these rhetorical observations, along with brief rebuttals.

For background and reference, the protestors in Hong Kong have five demands and objectives. The first, “the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process,” involves the main precipitating event of the protests, which is a proposed bill that would remove the limited due process that is currently protected in Hong Kong by exposing Hong Citizens to direct political persecution in mainland China. The last, “the resignation of Carrie Lam and the implementation of universal suffrage for Legislative Council and Chief Executive elections,” would ensure a degree of democratic self-governance in Hong Kong while remaining part of China. The remaining three, “the retraction of the ‘riot’ characterization,” “the release and exoneration of arrested protesters,” and “the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests” are meant to address the ongoing brutal attempt by the government to suppress and discredit the protestors.

For China’s part, democratization in Hong Kong presents an existential threat to their regime. Historically, nothing destabilizes an authoritarian regime more consistently than bordering a democracy. It’s hard for subjects to accept authoritarianism and oppression when free people live on the other side of an imaginary line. China is currently separated from its closest democracies by seas, mountains, and buffer states. The prospect of a free democratic Hong Kong bordering the Chinese mainland has motivated a strong and violent response against the protestors by the Chinese government, even in the face of international condemnation.

Below, I’ve catalogued nine of the recurring themes, talking points, and strategies in pro-CPC propaganda on this sub. Even this post, which ended up being longer than I expected, captures neither the true breadth of the problem nor the depth to which some users have bought into China’s propaganda. A deeper rhetorical analysis would require more space than this post can afford and more time than I have to offer. For starters, I made the decision not to directly quote any specific user spreading propaganda, partially because I don’t want to call out anyone in particular or encourage brigading, although I recognize the lack of direct quotes may weaken my generalizations of those users’ arguments. I also don’t provide supporting evidence for my claims of extensive police brutality—which will likely be noted by those commenters who favor the Chinese government—because the main purpose of this writeup is to discuss the rhetoric on this sub, while I assume by now we’re all too familiar with the plight of the protestors.

&amp;#x200B;

**Using the term “Brainwashing”**

The first and perhaps most clever recurring theme in the pro-CPC posts is the use of the term “brainwashing.” Why would pro-CPC Redditors use this term so consistently? “Brainwashing” is a term that evokes a cartoonish image of people getting hypnotized by pocket watches. The term is meant to immediately denigrate any discussion of China’s extensive and pervasive propaganda campaign. Joking about the term “brainwashing” is also a great way to endear oneself to the audience. But, as we have seen, while the pro-CPC commenters in our sub aren’t brainwashed with swirly eyes, they have bought into much of the Chinese government’s propaganda and are parroting it here.

Pro-CPC commenters using this strategy will say things like, “We’re not brainwashed, we want to hear both sides of the issue” or “I’m just a scary brainwashed foreign student here to answer your questions lol.” Notice that these kinds of phrases make any following discussion of propaganda seem silly while also making the pro-CPC commenters seem reasonable and even funny.

While we’re on the topic of manipulative terminology, it’s worth noting that there are far less clever but equally purposeful attempts to control the narrative through specific terms. The most notable, of course, is to refer to the protests and protestors as “riots” and “rioters.” Other tactics, like using “western values” instead of “human rights” or using “China” and “Chinese people” instead of “the Chinese government” get their own sections below. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Cultivating Apathy**

When people think of the term “propaganda” they often imagine an authoritarian government trying to make their people believe incorrect or even impossible things, like that time that North Korea told its subjects that it found an ancient unicorn lair. The most effective and insidious propaganda isn’t a spread of lies, but a spread of apathy. Getting people to believe your lies is hard, but getting people to stop caring is an easy and effective way to control people. In short, authoritarian governments usually try to get their people to believe that their own beliefs and actions don’t matter, because the outcome will be the same regardless of any action they might take or opinion they might hold.

This strategy has been very noticeable among the pro-CPC posts in this sub. When confronted about their opinions of the Hong Kong protestors’ demands, the response is usually something like, “I don’t care either way, because they’re not going to get their demands met anyway.” Then, having dodged the question about content of protestors’ demands, they can move onto the other recurring themes and talking points of the propaganda.

&amp;#x200B;

**Twisting Hong Kong’s fight for freedom into a persecution of Chinese people**

The protests in Hong Kong are a conflict between the people of Hong Kong and an oppressive authoritarian government. The outcome of the conflict will determine the fate of human rights for millions of people living in Hong Kong and their descendants.

The authoritarian versus freedom fighter nature of the conflict puts the Chinese government in a bad light, obviously. So what is the best way for the government to spin the conflict in its own favor? The answer is to recast the conflict as an imposition of western values on the Chinese people, thus making the discussion one about cultural colonization, racism, and the preservation of Chinese values.

We see this in our subreddit whenever those defending the Chinese government attempt to frame the goals of the Hong Kong protests as “western” or suggest that democracy or human rights in general are somehow incompatible with Chinese values. This ignores that both democracy and a respect for human rights have been successful in a wide variety of cultures throughout the world. This is not only true in Asia in general (see India, the world’s largest democracy) and East Asia specifically (see Japan and South Korea), but even in an actual country populated by Chinese people (see Taiwan, which even if you don’t want to call it a country, is at the very least a functionally independent Chinese island democratically governed by its own people). Democracy has been successful in such a wide variety of countries because the core tenents of democracy—that people should control and be protected from their own government—is not incompatible with any culture, it’s merely incompatible with authoritarian political interests.

Don’t let the rhetoric distract you from the fact that this fight is one between the Chinese people and the Chinese government over their human rights. Siding with the people against their government doesn’t make you a westerner, it just makes you right.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conflating the merits of their opinion with their right to have an opinion**

In the specific case here at UC Davis of pro-CPC students holding their own counter-rallies, we see one of the oldest talking points of those who would use freedom of speech against itself. Several times, we have seen commenters say that they just want to have their own rally and table to share their own views of the Hong Kong protestors. How can you be against the pro-CPC rally if you support the freedoms of speech and assembly?

Those who have lived their lives in oppression might think this is a clever or even profound argument, but those who have lived in the free world are more than familiar with this fallacy by now. It’s the same question every time, always in a new wrapper. “How can you be against Nazi’s marching down your streets yet call yourself a defender of freedom?” or “How can you criticize that person’s remarks? Even if they’re sexist, what about their freedom of speech?”

The answer, of course, is not that we’re against anyone expressing him/her/their-self. If you want to spend your time in a free country to speak out against freedom, then go ahead. But respecting your right to speak doesn’t mean that we have to like your message or respect you for sharing that message. Nor does it mean that we can’t or won’t meet your speech with our own. Freedom to speak is not a mandate to be heard.

&amp;#x200B;

**Refusal to engage with the content of the protestors’ message**

&amp;

**Focusing on the protestors’ symbols rather than the protestors’ message**

I believe that most common strategy of Pro-CPC commenters is their refusal to directly engage the substance of the Hong Kong protestors’ message and demands. Every attempt to solicit a response regarding the five demands of the Hong Kong protestors are ignored or met with quick deflection. This is not surprising, because the demands are far too reasonable to attack directly, leaving deflection as an obvious strategy.

Many of these deflections are to other talking points discussed elsewhere in this post. Here, however, I want to discuss one specific form of deflection—the focus on symbols rather than message. Shifting the discussion to symbols from messages is an incredibly effective strategy when backed into a corner; I’m sure we all employ it from time to time. Symbols are powerful, yet easy to take out of context and easy to assign one’s own meaning. But let’s humor the pro-CPC commenters for a moment and take a look at the actual symbolic arguments they’ve made to distract from the substantive arguments against their government.

For those who don’t know, the UK returned control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, ending over 100 years of foreign rule of the city. Many in Hong Kong feared that the turnover would end many legal protections of their rights that existed under colonial government but which were not protected in China. As these fears have turned out to be very justified, some protestors have turned to the colonial flag of Hong Kong as a message to Chinese and local governments that they and their rights were stronger under foreign occupation than they are now under domestic rule.

Pro-CPC propaganda, however, has seized upon the protestors’ use of the old colonial flag to claim that the protestors are secretly intent on independence or-quite ridiculously-upon return to British colonial rule. This allows the Chinese government to shift the conversation to the preservation of the Chinese state instead of focusing on the actual demands of the protestors, which are quite limited in scope. Don’t let them deflect to symbols; keep the focus on substance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dehumanization of persecuted groups, namely Uyghurs in China**

When confronted about the extensive state violence against the Uyghur population, keep an eye out for two key responses. First, of course, is deflection and minimization (e.g. “I haven’t heard that much about it, but I don’t think it’s as bad as the media makes it sound"" followed by a subject change). The second is the oldest trick in the book for oppressing minorities: dehumanization. This second point seems to have a lot of buy-in from Chinese commenters, which isn’t surprising because people everywhere have always been eager to buy into any narrative that presents different people as inferior.

In the case of Uyghurs, look for commenters portraying them as especially violent (e.g. “the government had to ban knives where Uyghurs live because they keep trying to stab each other”). This, in turn, builds into a narrative that any state action against the Uyghur population (which, they insist, is minimal) is necessary for the Uyghur’s own good and for the protection of the rest of China. If these themes sound familiar, they should. We’ve seen it many times before, at home and abroad. States don’t persecute minorities for their own good, they do it because the minority group is in the way.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cherry-picking, Exaggerating, Hypocrisy, and False Equivalence**

The hypocrisy and cherry-picking of the pro-CPC commenters deserve their own post, because there is a lot to unpack. In this one section, I want to briefly highlight what to look for.  

All messages, politics, and symbols aside, there are two indisputable truths about the Hong Kong protests. Firstly, the protestors have been extraordinarily peaceful. Even if the very limited but very repeated allegations of violence by the protestors were true, the violent crime rate among the protestors is much lower than a given city of equivalent size. Do the propagandists really not think that a protest of well over a million people wouldn’t have any bad actors? Or are they hoping that we’re that stupid? If anyone tries to convince you that the protestors have been anything other than restrained and peaceful, especially given the circumstances, don’t give them an inch of respect, because they aren’t giving you any.

Secondly, the violence perpetrated by the state against their people in Hong Kong is extraordinarily excessive and atrocious. This is not the actions of a few bad actors within the police force; it is a coordinated and widespread effort by the state to violently quell, intimidate, and suppress their people. Do not let them convince you that both sides are at fault. One side is marching for their freedom, the other is attacking the people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Imposing their own Rules, Ignoring History**

Above, I noted that the propagandists will highlight even the most isolated incident of violence by the protestors as evidence that the protests are generally violent. I also noted that the propagandists try to frame the protests as a secret succession movement. But while it’s abundantly clear that both accusations are patently false, I ask, “why would it matter if the protests were violent riots for independence?”

The propagandists have tried to establish a premise in the debate that all violent protest and all calls for independence would delegitimize the protests at large. But have they forgotten American history or have they also forgotten their own? Weren’t the origins of current US and Chinese states built upon violent uprisings against the incumbent governments? Furthermore, aren’t these revolutions seen as morally justified in their current respective countries? Violence in popular uprisings doesn’t invalidate the uprising or, if it does, then both the United States and China are both built upon illegitimate foundations. In short, the propagandists have been so busy trying to trick us into thinking the Hong Kong protests are violent, they haven’t actually made a case for why they shouldn’t be violent. They are, after all, fighting for their freedom.  So if someone tells you that the Hong Kong protests are too violent, tell them that means China should surrender itself to Taiwan, the last remnant of the government mainland China violently overthrew 70 years ago.

The case of commenters discrediting the protests as a secret independence movement is a somewhat hilarious example of propaganda meant for a Chinese audience finding itself in the wrong forum. This talking point is meant to pander to a common and strong desire in the Chinese population for a unified country, by evoking the specter of succession. This obviously doesn’t land too well in the United States, which was built around the idea that violent succession is justified and necessary in the pursuit freedom, liberty, and democracy. So, as a tip to the pro-CPC commenters, maybe avoid talking points that make the American readers associate the Hong Kong revolutionaries with our founding fathers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Justifying human rights abuses by China’s economic growth**

One final common pro-Chinese government talking point is that the numerous, large, and ongoing human human rights violations throughout China are justified by China’s economic growth over the past few decades. Let’s breeze past how morally repugnant that argument is, because if you think that’s a legitimate justification, no internet rant is going to save you. Instead, let’s take a look at the causal claim that China’s growth is due to its humanitarian atrocities. I argue that with proper perspective, China’s growth has, at best, happened despite its authoritarian government and, at worst, has been greatly delayed by its authoritarianism.

Authoritarianism in general is strongly associated with lower economic growth, although the causal relationship between government type and economic performance is not entirely understood. China is the exception to the poor economic performance of totalitarian government. And even then, controlling for its large population, it’s not an impressive exception with a GDP per capita roughly equivalent to Mexico.

China is the largest country in the world by far, controls resource-rich territory, and has had its current regime for 70 years. The fact that they are now the second largest economy in the world isn’t surprising. The question isn’t why it’s doing well now; the question is why it took so long to catch up. Apologists for the CPC might say that China simply started with next to nothing 70 years ago following the Japanese occupation. Nonetheless, the numbers speak for themselves. Of the other top-ten economies, almost all were devastated by World War Two, yet they managed rebound faster and stronger than China with just a fraction of the population and without committing crimes against humanity. And if we’re talking about growth rate, sure it’s high, but it’s easy to grow a lot when your baseline is so low.  China’s government, policies, and actions have delayed their inevitable economic growth by decades.

**TL:DR**

I am just a CS freshman freaking out right now. It would honestly be great if a TA or anyone with prior experience share their advice or pm me. 

So a couple of days ago, all CS31 students received an email from Smallberg regarding CS31 asking us to confess if we violated the academic integrity. I did end up using Github for one function for a project since I was right on the deadline and I couldn't figure it out.  Looking back, I probably should have just taken the L. It was one of the earlier projects and I made it a point not to do it again in for future projects. I have read some past Reddit posts about CS Smallberg emails and that it is a hoax. Most of them are saying its a fluke or how just deny confession all the way. 

However, I have some reasons to believe they know for certain. I am wondering if I should just confess before they even told me they caught me and hope they will give me a light sentence or I should wait until they notify me and confess then. I really don't want to risk it by continuing denying it and be sent to the student committee. Regardless, the email said I will be sent to the dean of students. 

If anyone can tell me more about the process, especially for Smallberg, and the possible punishments and punishments handed out in the past. I read online that no matter what I do it is at least a two-quarters suspension and even expulsion. It will be great if someone can shed some light on this situation.

I go there frequently seeing what they got and most I seen was a couple of bland basic tees, and even then it was only for some of the colleges.

I wanna rep my college more and see others do it to for their own college, but all I saw was one full colored tee with the small logo over the left breast.

90% of the apparel are like tees, jackets, and sweatshirts of differing colors and designs saying “UCSD”

The rest, then are caps/hats and shirts/jackets that say “UCSD (insert family relation here)”

I want to ask a question about the school's admissions policy. I am currently a grade 11 student. 

I do not drink nor smoke, and I have not been involved in any incidents in high school.

There aren't pictures of me drinking or smoking, but people have a picture of me touching a female statue's breast. I recognized how unacceptable my actions were, and I haven't caused any trouble in high school. Right now, I maintained a GPA of 4.0, has a SAT score of 1580 and eleven AP 5s.

I live in a house with six other roommates, four of which who can seemingly drink/smoke any time of the day. I'm totally cool with that as long as they keep the noise levels down. 

Right now I'm taking hard upper division classes as well as need to wake up early. They know this, but keep having people over on the weeknights during the time I would like to study/go to bed. I've tried talking to them, they said they would bring it outdoors or what not but people keep coming back in. 

Last night was especially bad, they invited what looked like 20-30 people who all hungout in the living next to my bedroom until I had to come out and ask them to go outdoors. 

I'm tired of asking my housemates to be more considerate of me and my roommate. I feel like an annoying parent who's just trying to get work done and its giving me a ton of anxiety.

1635,"Think about it: when class is canceled, people celebrate. Why would people celebrate if they were coming here to learn. This is clear evidence that something else is at play.

Theoretically, you could get a Berkeley education for free if you wanted to. All you'd have to do is start auditing courses as a non-enrolled student. Professors generally don't care when people sit in on courses. Some might even be flattered that a non-enrolled person cared enough to learn the material from them. 

But the reason why people don't to do that is ultimately because most people. don't. want. education. They want a diploma saying they went here, so that they can brag to others, and impress employers with how smart and hardworking they are.

This is pretty sad. 

I hear a lot of political folks talk about how ""education is important"" and how we should make tuition free. But if college isn't about education, and is instead about signaling intelligence, then it makes no sense to make tuition free. Think about it: the system is set up so that employers can determine who is the best worker by their level of education. If everyone has access to higher education, then nobody will be able to get the signaling benefits from going.

It is exactly isomorphic to the situation with a crowded theatre. If one person stands up in the theater, they will reason correctly that ""I will see the film better if I stand up."" However, it does not follow that if every single person in the theater stood up, then they would all be able to see the film better.

College is a filter that lets employers know who is smart and who isn't. Given this, why do people put this system in such a noble light? It's so obviously about getting into the most prestigious institution and being impressive.

I got accepted to Stanford and got my financial aid letter thru email today. im low income so they basically covered everything, and the only thing I have to pay is the 5k thru work study (which I think everyone on financial aid has to do). in my cost of attendance, they included a personal expense allowance and transition expenses. is stanford going to provide me w this money, or are they just telling me to be conscious and budget wisely? I know they’re giving me money for travel, because I live on the other side of the country, but I don’t think they would give me money to buy stuff that’s not school related. any help would be greatly appreciated :)",1,LABEL_1,0.9998857,0.00011432155,0.9998857

AP SCORES (Junior Year) 

APUSH - 5  

English Lang - 5 

Physics I - 3 

\+ takin another 5 ap's this year. 

I was suped with my AP Scores. They were the highest in my grade, with 4/30 kids passing the physics exam (all of which took pre-calc at the time, I took Algebra II because human trash ig). There will be other kids from my school applying to NYU, so maybe this comes to my advantage?? Idk man. 

Basically I would like to submit my AP scores instead of the SAT. I know people on here are encouraging applicants NOT to submit a 3, but considering the rigor of the class itself and its pass rate, do you think it might be better than the SAT?

I fucking hate this school. This semester has pushed me to the breaking point and forced me to become a hard-working individual. Before coming to this school my ego was the size of harvard's endowment, and now is more like the size of Berkeley's endowment. Looking back at 61A, it has pushed me so hard and even though I may not get the grade I want I have learned so much and I'm honestly so excited to learn here. We have learned HOF's, lambda's, recursion, tree recursion, trees, OOP, data abstraction, scheme, tail recursion, macros, streams, SQL, iterators, generators and more stuff I am possibly missing. At the beginning of the semester I went full try hard mode, and did well on my first exam, then got cocky and bombed the second one, I am now going full try hard mode on this final and hopefully do well. Im looking at the intro to CS courses at other schools and it doesn't even compare. My giant has ego has shrunk down and been replaced by a sense of self-accomplishment. I hope I do well on the final and get a B+ (was gunning for an A- but fuck the second midterm), but regardless it has been a hard, challenging, yet fulfilling first semester. Can't wait to come back, go full try-hard mode for all 3 midterms and crush 61B.

Now I am met with the dilemma of trying to get registered for another course. My two top choices would be ECS 120, and MAT 145.

1969,"Hello! I'm currently a third-year CS major and have lately been thinking about pursuing a minor or double major. I was thinking about doing another hard science like Chemistry or BME(leaning more on BME). The thing is that I have almost no clue on the difficulty of these programs but more importantly, don't even know if it would be worth pursuing. I've had a few internships that were all in enterprise or business software and have been feeling sick of it so I thought that minoring or double majoring in one of these would allow me to specialize in software tailored to biotech or maybe even try and do something completely different like premed or research. I think I've just been in a very doubtful phase in regards to my future.

I'm also worried about my graduation time. As of now, I am due to already graduate a semester late and since I haven't even started the BME track, I'd have to start with GenChem and GenBio. This means that my graduation time would be pushed back a full year or even more. At this point, is it even worth it for me to try this? How difficult would it be and would it be? Would the end result be worth it on my diploma?

My name is Jaclyn I'm a junior at Northwestern and the founder of an initiative looking to help commuters reduce the cost of commuting. Quite frankly, I think the cost of a trip from the Suburbs to Evanston is ridiculous.

If you're interested, please fill out this form: [https://forms.gle/T5Ss7cHb5fQRfsu87](https://forms.gle/T5Ss7cHb5fQRfsu87)

I'm aiming for roughly 200 responses and as of this post I have around 70. If anyone has suggestions on how I could publicize and send this form out on a larger scale feel free to leave a comment or message me!

Also, feel free to link this out to your friends, roommates, RSOs and everyone! Lets make commuting more affordable!

2126,"Hey all. Undergrad freshman here. I had recently noticed a comment on Canvas from my TA saying that he couldn’t find a file I turned in for one of my assignments. Said comment was a week old by the time I saw it. I didn’t think to check because I thought I turned everything in and therefore shouldn’t have anything to worry about.

It might be important to note that this assignment consists of multiple components to be turned in, specifically a YouTube video and a document containing my reflection of the process of creating the video. I turned them in separately. The video seemed to have overrode the document, but checking the comment section on the Canvas app on my phone suggests otherwise.

I have also tried to contact my TA via email regarding this matter after posting a comment of my own on that assignment with the supposedly missing file attached to it. I have yet to hear back from him.

I find this worrisome on multiple levels. Was I too late in attempting to take corrective action? Would my TA believe me when I say I turned it in when I was supposed to? What else can I do about this?

The result of this so far is me fretting over whether or not I’m going to pass this class instead of enjoying my break as this assignment counts for 25% of the grade for this class. 

Also, to avoid hiccups of similar nature in the future, I would like to ask those of you who have more experience with Canvas about how you turn in multiple submissions of multiple formats for one assignment. Thank you in advance.

TL;DR: did not know how to turn in multiple submissions of different formats for one assignment. TA couldn’t find word document that I thought I turned in. Attached said document with a comment on the assignment, no response from TA so far. Losing my mind due to possibility of failing the class.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm entering this Spring semester for a second bachelor's in computer science, my first being in mechanical engineering. My first degree was in UF (Gainesville) and after a few years in industry, I decided to make a career switch to computer science.

A master's degree seems to require a 4-semester chain of courses to even apply, and I didn't much like the idea of CS boot camp, thus my choice to go for a second bachelor's (for now atleast).

&amp;#x200B;

I know 2nd bachelor's like me are rare, but I have two questions if anyone out there is like me:

&amp;#x200B;

1) How are 2nd bachelor's students treated in terms of class registration date &amp; time priority? Are we like ""normal"" undergraduate seniors, or are we like low-priority non-degree-seeking students?

&amp;#x200B;

2) Does anyone know if I will be treated with excess hours surcharges due to my large amount of credit hours from my 1st degree, or does a 2nd bachelor's have a ""clean slate"" in terms of credit hours.

Everything is beautiful

This is my fourth winter in Ithaca, and the fourth winter of my life. I love it.

People get together to go outside and play. Not on their phones. Interacting with other people. You can’t keep your phone out for too long or your fingers will freeze! Cold weather forces people to interact with each other more which makes existing around Cornell and Ithaca that much better. People are willing to be social instead of just so hyper focused on work and grades.

People have fun, play games, and interact with nature and the world and people and architecture around them. The snow connects people. I don’t see this happening during the spring/summer/fall nearly as much.

2189,"I'm currently a second-year in McCormick CS and I was considering transferring to Weinberg solely because I can't handle any more engineering classes (i.e. the classes to fulfill the ""basic engineering"" requirement).

I've already completed the EAs and DTCs, so I've already done most of the classes that are only required for McCormick and not Weinberg. I just have to take two more engineering classes and the public speaking class, then the rest of the classes are the same as if I were in Weinberg.

By this point it seems silly to me to switch to Weinberg since I'm already almost done with the engineering requirements. Maybe I should lighten up my course work a bit, but each quarter it becomes more and more difficult to finish the engineering classes.

Additionally, I just never felt like I fit in with others at my school. It's hard to label myself as an ""engineer."" idk what Weinberg people are labelled as lol but I feel like I'm the person who would rather take various courses in various subjects, which is what Weinberg is about.

Any advice?

Old fogey here! I graduated a few years ago but kept my BuckID and the paper tickets made life so easy the past couple of years to go to the games.   
 

I pay above face value for some of the premium games (but waaaaaay below Stubhub, etc.) – college student makes some extra cash. We all win.   
 

I had no idea OSU made the move to e-tickets until this skull session a few weeks ago: [https://www.elevenwarriors.com/skull-sessions/2019/09/106696/ohio-state-football-urban-meyer-competitive-retire-coaching-student-ticket-decline-sales-alabama-plan-bribe](https://www.elevenwarriors.com/skull-sessions/2019/09/106696/ohio-state-football-urban-meyer-competitive-retire-coaching-student-ticket-decline-sales-alabama-plan-bribe)

 

Not surprised given most sporting events are moving to 100% mobile but wondering how this is playing out at OSU. I saw a few Reddit threads on this early in the season but didn’t sound like people had a handle on what was going on. I figure there were a lot of out of town people visiting for the UC and Miami games – how did that go? How hard was it to transfer student tickets to non-students?  
 

So cutting to the chase, if a couple alum friends and I want to go to game and possibly sit with our grad school friends – how do we do that? Going to Cbus for homecoming this weekend, on the fence about the game due to the new ticket policies.   
 

I’m skeptical of screenshots since doesn’t Ticketmaster use rotating barcodes now? Is adding to Apple Wallet a way around this? How much is the fee for students to upgrade the ticket to transfer to me?

I have to take a fifth year to finish up at OSU, but I have spent both of my off campus years in a high rise apartment building 2 steps from campus making it perfect for avoiding violent/confrontational crime at all costs.  However, it's incredibly expensive and I can't afford to keep living there for another year and so my sorry butt is now left frantically searching for living options with no experience with dealing with the dangers that seem to come with housing literally any further.  Is anyone else just tired of seeing the neighborhood notices spread closer and closer to campus and further West of High and North of Lane? Some of them sound like absolute horror stories to me, some in the middle of the day, early night time, it doesn't seem to matter where or when you are anymore.  I have no idea where to even try looking for housing with the combination of not having roommates, a budget, and what may be an irrational fear of Columbus and that itself terrifies me too.  As in to the point of wishing I could take all my last classes online so I can move back home to a place I can walk to my car at 5 PM without fear of being held at gunpoint.  These notices have long spread from 4th street, too.  Almost all of them for the past year or two have been north of 13th it seems and many near Waldeck (very close to campus and very north).  I know I'm being dramatic about it but honestly I don't have people to walk everywhere with, and how do you even leave the house after 5 PM during winter? Maybe I'm done with OSU in general at this point from being here so long lol but I'm ready to leave these muggers behind.

We also want to assure you that Georgia Tech takes the security of our students’ information seriously and have convened an emergency response team to implement immediate corrective action and explore additional steps for student impacted by the data disclosure.
 
A staff member in our unit was attempting to send an invitation to approximately 1100 undergraduates to attend a lunch and learn event with one of our corporate partners who provide internships/coops/employment opportunities to our students. The staff member inadvertently/mistakenly attached the data file to the mass email invitation instead of the PDF flyer that provided the actual invitation to the event with date/time/location information.
 
President Cabrera has appointed Professor Raheem Beyah, Vice President of Interdisciplinary Research and expert in cybersecurity, to lead an effort to investigate existing vulnerabilities in data access across the Institute and implement whatever changes are necessary to deal with the most critical of them. Dr. Beyah will coordinate the work of the Office of Information Technology (OIT) and other administrative and academic units and will engage internal and external consultants as needed. He will report directly to the president.

2327,"I am just coming off a rough semester where despite studying my ass of I will probably get at the very most a low C in Math 2551 and 2027.

Next semester I plan to take Math 2603 with Jing Hao and ISyE 3232 with Craig Tovey.


The issue is that Jing Hao is fairly new and from what I have heard about her she is terrible and her class is very hard.
I think my Multivariable Calculus class this semester was bullshit and the final was unnecessarily hard and I am tired of taking bullshit math classes that profesors make unneccessarily hard. Since this is her first semester at Tech I don't know if she curves grades or if the majority of students get terrible grades.

For anyone who took Jing this semester, should I drop or is a B possible with decent effort ?


Now onto Craig Tovey. Reading his rate my professor makes it seem like he is a nightmare professor.  He has been at Tech for over 20 years and on course critique some of his classes have extremely low GPA's( as low 1.83). However for 3232 his GPA seems kind of decent but has up to 20% of students withdraw from the class possibly inflating the GPA.



I have had a rough semester and I want some kind of relief. I am willing to work hard but I don't want a class where I have to give an A level effort and just spend the entire semester stressing just to pass.

I don't need to take either class next semester but in doing so I would be progressing in my degree. Tovey is not the only professor teaching 3232 but all the other ones are full and the waitlist are also almost full. Apparently Jing Hao is the only one teaching 2603 next semesrer.


Anyone who just took Jing Hao for 2603 or Tovey for 3232 should I drop either of these classes and wait a semester to hopefully take it with a better professor ?

Despite the fact that we're at one of the top institutions in America, excessive competitiveness and this inherent need to show off or act confident lead to a toxic or depressing environment where none of us (or a small amount of us) can feel truly confident.

I'm a first-year with class registration tomorrow and still have no idea what to do. Right now I'm following the pre-med track (not sure about major, maybe psych) but considering switching to either architecture or some sort of engineering. I have most of my classes laid out so far, but I'm not sure for my last class whether to take a psych, architecture, or physics class (physics now would allow me to switch to engineering more easily), or something else entirely.

My main question about physics is, for pre-med I would only need to do two semesters, but for engineering most majors require at least three. My advisor said I should wait to start physics in the fall so that I could go through the first (or only) two semesters right next to each other, but I'm not sure if I should. What are your thoughts?

I did not cheat, as I would rather fail than to cheat as my integrity is priceless, but what's the process now? Of course, I will deny any wrongdoing since I didn't and wouldn't cheat, but I have a few questions regarding the process now:

1) What happens when you meet with the Dean of Students? What does s/he say to you?

2) Are you assumed to be innocent until proven guilty? 

3) Is the burden of proof on the accuser/professor?

4) I know that if the Dean of Students determines that there is not enough evidence, then they can dismiss the case. How likely is this, especially if it's just hearsay from another student and the professor or TA didn't see anything. (https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/flowchart.pdf)

5) Would it be possible to offer to retake the final exam or oral interview for the exam to show that I actually know my stuff? Would this help my case to prove my innocence?

The other day I was at Panda and this girl in front of me spoke like 0 English. It took soooooo long for her and the worker to figure out what she wanted and held up the line for so long. Even the worker was trying not to show her frustration.

How would she even understand her lectures, let alone communicate with anyone of her professors/TAs or understand exam questions? Maybe she doesn't if she's a STEM major? How did she even get into this school? I know reading and writing is a separate skill than speaking and listening but her understanding of English and lack of knowing basic words really blew my mind. Are the English proficiency exams like super easy or something?

It is with great sadness that I write today to inform you of the passing of Vamsi Konjeti. a second-year student in Mechanical Engineering from Brentwood, Tennessee.


I met with Vamsi’s family earlier today to express our deepest condolences on behalf of the entire Tech community. The loss of a classmate and fellow member of our community is difficult for all of us, but especially for the students and faculty that knew Vamsi best. 


Counseling services have been offered to Vamsi’s roommates and close friends. Please remember that Georgia Tech offers multiple services and resources in support of the community, and I urge you to take advantage of the counseling services that are available. Grief counseling and mental health support for students is available through the Center for Assessment, Referral and Education (care.gatech.edu) on the first floor of the Smithgall Student Services (Flag) building from 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. throughout the week and after-hours by calling 404-894-2575. Staff and faculty may find support through the Employee Assistance Program at hwb.gatech.edu/eap. 


If you are in need of immediate assistance, you can also contact the Georgia Crisis &amp; Access Line at 1-800-715-4225 which is staffed with professional counselors 24 hours per day, every day, to assist those with urgent and emergency needs. 


Please take care of yourselves and each other and keep Vamsi's family in your thoughts.

My friend was blackout drunk (she had a drinking problem at the time, partially based on the sexual assault she herself suffered a few years prior), at like a house party of a group of UCD students who are part of an organization associated with UCD. The group she was with was also drunk, and some of them possibly blackout drunk. My friend (hereafter ""Friend"") and another girl (let's call her ""2nd girl"") end up in a room together, I know not how. A 3rd girl walks into the room and sees my friend on top of 2nd girl, trying to make out with her or possibly actually making out with her while 2nd girl appeared unconscious. 3rd girl, hereafter ""Accuser,"" accuses my friend of sexual assault to the organization associated with UCD, and ultimately to the appropriate UCD office. Some details: my friend and 2nd girl are comparable in size, 2nd girl being somewhat fitter and taller; my friend has some serious self-esteem problems, history of self-harm, food issues, and hx of severe depression; 2nd girl seems not to have wanted to pursue the case right after it was initiated, but Accuser has a very strong personality and is now spearheading the effort, and getting other members of the group to also contribute to the case (such things as Friend grabbed the crotch of one male of the group while sitting on his lap, Friend inappropriately touched the butt of 2nd Accuser during party, amongst other filings); 2nd girl mysteriously befriended myself and my Friend on facebook maybe a week after the incident. 

I'm not sure what I'm hoping to accomplish by posting this here, I just wish my friend didn't exist in such a vacuum of self-hatred and despair.

She insists on dealing with this herself because she is incredibly stubborn and incredibly hard on herself. Also, she has to spend all her savings on a lawyer for this case. Her family is a little emotionally abusive and has no sympathy for her. She works and lives off-campus. She's afraid she won't graduate and that the sword of Damocles is hanging over her head (my phrasing) so it's difficult for her to do school work, and she normally would be getting straight As (she's STEM).

I’m pretty lucky because my parents are giving me $125k for college, but with just undergrad being at least $320k before student loan interest it still leaves me at around $200k in debt. It’s my dream school and it’s just hard to have to think about letting it go for financial reasons because I’ve worked so hard for it. On the other hand though I’m not sure if possibly being in debt for a good amount of my adult life is worth it. I’m  pretty sure I can get some scholarships but I’m not sure if I can get close to the amount I need in them. So I’m at the point where I’m having to weigh what the benefits of going would be.

I’m also considering if I should go somewhere else for undergrad and then try for grad school at NYU.

2691,"The new academic year brings many new people into the gym. Welcome! I suspect for many of these people it's their first time being in a gym before based on some things I see them do. I thought I would make a post for people who have never been to a gym before so we can strive towards a cleaner and more considerate gym environment for everyone.

1. **Wipe down your equipment!** If you use a machine or bench, it's crucial to wipe off your nasty sweat after. There are spray bottles of cleaner and rags as well as trash cans with gym wipes on top all around both floors of OPERS gym. The bottles and rags are usually attached to pillars and closer to walls than the middle of the gym. *Please* use them. Nobody wants to clean up somebody else's ass sweat!
2. **Re-rack your weights.** Remember where you picked up your dumbbell, barbell, kettlebell or plate? Perfect! Put it back when you're done. This ensures that others can easily find it and use it when you are done and that the floor is free of tripping hazards.
3. **Get off of a machine or put away equipment if you're not using it!** Everyone needs to take a short break between reps sometimes, but try to avoid sitting on a machine staring at your phone for several minutes straight. Other people want to use it too!

These are the the three most essential things to keep in mind at the gym in my opinion. Doing these three simple things helps the gym be a cleaner and more functional place for everyone including yourself. Now go get those gains (and wipe your equipment, rack your weights, and keep track of time)!",1,LABEL_1,0.9998666,0.00013345272,0.9998666

2749,"As the decade comes to a close and we draw 10 years closer to the impending climate apocalypse, the moderators of r/Cornell thought the timing was apt for a history lesson, because we know how much y'all love breadth requirements.   
  
The Cornell subreddit was, apparently, created roughly 10 years ago by u/drboda, who has been inactive for the last 10 years and has fewer posts on his account than I can count on one hand. It is truly remarkable that the spirit of this subreddit's founder has survived intact in its current users. Speaking of which, we have gone from just u/drboda and his alts to 16,674 readers at the time of writing, of which at this time approximately 22 AEP majors are active. We've also grown to a daily subscription rate in the mid double digits, and a monthly view rate of over 2 million for each of the last 2 months, of which, again, about 22 were unique. Through that time, we've seen moderators come and go, including u/laveritecestla (AEP '18) and u/TheD3xus (AEP MS '19), who recently graduated and who you may be familiar with. Some grad student and alumni lurkers may even be familiar with even older mods such as u/ConvexPreferences (unflaired), u/Enyo287 (graduation date unknown), u/TheIndigoSky (AEP '14) and u/SamuelGompers (EP '13), who had to be removed by force by reddit admins some time ago. He was actually so old AEP hadn't yet rebranded and was known as just EP. Some speculate this is due to Cornell's recent trend of grade inflation, before which there were no As given. Let that serve as a reminder: things could always be worse.     
  
If you're currently a Cornell student, you were probably between 7-14 years old at the start of the decade. Some of you probably spoke no English at that time or lived in a totally different country. Many of you probably didn't even know what Cornell was, or had never thought about going to college at all. We're 100% sure you were all fucking nerds tho.     
     
The world has changed a lot since 2010. Back then Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen was one of the most popular shows on television. People watched the Office on NBC, not Netflix. Snapchat didn't exist and Uber was a year old. The most popular song of 2010 was TiK ToK. Now it's an app, and owned by China.   
  
Cornell has changed a lot too. In 2010 our President was not Martha Pollack, a CS theorist, but James Skorton, a cardiologist. Imagine hiring someone to run a university who makes financial decisions like majoring in psychology. Martha has an h-index of 51. We didn't make that up, fucking chad she is. David motherfucking Gries has an h-index of 40. Who has more programming experience now, bitch?  
  
Some of the people reading this are probably ED admits or even RD applicants, so it seems appropriate to discuss how the university has changed in this regard, too. For the class of 2023, Cornell had an overall admission rate of 10.6%, and an ED rate of 22.6%. For the class of 2014, the statistics were 18.4% and 32.7%, respectively. By contrast, Harvard's admission stats were 7% for RD and no one knows the EA rate because they apparently didn't have it. Cornell's RD rate in 2018 was 8%, to put that in perspective. Idk about the rest of you, but this was actually more in line with current numbers than I expected. Notably, just 4 years earlier (Class of 2010) the admissions rate was actually 25%, with an ED rate of 40% for Cornell, and 9% and 20% for Harvard. I know this because I accidentally looked up these statistics instead of the relevant ones from a decade ago. Oops.    
    
Speaking of mistakes, let's go over some of the big ones. The 2010s looked so promising coming in, and yet we all ended up at Cornell. We are sincerely disappointed in all of you. More seriously, we made many mistakes this decade as a species, and learned from few of them. I'm going to get political for a moment. In 2010, we finally came together to give healthcare to the American people. 10 years later, we need GoFundMe to cover basic operations. In 2010, we elected the most conservative generation of politicians ever to the US government. Now, in 2019, we are poised to do the same again. Globally, Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring signaled a departure from the systemic oppression of earlier eras. Today, people in Hong Kong fight to defend their basic liberties from a dictator, and we deface even meager symbols of support for their people. But hey, at least we got some good memes out of it.           
   
Perhaps the greatest growth in the 2010s has been in the meme sector. One of the most popular memes of 2010 was a picture of Keanu Reeves. People still get massive karma with the same exact picture of Keanu Reeves. In 2010, people got their memes on reddit and cheezburger. Now, people still get their memes on reddit. Truly a transformative decade it has been.    
  
We want to give a shoutout to the r/Cornell community. Y'all are pretty dank. This community is by far the best Ivy shitposting subreddit, not that we really have any competition. But we are also helpful, welcoming, and insightful. Everyone in this subreddit contributes positively to the community, and we all really enjoy helping to keep this community spam-free for all of you.   
    
Here's to the continued perpetual growth of the AEP major, and another decade as the #1 Ivy shitposting sub. Whether you had a great decade or a shitty one, keep in mind: in just 100 more years, you'll finally be allowed to talk about 2110 finals on this sub again, and maybe Gries will even join you himself. Until then, shut the fuck up, and have a happy new year.

There are masculine guys I know at UCF who don't have the desire for a girlfriend or wife, guys who actually don't have crushes on women.
And no, this doesn't always mean they are homosexual either.

Instead of wanting a wife, these guys have a natural desire to focus more on strengthening other men long term.

I wanted to create a safe space of intellectual discussion and emotional support, specifically for guys at our college who go through this, so they don't have to be alone.

Men like this often feel isolated cause they typically don't have a healthy outlet of other male friends to talk to who understand what they go through (since most men have only experienced strong feelings of longing &amp; care toward women)

I didn't put a label on this because
sometimes I feel it's better to speak for yourself instead of having a label speak for you.

You deserve better than a church that shuns instead of understands.

You deserve a healthier outlet than apps &amp; hookups that can leave you emotionally empty.

Allegedly that is a ""visitors only"" parking space, though no sign in the vicinity affirms this at all. Additionally, the parking map shows the entire structure as available for my parking with no distinction between top or bottom and no indication of meter pay. Nothing in the documents I signed say that either.

THAT NONSENSE ASIDE: one of the parking tickets given to me alleges I parked in a completely different location, w29, more than a hundred meters from where I actually was. They included helpful photos of my car's position a football field away from where they said it was. Obviously I can't be charged for that, right? It didn't happen.

Wrong, the appealed got denied. Allegedly, by a ""jury of my peers"", heavily implied by PTS to me to be fellow students, but I sincerely doubt one of our own would fuck us over like that.

2822,"[TLDR](https://bettercape.com)

Hello! I know many of us are scrambling to pick out classes last minute to round out their course-load for the beginning of Fall quarter. To help with this process, I have built a tool to help us make more informed decisions about the courses and professors we choose, by taking advantage of the thousands of student-submitted CAPEs. This tool was developed to better organize the data provided on [cape.ucsd.edu](https://cape.ucsd.edu). The following is a few features to justify the project's name, [BetterCape.com](https://BetterCape.com):

&amp;#x200B;

* Aggregate data -- Combines all similar courses a professor has taught to give a more complete overview of their class.

[For example, our good friend Gary has taught CSE 15L twenty seven times and over those twenty seven courses students have received an average grade of 3.26. Enrolling in a Gary course might be worth it with those stats :O](https://i.redd.it/2f4jzznd0lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Expand the aggregate data to get a breakdown of all courses.

[Clicking on a row in the table will bring up a modal showing all the courses that make up the aggregate data. Here, by clicking on the Gary row, we can see all of the twenty seven CSE15L courses he has taught, and the stats for each.](https://i.redd.it/pust17zs0lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Course grouping -- Whereas the order in which UCSD displays the CAPE data is sorted by quarter and lexicographically (causing CSE 100 to come before CSE 11, for example), BetterCape groups courses together by their numeric course code ordering and orders by term within that. This makes searching through a whole department much more intuitive.

[Very readable, incredible.](https://i.redd.it/xarqc9c51lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Filters! A feature completely missing from traditional capes.

[Here we are searching for upper division courses in the CSE department, taught during the years 2017 up to and including 2019, with an average received GPA of at least 3.5.](https://i.redd.it/qt2tv7ii1lo31.png)

So yeah, if this looks like it would be useful to you, I would love to have you guys check it out. At the very least, I think it is a much cleaner version of UCSD's capes. I would love some feedback from you guys! If this is something I see people are actually using I would definitely like to expand it to do some more interesting analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if this is something you think would be interested in working in, especially for people who are more talented than I with UX / web design definitely lemme know! (Mobile in particular is garbage at the moment)

&amp;#x200B;

2856,"As the title says, I took the Fall 2019 semester off because of financial issues plaguing my life and my mental well-being. I am now in a more comfortable place that makes it seem like I will be able to attend classes again in 2020, which I'm incredibly hopeful for.

&amp;#x200B;

I took the semester off without talking to an advisor or anything (a mistake on my part, I know) and had to drop a class I was about to fail in Fall 2018, so my first plan is to talk to an advisor and see what my future class road map can look like. I will also be talking to financial aid, as dropping that class put me below the required hours mark for Bright Futures, and I certainly need that financial assistance if I'm going to attend classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a few semesters into a Journalism degree that I really don't want to complete (something that I've realized contributed to my anxiety and depression) so I will also be talking to my advisor about switching majors to something that will actually make me feel excited for college again.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole reason I wasted what little money I have on chocolate and face paint was not for ""attention."" If I wanted attention I'd do something a lot cheaper, like jumping off a building or getting hit by a bus.

The reason I bought those things--with personal money, mind you, not the group's--was to draw more people towards the movement. There are a lot of people who have no idea what's going on, all the American students see is a bunch of strangers yelling in a foreign language.

I figured, hey, *I* like chocolate, so therefore, other people must like chocolate too! So if people like chocolate, they're going to naturally be thrilled by *free* chocolate. I thought it would be a good way to pull people into the protest who would otherwise have no reason to get involved, and hopefully in doing so, teach them about the movement and get them on our side.

As for the face paint, I wanted a way for the protestors and protest supporters to express their beliefs without vandalizing the school. Posters can be torn down, and chalking is against the rules. But there's no rule against face paint, and you can't easily remove it from someone else.

Not only that, but posters can only be in certain stationary locations. You know what can go anywhere, though? All of *us*! We can wander around the school bearing the Hong Kong flower and words of support, and not only will people see it, but they'll have the opportunity to ask the painted person, ""hey, what's all this about?"" So they're not just *seeing* our support. They're interacting with us, and learning about Hong Kong!

I mean, I get where you're coming from. The protests have been bloody and it's not something to make light of. It's a serious subject, and the protestors deserve respect and recognition. Which is exactly why I'm trying to attract people towards the movement.

My hope is that when people see the painted faces tomorrow, they'll want to ask, ""hey, what does that flower symbolize?"" ""Hey, why does it look like your eye was shot out?"" ""Hey, what do those foreign symbols mean?""

Seventy Thousand American Dollars. This year broke the record for the most enrolled students at UCSD, and I think something along the lines of the most international students (don't quote me on this) or at least a very high percentage.

So why do we still lack basic shit like Wi-fi and parking?

When people complain about parking, there are always those who mention ""what's the big deal"", ""the walk isn't that bad"". And yeah, I agree that with walking for 30 mins and leaving early isn't too bad. It gives me a chance to exercise and listen to a podcast..if it were FREE. Paying $30,000 to be forced to park elsewhere, or pay even more to barely find spots is worth complaining about. I get some of you guys are looking this as a half glass full kinda situation, but I don't think some of you realize how much $30,000 is. If everyone becomes content with this, we'll soon pay $45,000 to walk and listen to a podcast.

Anyway, where are all our funds going? Is there no possible way to see how much of our budget is going towards A and B, etc?

This might be a dumb question but I really am curious: why can't we vote on things like this? I feel what we can vote on are pretty irrelevant for the most part. 

It's not like we're asking for valet parking for each student either. Just a paved lot with some paint on it. And whatever it takes to make wifi better? What are you supposed to do to fix the wifi problem? How much would it cost?

I don't want to miss it, that's why I am desperately posting here. Plus, I also don't want anyone (poor SDE job seeker) like me to miss this deal.

I am planning on applying to Stanford, UPenn, and UChicago next year and doing econ and stats as a double major, but I had a few questions. 

1) Is econ and stats in Liberal Arts and Sciences or is it in the business school? Are there even specific business undergrad majors? If there are, is taking a specific business major like finance or marketing just as good as econ and stats if I want to get an MBA and eventually a management role, or is it too limiting?

2) How hard is an econ and stats double major? I know that prestigious schools are really hard, and I wanted to know if stanford is the same or if it is relatively easy to the other prestigious schools.

3) Is econ and stats going to help me find a consulting internship out of college and eventually help me get an MBA?

4) How much calculus would be needed for this double degree? I stopped after Calc BC and I am only taking Comp Sci as my math in senior year because I don't want to do Calc 3.

3141,"Hello!

I’m currently a junior in high school, and I’ve found myself intrigued by the Music Composition major offered at NYU.

Would my GPA and ACT score necessarily matter as much as it would with other schools when applying for music comp? My GPA isn’t bad by any means, but I’m just curious how these two things would play out when applying.

I also noticed that one of the audition requirements were “Three or four scores of original works in different instrumentation and style”. What exactly are they looking for? Is different instrumentation required for each score? Being a band kid, I’ve composed mainly wind ensemble compositions and arrangements.

Additionally, what should I look out for in general as someone who wishes to apply to this program?

One of us was stopped on ring road around 5pm, One of us on the bridge to UTC around 930pm, and another in UTC around 8pm.

I am interested in NYUs MBA/MSc Biology Dual Degree program. I have searched on LinkedIn for someone who is/was in the program, but to no avail. I am a mid-twenties biotech professional working out of SoCal, however I do not have much ""business"" experience. 

Here are some of my questions:

\- How did the MBA/MSc prepare you for a job in the biotech field? Where were you before the program and where are you after? (or currently)

\- Was there much overlap between the two programs? Did any of your classes cover the intersection of science and business? (such as bioentrepreneurship)

\- What are the advantages/disadvantages of the dual degree program vs. a singular program such as Keck Graduate School's Masters in Business and Science degree?

\- Did the MSc Biology intefere with the MBA events/extracurriculars? (Job fairs, networking events, etc.)

3298,"Hi, I'm a first year HTS student. Aside from that, I've had an ongoing issue of being unmotivated and finding or doing schoolwork or studying pointless. I can even remember doing this in elementary school with the easiest of projects, and procrastinating on a small 3 sentence summary on a book chapter until the day it was due. I just didn't see why I should care other than needing to get good grades to eventually make good money. I am relatively smart. When I study, I usually understand things pretty easily. But, for years I have only really joined harder programs and courses or pushed myself to be academically ""successful"" or try to be the top percent in anything I do because I feel that if I don't I'm a failure. I don't know what I want to do and feel lost. I feel like if I don't find a career I want to go towards soon, I will have no opportunity to feel motivated based off of enjoying my future. I'm afraid that I will continue to live like this, working hard to be the best or trying to survive vs doing it because I like it. I have learned to be a Jack of all trades, but lover of none. Even when I do find something I might enjoy, I think to myself ""can I actually make money off of this? Will I be struggling financially like my parents and the people around me forever?"" I can most definitely blame this stupid school system in the US and that's likely found globally, but I think it's best to conform for now as I always have. I just want to know for sure that I'll have stability, but that desire for stability and success is being driven without an actual road to drive on. I've been free falling off a cliff with no bottom I feel like for years now. No, I'm not suicidal. I'm stuck in that annoying ""I don't want to be here in this state anymore, but I don't want to die either"". I just want to be a better me at least if I can't find a better setting. I should just go see my therapist again. I feel like I'll soon relapse into that state of utter uck. I just want a sense of direction and motivation. What should I do?

TLDR What can I do to stop being a lazy mofo and achieve a sense of direction and motivation to do my work and figure out what to do with my life?

Hi!! I am applying ED to the Cornell hospitality school, and have terrific essays, recommendations, interviews (I had two), tours, and shadowed two classes at the school.

Lower stats are found at the hospitality school. I am currently applying with a 1350 SAT (with no subject tests), but hours upon hours upon working and volunteering experience. I also have a 3.6 GPA. My grades are A’s and B’s, and I am currently taking 3 AP classes: APES, AP Chemistry, and AP Calculus BC. I am on the Dean’s List for my high school, and was given an honor roll.

In addition, I have a recommendation from my company’s I work with, a CEO, a social media manager (for the hotel companies), and from a Cornell alumni.

3348,"&gt;I meet with Summit on a monthly basis to discuss resident issues.  We are keeping a log here in the office and only can make them aware when I am aware there are outages on the property. We are under a contract with them in which we have for two more years.  I am working closely with my supervisors to note all issues to ensure Summit is meeting their obligations of the contract.   Unfortunately, I cannot account for outages that are beyond our property limits.  I forwarded Summit’s notice of planned maintenance as it was provided to me from Summit.  You are correct as it only stated “Video Services” and not internet.  I also voiced my concern with the company that the majority of my residents are students and they are in finals.  As of this morning, you have been the only person to report an outage with the internet.  This could be due to us just opening and residents haven’t made their way into the office yet.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our package lockers are a new system that we just incorporated this past August.  We purchased the amount of lockers that the company stated we needed for the size of the community and number of residents we have. We are closely monitoring the system to determine if in the future, we do need to purchase more.  The emails that we send out is to promote quick turnaround of package pickup to help make room for others to be delivered in a timely manner.  The leasing office staff has been accepting packages for overages and we put them in the lockers as soon as there is availability.  This is also the most busiest time of the year for package delivery. Unfortunately, the system does run off of the internet, so if there are any outages, the lockers cannot be loaded; you are only able to pick- up packages.  This is another reason why we are keeping track of the Summit outages.

and showed science/mathematics ends in meaninglessness

1)Mathematics/science ends in contradiction:an integer=a non-integer

Mathematics ends in contradiction:6 examples

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/MATHEMATICS.pdf

3) biology is not a science

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/Bbiology-is-not-a-science.pdf

3) biologists dont know what a species is-thus theory of evolution is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense",1,LABEL_1,0.99976015,0.00023984665,0.99976015

Math builds on itself so much I'm not sure I have the time to try and get caught up. The W would also drop me to below full-time hours. 

This would be my third W though as I took 2 at a previous school. One was 1st year spring for a semester with 17 credits with 2 Lab Science courses during which my pet dog got cancer and died. I dropped an unneeded for my major Bio class. The other was 2nd year spring I dropped Multi because while I was doing fine it was an hour and in traffic hour and a half commute one way and I also had Chem, Phys 2, and Linear last Spring. I made an A on Multi on the retake. 

Am I screwing myself for job applications or grad school applications (MBA or Law) later down the line even with a 4 or hopefully still close to 4 G.P.A. ?

I for one had never worked with APIs because I've had no technical background prior to college and I never had a personal project, so it took me the longest time to understand what it is in the first place. This class teaches you a lot of practical skills beyond just the concepts. If you are scared of whether or not you should take this class, don't think twice. It's hard but it's VERY rewarding. It's one of the best classes to take to help you get a job imo (I'm not being a teacher's pet for peter alvaro. I barely spoke to the guy when I took it).

I got a 16/50 on the first midterm (including curve) and am usually getting a 3/10 on the quizzes. I’m very scared of failing because then I would not be on track to graduating. I have been going to tutoring sessions as well as trying to do the homework but I always seem to get the answers wrong. I’m a pretty good note taker and memorized all the trig functions so at this point I just feel very lost. My grade is heavily dependent on midterm 2 and chapters 3.8-3.10 are super confusing to me. I’ve been watching the organic chem YouTube videos as well so if y’all have any other studying suggestions please send them my way ;-; I know I am somehow studying ineffectively so anything helps. -Coming from a student who was never really good at math since middle school :(,1,LABEL_1,0.99987626,0.0001237614,0.99987626

I can’t afford to loose another quarter since I am a transfer. what should I do? do they save seats for people in situations like mine? is that why I can join the waitlist?

I think every school in the country can benefit from an esports program and I'd love to see one at UPenn. One of the biggest challenges for college administrations making the leap into esports is not knowing how many students really want an esports program. This program can include anything from a school funded club all the way to a varsity team that gives scholarships to its players. To address this challenge, I have started a survey that I'm hoping you guys would be willing to take. I'm trying to get this survey to as many schools as possible.

I am currently having trouble with my next semester schedule. To provide some background, a general counselor for my college told me that my AP credit can cover all of my breadth requirements (I've heard mixed things about this). This semester I was planning on taking Chem 32 because of my weak chemistry coursework in high school (not AP Chem), but due to some schedule changes I had to drop it. Now knowing its not offered in the spring semester, I am hesitant to take 1A but will be studying the topics on my own. 

I am still not sure how to complete my 2nd semester schedule considering I am done with breadths (?). So far, I'm thinking Math 16B for sure, along with Chem 1A **or** Math 16B and Stats 20.

After reading their website I just found out that CLEP credit and online courses do not transfer.

I've CLEP'd 3 classes (Sociology, American Lit, Brit Lit) and I've taken 3 online classes so far (Hist 2111, POLS 1101, Phys 2 w/lab).

I just wanna know how fucked I am. Does credit transfer work differently for students applying through the REPP?

Some people are saying ""they can't tell if classes are online"" and ""if it fulfills the degree requirement at your current school then that's good enough.""

What happens if they don't transfer? Will I have to retake the classes at tech?

I'm looking for other REPP students who may have also taken online/CLEP courses. How did your credits transfer?",1,LABEL_1,0.99982435,0.00017570033,0.99982435

Chem Bio major here. So I’ve been doing CS as a hobby since I was like 9 years old, and programming is one of my favorite pastimes and I’d consider myself to be pretty good at it.  I am considering minoring in CS, but not if it’ll leave me with no time to take the classes I wouldn’t have the opportunity to learn about otherwise. (You can easily learn CS online, but not Drugs and The Brain for example).

So I’m concerned because adding 61A would bring my unit schedule up to 19 units, which for a lazy guy like me seems like a lot. 

For somebody with ~8-9 years of CS experience, how easy would CS61A be? Is attendance in lecture mandatory? Can somebody provide me examples of projects/homework y’all gotta do so I can get an idea of whether or not I could breeze through it?

I just found out that the OChem series I had taken at a different college will only count as CHE 118A here in Davis.

The newfound freedom, the constant state of being surrounded by people, the way all the freshmen around me were so eager to make friends and have new experiences---I gained so much confidence and felt that this was really the beginning of the better part of my life. 

It was a slow and gradual buildup, but second year rolls around and I can feel the real anxieties taking over. I'm constantly thinking of how I don't have the professional or research experience to get the cs experience that I want. I really do love programming, but I'm struggling a lot in my current cs course. I know it's always hard to get your foot in the door for this kind of career, and I know I shouldn't compare myself to other people, but seeing my peers doing amazing work and having a great time with their clubs puts a small ache in me because I'm afraid I'll never have that. 

It feels like I'm always playing catch-up, chasing deadline after deadline, but nothing good is coming out of it. I cant find the time or motivation to do the personal projects I want to do, or apply for research that interests me. Every moment that I spend talking to friends or exercising or just laying still, there's always an unsettling guilt sitting in my chest. It's scary because every thought that runs through my head now is sprinkled with anxiety and guilt, and I really don't want that. I just want a chance to pause everything for a second and catch my breath, renew my perspective, but deadlines are still deadlines and time passed is still time passed.

3797,"Title. I'm a CompE transfer student looking to declare a CS minor. My previous institution offered a 4 hour CS 1302, which transferred to Tech as CS 1316 + a spare credit hour elective. While looking into exactly what CS 1316 satisfies I stumbled across [this PowerPoint](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2009/cs1316_summer/presentations/CS1316-where_it_fits.pdf) claiming that ""A student with strong performance in CS 1316
can jump directly to CS 1332."" I passed my CS 1302 with a (high) A.

&amp;nbsp;

The PowerPoint is apparently quite old and I can't find that info corroborated anywhere else. I'm not certain if this is still valid (or that it ever was). I'm emailing the CS minor advisors tonight to ask for certain, but I figure I might as well check here as well since the advisors will likely be out of the office for the weekend already.

&amp;nbsp;

If a high grade in 1316 _doesn't_ let you exempt 1331, would it be worth it to try to get my transfer credit re-evaluated?",1,LABEL_1,0.9997563,0.0002437701,0.9997563

No problem, this building is equipped with the finest cuisines available in vending machine form. I exit my study nest and head towards the nearest snack dispensary. I arrive at my destination and see a plethora of nourishment. Being a degenerate I swipe my credit card and enter A6 for a bag of dusty cheezy Doritos.

This way I can dislodge the first bag while getting a second bag of chips in the process. More chips equal less hungry. I swipe my card again and enter A6. I see the spiral mechanism turning and my anticipation grows. The first bag gets dislodged and falls to its inevitable consumption. My eyes glow with excitement, my mouth watering at the thought of tasting them perfectly nacho blasted tortilla chips.

3816,"I just got accepted to Columbia as an early decision applicant, but the financial aid package that I’ve received severely threatens my ability to attend. 

Context: My parents are divorced, and I live with my mother more than 50% of the time. In cooperation with Columbia’s financial aid procedure, my mother filled out the FAFSA and my father filled out the CSS Non-Custodial Parent Profile. My mother made it clear from the beginning that she isn’t able to pay anything for my college education. She completed the FAFSA in hopes that we would qualify for grants. 

Due to my father’s income, Columbia did not give us any sort of aid, meaning that my dad and I would have to pay the full $80,000 per year. The problem is that, despite his income on paper, my father isn’t by any means capable of paying that kind of money. He financially supports his unemployed wife, my brother who is also in college, his mother, my mother, and his extended family. My father may be the most affluent person in my family, but we do not have generational wealth. He has people to take care of and bills to pay, not to mention that he is old and thinking about retirement. 

My question to y’all is, is there any possibility of me qualifying for aid? I haven’t formally appealed my financial aid package, and to be completely transparent, I’m ignorant to the logistics of the process. Is my situation even legitimate in the eyes of Columbia? 

ANY ideas, suggestions, or explanations would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to ask clarification questions as well. Columbia is my dream school and somehow I got accepted.

It's okay to approach at your own pace, no one will force you; we're happy you're here.  
**Remember:** We're here to make friends, it's wise to avoid hot topics. We all come from different backgrounds and hold different perspectives, they're all valid, let's respect that. Let's be a positive and welcoming environment.

**WHERE/WHEN UPDATE:**   
***When***: 4pm, Sunday, October 20th. After looking through all the comments on the original post I saw that Sunday late-afternoon would be a more fitting time.   
***Where***: E-Street Plaza. Due to so much interest we are moving the meetup spot to the E-Street Plaza. This location is very public/open and will allow us to make plans by ear and find what can accommodate us best. E-Street Plaza is in downtown Davis and has Baskin-Robins, Taqueria El Burrito, and is across from De'Veres Irish Pub. [https://goo.gl/maps/6LCXL1uF4EnScSxi8](https://goo.gl/maps/6LCXL1uF4EnScSxi8)

I did pretty bad on both midterms, and  now I’m on track for a B-/B. Although a B is an ok grade imo, I am very stressed because I am planning to apply to the 5th year CS  Masters programs (so 170 is important for application purposes) and I strongly dislike all the material in 170. Specifically, I get really really bored and stressed out when reading 170 notes/watching lectures. Tbh, I feel like I’m just learning a bunch of theory that I won’t realy use (I know DP/LP/etc are often tested during coding interviews may be tested during interviews, but I still feel like 170 goes way too deep). **I also studied my ass off for both midterms, but still scored \~0.5-1 std below avg.**

I have a late drop form available, should I P/NP, drop the class, or continue taking it? To provide more context, I am currently also taking Data 100 and 61c, and am on track for A’s in those classes. I have also taken 2 other upper divs in prior semesters and received A-/A’s in them.

I called my sister (an EECS grad) for advice, and she is adamant that I should continue with 170 even it hurts my GPA. She also mentioned that theres only a few weeks left so I might as well just finish it. However, I don’t think my sister understands how much I dislike the class and how stressful it will be for me to study for the final. Please anyone have advice?

4006,"Hello, Reddit! /u/michaeldirda from the campus public affairs office here. With /u/lulzcakes‘s support we’re bringing back UC Berkeley’s chancellor, Carol Christ, for another Ask Me Anything session this week. We hosted an AMA with the chancellor [for the first time last October](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/), and she loved the format and the opportunity to field so many questions from the campus. 

Some brief background about Chancellor Christ: She first came to Berkeley just shy of fifty years ago to serve as a professor of English, and aside from a stint as president of Smith College from 2002 to 2013 has spent her whole career here. She was appointed Berkeley’s first female chancellor in 2017, and since then has worked extremely hard to fix the campus’ budget, develop a ten-year strategic plan for the campus, address the housing shortage, build community and improve the campus climate for people of all backgrounds, and more. You can learn more about her [on the chancellor’s web site](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellor-christ/biography).

I’m starting this thread now so you can think of questions and start voting on them, and she’ll begin answering on **Wednesday, September 25th at 4 p.m.**

As with last time, I'm just here to help the chancellor navigate Reddit’s non-intuitive interface; she’ll be responding to all questions herself. She says she’ll be happy to talk about whatever the community is interested in, though if there are areas that she does not know well enough she might ask me to circle back on a question if she doesn’t feel that she can fully answer it. 

Thanks so much and ask away!

4088,"\##My purpose for writing post is to try to prevent what happened to Antonio from happening to anyone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will reference this article for the purposes of this post, seeing as it's the first article that comes up on google search.

[https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/](https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/)

The article states the following, which is the same information as most other articles on the matter: 

\&gt; The night before he vanished, the college freshman had dinner with his mother, then went to a frat event, [the Miami Herald reported](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/coconut-grove/article236702618.html).

\&gt; He was last seen leaving the Phi Kappa Psi house around 9:30 p.m. but had not been heard from after the gathering, police said.

\&gt; Campus police reported that they found his body Saturday afternoon at the base of Fall Creek gorge.

&amp;#x200B;

Notice the second sentence I quoted, which states he was last seen leaving the Phi Kappa Psi house. 

\#The missing detail is that the frat event was a dirty rush event being held at the nearby City of Ithaca Cemetery, not the Phi Kappa Psi House. He was most likely not last seen as the Phi Kappa Psi house, but rather at the cemetery at the frat event.

[Note that the cemetery is right by Phi Kappa Psi](https://preview.redd.it/nxqfjvd5pdv31.png?width=1522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74850aad7642c61790e251314bd5aeedf4080303)

I do not have hard evidence to convince anyone of this, but I learned that these were the true circumstances of that frat event by word of mouth. I am not absolutely sure that my claims are correct, but since I believe there is a possibility they are correct, it is worthwhile to explore them, since perhaps we will uncover the truth about the incident, and learn how to prevent this from happening. If this incident did partly stem from a frat holding a dirty rush event at the cemetery, then I hope we learn from this and work to eliminate those events to any degree.  

I hope you talk about this post to me, to your friends, to anyone else. I hope we create conversation about this and work to get to the bottom of this tragedy. I hope the frat faces chooses to be punished for what might have been a terrible choice of event, so that all frats and the university can learn to never host events like that again. I hope there is a change made so that this does not happen again. 

If anyone has any supporting details or questions, please comment below. Thank you.",1,LABEL_1,0.9992898,0.0007101562,0.9992898

I feel kind of lost when it comes to scheduling. I’m new to this whole college game and having classses at odd times instead of regular times.

During the week, it feels like I do get work done, but still don’t make the most out of my time. I feel kind of lost and feel like I’m not even making the most use of my time. I feel like this might bite me back later during midterms and or finals. At times, I don’t even feel like doing any work at all, so I’ll just put it off and do it later ( not so great)

I planned on retaking it next quarter, but I’m not sure how long it takes grades to come out, and I have to change majors by spring quarter I believe. I’m afraid I won’t be able to change majors by then because I either fuck up Math 2B again or the grade won’t appear until later on.

4103,"How the fuck are we supposed to connect an Xbox One to the wifi. 

I tried in August connecting mine wirelessly to the NYU network. It kept giving me a bunch of different error codes saying it couldn't connect even after I registered it online. I don't remember the exact codes but it said stuff about not being able to connect to the network and something about the DHCP server. I emailed IT and they told me Xboxes couldn't connect wirelessly because of something either with the device or with NYU wifi restrictions - I don't remember their exact wording. 

IT told me I needed an Ethernet cable, which I wasn't able to set up until today. I connected the Ethernet cable and when I go to Xbox network settings it says that I have a wired connection. But it won't let me use the network at all. If I try to login to my account it says ""you need Internet to do this."" When I go to ""test network connection"" it says that I need to authenticate my device or something to join this network (note that this is a different error code than the one I received when trying to connect wirelessly). When I click ""authenticate"" it takes me to the nyu-media device registration site. I go through the entire process of putting the information in and it will say it's registered, but still never connect. It just says at the bottom of the screen ""this page will close once you are connected."" However it never closes, no matter how long I wait. Restarting doesn't help even after I've registered the device and waited several minutes. I am able to connect my wifi to my phone's hotspot so I'm fairly confident the issue is not with my XBOX, and instead is something with the NYU network.

Most (BUT NOT ALL AND IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T GET ONE) applicants will have an interview anytime between now and the end of November. 

Feel free to ask specific questions to people here (and check out previous threads below), there are multiple alumni interviewers that are active on this sub (including me). The best advice I can give is to be prepared, speak your truth, be an advocate for yourself (the interview is NOT the time to be humble), and try to have a relaxing, comfortable conversation about your strengths and experiences. Also, definitely research things about Penn that you can specifically reference to when explaining why you want to come to Penn. Also don't google your interviewer. It's super weird when you do this.

That's pretty much all there is to it. BUT if you are freaking out a bit, here's some other information that may be helpful:

QUESTIONS YOU MAY GET/MIGHT WANT TO HAVE ANSWERS TO

Recommended questions for interviewers:

Note: You shouldn't memorize any answers to these questions. They should come naturally. It's helpful to prepare to make sure you hit on a few key points you want to get across, but if you sound like a robot, it won't look good. These are just RECOMMENDED questions, so you aren't guaranteed to get any of them (In fact, many interviewers don't know this lists exists and won't use any of these questions). During my interviews, I usually start off with a few questions that I want to make sure I get, but the conversation that follows usually comes natural (i.e., I ask follow up questions that relate to what the applicant says).

*General introduction*

Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?

How would your friends describe you?

What experiences have you had with people who are different from you?

What would you like the Admissions office to know that might not appear in your application?

*Academic and Personal interests*

What do you most like learning about?

How do you learn best?

What is your favorite part of your school experience?

What topics or assignments have you found particularly intriguing?

Is there anything that you would change about your high school experience?

How do you spend your time when you're not in school?

What's the biggest challenge you've overcome?

*What would this student be like at Penn?*

Why Penn? How did you first hear about Penn?

What draws you to the undergraduate school/program to which you’ve applied?

What on-campus opportunities are you most excited about?

*Share your Penn experience*

What questions do you have?

Is there anything you’d like to tell me that I haven’t asked you about?

4133,"Hey guys,

I’ve been feeling a little worse for wear this midterm season for a couple of reasons and I wanted to know your thoughts / advice on my current situation. 


Basically what’s been fucking me up most is that I received a bad grade in one class my freshman fall semester and it absolutely destroyed my cumulative GPA. The class was in a subject (stem) not at all related to my major (humanities-oriented) if that’s important . I’m a sophomore in CC currently and I’m trying really hard in my classes this semester so I can nudge that number a little higher, but it seems hopeless at times because after two semesters I’m sitting at just below a 3.0. Honestly this has been killing my confidence and I haven’t told a single person except my mom about it (love you mom) because I’m just super embarrassed about it. Sometimes, albeit rarely, people will joke with condescension about how they know someone with a 2 point something GPA and I’ll just be chilling there like *yeah haha that’s rough hahaha* but on the inside I definitely shrivel a little. 

I’ve been trying to hype myself up through the reassurance that if I get stellar grades for the rest of college I’ll show an “upward trend” which will indicate growth and ability to learn from mistakes. This is actually pretty much what happened in HS for me (got meh grades freshman year and straight A’s junior year), but from a career / grad school standpoint I can’t help but stress. I know for certain fields like finance they won’t even look at your GPA if it’s below a certain cutoff, but to what extent are there exceptions to this via networking, professional/research experience and the like? And how does this vary among competitive fields? I’m feeling the same semi-desperation when it comes to grad school, specifically law. 

Coupled with this is the fact that I feel like an absolute retard in 1004 Java compared to the others in the class. I generally haven’t experienced imposter syndrome since I’ve been here but it seems like the class is easy for most people while I’m having a hard time understanding what are pretty abstract concepts defined using a ton of terminology I’ve never heard before, especially since I came into the knowing literally nothing about computers except how to use Windows XP and Office 2010 (deadass. on my Mac I can use the internet and that’s about it) It gets hard not to psych yourself out and have spiraling thoughts along the lines of *dang seas and stem kids are way smarter than me and a stem degree probably seems way more impressive than a humanities one so I should switch my major to stem to be more eye-catching to employers even if its at the expense of enjoying school* ... especially since I was pretty good at math and whatnot in HS but I just do not shape up to the level of talent in STEM here.

All in all I definitely just needed to throw a pity party for myself and I don’t think like this always, but these thoughts are still frequent enough to give me a hard time.  

TL;DR: Have just below a 3.0 GPA after two semesters in CC. Feeling dejected and nervous about my future. How important / unimportant is one’s GPA in the grand scheme of things? And do people really find Java easy on the first go?",1,LABEL_1,0.99988335,0.00011667809,0.99988335

I also have an internship lined up that’s 15-20 hours per week, so I need my classes on 2-3 days. I’m also a commuter. Is Econ 101, mgmt 1B, and a GE too hard on top of an internship? I’m kinda out of options because I only need 1 more GE. I also need 1 quarter of French, but it’s MWF so right now that’s not an option.

I’m a little borderline, and probably need a B+ (maybe B in 1B) in both classes to get into business Econ. Also, I took Woo for 1A and I know ravetch is impossible and way too much work. 

I think I can go to whatever discussion I want for 101, and since it’s a new prof I assume it won’t fill up. So I think I’ll use my second pass on that.

I took a semester of Intermediate French II at my previous university, but I was told I would still have to take a placement test to determine what class to take at NYU.

4294,"Definitely taking 126, 127, breadth, reader (13 units), but was wondering whether to add 188 or 110 on top of this.
 
Reasons for 188: I likely want to do ML stuff in the future and really really wanna get started in AI stuff, which is why I wanted to add 188. Maybe will do some fast.ai this break. (Is this relevant for 188?) One point of caution though is that I want to get an A+ to maybe get into BAIR in the future, which may be harder considering this schedule.
 
Reasons for 110: Due to time conflict with breadth I will not be able to attend 188 lecture at all. Also I am self studying Axler (linear algebra done right textbook) over break for fun and I feel like I might as well take 110 to get credit for that as well (Is there strong overlap?)
 
Reasons for another breadth instead: Want to bump my GPA up a little bit and less work. I don't wanna push myself too hard though because last semester I struggled with 61c and 170. Did p well in the classes but found myself working way harder than I thought I would. However this might be because I am bad at project classes and significantly better at math classes, which is better for this intended schedule. Overall, I don't want to work more than 10 hours a day (ideally much less) for the sake of my mental health. In this case, then I will take 188 + 189 + 110 in fall instead of 189 + 188/110, both along with recruiting.

Does the Graduate Record Examination primarily benefit rich white men, or level the playing field for less privileged students to compete for admissions slots?

The University of Pennsylvania’s philosophy doctoral program is taking the first view, ditching the GRE not only as an admissions requirement but also promising to ignore GRE scores if applicants provide them.

In a statement shared on the philosophy blog [***Leiter Reports***](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2018/09/penn-philosophy-will-not-require-gre-for-phd-applicants-this-year.html), Chair Michael Weisberg said the decision to blacklist the GRE was “unanimous” in the department.

Not only does the requirement harm low-income applicants and offer “unfair advantages” to applicants of means – namely, score review and test prep services for extra fees – but women and “underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities” fare more poorly on the GRE, Weisberg claimed.

I am a graduate PhD student in the Hotel School and witnessed an assault by Ankur Mulji on an undergrad last night.

Ankur approached an undergraduate student and harassed the individual with threats on a sidewalk as the undergraduate student was waiting for the bus, and continuously stating that the individual ""does not belong at Cornell because he/she is an undergraduate student"". Ankur also continued his verbal assault, stating that ""undergraduates are scum and do not have any jobs when they graduate Cornell"" and other racial slurs directed towards the student's home country, and that he himself is part of the ""prestigious Baker Program, and will make sure the [undergraduate student] will have an awful time at Cornell"". Ankur then continued to attempt to physically intimidate the undergraduate student by standing right against the student's physical body, physically slapping the undergraduate student's chest, and stated that he will follow the student onto the bus when the student explicitly told Ankur ""to get away"". Ankur only stopped when the student stated that he/she will call the police if the behavior does not stop, and Ankur walked away saying that ""[the student] made a mistake, and he (Ankur) will be seeing the student real soon"". All of these assaults and threats were because the undergraduate student was merely waiting for a night time bus on the sidewalk, as Ankur pushed past the student, only to turn around to tell the student to ""move the fuck off the sidewalk"".

This conduct by a graduate student clearly indicates a distinct pattern from Ankur of hatred towards undergraduate students, which is completely unacceptable as Cornell now host nearly 15,000 undergraduate students during the school year. The physical and verbal threats for harm is completely unacceptable from graduate students, especially as they are often times a lot older and stronger than undergraduates that just entered college. I also believe Cornell shouldn't allow this type of behavior at all from graduate students or permit the acceptance and existence of these types of graduate students, whom do not intend to ""share"" the campus with undergraduates, as this erodes from the ""Cornell Community"" that we all sought to build here on campus. This feeling of graduate superiority, egotism, and hate should not exist on our campus, to the point of nearly a hate crime, as it specifically targets undergraduate students.",1,LABEL_1,0.9998762,0.0001237473,0.9998762

I'm currently attending my first semester at UCF and an advisor told me that portfolio reviews for Graphic Design BFA is next semester around February. I'm currently taking Drawing Fundamentals 1, Intro to Computer Art, and Design Fundamentals 3D. She said I could participate in portfolio review next semester, but I want to know what are some things I should include in my portfolio review.

I'm a transfer student, but the projects i have made in the past are of really poor quality and I need to make new pieces this semester if i'm going to be accepted. I'm not the best at drawing but I want to do my best and get accepted so I won't have to wait a whole new year to attempt it again if i end up not getting accepted.

Also, I want to practice drawing the human figure since alot of posts i've read so far really push that but since i won't be taking Drawing 2 until next semester i want to practice it before, any advice? Should i practice drawing figures from photos?

2. If you worked in multiple states, you must pay taxes based on where you worked. In RARE occasions, you may also have to pay taxes based on where you lived.
3. You may only claim yourself as a dependent if no one else can. Figure this out with your parents.
4. If you are an immigrant and by some miracle (praise God) got a job in the US, you must pay US taxes.
5. Room and Board are generally not eligible for deductions and credits like Tuition and Fees.
6. The American Opportunity Tax Credit is a Godsend. Claim it if you can, and make sure you are eligible. It goes up to 2500 dollars in tax credits.
7. You can only receive the American Opportunity Tax Credit for four years of post-high school. It is a credit not a deduction meaning that it reduces tax burden, not taxable income.
8. As a Graduate student, you may be eligible for the Lifetime Opportunity Tax Credit. If you started Grad school in the fall of your fourth year, you may still be eligible for the American Opportunity Tax Credit. The American Opportunity Tax Credit can provide a refund of up to 1000 in some circumstances and is usually the better bet if you can take it if you don't earn much income.
9. Keep your T1098. Forward to your parents if necessary.
10. Keep track of unreimbursed Medical expenses and be sure to deduct them if they are eligible.
11. Fellowships are income if they surpass eligible expenses. Make sure to keep tabs on Fellowships earned and have enough to potentially pay taxes on them.
12. You may be required to fill out a paper form for special tax purposes (Like working in multiple states.)
13. The American Opportunity Tax credit cannot be used for expenses not required by the institute, but the Lifetime Opportunity Tax Credit can. Keep track of books you buy even if not for school.
14. Georgia Tech REQUIRES a computer as a condition of enrollment according to the student handbook. This means that a computer does qualify as an expense for the purposes of the American Opportunity Tax Credit as the university require it.
15. If you worked as a waitress, waiter, or contractor, your tips or payments ARE income and you may have to pay taxes based on what you earned. You likely won't get a refund in this situation and may end up owing.
16. If you have any investments or a interest bearing money market or sweep accounts, you may be required to pay taxes on capital gains or dividends regardless of whether you took money out. In the future, consider a Roth IRA.
17. Cryptocurrency gains are taxable. Consult Turbotax for more on this one and as always HODL. 
18. It's better to hire an accountant than to go to jail. Be especially cognizant if you started a small business this year.
19. Being married changes the tax rules, keep this in mind if you got married (Congrats!)
20. If your employer is paying for part of your tuition, this will decrease eligibility for credits.
21. If you are an older student with a low income and fit certain rules, you may be eligible for the earned income tax credit. Ask Turbotax.
22. I think that's it. Correct me or ask questions if you have them.
23. THwG and congrats on finals. Thanks for reading.

I'm taking EE16B next semester, but my worry is that because this wasn't a pure Maths course the Math 54 kids will have a better understanding of Linear Algebra than I do.

Because of this, would it be a good idea to take Math54 and EE16b concurrently next semester, or is it just a waste of a class?

Instead of that option, would perhaps taking Math110 in my sophomore or junior year be perhaps a better idea? Can EE16AB satisfy the Math 54 prerequisite for this class?

I first thought of applying to Tandon for Electrical Eng. program. However, after all the negative feedback regarding campus life, academics, campus conditions and Tandon as a whole, I am afraid I won’t really enjoy my stay in Tandon.

So, I thought it would be a better idea to apply for CAS Mathematics. It’s Stern, so, supposedly, campus experience and quality of education will be better, especially campus life, considering it is the main campus of NYU. 

Yet again, with my SAT(1490) and GPA 3.9 UW I would have a better shot at Tandon. Also, considering how competitive Stern is, I might even get straight up rejection for CAS.

4463,"Admins are laughing at us all blame the exam scheduling crisis on the student assembly, most of whom graduated before the schedule changes went into full effect. Only a bunch of fools would let the students make any sort of meaningful decision (schedule, admin fees, etc.) by fools like the students. It is far too likely that the SA is a scapegoat organization that can be used to push these agendas without any backlash – they can just point back at the student body and say that we elected the SA. 

Even if there was a ""real"" vote on such decisions, there had to have been influence (direct or indirect) from the administration. Most people already are aware of the fishy circumstances regarding elections here, as we can recall candidates in the past being disqualified for reasons that to this day remain ambiguous. If I were a betting person (I'm not), I would place a good deal of cash on designating student elections as bullshit as the student assembly's role in making legitimate decisions. Remember when free printing began in October? Me neither. 

That's because the school realized it *cost money*, so rather than directly saying ""no"" after an approval was prematurely made, the administration launched a succession of committees, meetings, and other bureaucratic requirements designed to do nothing but slow the process down. Just wait until next semester, when it gets delayed again.

There are actually a fair number of probable ulterior reasons for a final exam schedule change (such as higher internship/job ranking, etc). Some bad ones are related to rush week, and reducing (HA!) the stress the final exam period puts the students. In fact, just about every other shit reason like this is listed in the well-known decision report, which is but another sad byproduct of the business-like, bureaucratic-based system that this place has running. Over 100 page report of what? Whoever got paid to write that was probably giggling the whole time at how fucked things were going to turn out. 

If you were as infuriated as I was to get kicked out of the library at 12 the day before an exam, rather than say, ""fuck the SA, fuck gov majors, fuck the frats"" keep in mind who actually has control of such decisions. A truly student-supportive school would have looked a proposal to *take away study time* and prevented such an idiotic concept at all costs. So write a letter to the registrar or somebody like CEO Martha and ask, what in the fuck is going on?

4468,"Hey guys, 

I live off of Mcculloch and was wondering if it would make a huge difference in my life to bike to campus as opposed to taking the shuttle. 

The reason I’m considering a bike is because the last few days I have been late to my classes and penalized for the bus being extremely late. Today tops it, I left for my 9am class and waited for the shuttle from 8am until about 8:56 when it showed up. I was extremely late to class and my grade went from a 100% to a 40%. Yesterday I was late for an event and lost a spot that was pretty important to me for me, even though I left early.

This entire class really has been a team effort, from piggybacking off of each other's questions in office hours, to the lecture questions, and especially to the CO-OPs. The final for this class is frankly just one big annoyance at this point. So I say, let's keep that same energy going into the final, and let's collectively agree to make the mean really, really abysmally low. Like, I'm talking lower than your chances of getting that internship at Goldman or SpaceX, lower than your GPA, lower than your self esteem. To the tryhards/kids to whom electromagnetism just comes naturally, good for you, guys, but on the final, please just take one for the team and write down ""Jσε"" for every question, and maybe whatever poor unsuspecting TA grades your questions will have the particular misfortune of writing ""joe who?"" on your test. If you're not into that, you could always just do the test to the best of your ability, then do what you do for the Learning Catalytics in lecture and simply raise all your answers to the zero power at the end of the test.

The means for the prelims were both pretty low, the class is curved to a B+, we get 3 problem sets dropped, and it's really just not worth it to study at this point... I think we can all agree that this is the best move for everyone involved.

Hey Anteaters, I’m starting a Yang Gang at UCI in collaboration with the Orange County Yang Gang and we’re looking for motivated students who want to spread the Yang 2020 campaign on campus. Our primary activities will include: tabling, canvassing, fundraising, registering voters, and posting flyers. If you’re in the Yang Gang already I shouldn’t need to convince you any further, so sign up now and we’ll send you more details shortly. DM me if you want to be extra-involved and help run the club, because we definitely need people like you! (also don’t forget to join /r/YangforPresidentHQ)

Never heard of Andrew Yang? Put simply, he’s the Asian man running for president who wants to give every American adult $1000 a month. It sounds almost too good to be true, but it’s surprisingly the best solution to eliminate poverty and prepare Americans for the future as automation &amp; globalization ramp up. He is competing for the Democratic nomination in a highly-contested primary race, and is currently between 4th-6th place depending on what metrics you look at. His 21st-century platform consists of over 100 policies, including:

* The “Freedom Dividend”: universal basic income of $1000/month for every American adult
* Medicare-for-All
* Student loan debt forgiveness
* Federal legalization of marijuana https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1170048318686318593
* Combating climate change
* Giving people property rights over their data
* Reducing cost of higher education
* Eliminating private prisons and reducing mass incarceration
* Much, much more at [https://www.yang2020.com/policies/](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/)

If that piqued your interest, sign up today or stop by the Yang 2020 booth on Ring Road on Thursday, October 17 to find out more. In the meantime, no one can convince you better than Andrew Yang himself, so listen to the first few minutes of his [Joe Rogan appearance](https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8) and hear why you deserve $1000 a month. Feel free to ask any questions below and I’ll be happy to answer them, whether it’s about the club or Yang’s policies ;)

1. It’s been a hot second since I took AP chem (senior year of high school), and my teacher was also shit. I taught all the material to myself and as a result it didn’t really stick in my mind afterwards. So, essentially, I don’t really remember anything.
2. I’ve heard some horror stories about 2070 and am worrying that I’ll be coming into 2080 woefully unprepared.

what math class should I take (I think I can skip up till math 240 since I know Linear Algebra and Differential equations)?

Professor 1) Their office hours where during my classes so I followed the advice listed on the syllabus and emailed them to schedule office hours outside of their normal ones. The first time I scheduled with them I waited outside their office and they never showed up, after emailing them to ask where they were they responded by saying they’d completely forgotten we’d made an appointment. The second time I scheduled to meet with them I again waited outside their office and when they didn’t show up I emailed them and they said they’d written down the wrong date in their planner and weren’t there and didn’t show up again. Afterward, we finally arranged to meet before class started, they walked in at 10:10 when class began at 10:20 and gave me the midterm I’d wanted to go over and told me to ask them if I had any questions, the whole experience felt rushed and was generally unhelpful as they tried to cram it in just before class began.

Professor 2) I again tried to arrange office hours outside of their normal ones because theirs were during times I had classes. We had arranged to meet before class time, at 9:15 when the class started at 9:35. I arrived at 9:15 and waited for them as they weren’t there yet, they strolled in at 9:25 and when I went up to the podium to ask them go over the quiz we’d recently taken (which I’d explained in our email exchange) they claimed we “didn’t have time before class.” This bothered me because they were the party that showed up late. Afterward he came up to me individually and claimed we’d never officially scheduled an appointment to meet before class. After going over our emails I’d had said to him “thank you, I’ll see you before class on Tuesday” so we definitely had made the appointment official. I emailed him a screenshot of the email we’re I had confirmed our appointment and asked if we could make another appointment before our next class, he never responded and the experience in class made me uncomfortable with going to him for help going forward.

4629,"Hey everyone!

We're the Undergraduate Business Association, a general business club open to all majors. Lately we've received a lot of questions about business econ, and seen quite a few on this sub too. We decided to compile some of the most frequently asked questions for future reference, since it can be surprisingly difficult to get a thorough answer for some of these. Let's get into it:

**What is the difference between business admin and business econ?**

Business econ (BE) has a much higher emphasis on economics than business admin (BA), and can generally be described as straight economics with a couple business topics mixed in. The BE coursework is about 75% econ and 25% business, while obviously the BA requirements are pretty much exclusively business courses. BE is slightly more math heavy and the general consensus is that it can be a little bit harder than BA, but it's still not too bad for most people. Also, BE is **not** technically part of the business school, and actually falls under the school of social sciences (important for major restrictions and academic advising).

**Should I transfer into business econ or business admin?**

BA is usually everyone's first choice, while BE is the backup. However, less than 10 people per *year* successfully transfer into BA, while BE is relatively easy to get. It is worth noting though that yes, **BE is a valid alternative for BA**, even if it is significantly different. We'll get into that in the next question.

**Does being a business econ major instead of a business admin major affect my career choices?**

For the most part, no. Job outcomes are about the same, most employers don't know the difference between the two majors or don't really care either way. You might get asked why you didn't ""choose"" business admin (even though that's usually everyone's first choice), but as long as you give a good answer about how you really enjoy the econ side of the business world you'll do fine. Either way though, internships are really important as both BA and BE majors in order to start a successful career after college.

**Will I still be able to network as a business econ major?**

Yes. You'll still be welcome in most if not all of the business organizations on campus, which is a great way to network and experience more about what the business world is. 

**Should I get a Merage school minor as a business econ major? I.e. management, accounting, or entrepreneurship**

It's a good idea. What most people don't know is that you don't actually have to apply for the minor in order to graduate with it; if you took the required classes then you get it regardless. Most of the time there are still some spots open when major restrictions lift on a business school class (also, upper div management courses that are online do not have major restrictions to begin with), so it's entirely possible to do. There's a lot of overlap in BE and BA minor classes as well, just make sure to take the business versions of courses whenever you can since often they fill requirements for both BE and the business minors (for example, MGMT 30A fills the accounting requirement for both while the econ version does not)

4669,"Hey guys, so I am in my **junior year** and I really need some advice on whether or not I should pursue CSE minor.

Background:

**Cog sci, neuroscience majo**r, and I was pre-med until this year where I realize I want to do research more (so grad school, Ph.D. kinda direction).

So as for now, I should be able to graduate a year or at least 2 quarters early.

Motivation:

So since I decided on the change of my career direction it gave me a lot more free time to take classes that I am more interested in.

The reason why I want to have a cs minor is because I want to have a better understanding and grasp on programming overall with the hope that it will further my career and maybe merge my passion in neuroscience with AI/deep learning and stuff?? Because, I am not planning on staying in academia after grad school and I think programming is just a very useful skill to have.

Worries:

One of my biggest concerns is the tuition.

\- Since I am an international student, I have to pay roughly 16K quarterly. So it is quite a financial burden for my family and I. Because if I decide to just graduate early, I would apply for a lab technician job and start earning some income and then apply for grad school.

Another concern is:

\- are these classes actually useful? Or are they helpful for direct application? Because I know computer science does not equal software development and from the minor website, I saw we also need to learn about discrete math, some Computer engineering-related classes?? So is it really worth the effort and money? I mean I could always just take a boot camp class online to learn what I really need to know for my field. (e.g. Deep learning?)

Current situation:

I have taken cogs 18, cogs 108, and I am taking cogs 109 and CSE 8A rn.

So I would say I feel more comfortable (still have a lot to learn) with python and I had no experience with Java or C.

So what is your guys’ perspective on this?",1,LABEL_1,0.9998604,0.0001396398,0.9998604

I hope to dabble into computer science or finance while I am here as I wish to apply statistics to one of these two fields.

Is it difficult to transfer into CS or pick up a CS double major for freshmen who enter as a statistics major?

I am a prospective senior applicant for Stanford undergrad 2024(my dream school). I was wondering if Stanford full price is worth it as my parents did not qualify for much financial aid(income \~ 240k) through FAFSA and they have just bought a new house, which meant taking a pretty hefty loan while paying for our last home(trying to sell). If I attend Stanford, I hope to chase and squeeze every opportunity, internship, connections to VCs in Bay Area/amazing funding opportunities/networking connections, and immerse myself within the start-up culture and create 2-3 companies(have ideas already in mind), which is why it is my dream school.  My plan is to double major in bioengineering and MSE and I believe I have the caliber to achieve these things based on my unique track record in high school and work ethic(all by myself and through persistence: started profitable company in high school, won international competitions, was top 2% in competitive high school in Texas, did 5 internships etc.). My question is: Stanford is going to be around 250k-300k in loans which I believe I will have to mostly pay(along with some parent contribution) but based on my description, goals, and ambitious nature can it be a good idea to go if I get in. While there are other options/schools out there without the need for such a big loan,  I know that by going to Stanford I will be able to fast-track the ability to achieve my dreams and have the connections to the bay area/funding/ and world-class professors in front of me. Has anyone else been through the same situation(taking large loans) and attended Stanford?

Hey y’all. I’m that mainland student again who did an AMA. You can look into my post history where I believe it shows that Im in a quite neutral position regarding the HK movement, and I think my experience as someone from mainland can give you an indepth view of the side that you don’t usually see — the side of mainland Chinese students. The majority of mainland Chinese students do not support and are against the movenment in HK for two main reasons to my knowledge, and I will go over each one of them and explain why they see it that way. 

1. They believe HK protest is a violent separatist movement that’s trying to make HK an indepedent country.

They view it this way mainly due to how the protests are displayed by the state media. The state medias show footage of police and mainland Chinese getting beaten up by masked protesters, pictures of protesters waving British national flags, videos of protesters damaging the public properties, and more. Did these things really happen? Likely yes. Did they do it just because they are violent thugs? Probably no. Do they make up the majority of the protesters? Likely no. However, the state medias use this footages to paint the protest to be about HK independence and mentions nothing about the five demands. Many of you asked in the AMA why HK independence is a bad thing and why it angers mainland Chinese so much. HK independence is a highly sensitive topic due to two things. First, it is just not possible in anyway. HK has no military of its own, is in the middle of mainland China, and has its infrastructures, such as power plants and water reservoirs, are all in mainland.  Second, it’s due to history of HK. HK was a colony leased to the British in 1800s, and the lease has always to be seen as a shame over the entire Chinese race because it shows how weak Chinese were and how Chinese were treated like slaves that would just give out their territory for opium. Fortunately for people in HK, British brought in a western democratic system, trades, and modern technology, which improved the economy by a sustantial degree. This sounds pretty positive, but it leads to the next reason that mainland Chinese dislikes the movement.

2. Many mainland Chinese believe HKers see them as an inferior race.

Under British rule, HK exceeded PRC (People’s Republic of China, aka mainland China) economically by a huge amount with its GDP being higher than PRC for decades. Because of this, many mainland Chinese immigrated to HK, and as what usually happens during a period that had a lot of immigration, discrimination and xnophobia happens. Mainland immigrants were given derogatory terms, such as “阿燦”, “大陸哩”, “大陸仔”, “支那人”, etc (you have to google them since each one has a history). Later during the infamous Chinese Milk Scandal, many mainlanders went to HK to buy milk powder for their children because they lost trust in Chinese brands. They bought so much that many HKers couldn’t even buy for their own because they were OOS. This brought mainland Chinese a new derogotary term, “locusts.” And of course, the state media reported all of this to the mainland Chinese to show them how HKers see them as inferior. 

(Below is a personal experience that I first hesitated to include because I could be biased due to many factors, but i tried my best to write it as close to what happened as possible. Sample size of encounters is not large either where N ≈ 15)

When I went to HK over several ocasions,  i found some really consistant patterns of how people treated me. I do not speak Cantonese, so I have to use Mandarin or English. Although HKers dont speak mandarin, they use very similar written language as mainland (traditional vs simplified Chinese). Because of this, I would type out things in traditional Chinese and show it to then. All of the questions pretty mich started with “hi, sorry for bothering. I’m from mainland and can’t speak Cantonese. Can you show me how to ...”. With this method, people most of the time responded in a really cold manner without any facial expression. I was just thinking maybe it was just that HK is a busy city and everyone is in a hurry until I started asking questions in English. Whenever I asked in English, people tend to smile a lot and respond my questions patiently. I am not the only one who have had this experience and was surprised when one of my friends bought up experience of his in a conversation where he found this pattern, too. Was it due to xenophobia or the bad stereotypical image of mainland tourists? Maybe. Was it just due to HKers feel more comfortable with English than mandarin? Perhaps. But one thing for sure was that I felt uncomfortable with identifying myself as someone from mainland and many people in China see this as discrimination.


Because of these, many mainland Chinese have a very biased view on anything that HKers do. Even if they did know the five demands, it would still be difficult to make them support the movements because of this nationalism and ethnicity related bias.",1,LABEL_1,0.99987084,0.00012919935,0.99987084

4917,"I am a freshman cs major. I only barely got into this school (waitlisted) and I am very happy that I made it in. This is my second semester. I did fine over the summer but I'm finding fall semester so much more difficult. High school barely took any effort for me. I did study and do all my homework, but nothing in high school was ever hard. Now that I'm halfway through my second semester I feel like I've lost all my drive and I'm just a below average student who shouldn't even be here. I'm taking 4 classes and doing fine in three of them, but I got a 40 my first calculus test a few weeks ago and I feel like such an idiot. I understood the concepts, I just was too anxious to study. I don't even know how to study, because I've never taken a hard class before. I don't know what to do, I don't have any self-discipline left because I'm always exhausted and I've skipped class many times. I need some kind of structure to follow, but I know I'm an adult now who's expected to be able to take care of myself. I keep slipping into depression and wanting to give up. I feel like this situation isn't uncommon for students but I still feel so alone when everyone around me seems to already be so skilled at working hard studying and resisting distractions. I'm so disappointed that I went from the top of my class in my tiny high school to someone who's struggling to manage with only 12 credit hours. I went to the counseling center and they told me to leave and go find help somewhere else. I don't know where else to go. Was anyone else in a similar situation freshman year? What did you do? I don't want to sound so dramatic over one bad test, by feel like I'm already so deep in mediocrity it's impossible to improve myself. I really don't want to give up though, I love computer science and I'm proud to be a tech student. Where can I find help? What can I do?

4950,"I've seen a lot of posts here asking how Psych 100b is like. I was one of those students before and I took this class so I thought i'd tell you guys how it went for me. 

First off, I got a perfect score on the final (over the summer there is only a final and no midterm, and this one exam is worth 40% of your entire grade) and yet I ended w/ a B. everyone said to take it during the summer cuz it's supposedly easier, but I'd only suggest doing that if you are an excellent writer. I actually always thought I was pretty good at writing, I've never gotten anything below an A in any of my papers throughout several years in college thus far. But my self-confidence in my writing skills is completely shattered now cuz of psych 100b. 

During the summer, the lab is worth way more points than usual, it goes 60/40 in favor of lab, while during the school years it's vice versa. I wish I took it during the school year cuz the test was not nearly as bad as everyone on Bruinwalk said, and those extra points would've helped me a lot, cuz again I essentially got a 100% in lecture. Also, during the summer, keep in mind that the pace is accelerated like crazy. The thing was, we would be assigned a big project on a thursday, and it would be due on tuesday- problem was there wasn't a single OH available in b/w those days and my TA was very bad at responding to emails. This was a very annoying problem to have for a class like this cuz everything is so arbitrary and the instructions to assignments are not clear. I swear they keep things vague and confusing on purpose or something. You'll know what I mean once you take the class- but basically almost every element to whatever instructions you get, or the ""guidelines"" to the first and second submissions are really up to interpretation. So thus due to my TA's lack of ability to respond to emails and lack of OH in b/w having something assigned and due, I would essentially be shooting from the hip on a lot of things. There's no minimum page or maximum page limit either, at least having that would've been nice so you have some gauge in how much details need to be written. There'd be instances where I'd write things the T.A. said to do, and she would still mark me off. She would even mark me off for something that would literally be addressed the next sentence, it's like she barely read my paper or something. 

The grading of these papers is very, very arbitrary. Sometimes your T.A. will mark off minute details while forgetting to mark off other parts of your paper w/ similar mistakes. Also, the first and second submissions are the biggest component to your lab grade, and they build off each other. I did not even get my first submission back until a day or two before the second and final submission was due, so I pretty much had no idea if a lot of the ideas I was writing were even accurate. From what I understand, this is usually not an issue during the regular quarter cuz everything is spaced out, and you have weeks to do assignments we have days to complete.

Oh and a big part of your lab grade is going to be your group. I had a pretty shitty group so that sucked- one person seemed to not care about anything while the other pretended to care while writing BS. So there's going to be a lot of luck involved in this class. 

Bottom line is, the material to the class is not difficult but it is poorly structured imo. I feel like they should be giving more clear instructions to the assignments, and either eliminate the group element or change the structure of it. I understand that obviously in the future many of our careers are going to involve the ability to work in groups, but I feel like for a 6 unit class like this where your grade is so important, they should allow grades to be decided by the individual. But hey, that's just my 2-cents. I also wanted to write this post so that others may be more mindful of taking this class over the summer. It seems like the general consensus among psych majors is ""take 100b over the summer, it's going to be easier!"" but it is entirely subjective and depends on your strengths and weaknesses as a student. If any of you out there have some questions or want to know more details (like the T.A. I had or grades to specific assignments) pm me, I didn't wanna write out too many details to maintain anonymity.",1,LABEL_1,0.9998762,0.00012378047,0.9998762

For the past 2 and a half years, after every single exam (especially after the final grades are out) people seem to constantly flood piazza (or any other choice of communication) with questions regarding curves. A lot of them just didn't make sense to me. I wanted to discuss about this for a while.

So basically what I noticed is that professors usually aim for a 70~75% average on an exam, and set that as a C or C+. If the average is close enough, or if the average is higher than the target, the class usually isn't curved (unless the average is too high, in which case a downcurve can be applied in very rare cases)

If the average is lower than the target, professors curve the class to have a C or C+ average. For example, getting a 66% on an exam where the average was 50%, you will likely get curved to a B or B+. 

Students also seem to ask for curves even when the class average is well over 80% with plenty of chances given by the professor for extra credit and whatnot. Most of the time if someone asks a question about a curve, it gets serenaded with a thread of replies asking about the same thing.

Also, I'd like to stress that there is no shame in tutoring/taking more time at Stanford.

I was wondering how to use my financial aid to buy textbooks? 

I’m pretty set financially for this semester - bright futures covers my tuition 100%. And I’ve got money left over from fafsa and the ucf Pegasus scholarship. So I wanna use that left over money to buy textbooks but I don’t know how?? Like when do we get that money? Also how do I get that money - do I have to sign any forms, or do I just wire a bank account for the direct deposit? 

My biggest concern is that I have an online class and the online Lab for it has assignments due this Sunday. My other classes’ textbooks can wait for a little bit, but I’m trying to at least get the Lab access ASAP which is why I’m asking about using financial aid to get textbooks. Can someone help maybe?

I am no moderator but I have been pretty active on this subreddit for the last year and a half or so and believe I may be able to vocalize some concerns I have personally experienced and what I see other users complain about. We attend the largest private university in the United States as well as one of the most globally spread and it's quite discouraging that our subreddit is relatively inactive amongst our current students and bombarded by redundant and easily answerable questions by prospective students. Here are some changes I suggest:

1. **New Mods:** The change first needs to come from the people able to make the change – the moderators. Most of the moderators, however, seem to have gone inactive due to having graduated or other reasons. I have only seen u/mrmbuceta be active in recent months and I applaud them for doing what they can, especially during the stressful Tandon semester. With more mods, the sub may not have to always rely on u/mrmbuceta to see the post or other users reporting ChanceMe's and admissions questions for action to be taken.
2. **A new sidebar**: Whether a prospective student or a new redditor, it can always be helpful to have NYU-specific information regarding the rules and function of this subreddit. A new sidebar would hopefully prevent the need for more work to be done by the mods. A sidebar such as the one sported by r/uchicago or r/rutgers may be informative to new and old members, directing prospective students to more relevant subreddits to them, including r/ApplyingToCollege and r/ChanceMe, thus avoiding the need to remove questions that belong there.
3. **Post flairs**: Post flairs would work to organize and categorize posts as news, school-specific inquiries, memes, and more.

Please let me know if I missed anything that you would like to add or remove and I will do my best to do so!",1,LABEL_1,0.99986905,0.00013093544,0.99986905

5313,"Hello my slooty slugs!

I've been seeing a lot of especially bad struggling going on this quarter, so I'm writing this post in hopes that it can help someone. I know how scary it is to seek help, especially when you don't know what to expect, so here I'm going to write everything I've learned about the CAPS and DRC process in the two and a half years I've worked with them.

**Notes:** This is the information I can give as a UC Ship student, I don't know the details for non UC Ship students, but if you walk in they will 100% tell you what they can do for you. If the thing you're struggling with is ADHD, CAPS is very limited in the help they can provide. I believe they require a full examination to diagnose an attention disorder, and even then they don't have ADHD medicine readily available in the campus pharmacy. I'm not entirely sure, though.

*The CAPS center is across the street of 9/10, upstairs and the OPPOSITE side of where the stairs lead you (right above the pharmacy). The DRC building is located in the Hahn Student Services building, which is across a bridge from the McHenry library.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**CAPS Therapy:**

You can choose to either schedule an appointment over the phone or walk in and fill in a form for them to process you into an appointment. If you feel you're in need of immediate care, you should walk in and express this. You can be connected to a crisis therapist, who will make sure you're okay and not in danger of hurting yourself. 

When you walk in, you can take two different routes as you fill out the check in form. If you check off that you have been feeling suicidal, they will find a therapist for you immediately to make sure you're going to be okay and safe. I will strongly advise that **IF** you want to check off feeling suicidal that you check off that you do NOT have a plan on suicide if you don't want to risk getting a 5450\*\* form filed on you. It might take up to 15 minutes tops for them to find you an available therapist, depending on how busy they are. You'll almost be guaranteed a same day check in though. If you do not check off either of the two suicide boxes, they will feel you aren't in any immediate danger or in danger of hurting others and will probably schedule you for a different day appointment.

When you talk to the therapist, you just have to make sure they understand that you are not a danger to yourself. If you mention you feel depressed and unmotivated, that's enough for them to give you the help you deserve. You don't have to mention you are suicidal. If you mention you have vague suicidal ideation but that you would never follow through, it's very unlikely that they will involuntarily hospitalize you. If they think you need it, they'll give you a short term therapist to help you through the next one to threeish months probably. However they do not offer on campus long term therapy. If you want a long term therapist, they will give you a referral and you'll meet with a therapist off campus. I hear that there is a place near the Metro Center, so it'll just be a short bus ride and a small walk.

\*\***What is a 5450?** A 5450 form gets filled out by a doctor if they feel you are a danger to your own safety. It's what leads to involuntary hospitalization. Generally you don't want it to get to this. It takes away some of your legal rights for up to (but not always) three days, and you are put under the care of a hospital that will monitor your condition. If it comes to this, you'll be okay, and you'll be safe. Just stay calm, and remember that the people handling you want the best for you. They're on your side. I've been to the local psychiatric hospital, and the staff are so very supportive and sweet. Trust them, because they're there for the sole purpose of helping you. 

&amp;#x200B;

**CAPS Medication/Psychiatric Services:**

If you express you want medication, they will assign you to a long term psychiatrist. You'll talk about your needs and they'll start you off with a SMALL dose of a medication, where you can pick up downstairs at the pharmacy. They might tell you to get your blood drawn sometime soon downstairs to make sure you're good to take medication. They'll continue meeting with you every one to two weeks so they can monitor your side effects, health, and needs. Most likely you'll jump from prescription to prescription until you find one that suits you. They might raise or decrease the dosage. They might put you on more than one to find the perfect dose for you. **Keep in mind that all of these changes are 100% YOUR CHOICE**. They will NEVER force you or pressure you to take medication. They're only there to advise you on what they think is best. You will be in control. 

The process might be a struggle, but try not to lose hope. Medication isn't for everyone, but even when it is it takes a while to get it right. Try your best to be completely honest. Feeling 10% better? Don't tell them you're good, admit that things are better but that you aren't completely happy, and they'll talk with you about if they think you should keep trying to find a better dose. It's also normal for medications to lose effectiveness after a while. Don't be discouraged. It's all part of the process. After over two years of medications, I kept making little improvements, but I only found what I think is the perfect prescription 5ish months ago. It was a long journey getting to this point, but I'm the happiest I've been in actual years. If you're feeling good about your prescription, they'll change the appointments to every month, and if you feel great and ask them, they might make it every other month etc. If you ever develop side effects and your appointment isn't until next week or month or something, they'll always be available through the Health e-Messenger.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vacation Coverage:**

Your UC ship coverage lasts through the summer even if you aren't taking summer classes, so you don't have to worry about getting cut off for summer. They'll give you referrals to meet with people in your area over the summer, and give you the medication you need. If you can't find one close to you, they'll even go as far as to pull it up and help you find someone you can meet with. You'll also be able to access them through the e-Messenger.

&amp;#x200B;

**DRC Accommodations:**

You know those little blurbs at the bottom of every syllabus talking about disability resources? It's not exclusive to physical or severe mental disabilities. It applies to anything academically debilitating, including depression and anxiety. You can make an appointment and they'll go over what accommodations they offer. If you have a note from a therapist it'll be much easier to get approved, but I think they also give accommodations without it. I'm not entirely sure. If you get approved, a new menu option on your student portal will be added for Disability Services where you can check off boxes for the classes you need letters for. Go ham and check them all off, whether you think you'll need them or not. It's a safety net. The Accommodation Letters will be emailed to your ucsc email after a few days. 

Being a DRC student is a godsend. Seriously. They offer things like absence and tardiness excuses, deadline extensions, and laptop approval during lectures. The effectiveness of these letters is up to the professor, so don't abuse them. Still, they'll usually be VERY understanding and will work with you a lot more leniently to help you pass. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Emotional Support Animal (ESA) on campus:**

I'm hesitant to cover this, because I don't want people to glamorize the idea of having a pet on campus. It's not some fun cutesy college experience aesthetic bullshit- do NOT try and get an ESA unless you truly believe it will help you get you through your depression. Pets are not accessories, they are not feel-good tools either. They have needs, and if you're having trouble taking care of yourself, you need to think long and hard about whether you're prepared for the commitment of taking care of a whole other living being. 

**Questions you should ask yourself before deciding whether you should apply for an ESA:** Are you capable financially and physically of caring for this animal? You should have a solid few hundred dollars saved away AFTER buying all the basic care materials, in case of a veterinary emergency. You have to be capable of remembering to feed and groom and pick up after your animal every single day. Will you be available emotionally for your animal as they are for you? An ESA does not solely exist to comfort you. They are living being creatures too, and need love and affection and constant care. If you'll be gone all day sometimes and you live alone, consider the emotional well being of the animal, who will feel abandoned and alone. Will you be able to take care of this animal for potentially the next 10 years? This isn't a fish, they'll be alive for a while, and they'll bond with you. Have a solid plan for how you'll have your ESA with you after graduation.

**Still want an ESA?** The ESA application can be picked up at the DRC. If you have a note from a therapist, it'll be much easier to get approved. The approval process will take a few weeks, and then you'll schedule a meeting with your housing coordinator to go over the rules. When you get your ESA, you'll meet with them again to give them your pet's health records.

**Getting an ESA:** You can bring a pet you already own at home, or adopt one if you feel ready for the commitment. If you're struggling a lot with the common symptoms of depression (fatigue, lack of self care, inability to go outside) and you really want an ESA, please get a cat. A dog needs a lot of extra care, and for you to give them the best quality of life, you'll need to be able to walk them every single day for a good amount of time. For where to get the animal, the first main options I considered were Craigslist and the Santa Cruz Shelter. However, Craigslist results will mostly be in neighboring cities, so be ready for a drive to meet and pick them up. For the local shelter, you need to be over 21 to adopt. Soooo I personally had to fall back on Petsmart's in store shelter, where I met my best buddy Bailey. Also be aware when adopting, that you are responsible for any damage or disturbance your pet causes. A loud or destructive animal is definitely not a good candidate.

Be aware that there is usually a 100-150$ adoption fee, on top of needing to buy a brush, scratching post/litterbox for cats, toys for dogs, and pet food and potentially litter regularly. Be prepared to spend 200$ straight away. Then also be ready to pay the monthly fees for care. I personally have to spend \~40$ every month for litter and cat food. 

*When you adopt this animal, you are adopting a new friend and family member, so don't fuck around and be a good owner for your good boye/gorle.*

**ESA Housing Rights:** An ESA is actually protected by California law in terms of housing. Any apartment, including ones that have a no pet policy, cannot turn you away or charge you more for having an ESA. If you provide proper documentation, they must allow you to keep your animal with you as long as they do not damage the property or cause a disturbance of any kind. However, this is in terms of housing only. ESA's are *not* Service Animals. Service Animals are trained and are allowed basically anywhere, but your ESA is basically just another pet in every other aspect. Hopefully though, this housing protection will help you stay with your animal after graduation.

*If you abandon your ESA after the school year ends, I will send PG&amp;E after you.*

If you're depressed or struggling, you deserve to get the help you need. Don't ever feel like what you're going through isn't real or important enough to be addressed.

5318,"As the title says, I've had second thoughts on committing to GS since I received my acceptance. 

If the ""School of General Studies"" really is just an (awkward) administrative title, why does Columbia's website promote the fact that ""GS Students take the same classes and have the same professors as CC and SEAS students"". If that's the case, why even separate a body of students administratively, if they are taking the same classes and have the same professors?

I understand CC vs SEAS. Different core requirements. But the GS core is practically the same as the CC Core, save for 2 or 3 classes (I think?).

Then theres the whole issue with lack of proper financial aid, diploma typed in English (instead of Latin), etc. Little things here and there that make GS less ""desirable"" than CC.

On a more personal note, I'm transferring in with an Associate's Degree, with around 75 credits. I've received offers from other schools who accepted anywhere from 60-70 of those credits, but Columbia only accepted 31 according to the transfer credit report I received.

I learned about GS 2 years ago and I was ecstatic to have the opportunity to attend a school like Columbia. I worked super hard to maintain a really high GPA, taking 4 classes in the evening while working full time during the day etc. I was so happy when I got accepted. But reading forums, it seems a lot of people are dissatisfied with GS and feel like ""second class citizens"", and that combined with less than half of my credits being transferred makes me hesitant to accept Columbia's offer. It would probably take me 3 years to finish my Bachelor's now. 

**TL/DR: Got accepted to Columbia GS, hesitant to commit because of the ""General Studies"" stigma and less than half of my credits being transferred/accepted. Is it worth the ""Ivy League Education""? Can anyone in GS tell me what your experience has been so far, honestly?**",1,LABEL_1,0.9998549,0.00014503984,0.9998549

I was dismissed for the 19-20 school year because of minimum progress and gpa standing.

If my petition for withdrawal goes through, I may be eligible to continue in winter/spring 2020.

I've applied to Sallie Mae, Citizens Bank, College Ave, Discover, Credible, and Ascent. Only Ascent approved however they only gave me $9,500 and that is obviously not enough.

I thought I'd be able to get approved since I have good credit history (790) and I have my own income through my part-time job. I didn't want my parents to cosign since I don't want to burden them but it's not like they can cosign for me either way since they have very terrible credit history and they have their own money problems.

From what I understand, going to Barnard is basically like going to Columbia—and a lot of people are up in arms that Barnard kids are just as good as Columbia kids. I also understand that Barnard has a different atmosphere, etc. from Columbia and all that. However, because Columbia College is so similar to Barnard (with students from one taking classes at the other), what even is the point of applying to Columbia instead of Barnard? I get that they have different atmospheres or whatever, but is there any tangible advantage to going to Columbia instead of Barnard? Especially so if I have a statistically better chance of getting into Barnard. 

Also, please don’t tell me that Barnard and Columbia are one and the same. I get that Barnard is OF Columbia University, but I can apply to them separately on the Common App and that is how I’m referring to them.

 A/A+ is from 100\~92ish, 

A- is from 92-90ish

B+ is from 89-87ish, and so forth?

Once I have enough video ideas come in (and all ideas MUST be from other people, that's part of the point of this show), I'll put out the first video where I explain exactly what this show's all about, why I decided to start it in the first place, and what y'all can expect from it.

However, before the fall quarter began I went through something devastating and got major depression and I barely got diagnosed about two weeks ago. I wasn't able to focus as much as I wanted to, so I ended up failing two classes, and dropping one and getting a W on my transcript because the class I dropped was a lab. The only class I passed was my writing class.

My major is neurobio and I failed chem 6a and math 10a (the final screwed me up). Im worried about multiple things, my GPA, having to repeat pretty much an entire quarter, having two F's and a W on my transcript, not being able to receive financial aid because I failed two classes and now my GPA is hella low, being put on academic probation.

The chem 6a classes all have a waitlist, and so do the 10a classes and the 10a classes conflict with my BILD 1 class (which I need for my major and college requirements, and atleast this way I'll be able to get back on track with my BILD courses), so I can't drop BILD 1 to put myself on the 10A of 6A waitlist.

For now I have, CAT 2, CGS 105, FILM 87 as my enrolled courses and COGS 3 (for my college requirements) waitlisted.

The nail in the coffin right now is that my 2 design team groupmates pretty much never correspond to any of my messages and its getting kind of old after 4 weeks of barely being able to plan anything. I ask for available times and they obviously put only hours they'd like, and then even do a switcharoo on those times.

**The second is, what projects do you recommend, that :**

I can join in the middle of the year (maybe start rolling in integrating into the team this quarter). 

Give you more opportunities to be part of the design decisions of the team (rather than just a few people making decisions about design, concepts, and specifications) and giving you busy tasks may or may not be of any use and that would get you grilled every single check in by Walter  (kind of a huge plus).

 It would also be nice if there was more freedom to fail, (benefit)

You don't have to sign up for MAE 189 (optional)

I'm not saying this as an exact need, but an offchance benefit

5577,"LARPing is Live Action Play Playing - like any RPG, except instead of sitting in a dark room lit only by your 30"" monitor, you play outside and hit nerds with sticks. Its an incredibly cathartic release, not to mention all the benefits of physical exercise on your brain and grades and the like.  

[Xadune](https://xadune.com/) is a Victorian Gaslamp LARP centered in Atlanta.  It is lightest-touch combat, roleplay heavy, and extremely new-player and new-LARPer friendly.  We are hosting their next game November 29th - December 1st at Indian Springs State Park.  Just an hour south of Tech on 75, it provides the perfect (temporary) escape from finals, essays, and overbearing family members who insist that you are *so smart,* so you'll be just fine on your finals. You can come by for the whole event, or part of it, or whatever you like, but I assure you you'll have a great time. 

Best of all? Trying the game out is free! If you come out to be a 'Monster' - where you get to play the various villains, antagonists, and crunchies the players are pitted against, admission is free! We will provide you with all the costuming and weapons needed to play, as well as run you through the rules and safety instructions.  Just bring comfy shoes and warm clothes. 

If you really like the idea of LARPing and want to play as a Player Character, show your Buzzcard at Check-In to get $10 off admission.  

Xadune really helped me when I was at Tech.  I was, as many are, overwhelmed by the workload and I would get caught in a spiral of *I have to do more*. Taking a break from academic things, getting some fresh air and exercise, and making friends outside of Tech really helped me be able to focus on my schoolwork when I got back.  I probably wouldn't have graduated if I hadn't have found LARPing, just because having a not-Tech-focused hobby kept me sane.

I am currently in my junior year and am majoring in economics. My plan is to follow through with a PhD in said subject.

From what I have heard, one needs good research experience to make a good PhD application. I sort of have had no luck in this aspect. I have a good GPA, and from what I have seen, I can do the work most employers could ask for. The problem is in that I suspect that I haven’t networked much. 

Until now, my idea was that I would look for professors announcing vacancy through some medium in the department. However, I have found literally no such vacancy notices in the economics department. In fact, all other but professors from economics department post on NYU Job Search portal. 

Of course, there can be some very straightforward explanation to this, but I refuse to believe that NYU’s economics department doesn’t open its doors to undergrads for relevant research experience.

PHYS 2208: Priority is given to students who cannot satisfy their Physics requirement with PHYS 1102. If you cannot self-enroll in PHYS 2208 via Student Center, you should add yourself to the Physics [waitlist](https://www.physics.cornell.edu). If you only list one option for section and lab, you may be passed over for students who have been more flexible and listed more section options. Do not enroll in electives during lecture times.  If you need to add filler classes for financial aid purposes, do not add classes that meet during your requested section times. Your schedule will be reviewed to ensure spots you requested do not cause conflicts with classes in which you're already enrolled. Placements will be made in mid-December, directly through your college registrar. Due to the class having 38 separate components, it is not possible to give you your chances for enrollment to the class or a particular section. Most of the waitlist for 2207 was enrolled in their requested, or agreed upon, sections this semester.

PHYS 1112, 2213, 2214: There is no waitlist for this sequence and all seats in all sections have been released to Student Center. If you are flexible with your schedule you will be able to enroll.  If there are no open discussions or labs that fit your schedule, see the Physics Course Coordinator in 121 Clark Hall during your add/drop period. Sections will not be filled beyond capacity during the pre-enrollment period. 

PHYS 1116, 2217, &amp; 2218 are on the waitlist.

5661,"Hey guys,  


I'll be going to university in the **UK** (**I'm Bulgarian**) in September of next year. I've already applied and been accepted into 4 of the 5 unis I picked (accepted in **York, Surrey, Sheffield, Leeds,** waiting on response from **Southampton**, but I'm 99% sure I'll get an offer).  


I want to study **CompSci** and since my end goal is working in the US. I want to use a MSc to jumpstart that (Visa, getting 3 years to work in the US post graduation so I've more shots at winning the visa lottery + I imagine a US degree is more desirable to US employers).  


I'll most likely end up working through uni in a pathetic attempt to save up enough to get out without any financial aid (one of the reasons I'm going to the UK, is that while my parents are well off by Bulgarian standards - big house, luxury SUV, they can in no way afford the 9.25K GBP + cost of living in the UK, let alone the 77K + cost of living in NYC, so I'll most likely either work to pay for uni in the UK or get a loan, and they'll provide the accommodation, etc.), or at least a minimal amount of debt, maybe get accepted to NYU and get absolutely obliterated by the monstrosity the living cost + college cost are.

Really hope the UK BSc can land me a decently paying job (even 60K will be a godsend, I'll get 3 roommates and live in Alphabet city to save on rent lol) so I can at least cover cost of living and put away cash for the debt I'm about to pick up thanks to NYU, without being on the verge of homelessness.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck me the debt will be **crippling** even if I work while studying.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm wondering is, what's the best way to get accepted into NYU? I've got straight As, will do anything in my power to graduate from uni with a BSc w/ Hons, but I'm unsure which university to pick - which one of the five is more highly regarded in the US? From what I've looked up, Southampton, Leeds and Sheffield are the best out the 5 and all rank within the top 100, but I'm hoping to get some input from people who've actually gone/are in NYU - hopefully maybe an international student who took my route?  


Tl;dr: I'm Bulgarian, going to study CompSci in the UK. End goal is working in the US. Out of these 5, which is the most highly regarded in the US/will grant me the best chance of getting into NYU - Southampton, Leeds, Sheffield, Surrey, York?

5666,"Hello! It's me, your friendly university Musician's Network president (until spring semester at least)!

Under the Couch is a student run arts space and music venue. It is the home of Musician's Network and its shows, and MN helps put on shows and events for many other organizations and departments within the space. During the daytime it serves as a relaxing public lounge with music and ~atmosphere~. There are also practice spaces and a studio. 

I don't know how many of you remember or were previously informed, but Under the Couch will be going down with the upcoming Student Center demolition in May 2020, and there are no plans for a new one to be built when the new Campus Center is constructed. Only the Musician's Network practice spaces and studio will remain. 

This, however, does not have to be the end of student-run arts space on campus.

After a meeting with VP of Campus Services Kasey Helton,  Senior Director of the Student Center Lindsay Bryant, and Undergraduate Student Body President Pooja Juvekar, Musician's Network is now looking for alternative locations around campus to serve as a location for a new Under the Couch.

There are a few wants/needs that would make a location suitable:

* Ability to accommodate 50+ persons at capacity
* Ability to install a sound system (big speakers/equipment and sound booth)
* Ability to be loud and play amplified music
* Space to install a stage and lighting
* Space to store equipment
* Easy access for patrons and load-in
* Bathroom Access
* Space to function as a daytime lounge
* Visibility 

Not all of these necessarily need to be met, but the more the better


We have a few ideas so far. Some are just shots in the dark/completely off the wall, and that's fine. We're brainstorming now and we'll look into further feasibility in the future.

* Living Learning Communities room near the wing zone
* Woody's Food Court
* Second Floor of Barnes and Noble
* Rec Tech space on East Campus
* Rent a storefront in Tech Square 
* Somewhere near the football stadium??
* Somewhere around the biotech quad??
* Somewhere at the Bill Moore Student Success Center??
* Biltmore Building Basement?? 
* Dalney Parking Deck??

So not all of these are overseen by Campus Services. The easiest solution would likely be under them but starting a conversation with a different department could also be possible.


ANYHOW

If you have any good ideas about underused spaces on campus that could suit our needs, I want to hear them!! I'll venmo $5 for every good, unique suggestion (this is me personally, not the club or any other gt organization). Thank you for your help!

I’m in the Stanford CO 2024 and I’ve never visited campus, my only idea of what the campus is like comes from gilded youtube videos and google maps. Maybe accepting my admittance without knowing the campus was a bad idea, but it’s Stanford and I grew up in California so I’m not expecting much different. 

However, I’m incredibly poor. Like, will need a work-study job as soon as I step foot onto campus poor. My parents have absolutely no money to give me for college, and so I won’t really have access to certain things (like a bike/skateboard to get around) for awhile unless I’m able to secure a scholarship (not banking on it but I’m hopeful?) 

So, my questions for you all are: for the period that I don’t have a bike/skateboard/whatever, is walking around campus difficult/doable? secondly, is public transportation an option? I’ve seen stuff about public transport on Stanford’s website, but I’m not sure how viable it is since whenever I see YouTube videos, people just Über to go to Walmart/Whole Foods or Palo Alto or whatever (their privilege or just the most convenient way? both?)

***Photographs and source-gathering are basic, non-negotiable parts of the job***

It is bad enough when students at an elite university demand the school’s newspaper stop doings it job, as happened [**at Harvard recently.**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/harvard-immigration-activists-furious-that-student-newspaper-asked-ice-for-comment/) It is worse still when a school’s newspaper vows to stop doing the job itself, as happened at Northwestern University [**earlier this month.**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/student-journalists-apologize-for-taking-photos-of-protesters-at-a-public-protest/) There, responding to activist outcry over its coverage of a campus protest, the editors of *The Daily Northwestern* apologized for taking photographs of the event and for reaching out to students for comment via the school’s directory. The paper also apologized for naming the subjects of interviews. “We will…work to balance the need for information and the potential harm our news coverage may cause,” the editors wrote.

This is a silly joke. If a newspaper seeks to “balance” its coverage by taking down photographs and voluntarily making it harder to contact relevant sources, it’s intentionally hobbling itself, in this case for no other reason than that some students weren’t happy about being associated with a public newsworthy event. Everyday journalism is apparently now viewed by campus activists as evil and “harmful,” but it’s another thing entirely that campus journalists actually bought into it.

Besides study more, PNP the class (which I am probably going to do), what other advice do you have for me? I am worried about not even passing the class if I do poorly on the final especially. I need this for the L&amp;S breadth requirement and I don't know what I'd do if I don't pass it. Has anyone else been in this class before in a similar situation? Also are there any tutoring resources for this class, besides generalized physics tutors? It's silly because I feel like I'm learning in the course, I enjoy it, and I don't care about having to PNP it; however, I understood this is supposed to be one of the easier physical science breadths yet my midterm grade did not reflect this obviously.

Trust me, as someone who has been a part of the program before (and would never willingly be a part of it again) there are much better ways to make a difference on campus. Firstly, your experience in the program really just depends on whether you’re liked by the “professional” staff which is why you may hear some people say such positive things about their experience and hear others complain about theirs. The staff has no morale. The staff works insane hours (many of which aren’t paid but are rather “compensated” through housing which is technically illegal in California but they’ve found some special wording that makes it legal in their work contract) and despite constantly working your butt off, you will hardly receive positive encouragement and only constantly be told what you (the staff collectively) are doing wrong. Although constructive criticism is great, this professional staff literally doesn’t know how to thank you for your hard work. If you suffer from mental health I am warning you, DO NOT JOIN THIS PROGRAM. They don’t care about your mental health and everything they preach all summer applies to everyone but their own staff. For example, they constantly tell the new students about how even though they’re in college it’s important to, “get 7-8 hours of sleep,” meanwhile the staff is constantly running on very little sleep. Every year they get complaints about mistreatment by the professional staff and simply just brush it off with a mediocre apology. Seriously, you’re better off working at a coffee shop over the summer (you’ll be a lot happier).

I have never used common app and when I paid for the application fee, I clicked submit and left the rest alone. So...I forgot to confirm all of the legal things towards the end of the common app (I didn’t think twice and left it alone...but that’s only because I had to go to the hospital.) We had a major family accident and I’ve been in the ER since Tuesday afternoon. Things are not well atm. 


 Yesterday night I realized that Slideroom gave me a 24 hour grace period——so I proceeded to submit my entire application LATE (around 9pm yesterday night.)


Now I don’t know what to do.

Is Stanford going to read my application? Or throw me in the pool with RD applicants? I’m not sure if anyone knows:(

REA means a lot to me because I’d like to know if I was denied/accepted early. this is really upsetting to me and i take full responsibility for the late application. stanford is my dream school and i believe I ruined all of my chances for admission.

The program matches 3rd/4th year and graduate students with paid internships at awesome aerospace companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab and OneWeb while also providing fellows with mentorship from industry executives. The program culminates with a networking summit in Los Angeles to better inform fellows about all of the opportunities available to them in industry. During this summit last year's Matt Fellows got to meet Elon Musk and Buzz Aldrin!

Last year Tech had 4 Matt Fellows:

The application is quite extensive but if you or anyone you know meets the following requirements please send the application form their way! The MIFP is major agnostic so even if you are not AE please consider applying! If you have any questions feel free to comment before and I'll do my best to answer them or pass them along to the rest of the fellows! Also, be sure to [attend our info session next week in Guggenheim 442](https://ae.gatech.edu/event/info-session-brooke-owens-and-matthew-isakowitz-fellowship) where last year's fellows will go over the program in more detail and give advice on how to put together a stellar application!

Requirements:

* At the time of application, is a **college junior, college senior, or graduate student** who intends to pursue a **full-time career in the commercial spaceflight industry**. 
   * *Commercial space* is broadly defined as activities in entrepreneurship, intrapreneurship, and innovation that will enable new or dramatically improved products or services that do not depend solely on government cost-plus contracting to prove viable. In its most aspiring terms, commercial space promises to alter the space industry through new business models that will open up the space frontier.
* Has earned an **engineering or science degree**, or is working towards one at the time the Fellowship begins. 
* Has a diversity in experience and academic interests such as in engineering, science, management, business, and other related fields that can be related to commercial space. 
* Is a **U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident** (green card holder) due to export control regulations at the host companies.

I am posting this on behalf of a friend, but she has a team for the solar district cup! She originally had a team, however she hoped as the deadline drew near, they would help more but that never happened, so here we are!

She has had to work on most of this on her own due to the group not helping.

**What is it?**

The solar district cup is a team event to create a solar panel system using a mixture of comp sci, chemical, electrical and similar type of engineering!

**What do I have to do?**

The first part is a lot of paper writing and catching up on the research, but my friend would be able to help immensely.
The full task is not due until April of 2020, but there IS a deadline due Nov. 21st. 
There is more info below!

**Who do I contact?**

Just let me know in the comments or PM me and I will get you into contact!

Here are some questions

* If the same module has multiple sessions, each with different exam date on the matrix, does it mean that this module has different groups of people sitting for the same paper at different dates and times?
* How do I tell which module has/doesn't have an exam? e.g. ECE 2045 doesn't have exam while ECE 2035 have even though both are quite similar(?) in nature. The course catalogue doesn't always explicitly state whether the module has a final and how the weights are like for the assessments.

5996,"Hi,
I was waitlisted (yes, waitlisted, not deterred) from LS this past week and have been pondering whether or not to accept the offer.
Just gonna list some various thoughts
- While LS definitely had a bit of what I wanted, I won’t lie by saying part of the reason I applied there was because it was on the easier side of nyu schools (Again, I still liked LS enough to where I would have been fine going there)
- my 2nd choice school (GW) has an EDII option, and in all honesty they offer exactly what I want in terms of major (political communication). I also think I have a better shot of getting in there than with NYU
- I genuinely don’t know if I could stomach waiting 5 months at the minimum to hear back. I have some problems with anxiety and the mere deadline to decision wait this past fall was a lot for me
- I also don’t think I’d have a great shot at getting in off the waitlist, especially considering NYU historically isn’t the kindest with that
Essentially, I’m leaning towards not accepting the waitlist offer. I know anything can happen. I know there’s no real reason not to. But I don’t know if I wanna commit to this place further than I have cause I’m just sort of out of it right now. Is there any strong reason I should or shouldn’t go for it?

6063,"A significant percentage of the students at this school are truly struggling. It's not new and I'm glad people now feel safe enough to reach out to the community about it. I want to help, and this might be a message you **need** to hear.

If you're reading this as a fellow student, there's a good chance you've got a million things occupying your head at this very moment. Enough things to cloud judgement and distort thought. I'm asking you take a break from inside your head and zoom out to view your life from above.

What you might see is that you look like a point on a plane of the cartesian persuasion, located at what we call the present moment. It's got an infinite number of bumpy paths extending in all directions. Like... really bumpy--keep your arms and legs in the car at all times.

Every hill is a high in your life. Every valley is a low.

At our altitude, these might look small (not necessarily--I'm not trying to make light of tragedy). That embarrassing thing you did last week? Approximately every person except you forgot about it not even 10 seconds following. Got a job offer? You are a MF'ing G (I cannot emphasize this more, getting employed is the reason you *willingly* came to Tech!!). Same thing, though.

If you're like me, you have at *least* a few crippling insecurities. Times I've failed to perform. Making below average grades in my classes. Bombed every single one of my two phone screens this semester. I'm extremely into that girl, better play it cool and pretend like she doesn't exist (works every\* time). Is there a job ~~beyond retail~~ I'm... actually qualified for?

If you're like me, you probably want to change too. We all have an ideal image of ourselves we can visualize. Mine goes to sleep every night at a reasonable time, excited for the next day. Puts forth his best effort, in all things, irrespective of his emotional state. Has a 10.75 inch jimmy john... You get what I'm saying.

Let's call this ideal version of yourself Big-Dick-Energy-Chad-You (BDECY).

Why in the world do we all feel so rushed to reach this ideal? BDECY is mostly achievable. Look, I know 'Biggest-Dick-Icarus' (BDI) did it in 2 years while volunteering in Africa, but what does that have to do with you? It's possible you're a late bloomer and it'll be another 5 years? 10 years? 20? Who knows and who cares. It's entirely possible BDI had a helping hand, arm, *and* leg, or maybe not; It truly does not matter.

So your work hasn't impacted the lives of strangers yet. So not everyone likes you. So you've got noticeable flaws. So you've fallen way (waaaaaaaay) short of where you thought you'd be at this point in your life.

So... wait, why do we care about these things again?

If you're like me, your younger, ignorant self, often lauded as a (future) world-impactor, set up some self-expectations that don't make a whole lot of sense under closer scrutiny. 

**You've put all your self-worth eggs in the achievement basket.**

The truth is, it's an anomaly to drive up a steep mountain in the plane of reality and make it to the top without falling off and sustaining major trauma. Besides, once your altitude gets high, you have no choice but to keep moving up. *To stop is to fall all the way back down*. BDI is the one who's actually out of place. He will have to bust ass for the rest of his life just to *maintain* his position.

I'm going to challenge you to stop looking at paths leading up mountains and aim for something flatter. Look for a wide path rising slowly and steadily. Give yourself permission to fuck up. And be there to support yourself when it inevitably happens.

Don't totally let go of BDECY, but rather realize you may never reach that ideal, nor should you feel pressured to. Realize that BDI is exposing himself to a *dangerous* way of life. A way of life taking him to a summit, alone. **Any path that puts you above everyone else, by definition, leaves you there on your own.**

Now zoom back into the close view of your life. Take stock of your surroundings. Stop looking directly down or directly up. Instead look at the horizon and find a gentle slope leading up, but advance slowly, deliberately. You've got plenty of time to gain momentum before hitting the gas.

Determine your success, not based off of where you are, but based off of any small thing you did this day/week/month/year that moved you ever so slightly towards your ideal self. **Something that's trivial to everyone else might be huge for you.** And give yourself a pat on the back. You've made it this far.

**tl;dr: Stop focusing on who you think you should have been by now. Instead, pay attention to whether or not you're moving in a positive direction. Achievement is not a sustainable source of self-worth. When you let go of the need to be special, it will free you.**",1,LABEL_1,0.99986786,0.00013218402,0.99986786

6102,"(I hope I'm posting this in the right sub, I'm sorry if it's not) Hello everybody, I'm a senior that is most likely applying to Cornell ED. Some background: My school offers a lot of math and science classes, and so I've taken some accelerated math courses (from pre calc up to Calc AB), and I really got into physics (AP 2, C Mechanics &amp; EM), but I'm also part of the design major at my school. So I'm really passionate about art and design, and I wanna see if I can expand that passion into Architecture here. Anyway:

1. What's it like paying for a five-year course? Is it significantly more challenging than a traditional four years? 
2. Any small things that makes you think arch stands out at Cornell? I've heard so pretty good things, but I'd like to hear some firsthand experiences 
3. Do you love what you do as an arch major? 

Thanks, and sorry if these questions are annoying. I know there's an admissions thread, but I have no idea how to get there or if this should be there. To be honest, I'm teetering between EP and AAP. I feel like AAP would be a fit for me as someone who's also into design, and I'd have a way to stand out between the applicants as opposed to going to EP. But an architecture education also seems quite an expensive investment, and if that's the case I wanna know if it's doable or if I'd have a good return.

I am planning on applying to Stanford, UPenn, and UChicago next year and doing econ and stats as a double major, but I had a few questions. 

1) Is econ and stats in Liberal Arts and Sciences or is it in Wharton? Are there even specific business undergrad majors? If it is not in Wharton, is taking majors like Finance or Marketing just as good as taking econ and stats if I want to eventually get an MBA and get a management position? I know that Wharton is renowned but I don't know how much a specific major will help. 

2) How hard is an econ and stats double major? I know that prestigious schools are really hard, and I wanted to know if UPenn is the same or if it is relatively easy to the other prestigious schools.

3) Is econ and stats going to help me find a consulting internship out of college and eventually help me get an MBA?

4) How much calculus would be needed for this double degree? I stopped after Calc BC and I am only taking Comp Sci as my math in senior year because I don't want to do Calc 3.

5) Is grade deflation a thing and will it hurt me?

6169,"I am currently a freshman and just completed my first semester at Cal. It wasn't as cumbersome since I had taken just one technical course (Math 1A, I'm an international student and didn't know about APs till the end of senior year) and got done with a couple other breadths and university requirements. I'll be taking Physics 5A along with Math 1B next semester. I'm planning to pursue a PhD program after graduation and mostly get into academia after that.

What I have observed from my exposure to the field of research (in physics at least) is that there is a growing need of programming skills for analysis and other purposes. Because of this I was planning to do a minor in CS, hoping that it would help my cause as I pursue higher studies. But what I have heard is that CS courses at Cal are super time consuming and upper division courses are extremely hard to get into even for CS majors. I am also planning to get a double major in Astrophysics for which the lower div prerequisites are the same as that for Physics but except for CS61A, there aren't any course overlaps between CS and Astrophysics. I have 6 more semesters (and 4 summers) for which I have just made a tentative schedule.

I'm dead set on majoring in Physics but not so sure about the Astrophysics and CS part. Is it a feasible path to take? I would love to hear from people who have taken a similar route to this one and advise me on how to manage my schedule. If anyone wants additional info to help me decide, please let me know.

6182,"I love UCLA. This is just a rant.

But fuck UCLA.

Tell me if anyone can relate.

&amp;#x200B;

My on campus job hasn't paid me for the past four weeks. The reason for the late pay is for some bullshit reason on behalf of HR, so I can't and won't blame my boss for this shit. But I've been out of money for the past two weeks. I owe my friends money because I needed to pay for gas to get to my two unpaid internships. I'd be saving money if I had a parking pass on campus so I wouldn't have to park so far north. But UCLA won't give me a pass because ""my off-campus internships are not sources of income"" and for that reason I don't qualify for parking. It's like Sunglass Hut refusing to sell me sunglasses cuz I walked in on a fucking foggy day.

I'm sitting here in class right now unable to concentrate because of all of this. I have no money. I have so many responsibilities I'm juggling at once. My professor barely speaks speaks English and we're learning difficult mathematical concepts. I have a paper due next week for a GE class that has no relevance for the career I want to have. I have so much pressure to deal with, which I am capable of doing, but UCLA keeps dishing me so much fucking unnecessary bullshit that everything is way harder than it truly needs to be. I can't even imagine what it's like for other Bruins who have less money that me. I truly feel inferior to them; they are persevering and overcoming the obstacles of REAL financial stress and I am unable to do so myself.

Yes, I signed up for all of this by choosing to go to college. But fairly said, UCLA fucking sucks because of all of the flaws that come with running such a big system. And fuck my professor. Yes, I should put my laptop away so I can try to pay attention but I'm TRIPPIN right now because of actual life issues... and I'm supposed to go to class and try to decipher this lady's English. We're at such an amazing institution and I can't even understand my professor. LIT. And I've had professors like this before. Fuck all of my friends who are going to easy colleges and enjoying themselves. I'm so jealous of them. I want that so badly right now. But I realize I need to keep pushing and stay levelheaded because UCLA will give me fantastic opportunities later in life...

6185,"  For early decision, I have been admitted to the College of Engineering class of 2024. I was celebrating this fact until the evening of Christmas Eve, when I received my financial aid offer. From what I can discern, my family is expected to pay the full price of $75,868 for one academic year. To be clear, I was expecting to receive minimal aid, but I have been all but blatantly rejected by the financial aid office. I understand that the university awards no merit-based financial aid, but I took my admission under early decision to mean that I was wanted on campus. I take offense to the fact that the university cannot offer me a dime. As far as colleges went, I was not ignorant to the fact that Cornell would be a costlier option, but I imagined a greater cost would be somewhat justified. There is no justification for a direct $300,000 expense over four years.

  I would not usually discuss the following details in a public forum, but, for background, they feel pertinent. I am an only child. My father, (who is looking to retire in the coming years) has an annual income of $90,000. My mother has an income of $10,000 - $30,000 from her investments. The problem lies within my mom’s assets, totaling approximately $1.3 million in said investments. I have never considered my family to be rich nor upper class. We live pretty conservatively, seeing as we could not recoup any major expenses through income. My mom worked hard to attain that level of financial security, and I take even greater offense to the fact that Cornell sees it as theirs for the taking, but I digress.

  Let me consider some hypotheticals for a moment. The cost above is strictly for undergrad. At this time, I am considering (or would at least like the option of) going to med school.  Forgive my rough estimate, but I would predict this to be an additional $300,000 (especially if it is at Cornell). For my mom to raise the combined total in cash, she would likely incur an expense closer to $1 million (accounting for hefty tax penalties and other costs associated with liquidating that quantity of assets). I cannot, in good conscience, ask my mom to spend the bulk of her savings on my education, nor would I be comfortable taking on that kind of debt myself.

  Perhaps I have been naïve in not paying enough attention to costs. I bring this to the subreddit in the hopes that someone can share a similar experience. Is this the expected (adjusted) cost of attending Cornell? Having just gotten this news, I have not been able to contact the office of financial aid due to the holiday. I fully intend on asking for my decision to be reviewed, but do I have any realistic recourse? Perhaps most importantly, is four years at Cornell worth $300,000? I had strong doubts that I would be admitted to the College of Engineering, but I never considered that I would be priced out of a school marketing itself as the most progressive ivy. I am questioning whether my admission was based on merit or merely my ability to pay. I hope to join you guys in the fall, but that may not be a possibility.

6260,"Given the school's reputation, the (high) quality of our classes, our location to the industry, and how much this shit costs... I'm really surprised and disappointed at how little Wasserman Manhattan does for CS students. Some points I noticed while focusing on getting myself hired in a new-grad position:

* On Campus Recruitment (OCR) has a negligible selection of tech firms. I signed on right at the start of recruitment season and the only big-name tech company I saw was Microsoft. MasterCard is also there but that's about it. The rest of the listings are all consulting firms or law offices. So now we need to deal with exploding offers, vague interviewing timelines, and all the other BS that goes on with recruiting when your school doesn't stand in your corner. 

* The career fair was just as bad. I could count the big name tech companies on one hand, and some of those felt like an afterthought. The Tandon career fair I've heard is much better, which is understandable. If they're not going to let us into that one, which is again understandable, at least don't schedule it for the *same exact date* so tech recruiters have a chance to visit both. 

* Handshake does nothing that public job boards don't already do. Its only purpose is to give desperate teaching nonprofits a platform to beg undergraduate students to consider them.

* The events are also lacklustre. Pretty much the same firms as OCR and the career fair, and not much is focused on tech. 

* I haven't met anybody at Wasserman Manhattan who actually knows something about the tech recruiting scene. Sure, it's nice to get my resume reviewed, but when they don't know what anything on there means it only goes so far. 

How do you all deal with this? I have very few friends graduated and working in tech that I can ask for advice/referrals from. I have no recruiters I'm communicating with because the career fair was a wash. I just feel blind and hopeless because the ""amazing job center"" we have here is utterly failing me during the critical recruitment season.",1,LABEL_1,0.99986404,0.0001360056,0.99986404

I have no calculus experience. Kind of. The one time I was in a calculus class was about a year and a half ago and I dropped it after two weeks. 

Looking at my degree plan for Political Economy, I have to take some intermediate economic theory classes. There are some without calculus as a prerequisite, but I am worried they won't be offered / will fill up by the time I sign up for them.

How difficult would ECON 100A, ECON 101A, ENVECON 100, or UGBA 101A be for someone with no calculus experience? I plan on going to the Student Learning Center if I am stuck in one of these classes but would that even be able to save me if I have next to no knowledge of calculus?

6341,"Hi,

Please be patient and open-minded as I spill the details of this story. I am extremely grateful that I’m an incoming fresh at Stanford. It was just the perfect fit for me. The resources seem boundless. I’m from an upper-middle class single home. My mother came from a low-income family(she’s first gen—first to go to college), immigrated to the U.S, worked her butt off to become the physician she is today. We essentially started off as working-middle class(when my twin and I were born), by 10 years of age we were middle class, and by 15 years of age we were upper-middle class—she essentially broke the cycle for the family. I have a twin(going to a top school on the east cost—same name brand) also, so that’s two people going to college at the same time. She’s a single parent, so she’s the only person paying for both our fees. She’s extremely proud about us the colleges that we’re attending. The caveat is that she’s paying almost full cost for each person. I feel guilty sometimes because a good chunk of her salary is going into paying for 2 people at the same time while taking care(financially) of family members back in her home country. Sometimes we hear the complaint about fees—jokingly and un jokingly, which is perfectly understandable. 

Both my sibling and I want to go into medicine as well. I understand that there are quicker and more lucrative option to wealth than going into medicine. At an event today, my mom’s colleagues essentially hinted at me not to go into medicine when I’m paying such high cost to go to Stanford. They were suggesting I explore other routes out there that will make me a higher income in a shorter amount of time. They basically said keep an open-mind—you’re around Silicon Valley make all that fees worth it. They suggested that one going into medicine didn’t need such an expensive school, so if I’m going there I might as well take advantage of all the other non-med related resources.

Now, my mom has been supportive of whatever decision I make. She essentially told me to do whatever makes me happy.

So, I ask this question (please consider the circumstances) to those who are upper classmen and alum—has the Stanford name tag been worth it to you?",1,LABEL_1,0.9998724,0.00012756775,0.9998724

This is the most insane but completely non-fiction story you will ever see. It is however having trouble getting traction, and getting censored\\banned. Some of the ways this is happening are explained in the update section near the end of the document. Media is currently ignoring this story. This is an effort to create public awareness, so that bribes, blackmail, censorship, and secret deals cannot allow these vile criminals to maintain the status quo, and remain in office.

Billions in bribes were paid to Trump, Pelosi, Schumer, Harris and others to enable a Soros, Koch, and Porter funded child raping ring to operate in the USA.

\\\\Please post this anywhere you can! Create your own posts with this or other excerpt from the PDF. This information keeps getting blocked, censored, 'down/voted' etc. These people are extremely wealthy and throw money to anyone who will help them cover up their child rapes , child murders, and corruption. This is usually done through a receivership transfer where you receive the funds after for or more day, and it can be pulled at the last second, which is usually the case after you've done them the ""service"" as they call it. Please help get the word out. Soon it will no longer be able to be ignored.

A word about the ""faggot"" usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control of the situation, if they were the usage would have been stopped. Everyone out there needed to see this, as it was contrary to the picture they were painting. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the telepathic headspace \[see reference item G in the PDF\], which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of B.S. in the headspace, because they would not call each other “faggot”, and in turn giving themselves away thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for those unintentionally offended. On that note, I give you former President Barack Obama in a foursome with Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and Matthew Porter.

6349,"Basically my first semester at cornell was the best time of my life. Sure it was alot of work and some stress, I've made genuine friends here and I absolutely love most parts about the school.

This break, I realized why I love it so much and I honestly feel shitty for it.

I love it more because I'm away from my family. 

Small family, so we really 'rely' on each other. Guess in some way it can be taken as overbearing parents. Not academically, but just really really tight. mostly in a good way, but stressful nonetheless. 

I've never had this much freedom. My parents always gave me alot, but I've never taken advantage of it. being here with them basically stuck in this house is honestly frustrating. I already got into an argument with them earlier tonight. the worst part is that they are honestly wonderful and I know many would love to be part of a family like this.

I just miss the routine I developed there. Sure i have friends home too but honestly after making these cornell friends i dont really want to go back to some of my toxic 'friends'

I feel like an asshole wanting to get away from this family. I am blessed in so many ways and I feel ungrateful. My parents have been nothing but supportive all through my life but I just cant stand the independence I had there.

There I was, a 19 year old kid walking into Mcdonald’s. Life was good. I was preparwd to devour a not-so-nutritional meal and absorb it i to my 19 year old human flesh. I was with my friends. For the sake of keeping their identities secret, their names were d*ckface McF*ckington, *sscheek Mcgee, and Female Companion. 

The time was 10pm flat. I say flat because the only thing that is sharp was my keen eye. So there I was, ordering my not-so-nutrtional chicken wraps and a Mcdonald’s Sprite (We all know it isn’t just regular sprite). I waited for my food and laughed with my indentured friends over something politically incorrect. I hear my name: Order ###. I shot up and walked over to the counter to see a fair skinned, redheaded, glasses wearing goddess hand me my food. I said my signature “thank you thank you.” She then looked at me from the shoes up saying “you are welcome.” and turned around sassy and stylish. I knew right then and there that I wanted to get to know the woman I dubbed as “The Mickey D’s E-Girl.” I didn’t know if she was flirting with or not until my two female friends, Female Companion and *sscheek mcgee started to go “OOOOOOOH.”

We spent minutes conversing over the matter. I knew that one day I would have to see the Mickey D’s E-girl again.

6434,"I know it's midterms and I don't want to take a lot of your time. I don't want you guys to read all this and think ""damn I should've used this time better"". That's not my point and I'll try to go straight to the point, if possible. Sometimes I do admit I'll have to take a long detour, and it will be up to you to decide if you should keep on track or not.

&amp;#x200B;

As UCLA students you might think, if thinking is something you include as part of your daily reflection time fo the day, what's the purpose, or goal if that word suits you better, of going to a good (even though everything is relative and other ways of self education are decent) college and myself, as a Bruin, ask that question several times, at least five or six, maybe seven some days when I'm nostalgic, sometimes more than once per hour even. It's interesting the role of college in our lives and we can't deny it takes a toll on our mind or brain, with the passing of the years. It's totally worth it but sometimes it's not and even if it's not worth it, going to college is one of the things every person in their young life should at least consider and if they don't, well that's up to them, who am I to judge, right.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I wanted to tell you guys, now that you are studying for your midterms, is that an exam is exactly that, an exam, and if you are looking for some sort of strategy, well, in college there are a lot of them but I don't want to spend more of your time when you clearly should be studying, but I do want to say that it's important to at least consider everything we just discussed and even though I did them most of the talking, you as a reader are also an active mind and I am sure your take on this is as important and relevant as mine.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this and I wish you the best, or not if that's not what you are aiming for in this life.",1,LABEL_1,0.9998853,0.000114688904,0.9998853

&gt; There has been a concern raised about the fact that the final assignment (Lab 10) is due during the final exam period.  I just wanted to reassure everyone that this is clearly within the rules because it is given in lieu of a final exam.  The GT rules state ""No assessment other than a final examination or its replacement may be due during the Final Examination Period.""  This assignment is considered as a replacement for the final exam.

&gt; Best of luck on Lab 10 and hope you enjoyed the course.

MIDDLE EASTERN WOMEN 18 YEARS AND OLDER NEEDED FOR ONLINE STUDY

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Long Island University-Brooklyn and I am asking you to be a participant in my research.  This study is designed to help identify protective and risk factors that impact the psychological health of Middle Eastern/Arab American women. 

You will fill out a series of brief questionnaires.  This study will require about 45 minutes of your time.  Because the study focuses on Middle Eastern women, you are eligible to participate if you are a woman who is 18 years or older living in the United States and identify as Middle Eastern (including Arab or Arab-American from the following countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen).

If you participate, you can be entered into a raffle **to win one of twenty Amazon $20 gift cards**.  Additionally, you may find the study interesting!

You will also provide information that may help clinical psychologists learn about factors that impact the psychological health of Middle Eastern women.   Research data in this area would also provide information that would facilitate the administration of culturally informed psychotherapy in this population. 

To participate, go to:

Long story short, I've switched career paths a bunch of times and now I decided I want to get some research experience for grad school. I was wondering if anyone has any insight on people who are not Stanford undergrads or alum getting into labs (biological sciences specifically). Unfortunately, because I switched career paths so much, I have some prerequisites I have to finish at CC, so I can't apply to the full time positions for LSRP and others.

Note:  there is not much to see in the video, the audio is picked up    from  another \[illegal surveillance\] system.** See page 35 in the PDF below. He identifies himself on page 32 around 3:30+.

Excerpts of the dialogue:

1826 Gigi Hadid: Buttgieg just killed his first kid.

1827 He's standing there in shock.

1827 Peter Buttgieg: I feel soulless right now, maybe I'm better off that way.

1827 Sean? Porter: Buttgieg's actually laughing about it.

1827     Donald Reeves: Can I ask you a question? Would it be too much to ask    to  not be laughing at the fact you just killed your first kid?

1843 Gigi Hadid: The first time DeBlasio fucked a kid...

1844 ?: Retarded observation after what just happened to that kid.

1847 Gigi Hadid: Buttgieg is dancing around \[celebrating\] he killed his first kid.

1903 Donald Reeves: There's not gonna be anymore of that disgusting shit. Buttgieg made him \[the boy\] eat his own shit.

1905 Peter Buttgieg: What's the deal Christopher?

1905 Christopher Porter: That's Buttgieg, wants to know if that kid is still alive.

This semester has left me profoundly tired, mentally and physically. I sleep four hours a night and I really wish I had time to get back on my summer routine, which was so much more regimented and healthy because of my job.

6574,"Dear Yellow Jackets,

Congrats on the finish of the finals. Merry Christmas and happy break.

Need advice for two of my ""potential freshman"" friends

Background

Both of them have visited GT and love the ambiance and students body. Both of them have excellent standardized testing  scores, will be their class's valedictorian or salutatorian, have decent ECs and both of them are OOS (full fees).

Candidate A

Wants to definitely become a Doctor so Med school it is. He is super keen to come to GT but parents and friends are warning about grade deflation and high pressure at GT. The general advice given to him is to land up at one of the smaller Ivys, relatively chill, collect the 4.0/4.0 and move on to Med school. So the question is whether Med schools/Grad schools recognize that GT is much more harder than your typical Ivy in terms of grade deflation and rigor of curriculum. Other things being equal(hard work motivation etc.), Will a say 3.6 at GT be ranked superior than say a 3.9 from Brown. 

Please, the aim is not to disparage GT or Ivys but realistically figure out the trade offs. ( [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/20/why-grade-inflation-even-at-harvard-is-a-big-problem/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/20/why-grade-inflation-even-at-harvard-is-a-big-problem/)  or   [https://www.studentsreview.com/viewprofile.php3?k=1230783522&amp;u=331](https://www.studentsreview.com/viewprofile.php3?k=1230783522&amp;u=331) ).  

&amp;#x200B;

Candidate B 

Is super keen to  join GT. She is from Florida, has a number of relatives and friends in Georgia. She has allergy issues in minus zero weather (realizes that she will be miserable in cold weather Ivys) and loves hot and humid Hotlanta. Candidate has \~&gt; 75% percentile credentials.  Off-late GT has started deferring over qualified candidates in order to yield protect. Early application is already done. Candidate B wants your advice on what to do from now till Jan 18 (results date) to tell the admissions team that she is super keen and will definitely join if given a chance (please please), please don't deffer or reject thinking that the candidate will go off to Ivys instead of coming to GT.

My friend told me to just quit and take the offer at the lib. Only thing is I want to  be able to put down work on my resume and working short term is a big no to put on my resume (otherwise I’d be seen as a job hopper :( ) 
I don’t even know if I’ll continue working at the library next quarter because of classes and another commitment (but I do like how I can work on the weekends). That’s why I’m not sure if I should just stick with my dining job until the end of the quarter, put that on my resume and then just not work next quarter OR take the offer at the lib and continue working next quarter.

I know some MA/MS programs are free to enter for anyone who can get the grades (like Econ's MA) but I know the application process is a lot more involved for statistics.

I have been strictly an online student and live three hours away, so I actually have not stepped foot on campus once during my program. My parents want to see me walk, so I agreed to do it. They are flying in to meet me and my oldest son, my wife is staying back home with our two babies. 

Does anyone have any local advice for graduation day? We will get there early and expect big crowds, but anything else that would be good to know that would help us with our day for visitors to campus like us?

The whole meeting took 5 minutes, and she had me officially declared for Sociology on the spot. She then sent me to the Education office, saying I had to meet with them to declare my minor.

I met with a peer advisor, who was lovely, but couldn’t sign-off on it and could only forward it for processing to the actual advisor. She said my Education declaration could take up to two weeks.

Now I don’t want to go all entitled customer here. I understand that people are busy, departments get backlogged, welcome to college. But I can’t wrap my head around the discrepancy. The declaration paperwork only requires a look-over for correctness, a signature, and what seems to be a few strokes of the keyboard, at least from the looks of it. Why can I meet with the advisor in charge in one department and they can instantly declare me, but I can only meet with a student in the other department, and won’t be declared for up to two weeks? Is Education just a much larger major with more students? Is the declaration processing more complicated for Education on MyUCSC?

I'm questioning this because on numerous occasions, I would have liked a nice study space, with normal chairs and tables at a usable height. However, there are not many great places to plop down and do a lot of work by yourself. A lot of would-be perfect places to study at Tech are ""collaborative spaces"" or locked without reservation. 

Living on West, I feel that half the space in willage is inconvenient for studying, whether it's because it's loud, there aren't good tables with the chairs, or because it's just designed to be a common space rather than having dedicated silent study space. The next closest options are Kendeda (which is BEAUTIFUL) or the student center. But once you go inside Kendeda you quickly realize study space is almost non-existent. There's a ton of potential space to be used, but the huge classrooms are locked when not in use, and the tiny student space is filled with fancy chairs and stools. The student center faces the same problems as willage, yet arguably worse.

I fear that, as Georgia Tech constructs new buildings and renovates old ones, they're putting too much of a focus on 'collaborative' spaces and making things appear modern and attractive. I'm hopeful for the new library renewal to provide a large amount of student space. (look at this!  [https://www.bnim.com/project/price-gilbert-and-crosland-tower-library-renewal](https://www.bnim.com/project/price-gilbert-and-crosland-tower-library-renewal) ).

indian (intl) who's been accepted to c.o. 24, received my award letter today. im quite grateful for how much they're giving me, but it's still pretty tight for my parents and about 1500 dollars more than they said they were capable of in the css form. they're also not gonna pay for flight tickets etc., though this is understandable since we opted for that in the css form. 

question - is it necessary for me to get accepted somewhere else with a better financial aid package to meaningfully negotiate for better aid? how effective is that given stanford knows they're the best (???how did i get in lol???) and pretty hard to turn down? i obviously don't want to contrive any family crises to request more aid, but would really really appreciate if they met the requirements we expressed in css. what are my options here? is sending a simple appeal letter reminding them of things like my grandparents' medical expenses sufficient, or do i absolutely have to get in somewhere with better aid to send in the letter? because i really really dont wanna apply anywhere else lol.

I didn’t originally plan on transferring, hence my ~70 credits as a sophomore, but this school has captivated me and gets me invigorated for college. I blew through my first two years of university experience and still have a 4.0 GPA. 

I heard on another sub that admissions don’t care if you send an SAT score for reference if you have more than 48 credit hours at your institution, can anyone verify this for me? My SAT was 1310 junior year for reference and I plan on retaking but I’m worried they wouldn’t even care.

6760,"Hi Everybody 

I am currently in my second year here at Canada College I will be applying this year to transfer next fall as a Computer Science major BA. My first question is will I be considered competitive since I am taking the new transfer requirements that consist of python, Computer assembly line and arch, and C++. I believe that the majority of the people applying for next fall will be taking intro to Java, data structures in Java and discrete math. The reason that I am asking this question is that If I were to take the old requirements, I will have to take the courses that I am currently taking at Canada once I transfer to UCSC. My only concern is the course articulation why you may ask is that here at Canada there is only one python course but it articulates to CSE 20 instead of CSE 30, CSE 30 is a new requirement to transfer here at UCSC. I have been informed that I can test out of it which I forgot if it is either CSE 20 or CSE 30. Another course that is in the new requirements is CSE12/12L, here at Canada there is only one Computer assembly line and arch but it has never been articulated to CSE12/12L. If this two courses were not to be articulated, will I still be admitted even though there is no courses that are articulated to CSE 30 and CSE 12/12L at any community college near me like CSM and not having the minimum GPA which is 2.8 in at least 3 courses that will be completed by the end of this semester.",1,LABEL_1,0.99987143,0.00012861703,0.99987143

Tardos was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, but you’d ruin the algorithm.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually whipped out his student ID card, saying he was ready to purchase some girlfriends.

He turned to me and said “want to be a part of my stable matching?” I told him that I couldn't date someone who has shit in their hair. He said said that he washed it out in the shower.

Academically, I can barely handle the minimum unit requirement. The mindset in lecture halls feels like a ""don't ask a question unless you know you're right"" one. Along these same lines, ive found students in my major (ANS) to be competitive to a point of pushing me down mentally to step ahead. I don't feel comfortable stating that I don't know an answer anymore. All of my discussion TA's for general classes (chem, bis, ect) are international male students who can't explain things very well, and it gets frustrating very quickly (To no fault of their own, I know they are trying). I  hate the learning mindset this school has, which often doesn't leave room for mistakes and as soon as you get behind there's no returning to your original pace.

I'm depressed and The SHWC doesn't even have enough therapists to see all of us, they're booked out -2 weeks. The online resource crisis line is literally scripted and didn't help at all ""did I help you move from a 'hot moment' to a 'cool calm' today?"" (Yes, that's a quote. The whole conversation went like this). All I needed was human connection and guidance earlier than the two week waiting period they offered.

Davis is accepting more students than it can handle and it's causing issues across the board, from mental health, class impactions, and housing space. 

I don't know how you upper-grads handle this but ive just been smoking weed to manage my anxiety and depression and it's obviously not helping. (no need to lecture there, it's a short term gratifying solution, I know) I don't know what to do, I feel alone, uncared for, uncomfortable, and destined to fail. 
I regret choosing Davis and wish I had gone to CC. I think I just can't handle the pace of this school, and maybe it's just a me problem. I feel it's too late to back out or even transfer to another UC now, I'm in my second year and don't know what my options are until after break because it was the soonest appointment I could get with an academic counselor.

6979,"Hey guys,

So throughout high school, I was super passionate about music. I was heavily involved in the music program, being in my schools orchestra, marching band, jazz ensemble, and even choir. But I also focused and did well in academics. I strongly considered a music performance major, and either going down the music performance route or being a music teacher. I play violin, marching percussion (like marching snare), and electric guitar. But I caved to the pressures of my Asian parents who made it clear they were not okay with me pursuing music and I should pursue a more lucrative and practical profession, like CS. So I focused on that, and got into Berkeley.

I've been at Cal for 2.5 years now, and I'm doing kinda well academically while pursuing my CS classes. However, I genuinely hate it. Music is my true passion and what I love, and it would make me happy to drop out and pursue music full-time. I want to be a guitarist doing jazz stuff mostly, and hilariously enough, I wish I attended Berklee school of music on the east coast over Berkeley. 

However, I know quitting college and trying to make it as a musician is reckless financially, and a lot of aspiring musicians, even super talented ones, make ends meat by driving uber and lyft, doing retail jobs, etc. And if I tough it out in CS, and get the degree, I could have a CS job, even though I hate it so much, as a backup that pays pretty well and devote my entire free time to music and making that work, and I could work part-time in CS too to get some dough while trying to get an avenue into music. It's just I love music so much and hate academics and school despite being competent at academics and caved into Asian culture/parent pressures, but you need to put food on the table somehow. 

Any advice you guys would be great! And I know I'm just venting. Appreciate it :)",1,LABEL_1,0.9998787,0.00012129139,0.9998787

My roomate is having some hard times.

Everything seemed off when she returned to our room tonight in tears, her sea-green green sweatshirt soaked. I asked her why she didn’t wear a coat and if she was all right.

“I lost my best friend,” she whispered, “I’ll never see her again.”

I was taken aback as her mourning turned to rage;

“She’s the reason I’m part of my friend group! She was my identity— without her, I’m nothing! 

“I took a bathroom break from studying at Stommons, and when I returned, she was gone.”

And with those words, my roomate fainted.

7112,"You know, I haven't achieved anything significant in life. No particularly impressive sports records, no Olympiads, no out of the world scores in school or SAT. Then why would I try to be placed among immortals? Why did I spend all that money to get rejected? I don't know. I have some questions. I have a little something that drives me. It's those questions. I like the sciences. I like to study stuff. I like libraries. It's like this humongous collection of summaries of great people's life's works over hundreds, thousands of years. How wonderful does that sound. We won't get to know all of it. I was so sad when we had to choose our streams in grade 11 because I'll never know what studying microeconomics or geology is like, not in a classroom environment. We had this TV show on Nickelodeon where some dudes did some work in a workshop, and I have dreamt so many times of all the wonderful things I could do in there, of all the innovations that I could come up with, of how it's going to make life a little better for some people. I was going to choose the conventional Joint Entrance Examination path like every other High schooler in India and then I stumbled across Glorious to View, and my childhood self was like Holy shit these places actually exist! I scored terribly in class 11 because I was too enchanted by the wonderful world of CS courses on Coursera. I scored low on the SAT despite topping my maths class in school because they cut 90 marks for like 4 wrong questions in Math. I obviously don't like to think of it but deep down I know so well I'm not getting to go there. Missing out on not the academics but a community of higher thinkers, a group who's as imperfect and motivated and curious as I am. I've missed out on a lot of things in life, but this is a little different. The mods are gonna remove this for being antagonistic anyway. But to everyone who's in that place, busy being a God, and everyone who's on the other side of the fence, just trying to survive, I hope you do yourself proud, more than anyone else. The difference we seek for can come in a plethora of ways and methods. A Cornell education is just one of them. There's something in those gorges, something about that remote location, something humble about the air in that place. Something that invites you to dance. Something that beckons you to explore, something that tingles your curiosity to make you dig deeper and strive harder. I like that feeling. Ah, I'm romanticising this once again.

The main point is **there are numerous resources in colleges available to students which, in the midst of all the academic pressure and chaos, are often not publicized/made known.** As an example, Penn has a First Folio edition of Shakespeare (printed in 1623 and is the only reliable text for all of Shakespeare's 20 plays), or a digital library that allows you to rent equipments worth tens of thousands of dollars. All of my friends on campus that I've talked to did not even know of their existences, let alone actually using those resources.

7236,"Hey all,

I'm a senior who thought that Columbia SEAS would be my first choice. I was planning on EDing as a CS/Applied Math major, but I've been reading this subreddit and the Spec lately and the whole ""stress culture"" at Columbia has left me with some doubts.

1. A reason why I'm thinking of applying to Columbia is because of the Core, since I've always wanted to become exposed to the works that have changed society and also widen my perspectives intellectually. However, further research makes it seem like the Core holds a lot of students back from taking other electives related to their area of interest. Since CS majors would also have to declare a track along with their major, the heavy courseload seems to make balancing life and school extremely difficult for engineering students. Is this true? How are engineering students able to balance clubs, double majoring/minoring, the Core, and just plain having fun all at once?
2. What is your honest review of the Core coming from a STEM background? Reading Plato, Adam Smith, Descartes, etc. seems like an incredibly enriching experience, but how much does the Core detract from your major? On paper, the Core sounds great to me, but are the classes really that intellectually stimulating and easy to balance with your major? How has the Core affected your mindset on the world as an engineer, and do you believe I could have an experience like that anywhere else? Is the Core really much more different than say, taking some philosophy/classics/econ electives at Stanford? 
3. Are grades inflated or deflated in the engineering school? I've heard mixed opinions on this, but it seems like grades overall still stress students out. In terms of employability, would the existence of grade deflation hurt?
4. Many articles/reviews have also pointed out the fact that Columbia's administration is terrible and their failure to encourage community and school spirit, throwing kids into loneliness and stress. Is it really that hard to find sociable groups around campus? I'm not that interested in partying/tailgating at football games like at a flagship state school, but I still want the chances to meet new people and belong part of a tightknit, small group of friends that I'm able to rely on throughout college. I understand that Columbia does attract an individualistic student body who don't mind veering off campus into NYC, which is fine since I do see myself as an independent person. But, still would rather explore the city with a small circle of friends rather than by myself. How much is Columbia's sense of individualism really ""freedom"" rather than isolation or loneliness? 
5. There are many negatives that I've pointed out about the school, but are these just troubles of college or are they actually exclusive to Columbia? Are the negative reviews on the Spec, Niche, Unigo, etc. a result of the activist/vocal minority at Columbia, or do these opinions actually reflect the Columbian experience?",1,LABEL_1,0.9998792,0.00012086175,0.9998792

I think I may have fell into a creative arrogant trap. I’m currently in Canada at a University that seemed to have been a good option for someone who is creative and intellectual. For anyone who knows Elon Musk and his story, I quite literally thought I was clever enough to go to a harder school than Musk did in Canada but still try to transfer to a school in the US. That was a bad plan. It was appealing, who wouldn’t want to transfer from one impossible school to another and have that as their history? I then realized that this University is trying so hard to have a good reputation that it cares less about what the students actually learn than having the hardest courses. Turns out, everyone is failing their courses and everything is curved all the time. Thus, it is quite impossible to transfer as it seems that averages are nearing 60 at this school. Overall, it is a massive trap and a hellhole for someone who is creative and wants to build things. I have no time to do anything because of the massive course load and being in one of the hardest programs. Not only that but the professors at the school can barely speak English. I’m not sure what to do being someone who was chasing the reputation of the school and hoping it would be easy to transfer to a US school so I could actually enjoy world renowned professors, creative students, and time to learn. The US is rather more creative than Canada and I think I have made a bad decision. As before, I could see the path to success, now all I see is me finishing this degree then being trapped in Canada and never starting a business in the US.

You won't fail (because of the curve it's almost impossible to) but your GPA will take a hit that just isn't worth it.

Of course, it's not impossible to do well in the course if you want to overachieve, go to office hours every week and develop a relationship with the profs/TAs to understand.

2. My background is almost completely composed of programming and CS theory? I have taken a few hardware courses such as Computer Architecture, Wireless Technology and Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems as well as a couple projects but that's that.

Before I start, I know my stats aren't super outstanding, but I am getting anxiety of being locked down to NYU in the very extreme case that I do get into CMU. I don't know if my situation is special or not but it is definitely complicated. The circumstance I'm under is that I studied and lived in Vietnam for 14 years (bc I'm Vietnamese), then I moved to Singapore and studied there for 2 years under their public education system. I got an O-Level grade of 10 which isn't spectacular but its good considering where I went to Singapore. I kind of lack extracurriculars in Singapore because all the students are to prioritize their focus into the O-Level Exam. I moved over to the US mid-year Junior year, so my Quarter 1 grades are missing from my GPA. Moreover, my school wouldn't add my grades from Singapore so my GPA isn't the actual GPA until the colleges I'm applying to do the calculations. I am doing the best I can right now at a competitive school and trying to use my senior year to boost my GPA. I hope y'all can help. Thank you! 

Here are my stats:

GPA (unweighted): 3.67 (not my actual GPA since I moved from Singapore to the USA and the school didn't consider my grades from my school in Singapore. 

SAT: 1420 

O-Level Grade: 10 (O-Level is like A-Level but for Sophomore Kids, it's much like a high school diploma over here. It is a national exam that over 80000 kids in Singapore take in order to continue their higher education)

Extracurriculars: 

\- Student council (Freshman and Sophomore Year in Singapore) (Kinda like class council)

\- Person-In-Charge of Robotics Club (Freshman and Sophomore Year)

\- Member of Executive Committee of Student Council (Sophomore Year) (So I was in charge of an aspect of the student council and oversaw the members in that group)

\- Participated in SASMO (Singapore Asian School Mathematics Olympiad) 

\- Participated in Research Competition at a Local Polytechnic (Singapore)

\- Participated in National Robotics Programming Competition (Singapore)

\- Did a summer research program at NYU (researching in fluid dynamics)

Hi all, I am a student conducting a private study on **student loans and how to make them more student-friendly**. As a part of my research, I am conducting a survey that I would love if everyone could fill out. As long as you have a loan or are thinking about a loan, you are eligible! Also, everyone who takes it will be entered to win **multiple $50 Amazon gift cards!** All survey responses will be kept completely confidential, as name and e-mail are NOT being collected. Also, all questions are optional, so feel free to not answer any question that you do not want to! Thanks for helping me improve the student loan process, I really appreciate it!

**TLDR: Take my confidential survey about student loans and you'll have a chance to win $50!**

I understand he wants all HashMap objects built with the default constructor to use a default hash function that we write. He also wants another constructor that makes a HashMap that uses a particular hash function. How are keys supposed to be hashed by a member variable function if the HashMap is initialized with no keys/values. HashMaps are initialized with some HashFunction and also 10 Node pointers that each point to nullptr. Shouldn't a hash function be used when you add keys to the HashMap so it should be a part of the add function? How/when do you access the HashFunction that is part of the HashMap object? I'm just confused about how we are supposed to use a HashFunction that is part of an initialized object rather than just a member function part of the class.

7600,"The dining halls at UCI try their best to appeal to a lot of different  tastes and appetites with their food choices, but sometimes you want  something more filling or satisfying, but don't want to go to UTC or  another place to get food. UCI Test Kitchen serves to help that problem,  creating new food ideas with ingredients found throughout the dining  hall stations.

For this edition of UCI Test Kitchen, we'll be kicking off the weekend with ice cream sodas, including the beloved root beer float!

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

2-3 scoops of vanilla ice cream (use chocolate for the ice cream soda variant; Honeycakes station)

1/2 glass of root beer (root beer float; any soda fountain with a touchscreen)

1/4 glass sparkling water (ice cream soda; any soda fountain with a touchscreen)

1/4 glass milk (ice cream soda; various)

1/4 glass chocolate milk (ice cream soda; various)

Whipped cream (optional; Second Breakfast station)

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:**

1a.) If making an ice cream soda, fill the glass about halfway with a mixture of sparkling water, milk, and chocolate milk, then mix until foamy

1b.) If making a root beer float, simply fill a glass halfway with root beer (with an optional added flavor of vanilla)

2.) Carefully transfer the ice cream from the bowl into the glass

3.) Top with whipped cream and any other toppings

&amp;#x200B;

Most everyone has had (and loves) root beer floats, but not as many people know of its lesser tasted version, the chocolate ice cream soda (pictured here). Both have their own signature flavor profile, so try out both with different toppings and soda-to-ice cream ratios and see which one you like best! Enjoy!

*\*Note: Some ingredients depend on what options the dining hall puts out for the day, so some parts of the recipes may not be readily available for  every time of day. Most recipes/locations are based off of Brandywine's stations.*

On the official Stanford webpage, they state: ""The Computer Science Department does not offer financial support for MS students"". However, on the same webpage, they also state that limited CA/RA resources (tuition + stipend funding) are sometimes available to Master's students once matriculated.

On the application website, it asks the following required question:

""Are you applying for financial aid such as fellowships or assistantships from Stanford University (e.g., Departmental funding)? - Yes/No""

I'm not sure which one to pick right now. The reason being that I think picking ""Yes"" will significantly hurt my chances in admissions, since Stanford clearly states not to expect funding for MS students. However, I'm planning on working hard if I get in and secure CA/RA funding. If I check ""No"" on the app, I'm worried that I will be barred from ever applying for CA/RA funding, since the department can point to my application and say ""look here, you clearly said you're not applying for financial aid"".

7745,"Hi there. 

About a week ago, I was considering taking a leave of absence, and submitted a request on Albert. I did not turn in any of the paperwork that my school (Tisch) requires, and did not even offer a reason as to why I was requesting a leave. In that time, I decided that a leave wasn't truly what I wanted, and I quickly emailed my advisor asking how to proceed in reversing the leave. She responded saying she would correspond with someone else on the next move. This was last Thursday. 

My advisor nor the person she CC'd got back to me, I (regretfully) assumed that since I didn't turn in any actual paperwork the request would likely get denied or simply wouldn't process. Flash forward to today, and my request was approved. 

I'm kind of freaking the fuck out. I'm un-enrolled from all my classes and am not able to even view my past schedule. I emailed my advisor, as well as the Registrar office, and left a voicemail for someone at Tisch to respond to, but obviously it's past 5 and no one will respond until tomorrow. 

So my big question in all of this is - am I completely fucked? Has anyone been in a situation similar to this before? To complicate things further, I am currently in housing and the prospect of getting kicked out is giving me terrible anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

PLEASE HELP! 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I requested a leave of absence on Albert, changed my mind, told my advisor, assumed we were cool. We are definitely not cool and now I am unenrolled for the Fall semester.",1,LABEL_1,0.9998507,0.00014932449,0.9998507

I am studying astronomy and physics at a school that isn’t prestigious at all, but it does have pretty decent rankings for those programs. Columbia has been my dream school, and unfortunately I got rejected applying last year as an incoming freshman. I was wondering some things: 

a. What are people’s thoughts on the physics/astronomy program at columbia?
b. I know columbia has the core. I was wondering if I transferred in after two years, I could still graduate in the next two years? 
c. Would it be better to stay at my current school and graduate without loans, or to transfer to columbia and accrue some student debt?
d. If I got rejected applying as a first year last year, would I even have a chance at getting in as a transfer?

7751,"I'm aware that people have made numerous posts similar to this one so I apologize if this is redundant.

If you don't like reading controversial stuff, then don't read below. 

**Context:** 

2nd year engineering (M)

**Detail:**

So, I've been speaking with a few individuals at this school and I find that I don't 'click' with anyone because we don't have shared mutual interests, so here are mine:

* Philosophy 
* Economics (very little)
* Politics
* Foreign policy

Warning: libertarian rambling below.

**More Detail**

So, I've decided to give some selections regarding what my viewpoints are:

Philosophy:

* reality exists, man can perceive reality, reason is the means of perceiving reality, we have free will
* God doesn't exist, faith is immoral
* mysticism and totalitarianism are linked; for example, Nazi Germany primarily resulted because of Christian faith/self-sacrifice (Plato)
* rights belong to man because man can reason, non-human animals have no rights
* rights are the property of individuals
* taxation is immoral

Economics

* The mixed-economy results in racism. Since people have to create political unions to organize for 'rights,' they do so on grounds related to race. Thus, the lack of free markets encourages racism.

Politics:

* I believe hate speech is free speech
* there shouldn't be as many regulations. for example, there should be no American Medical Association, which is just a cartel. People should be able to receive surgeries from people who have no experience at all so long as they consent
   * corporations 'buy' the gov. to grant them favors. regulations are used by the wealthy to keep competition down.
* cocaine, suicide,etc should all be made legal (although I think of them as immoral)
* i support clean energy but environmental policy would unintentionally harm the poor so I'm against it
* I believe gun rights are a technicality but today gun violence is just a means of political demagoguery
* not planning to vote during the next election. 
* democracy is not inherently good. an ideal gov. would be more akin to a confederacy
* universities should be privatized and deregulated to lower cost and increase quality

Foreign Policy

* should cut military funding by over 70%
* should return from middle east
* unsure regarding israel/palestine. support peaceful resolution.

Social

* racism is bad but those who seek to punish racism have gone the wrong route (I believe in forgiveness and sympathy as a means of ending racism, not totalitarianism)
* i think that women should have the ability to have an abortion during the first trimester. second tri. is a technicality. third should be illegal.
* immigration is a technicality. moderation",1,LABEL_1,0.9998607,0.00013928986,0.9998607

7789,"MESSAGE TO EDUCATORS

Hello,

I am writing to educators, academics, and academic institutions to encourage the adoption of a course of study related to the issue of “ufos” (the most commonly used term though the United Stated government and many others today prefer the term “unidentified aerial phenomenon” or “uap”).

Despite the “breaking news” on this subject since the NY Times report of December 2017 (when they identified a Pentagon UFO study program and released Navy pilot film), signs of a continued avoidance to addressing this subject remain.

Nevertheless, there are beginning signs of a growing recognition of the need to address this, no matter where this leads. In September 2019, Politico’s Bryan Bender noted an interesting statement by the Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee, Matk Walker (R-NC). Walker had been making inquiries in a partially frustrated attempt to determine whether the Chinese or Russians have made an extraordinary and dramatic leap in technology. It appears he may be realizing something else may be happening:

“In a recent interview, Walker, a former pastor, also acknowledged that he is open to the possibility that there are no easy explanations—or the answers could change how humanity perceives the known universe.”

Since preparing a course of study for a long-ignored subject may be a difficult and confusing process at the start, I want to identify a resource that can serve as a good starting point for that:

THE UFO ENCYCLOPEDIA, 3rd Edition, Two Volumes, edited by Jerome Clark. (Make sure you get the 2018 released 3rd edition; published by OMNIGRAPHICS.)

There are very limited UFO courses in a very small number of academic institutions; these may serve as helpful models.

There are also a few expensive online UFO courses of study.

Since I have had 50 plus years of intermittently engaging in a concentrated study of the subject, I began in late May 2019 to write educational content for different aspects of this subject:

http://cosmic-pluralism-studies.academy

As stated there, the material can be freely adopted, or utilized in any way, without attribution.

Finally, it would be great to see academic institutions as a safe refuge for encounter experiencers to relate their experiences in a setting that adheres to strict standards in research, something often lacking in the uncredentialed arena of ufology.

Thankyou for considering this.

I am currently a senior applying to UPenn ED for Computer Science, and I am having difficulty choosing between a CSCI major and a CSAS major.

For context, I take the IB curriculum, and I take Math, Physics, Economics, Computer Science, Chinese, and English Literature. I have a keen interest for Computer Science especially after I interned at an AI company, and I am hoping to go into the direction of a software engineer/data scientist.

I've looked at the CIS website and my understanding is that CSCI is the more common Computer Science major, whereas ASCS has a lot more flexibility with other disciplines. It also seems as though CSCI is much more demanding than ASCS. I would assume that I would be more suited towards the CSCI program since my current courses are heavily STEM based, but I also am interested in the humanities, hence my interest in ASCS.

As of now, I am leaning towards CSCI and then perhaps switching to the other if I change my mind, but I was wondering how easy it is to switch between the two? Is there a difference in the stereotype of people that take these two different programs? Also, if anyone has an idea of which program has more competitive admissions, that would be great.

TL;DR? Free photos for you, in exchange for posing for a photo on Wednesday, November 27th, from 10:00 AM until 2:30 PM. Held at Studio 140 inside the Media Center and Communication Building. First come, first served.

Friendly neighborhood /u/CruzedDude here with a fantastic offer. A free photo for you to do whatever you want. Yup. That's right: free.

Desperately need to update that aging tinder profile? Maybe the insta feed needs a different angle? Or just nothing better to do on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving break?

The catch is I'd like you to pose for a photo. The pose in question is incredibly simple in nature: give the camera the bird, while saying, ""~~Fuck you~~!"" or your favorite swear word.

You may be saying to yourself, ""This is quite the odd request. I wonder why in the world would this otherwise normal person, resort to taking photos containing such unpleasant language, and vulgar gestures?"" The answer to that is simple: a recent critique became just a little too heated. After talking to a grad student that I have better rapport with, we agreed that [this is how](https://youtu.be/kjS6bQ5OQ-o?t=40) most critiques in VisArts typically are conducted. We chuckled, but the conversation birthed this fun project.

So if you feel like you like to be apart of gallery, which I have no intention of reproducing beyond my own personal portfolio (treat this post as a form of promissory estoppel), stop by Studio 140 at the [Media Center and Communication Building](https://goo.gl/maps/E6ozwVyvBzVBfvqy7), on Wednesday, November 27th, from 10:00 AM to 2:30 PM. The format will be first come, first serve. 1 pose will equal a photo of your choice (more if there isn't much of a line). You'll get a RAW file via email. 

I want this to be clear: I will not be editing your photos for you. Every digital media lab computer already lets you do that for free with Photoshop, and I do have other classwork that demands my time.

There will be colored gels on hand to select from to give you photos a bit of unique identity. And the only dress code will be that you're wearing clothes, I may be an artist, but I'm not an *artist*.

7918,"Hi guys. So I am currently a community college student looking to transfer next fall...UCLA being the top choice \*wish me luck for admissions ripppp\*\*. However, I am pretty torn about my major.... I have changed it multiple times from majors such as political science, criminal justice, etc... all within the social sciences. I've never really found a major that I am genuinely passionate about and the uncertainty that comes with that is so stressful. I definitely am not suited for a STEM major. Not going to lie, I somewhat cherry-picked anthropology just because I was running out of time and needed to choose a field with a reasonable amount of major prep courses so that I can transfer in time (because I need to submit apps soon). Not to say that I do not enjoy the anthropology classes that I am taking, but I have a difficult time believing that it will really get me anywhere in life as it is not a traditionally respected major such as CS or Bio. Ultimately, my end goal is to go pursue law school after my undergrad, in which they do accept students of all majors. BUT will the skills acquired from an anthro degree even be beneficial or worthwhile? Part of the reason I chose this major was due to how fascinated I was with an anthropologist's perspective... being able to objectively analyze situations/people/etc. and effectively communicate their thoughts. But I can't help feeling a level of embarrassment when people ask me what my major is because they are quick to make negative assumptions. That sounds extremely ridiculous because I know that I am a hardworking student who is dedicated...but society has gotten to me sadly and I try to fit into other's mold when the only person I should work to impress is myself (and my future employer of course LOL). When i do transfer, regardless if that is at UCLA or at another UC campus, I am afraid I will be unhappy and that I have wasted all this time and money... i guess the main purpose of this post is the question: **Is an anthropology degree a waste of time if I am trying to pursue law?** \- sincerely, a confused 19 yr old gal :(",1,LABEL_1,0.99988794,0.000112042,0.99988794

7974,"Hi everyone, 

As I’m sure you’ve noticed, there have been tons of petitioners flooding campus talking about government bailouts, climate change, and energy efficiency standards. Currently a battle ensues between the coal and nuclear lobbyists and the environmental organizations.

Earlier this year, House Bill 6 was signed by the governor allowing two of Ohio’s coal companies and two nuclear companies to disregard Ohio’s energy efficiency standards. In addition, they are increasing Ohioan’s energy taxes to provide money for four governmental bailouts of those same companies. When a bill is signed by the governor it goes straight into effect without receiving votes from citizens. 

There are two petitions currently floating around campus: one by the environmentalists and one by the coal/nuclear lobbyists. The environmentalists are petitioning to gain ballot access on a referendum to house bill 6. This allows a vote on Election Day for, or against, this bill, hoping to kill it at the polls. These petitioners are identifiable by a large paper packet attached to their petitions, containing: an explanation to what the petition is, a certification from the attorney general that this is a legal petition, and they always ask if you’re a registered voter of Ohio before allowing you to sign the petition. Some of them are paid, some are volunteers. However, NONE of them are paid per signature. The other petition is from the coal and nuclear companies who hope to stop the referendum from reaching the polls because they assume people will vote against it. They are identifiable by one page petitions with a statement of certification at the bottom. They are not verified by the attorney general, so have no seal of approval to verify they are real. This is a political tactic called blocking. Blocking is used to confuse the public into thinking they already signed the petition so there is no need to sign again if they are ever approached by the environmentalists. People doing this are called blockers, and are paid $8 per signature. They typically do not ask if you’re registered to vote. 

I hope this clears things up!",1,LABEL_1,0.99984556,0.00015440487,0.99984556

Basically, I think being an RA for 2-3 years is a little bit selfish and probably shouldn’t be allowed. I mean, maybe if the RA hiring process was more anonymous my feelings would be different, but the way it’s set up now, it’s super easy to just hire your friends and re-hire each other. Year after year of this means that less and less people have a legitimate chance at being recognized for having good RA’ing skills. Like, okay, maybe it’s reasonable for people to RA for two years, maybe they’re really passionate about that themed hall or maybe they’re crazy fucking good at it. I get that. But don’t you think three years is kinda pushing it? Like you get three years of free housing just because your friend lowkey tag-teamed you in? 

I’m not trying to say that being an RA is easy, I’m sure it’s really stressful and taxing and justifiably worth the free housing compensation.

* Study boxes for things like waffles, they look even paperier? I assume the plastic top goes in recycle?
* Bags for chips/popcorn have to be thrown out, right? (Does this mean UCLA will get rid of them within a year to be ""100% eco-friendly by 2020"")
* Cardboard pizza boxes...I figured these were compostable but apparently you're supposed to take them apart and recycle them? According to a sign on the trash chute
* If there's a significant amount of food in any of the above doesn't that make them non-recyclable? 
* Receipts/classwork is paper so it definitely gets recycled??? Right??
* Technically the big black trash bags aren't compostable so can I really drop a bag full of compostable items down the compost chute??? Doesn't this defeat the entire point

Reusing passwords, that's no fun…

This makes it easy for hacker bums.

Here at cyber we want to relay,

Some password tips to keep the spooks away!

&amp;#x200B;

\- Use a password manager application. You only need to remember one password and the application will create unique, complex and long passwords for every website.

\- Never use the same password on multiple sites, a password manager will help you with this!

\- Avoid passwords based on a dictionary word or something about you. A password manager will ALSO help you with this, awesome!

\- Enable multi-factor authentication on any site that has it available.

8084,"Hi guys, 

As you can tell, I'm a senior in high school. From freshman through junior year, my grades were all A's with a total of 3 B's on my transcript. I worked pretty hard and I tried my best. My academics were my focus and I tried to take as many rigorous courses as I could. However, this year, my grades are slipping. It is NOT due to senioritis. I have gotten two major leadership roles this year (president of a club and major leadership role in JROTC), and I am taking 6 AP classes at the moment. I have never taken this many all in one year before. But because of that, I have 2 B's and a C right now. My B's are in AP Chem and AP calc, and my C is in AP Physics mechanics. I'm applying as a life science major and it is not physics-heavy at all so I know my strong suit does not need to be in physics. I applied to Cornell ED and I am worried that on the chance that I get in, all my hard work will have been for naught because of  my senior year transcript and they'll rescind my acceptance. 

Were any of you in my situation as a HS senior? Will this happen? Any help or info would be appreciated. My anxiety is just through the roof right now and I don't think my grades will change drastically. Also I'm sorry if these types of posts aren't allowed, I can delete them if need be.",1,LABEL_1,0.99987817,0.00012178864,0.99987817

8113,"Story: I submitted all the documents needed for determining eligibility in June for taking summer classes. I'm a student diagnosed (at a young age) with ADHD and I have received accommodations at my previous schools. I submitted documents and met with XXXX (I do not know if I'm allowed to state the name of the specialist) at the initial intake appointment and was stated I can get accommodations on a provisional basis. After that, I tried contacting her several times (since mid-august) even dropped in at the OSD office several days but no response. The front desk and call answering people kept telling me I cannot meet until after Sept 2nd week. I explained to them several times the summer class is over by that time and why would I need to meet then. 

My final attempt of trying to contact: I dropped into the office still not allowed to meet so I called after one-hour, same response then called again after 3-4 hours (a different person answered) started giving me the same typical story you have to make an appointment bla bla... and I responded back saying you guys keep saying you don't have appointments then how can i meet..... I finally said a bit angrily I need you to transfer me to this person and the person on the line responded back saying she is busy and I told the girl on the phone tell her that I'm calling regarding a summer class and that I need a response. 

She took my name and then finally transferred and here she responds to me I will submit docs to the committee but I cannot guarantee you will get any accommodations (My first thought: was she thinking I gave docs for her to hold on to them or something and what the hell was she doing without submitting docs to committee all this time). She responds to me that my documents are years old (All medical docs submitted were within the last 10 months). I had patience and asked her can you proceed with the current school accommodations letter and the submitted docs and then within 2days I was approved minimum accommodations and she itself told to me meet a different specialist (IDK why).

Long story short: I completely felt like she completely ignored (neglected needs) me on purpose but IDK if that's how the OSD office at UCSD works since this was my first time interacting with the office. I honestly feel bad for those students that cannot get services even with documented disabilities since they have to go through specialists like her.  

OSD office at UCSD should have a better screening process when hiring specialists like her and higher-ups need to stop acting like you don't know/ see these.

Anyway, I need a B- and C+ in Stats 20 and Economics 100A to meet the cap (they can be interchangeable) but based on distributions/averages it looks like it'd be more likely to get a B- in Econ 100A and a C+ in Stats 20 because the average in 100A is a B and the average in Stats 20 is a B-. 

I kind of wanted to get higher because premed (and maybe law school) but oh well, I'm not that great at econ.

Anyway, I felt a bit shaken walking out of the midterm because I struggled a bit with the last problem (and definitely BS'd the last 5 points and more likely than not made other errors) but at the same time I don't think I *totally failed* (as in I didn't feel like I made *everything* up and didn't write BS down for *every* problem). 

So my questions are:

1) Is it doable to kinda fail every exam and still get a B- or C+ in the class?

2) Does Acland curve generously?

&gt;""NR"" = An ""NR"" means ""no report."" An ""NR"" can only be assigned by the instructor. An ""NR"" is not calculated into the student's GPA, except for certain careers where it is converted to an ""ED"". An ""NR"" is subject to lapsing to a failing grade (""ED"") for certain careers.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; ""ED"" = An ""ED"" means ""unofficial drop."" An ""ED"" is calculated into the student's GPA as a failing grade. 

I will email the professor soon, don't wanna bug him when he's celebrating the holidays, especially because he clearly told me that he will report it late. I'm just concerned it's going to turn into an F.

Anyone else experience something like this? How long does it take for an NR turn into a failing grade?

* On academic history, it doesn't show anything. Grade is left blank.
* Only found out because I ran the degree audit and it says NR.
* Doesn't show up on late grades",1,LABEL_1,0.9998622,0.00013774779,0.9998622

The more time I've spent talking to people at Cornell and browsing this sub, the more I think that Let Them Eat Cake needs to be a real club. 

(Here is the link for those who didn't see my previous post)
https://reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/d894s0/new_club_idea_let_them_eat_cake/

There are not enough resources for Cornell students to abate their loneliness or stress from everything that happens here. While I thought of the club as something that specifically goes against the notion of exclusivity, I now think that it could focus more on inclusivity and making sure that there's a place for everyone.

Of course, everyone would still be welcome to come and enjoy cake (please do), but my hope is that all of the people who have felt or expressed loneliness here at Cornell could find solace through this club.

On that note, I would love to make this club a real thing, but I don't feel like I can do everything on my own. There's a fair amount of planning that would need to go into doing everything for this club. Would any of you guys be interested in helping me out?

Feel free to comment or message me if you might want to help out. I think that meeting as a group and figuring everything out would probably be the best way to take tangible steps towards making the club.",1,LABEL_1,0.99986786,0.00013217462,0.99986786

Likewise, when youre feeling like shit its really hard for me to resist hugging you and telling you everythings going to be okay. We have so much in common its crazy and I wish that we could spend more time together outside of class.

Recently its become clear to me through certain events that we're classmates first and (barely) friends second, and I get it. I dont view myself too highly, so the idea of someone liking me as much as I like them is completely foreign to me. I just needed to write this as a form of closure where I could lay this all out at once and put it to rest.

I know that we all-too-often see posts in here detailing the horrors of mental health services on campus, and I was wondering if it would be helpful to collect experience stories as well as a specific list of issues that might help pinpoint actionable changes.

It seems pretty commonly understood that the mental health system at Tech is inadequate for students' needs.  I can't help but wonder if this is finally an opportunity to make our voices heard?

Of course, he is lying a little. Our test room ran out of tests twice, and the test was supposed to start at 730, but we ended up starting at 755, which he gave us until 900, but everyone had to make it to their next classes, so people starting leaving at 850. The test was supposed to be 80 minutes, but in actuality we had around 55-60 minutes. I think it’s unfair, but what should I do about it. I felt like if I had extra time I could have gone back and thought out my answers and checked answers, but I felt rushed, so my performance was bad. I don’t know if telling the professor is worth it. Or if he even cares? Is he going to take the TAs words or believe what we have to say? Any suggestions?

8305,"Do y'all know that one African American woman that swipes people into John Jay? She has short hair and glasses. Well I think she is excessively rude. I understand that she deals with hundreds (if not thousands) of people a day, but there's no need to make me feel like an idiot or a child everytime I entire the dining hall. If she was just DMV level rude I would be fine, but this is next level. Here are some examples:

- Very recently I asked about the meal options for restrictive diets and she quickly said ""I'm not telling you, it's none of your business. It doesn't apply to you"". Immediately she assumed my religion and dietary restrictions based on my appearance. The options very well could have applied to me as I have both Jewish and Muslim family members. 

- Another day she handed me back the wrong ID and actually tried to argue with me that it was mine. I don't know what was implied by her assumption of my appearance again, but I don't think I looked anything like the person on the wrong ID she handed me. Needless to say I was offended and embarrassed by the scene she caused.

- Just today she tried to tell me that I was returning my EcoReps box incorrectly, when just days prior SHE is the one who rudely told me to do it that way. 

There are so many more rude things she has said and done to me in that short window of time from swiping in to exiting. 

And I'm not normally a complainer or one to get offended, but this is just irritating. I'm definitely not spoiled either. She just makes me feel stupid and uncomfortable while I'm just trying to eat.

Everyone else in John Jay is so nice. Particular the woman that works behind the grain bowl station and the woman at the action station. They really make up for the swiping lady's bullshit.

TL; DR is there any way to file a complaint against rude workers like her. Really it's just her. And maybe a way to submit compliments for good staff members. Also, has anyone had a similar experience with her or someone else?",1,LABEL_1,0.9998698,0.00013014744,0.9998698

2. If there is reading material, read it before the lesson of that material
3. If professors lecture in a certain outline, take notes in the same way
4. After each class, clean up notes + identify things that were not understood
   1. – take these things to office hours / discussions
   2. – combine lecture notes with reading notes
5. Review notes before a discussion class
6. Keep all loose paper from a class in class folder
7. Turn off phone while studying or keep it away
8. Before a party, Netflix, or any distraction be completely done with school work for the day

However, I was a little taken aback to see how the student body treated the author of that piece, their fellow student, with such open and brazen contempt in the Facebook comment section.

This is my first year here at Penn as a master’s student and the student body here seems to be more mean-spirited than I anticipated. There are ways to disagree with someone’s argument without completely denigrating them. 

P.S. There are actually arguments in favor of giving legacies a leg-up in admissions. As the author alluded to, legacies are more likely to donate to the university, which benefits all who attend.

Seeing as I graduated in Spring and am starting at a real job soon, I'm hanging up my hat. It's been an interesting experience seeing how these forums operate. Good work and good luck to our newer mods. I'm excited to check back in (under a new reddit acct) and see what the school's up to.

8472,"This is just a rant. Things I wanted to shout out from the top of the Clock Tower, but obviously never did. Here goes.

If you've been to PSB or Clark Hall, by the physics office, you'll see quite a few posters saying ""physics department cares"", ""how are you? No, really, how are you?"", ""Physics is inclusive"" and what not. Everyday I see those and I think to myself, ""how hypocritical can they get?"". 

I didn't come here expecting a romantic grad life, working on world-changing stuff and all. But I did want to survive. And from my first day of interactions with the professors, I've been constantly discouraged. My already low self-esteem didn't help either. Surely, professors only have the students' best interests at heart. I was so naïve I actually trusted them. I guess I wasn't used to this level of elitism because all through my school and my undergrad, I was constantly encouraged and I was really lucky to have good professors who actually cared. 

I listened. Mostly because I was hoping to work with them. ""We will deem you worthy of being considered if you prove yourself exceptional in your battles"", they said. ""I'll prove myself, elders"", I said. I did not. I won't say I'm the tail of the class, that's just hanging on, but I'm not the head either. More of the underbelly. And it definitely isn't because I'm not working hard. Despite all the corny pep talk that people will give you, I've realised that you can't always achieve what you want by working hard enough. 

Now, the ingredients are just right for my mental decline. A lot of stressed out students seek asylum at Cornell health and I did, too. I had to because I was already on medication. Need to get my pills somewhere. They're a whole different clump of unprofessionalism. Appointments are insanely hard to get, nothing ever happens on my time, and I've even had to miss a few doses because they couldn't get my medication ready on time. 

That was last year. Come summer, there's a hiatus. The sun, the birds, the breeze, the waterfalls. And poof, it's gone. Another bout of the grind starts. And I can see myself going down the same road again.

 I'm not sure where to go from here. 

I didn't want to put down people who actually do care, maybe I'm just unlucky in that I keep meeting those who only turn away. The professors that I've met don't have the slightest inkling about how to help someone, I don't expect them to actively do anything, just listen. 

I don't wish to be a drag but I was told by my psychologist that talking about it more freely would help and I don't have any other platforms. So, thou art my heathen.

If you've read till here, thank you for that. If you haven't that's okay.

State the item that was lost, where and approximately what time you found it, and whether or not it was returned to a lost and found location (e.g. UCIPD).

**Is my schedule doable?**

We can't exactly say what's best for you, but you can consider a couple things: Generally speaking, GEs will be easier than Math/Science/CS courses. 8 am classes are going to be tougher on you than late 5pm+ classes, while approximately noontime is generally the sweet spot. Taking around 3-4 classes (12-18 units) is a good amount and while taking more classes is manageable, it will very likely be tough. If you are very used to studying and high workloads and want to get your credits ASAP, then go for it. Remember that since we're on a quarter systems, classes go by very quickly.

Please look like you are interested in working for the department and read the department’s website. (Google is a wonderful tool). A well written cover letter that correlates your skills and experience with the job description will get you far. We need to know why you want to work in the department, what are your professional goals. (Never say that you want the Penn benefits, we already know that, we want to know more about what kind of challenges you are looking for in your career and why you think working in this department is interesting.) This is Penn and strong writing and communication skills are a necessity for any job, demonstrating these skills in your cover letter is the best way for you to tell us how your skills will benefit the department and why you want to do this type of work, etc. If you are unsure how to write a clear cover letter, Google it! There are plenty of examples out there to give you a jumping off point. Next, make sure your resume is up to date, use the correct formatting so it is streamlined and clear. We do not want to see an eight page resume (double spaced with weird formatting), it’s a big distraction, and as a hiring officer trying to screen hundreds of applications, these get trashed first. Streamline your resume so it is easy to read and get someone to proof read it before you upload it to the job portal. Your resume should not be longer than one page (unless your employment history supports more pages or you have publications to list).  Again, if you are unsure how to format your resume correctly, Google it! Happy job hunting and GOOD LUCK!!!",1,LABEL_1,0.9998632,0.00013676312,0.9998632

8497," “I would much rather my own children interact with drugs than with the police.”

That statement comes from Columbia University Professor Carl Hart in a recent *Washington Post* [**op-ed**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/10/05/ivy-league-professor-i-would-much-rather-my-own-children-interact-with-drugs-than-with-the-police/) that he penned arguing “the killing of black people by the police has been on a regular schedule.”

Psychology Professor Hart writes that drug effects are “predictable,” but encounters with police “often” end with dead black people.

Dr. Hart, the first black professor tenured in the natural sciences at Columbia University, teaches a psychology course titled “Drugs and Behavior,” and is known for [**his research**](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/fac-bios/HartC/faculty.html) in narcotics and drug addiction – both from a scholarly angle as well as personal experience.

“I speak candidly about my past and who I am,” Hart writes in the op-ed. “In fact, ‘High Price,’ my science memoir, is one of the required readings for \[my\] course. In it, I detail my imperfections and past drug use and sales. I also lay out a blueprint for how one can succeed as a scientist and academic in a world that despises one’s people.”

8567,"Hey bruins, I've been accused of soliciting donations during my final exam (using a clipboard) by another student. I had a clipboard in my seat faced down but didn't even look at it or touch it once throughout the exam. The bossman (professor) himself said that he did not witness anything but since I've been reported by another student, then he will be referring me to the Dean of Charitable Acts for resolution. I did ask ""Scuse me boss, can I ask you a question"" to my TA, but it was about the exam, not donations. I did not solicit donations, as I would rather go broke than to do so as my integrity is priceless, but what's the process now? Naturally, I will deny any wrongdoing, but I have a few questions regarding the process now:

1. What happens when you meet with the Dean of Charitable Acts? What does s/he say to you?

2. Are you assumed to be innocent until proven guilty?

3. Is the burden of proof on the accuser/professor?

4. I know that if the Dean of C.A. determines that there is not enough evidence, then they can dismiss the case. How likely is this, especially if it's just hearsay from another student and the professor or TA didn't see anything. (https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/flowchart.pdf)

5. Would it be possible to show my donation logs or my (legally obtained) solicitation license? Would this help my case to prove my innocence?

6. What is the best way to prove my innocence, especially since it's just hearsay from everybody?

7. Am I able to ask bossmen questions or even know who the bossman is that accused me?

If you have any experience with the Donation Integrity process or have been through it yourself, please share! Thanks y'all!

EDIT: I didn’t bring a backpack to any of my finals that day. I only had my bulletproof vest, my champagne glass, and my clipboard. The clipboard kept falling out of my vest (I got a pretty huge clipboard) so I just picked it up as the exam started and put it down on my seat without a second thought and continued with my exam. At no point did I touch the clipboard or even look at it.

EDIT: I just went into my donation logs. I went back to the day of my exam and during the exam time, it showed that there was 0 activity for any donations or ATM withdrawals or any suspicious questions asked of bossmen at all. It also showed that I received zero dollars during the exam. My clipboard has every donation that I have ever received and records of every student stopped, so this is irrefutable evidence that I did not solicit donations.",1,LABEL_1,0.9997907,0.00020933371,0.9997907

How is this currents schedule for Spring as an EE:

ECE 2026 - Lee &amp; Krudsyz

ECE 2040 - Geoffrey Li

ECE 2035 - Linda Wills

MATH 2551 - Undecided (Hao Liu, Shuenn, Lubinsky but 8AMs tho)

For reference, taking cs1332, ece2020, diff eq, and phys2 this semester.

(1) I was going to originally put ECE 2031 in place of MATH 2551 and take multi. over SOUP but have been advised by several people against it, especially with 2026. But I kinda want 2031 to be able to take 3040 in Fall 2020. Thoughts?

(2) Still undecided between 2035 and 2036. 2036 seems more fun with more usage of the mbed kit but at the same time, I've heard I wouldn't learn much at all especially having taken CS1331 and am planning to take ECE 4180 in the future anyway. Aside from C/Assembly vs. C++, what other content differences are there in the two courses and for those of you already familiar with Object-Oriented Programming, do you feel like you gained anything from the 2036? I see 2026 is concurrent prereq for 2036 so was wondering if y'all actually did any DSP or EE-specific coding in 2036 that would be valuable.

I was told by several different people that I should try to use CPT as it’d be good to have all of OPT left when I graduate in 2022. The thing is I did a lot of research and I’m still confused af on how they work especially here at Tech.

First of all, is it actually true that I should go for CPT? I read that the internship would need to count towards my degree, so I should register it through C2D2. But what does that even mean?? So do I get credit counted as electives or something? Does that imply I couldn’t get paid? Also, about the whole process: do I just apply to companies and then after I get an offer I apply for CPT at Tech? Is that how it works?

Another thing: I was told that the companies wouldn’t need to sponsor me since I’m a sophomore and it would be just an internship with extremely low chances of them offering me a full job after I graduate. Is that true? If anyone can answer any of the questions that’d be great! Also any advice you have on what I should do (like CPT or OPT) would be greatly appreciated... thanks!!

8702,"I want to preface this post by saying that I know my opinions are **widely held** throughout the Stanford community, I just wanted to create a post that would help visitors and ProFros know what the best options are for food on campus!

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Arrillaga**: the food here is sooo good! The chicken is nice and juicy, the building is so large, and the staff are so friendly. The attribute that puts Arrillaga over the top is their garden, which grows all the food served in the dining hall. It is huge and you won't have any trouble finding a seat. 10/10
2. **FloMo**: I love the view in this dining hall and the fact that the name is an abbreviation is so cool! I haven't tried the food yet, but the ice cream is really good (doesn't compare to Arrillaga though). Also, say hi to John on the cooking staff while you're there. 10/10
3. **Lakeside**: I have some friends in Roble (best dorm!) and stopped by to check out the dining hall nearby. The dining room feels like a conference hall, the tables are pentagons and the chairs are nice and sturdy. I will say that the drink serving section allows people to walk up and steal, which is a terrible design choice. Still check it out! 9/10
4. **Ricker**: The food was stupendous but it's lower on this list because it's kind of far away from all my classes and it's inconvenient for my schedule. 6/10
5. **Wilbur:** It's literally a 2 minute walk from my dorm, the food is pretty great, and the staff is pretty friendly. However, the smoothies are not a regular occurrence and the soft-serve machine seems to be broken all the time. 5/10
6. **Casper**: Very close to Wilbur, and the quad is pretty nice. I will say one thing though, it's full of athletes, and as a 5'3 115 pound man, they make me feel inferior. Stay far away from this dining hall if you're an average sized human and want to feel that way at Stanford. 4/10
7. **Stern**: This dining hall deserves a special place in hell.

\- We use an app developed right here on campus called ""Poop Map."" It is available for free on both Apple and Android, and it essentially allows users to review the bathrooms they used and the poops themselves.

\- **Participants will join the ""SPI"" Competitive league by downloading the app, Poop Map, creating a profile, clicking ""Leagues"" at the bottom right, pressing ""Join"" and then typing “qotcafcao3367”**

\- The requirements for membership are quite strict; we expect at least seven weekly logs, however, joining the league is not binding. Casual poopers are welcome too, they just won't get any t-shirts or get to go on the retreat. Special prizes will be given throughout the year to whoever poops the most and in the most varied locations.

I'm a junior from Canada in the IB Diploma Program at my school. My school (along with all IB schools in my city) doesn't offer IB Math HL, so I have to take IB Math Analysis SL (pretty much the equivalent of AP Calc AB). My top choice school is Wharton, and the dean of admissions at Penn recently posted [this](https://www.page217.org/ib-curricular-changes/) on his blog, which, in short, explains that Math Analysis HL is the best option for applicants in the IB program, and that Math Analysis HL ""would not be \[their\] first preference for students interested in business.""

I understand that colleges tend not to penalize students for not taking a class because it not available at their school, but I am able to self study and take the AP Calculus BC exam (but not take the class) at another school in my area. Would this increase my chances at all and make up for not being able to take a rigorous math course? I am sure I can handle all of the contents of AP Calc BC (and likely score a 5), but if it would make no difference to my application, I would probably rather spend the time that I would use studying for that exam by studying for my other classes and doing extracurriculars. If I were to take the exam, I would probably want to do so this year so that I am less busy next year. I am just a bit worried because I don't want to be at a disadvantage as a result of not being able to take the class.

8775,"This meeting is the socialist answer to the New York Times “1619 Project,” which has been accompanied by an unprecedented publicity blitz, including at schools and campuses throughout the country. The occasion they cite for the publication of this project is the 400th anniversary of the arrival of 20 African slaves at Port Comfort, Virginia.

The Times project raises the question: Is race the driving force of history, as the Times insists? Or, as Karl Marx analyzed, is it class? Is “anti-black racism … in the very DNA of this country” as the Times writes? Or is the history of the United States fundamentally the history of class struggle? As social inequality reaches record levels, is America heading toward race war or socialist revolution?

The promotion of the 1619 Project takes place under conditions of expanding class struggle internationally and a growing interest in socialism among workers and youth in the United States. Its aim is to block the development of a united movement of workers across all races by cultivating racial divisions.

This meeting will refute the historical falsifications advanced in the 1619 Project, explain their underlying political motivations and present the strategy for socialist revolution in America today.

I transferred to Columbia after 2 years at another college, having took Elementary 1 &amp; 2 at my previous school. I did well and received A's in both. I recently took the online placement test. I felt fairly confident through the whole thing, having spent a few weeks refamiliarizing myself with the first two levels.

But it doesn’t matter how few hours I study, I am always way ahead in the class and when new material comes I’m still too busy laughing at how easy the previous week’s material was. And with some classes I comprehend the material so much that I feel like I can’t go to office hours because I don’t even know WHAT to ask. I know it’s because there’s no need to study - I never seem to need much time to do actual practice problems, because I waste too much time playing games on my phone during class that it doesn’t seem necessary to do homework if I’m going to ace it anyway (right?)

Then shit is hitting the fan now that midterms are here. I hate overhearing conversations of “oh yeah that wasn’t too bad” from people I KNOW know what they’re doing in the class when I’m over here flying through exams getting As like nothing.

I just hate always being so ahead even though I love the material.

8953," So this entire thing has been stressing me tf out lately:

I'm currently a sophomore at De Anza College and am applying to transfer to a UC for the Fall 2020 term. I applied for TAG for UC Davis, and despite my belief that I had met all the requirements for UC Davis for my major (Computer Science), my TAG was not approved, with the stated reason on my UC transfer admission planner portal:

*""Your GPA in a selective major preparatory course or course group falls below the minimum required for your major at the time of TAG submission.""*

The computer science selective course requirements for math for Davis are Math21A, Math21B, and Math21C. I cleared both Math21A and Math21B with my Calculus BC AP Score of 5, so I did not have a GPA for those two courses. So the only course in this series that I was able to take at De Anza was Math21C, which I got a B in. But since Berkeley and UCLA require taking the entire math series, I have also taken additional higher level, more rigorous math courses in which, including Math21C, I received an overall GPA of 3.5 in the MATH-specific selective courses. Here's basically a summary of what classes I took in each series and the grades I received.

\- Math1C (Calculus): B (3.0)- Math 1D (Multivariable Calculus): A (4.0)- Math 2A (Differential Equations): A (4.0)- Math 2B (Linear Algebra): B (4.0)- Math 22 (Discrete Math): In Progress**Overall Math series GPA: 3.5 at time of admission, higher than required GPA of 3.4**

In addition, here is a summary of the Computer Science specific selective major courses I've taken at De Anza:

\-CIS22A (Intro C++): A (4.0)-CIS22B (Intermediate C++): A (4.0)-CIS29 (Advanced C++): A+ (4.0)-CIS22C (Data Structures): B+ (3.3)-CIS40 (Intro Python): A+ (4.0)-CIS41A (Intermediate python): In Progress**Overall Computer Science series GPA: 3.86 at time of admission, higher than required GPA of 3.5**

**My overall UC-Transferable course GPA at time of admission is 3.72, also higher than required GPA of 3.4**

With that being said, since I was not approved for TAG for this special circumstance of having previously cleared both Math21A and Math21B with my AP Score and not allowing them to be counted towards my GPA does that mean that I'm also not eligible for transfer for general admission either, despite having went above and beyond their requirements for math? 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically my question is, **if I wasn't eligible for TAG, will I still be eligible for general admission?** Or am I royally screwed and need to wait another full year at deanza to try and take those two courses for a grade before I can even try to transfer again? (Would be a waste of an entire year of my life).",1,LABEL_1,0.9998082,0.00019184282,0.9998082

I guess I also got a little bugged when she kept trying to see what I got right/wrong on the exam as well. However...the biggest issue is that it doesn't really help if both of us are stuck on the same kind of problems and not sure why they thought we would somehow help each other.

8990,"CW: climate grief/anxiety 

I wanted to see if there would be any interest amongst the general student population in either or both of two types of clubs/gatherings.

The first would be a support group to address climate grief. As more and more news reports come out detailing ominous signs of an impending ecological collapse (ice cap loss breaking the big records, deadly wildfire seasons every year, widespread crop failures, Amazon deforestation, ocean acidification, permafrost melt releasing massive amounts of methane triggering further warming, a recent widespread public safety power shut off in our region)  it is becoming impossible to ignore the growing emotional toll of the climate crisis. There are so many feelings associated with this crisis: fear, anger, powerlessness, hopelessness. Many people my age I speak with candidly don’t see a future in which it’s safe to have children. Many fear we could see widespread famines, water shortages, and wars in just the coming decades. Many people are already being directly affected by climate change including those who experienced the devastation of hurricane Maria and more recently Dorian, those who’ve lost homes to wildfires and floods, and countless others. Climate change is a very real, very imminent threat and there are very real anxieties, fears, and feelings around it that need to be addressed. I’d like to start a group where people can talk about and work through their grief in a community. I would base the group around the Good Grief Networks ten step program for personal resilience and empowerment in a chaotic climate: https://www.goodgriefnetwork.org. Please let me know if a group like this is something you would be interested in. 

Secondly, I noticed there aren’t any groups centered around how to live sustainably, self-sufficiently, or even many skills based groups. I’d love to start a club where we got together and learned a myriad of skills needed for a self-sustainable life. Some topics could include: canning and preserving, sewing, basic first aid, basket weaving, plant identification, archery, backcountry medicine/cooking/fire making, basic maintenance of things like bikes, cars and appliances, HAM radio, etc. Please let me know if this is something you would be interested in.

**In the morning of Tuesday at 9am in 2015** Six UCSC students blocked the Highway 1 southbound right here Highway 17 merges at where what's known as the ""fishhook"" and thus completely disrupting traffic, commute to work,  local businesses/companies on both sides of the hill to bring awareness to Tuition Hikes and Black Lives Matter. It took police and firefighters five hours to break apart PVC pipes protesters had their chain-locked arms in, through a garbage can with 700lbs of cement.

I'm understanding of causes, but disagree with certain methods. In this case  I thought this trivialized the seriousness and movement which they said to have protested for. Focus on one cause, and stick with it. Tuition hikes, Police Brutality  and Black Lives Matter?.. Might as well throw rent control, our opioid problem, homelessness, white supremacy, or anything else that would further water down whatever issues they wanted to bring acknowledgement towards.

**Every year there are different protests/picket lines** that consists of both entrances to the campus being blocked by students whiles classes were still in session. My experience: I get off the bus with my bike from base of campus and ride up, protesters won't negotiate/budge. There seem to be a lot of tension in the air or some sort of preparedness for exchanges of words as if that's what has been going on all day.. It was hot and sweaty, quiet, and a lot of them looked tired and fatigue. I tell them to stay hydrated as I ride off and took the dirt road on my bike to get to class (more longer and tiring). I made it to class, out of breath and met with classmates who conveniently live on campus to get to class. As I ride off they a handful of them said thank you collectively in appreciation upon reminding them to stay hydrated. While I was there another guy insisted on getting through the linked-arm picket line.. they wouldn't budge. So he broke his way through and manage to disconnect the armed linkage between protesters and kept on his business while student protesters were shouting and berating him.

Guaranteed a protest will happen, how you handle or engage is up to you. Funny thing is I don't know if anything ever changed or if these protests had any influences in any decision makings regarding what they were protesting for. I had a friend share with me that some girl was running amok up and down the dorms barbarically knocking on everybody's door including her door, waking her up to have her join in on their protests during dead week (week before finals). I'll leave it up to your imagination on how that 'conversation' went as well as how interactions between ""join me in this protest"" girl and students on her floor were for the rest of the year.

9067,"Hey bruins, I've been accused of jerking off during my final exam (using my left hand) by another student. I had my dick out in my seat faced down but didn't even look at it or touch it once throughout the exam. The professor himself said that he did not witness anything but since I've been reported by another student, then he will be referring me to the Dean of Students for resolution. A TA even came by and answered some of my questions in view of my penis but didn't make any comments about it. I did not jerk off, as I would rather fail than masterbate in public as my integrity is priceless, but what's the process now? Naturally, I will deny any wrongdoing, but I have a few questions regarding the process:

1. What happens when you meet with the Dean of Students? What does s/he say to you?

2. Are you assumed to be innocent until proven guilty?

3. Is the burden of proof on the accuser/professor?

4. I know that if the Dean of Students determines that there is not enough evidence, then they can dismiss the case. How likely is this, especially if it's just hearsay from another student and the professor or TA didn't see anything. (https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/flowchart.pdf)

5. Would it be possible to offer to retake the final exam or oral interview for the with my dick in my pants? Would this help my case to prove my innocence?

6. What is the best way to prove my innocence, especially since it's just hearsay from everybody?

7. Am I able to cross examine my accuser or even know who accused me?

If you have any experience with the Academic Integrity process or have been through it yourself, please share! Thanks y'all!

EDIT: I didn’t bring a penis pump to any of my finals that day. I only had my penis, my bruincard, and my phone. The penis kept falling out of my pocket (I got a pretty huge one) so I just picked it up as the exam started and put it face down on my seat without a second thought and continued with my exam. At no point did I touch my dick or even look at it.

EDIT: I just went into my Applewatch's ""Penis Touch"" counter. I went back to the day of my exam and during the exam time, it showed that there was 0 touches at all. It also showed that I picked up my penis 0 times during the exam. The ""Penis Touch"" function is not alterable by the user and this is irrefutable evidence that I did not cheat.",1,LABEL_1,0.99981487,0.0001851332,0.99981487

I want to bring you an update to last night’s message. It is with a heavy heart that I share with you that James Strock, a second-year student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, passed away after a swimming accident yesterday.

James, who was originally from Uganda, moved to the United States at age 16. He worked hard to adapt and excelled academically, according to his parents. James was a computer engineering major and an active member of our campus community. He was an avid user of the Campus Recreational Center and attended campus ministry. He completed a co-op program with DataPath in Lawrenceville this past summer.

On behalf of Georgia Tech, we offer our deepest condolences to James’ family and friends during this difficult time. I have been in constant contact with his family and will continue to be there to support them.

This is a tragic loss, and I urge you take advantage of the counseling services that are available on campus. Grief counseling is available through the Counseling Center (counseling.gatech.edu) in the Student Services (Flag) Building from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. throughout the week and after-hours by calling 404-894-2575. Staff and faculty may find support through the Employee Assistance Program at hwb.gatech.edu/eap.

What happened? Why the UCFPD came looking for me in class! Thankfully, I was late that day, so what did they do? Why they called me and demanded I present myself immediately. I asked if I could just meet them after class, thinking that A) talking to the police in view of the class wouldn't exactly do wonders for my social life, and B) I was rather nervous about why the fuck they were looking for me. They told me to go to the station as soon as I was free. I, again, being scared, went. They took my ID and locked me in an interrogation room. They had my reddit post. They demanded to know if I was depressed. I said yes. They asked if I felt bad often. I said yes. Then, the detective or whatever the bitch's rank was left the room. She came back with two officers and announced I would be Baker Acted. I am not from Florida (or even from America), and I had never heard the term before. They said ""we are gonna take you to somewhere that will help you"". Still not seeing what was happening, I said that I had class in two hours (which I did), and asked if I would make it. They said sure. I was taken to the University Behavioral Center, in handcuffs.

&amp;#x200B;

""But what's so wrong with that?"" I hear you ask. ""You said you were depressed!"". Well, to begin with I was already heavily medicated AND I had my own doctor AND my own therapist that I saw every week. And if you think the UBC is good for anyone, I invite you to commit yourself there. They drugged me by force. They did so many medical tests. They told me I'd be gone in under an hour until they locked me up and said ""Oh, doctor is gone, you will see him tomorrow."" and then they dropped the act and said ""Actually, by law we keep you here for 3 days."" Great time. They didn't even let me eat with the rest of the prisoners there for a day, and yes, I will call them prisoners because we weren't allowed to be free. What else? Oh they therapy of course. They told me UCF had been alerted of my being committed and that I would have to speak to them or I wouldn't graduate. Did I mention I asked for support online because I didn't want what I felt to be commonly known? When I started crying out of despair for the situation, they had security drag me away. Great place. I hope it burns down. After 2 days, the doctor finally ""arrived"", and, after talking to me for 5 min and hearing my situation, he let me go. Wow, its almost as if, if you aren't a lying piece of shit, you might be more efficient than doing something akin to a kidnapping!

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, fuck UCFPD. They started this hell. Fuck UBC. They continued the hell. This was a little over a year ago. To this day, I can't see a police officer without fearing for my safety, UCFPD or otherwise. To this day, I cannot see a therapist without being afraid to my very core, and feeling the same dread I felt while locked up.

1. I have already taken the 61 series in its entirety and 70 and gotten B's and B+'s in those classes
2. I am taking upper division CS and EE classes starting next semester, and dont really know what this means for me

I dont really know what happened or how it happened, but Ive always felt wildely inconsistent as a student, and just cant seem to find a groove at all since starting college.

9302,"Hi, everyone! I'm writing this because I feel concerned about what I see as an unfair prejudice some of us American students harbor. Specifically, I think there are uninformed and unkind stereotypes about Chinese international students that as UCSD students, that we should challenge. One of the common stereotypes I see is that Chinese international students only associate with other international students, and don't adjust to U.S. culture. My response to that is, of course that's how some of them act! They are far away from home in an unfamiliar and difficult school, which (as is often mentioned in this subreddit) is not always the most welcoming place. If as English-primary-language people born and raised in the U.S., we were dropped feet-first into the University of Shanghai, we would probably act in a really similar way. I think Chinese international students deserve empathy and understanding for acting differently from the average U.S. student. After all, people are different from each other, and all have their own challenges. That doesn't mean they stop being people.

I think many of us would feel differently about the stereotypes we hear and repeat if we were to actually have a good conversation with our Chinese peers. I confess that I believed some of these stereotypes in the past. But after connecting as people and having conversations about grocery shopping, or the dorms, or shared experiences with classes, my opinion changed because I saw that Chinese international students are just students like us, but from a different place and set of challenges. If we find ourselves buying into this prejudice — and that's what it is, prejudice, because we are pre-judging people we often have not met or known personally — then maybe our first response should be to ask ourselves some questions. We can ask ourselves, have we really tried to understand? Do we even try to speak to Chinese international students? Or are we simply being afraid of something unfamiliar? I know that I didn't ask myself these questions for a long time, and believed mean and often inaccurate stereotypes because of it. As students and as growing, learning humans, we owe it to both ourselves and our peers to interrogate these stereotypes.",1,LABEL_1,0.99988854,0.00011147654,0.99988854

Because my current school ends around on Dec 20th-ish, and considering that the first day of the class of GaTech is on Jan 6th (and FASET orientation is on Jan 3rd), I really have little time for a house hunting. It is nearly impossible for me to look at houses in person because it is 10+ hr driving from here. Also, I need to move everything with my two dogs, so I need an address to move stuff before I hire a mover.

So, I've been browsing Zillow and Trulia for rentals, and I narrrowed down to a few apartments, and then I checked reviews of each one of them on Yelp and I had to cross out everything because the reviews were so bad and it seemed like they were no place for living. But after crossing out those apts, I can't really find any other options :( 

So, I am trying to reconsider my lists... and if anyone is living near campus, any recommendation would be appreciated.

My budget is less than 2k/month, and what I am looking for is safe, quiet, smoke-free enivronment.

9361,"I just got my FA package back this morning and as expected, not looking so hot. I have received about 5k in non loan money. Looking at my credit evaluation, I'm projected to graduate in the spring of 2022. I would be doing 5 semesters at NYU if I were to take a normal courseload and not fuck it up somehow.

I studied a double major in English and art history at my current university, and took a semester off on medical leave. If I went to Gallatin, I would want to study more in STEM fields and integrate that into my major, something that I have wanted to do for a while but couldn't because the rigor of the classes at my current university kind of make it impossible. I have very little debt since I went to a state school. I have worked freelance a bit and gotten a journalism internship, but I wanted Gallatin because I want to explore more of what's out there for me.

The cost is giving me some anxiety about whether or not this would be worth it. I'm already flexible about the idea of working off most of the smaller loans as I go and even being an RA or commuting from my home in LI if needed for a few semesters, but I want to know if any current NYU students think this is feasible. I also want to know if it's possible to graduate from Gallatin a semester early or if I need a reality check and I'm not even graduating in 2022. 

I know this decision is pretty personal and no one can tell me ""yes, go"" or ""no don't"" and decide for me, but I want to be prepared for what comes if I choose to attend.

9456,"Got this email:

Hello friends.

A week ago, the House of Representatives voted to formalize the process of impeaching the President. I was disappointed to see that not a single Republican voted in favor. While the Democrats’ approach to this process has been far from perfect, it has becomeabundantly clear that our President has unlawfully abused the trust placed in him via the office that he holds. His actions with respect to the ongoing scandal regarding his communications with the President of Ukraine are without explanation or excuse. An ever-increasing body of evidence indicates that our President has broken the law, and if someone claims to uphold the constitution, then the appropriate response is clear: these actions must be investigated, and the President must be held responsible.

I have always considered myself a Republican. My views on policy and governing principles have not changed during the course of this administration, even while the national party has contorted itself and abandoned some of its longest-standing principles toplacate its current leader in the White House. In fact, these principles – respect for our constitution, rule of law, and the belief that the President should be held to the highest ethical standards – are what led me to conclude that I must separate myself from the GOP and support the ongoing impeachment inquiry. It brings me no joy to break with a party that, for years, I have seen as holding the best solutions to so many political questions. It is clear, however, that the present-day national Republican Party, with few exceptions, cares more about defending the indefensible in an attempt to cling to their own power than pursuing truth and justice. This party has lost sight of the values that made it unique and has fallen into the trap of chasing the whims of one man who constantly lies, brings shame to our country, and defies our constitution. This is the same man who, when speaking of John McCain, said he prefers those who ""weren't captured"" despite his several deferments from duty. While Senator McCain sat in aVietcong prison cell, the President described avoiding contracting STDs as ""his own personal Vietnam."" The President’s term will come to an end – his leadership is temporary. However, the stains he has placed on the party he represents and the conservativemovement will be recorded forever in history. I sincerely hope that the mantle of Republican leadership one day returns to those who value honor, dignity, and conservative principles, but those currently at the helm of the Party seem to be charting a course towards a much darker future for the GOP.

Many people who share my views have stayed silent, hoping that soon enough the embarrassment of the current administration will blow over and we can pretend this presidency never happened. That is simply not possible – it is increasingly clear that continued silence is tantamount to complicity. Those of us who cannot abide by this President’s actions must make clear where we stand. The reluctance of the party to separate itself from its leader, or even to criticize him on his worst mistakes, shows that change from the inside is not currently possible. As such, I will be stepping down as Chairman of the College Republicans at Georgia Tech, effective immediately. If there is no tolerance for dissent and no appetite for following the law in the national GOP, I must respectfully part ways. I believe there is much good to be recovered from this political organization, but that is all it is – a political organization. It does not, and should not, dominate our lives. I, for one cannot support the actions of the current leaders of the party, and so I will be, for the time being, separating myself from their leadership.

The last two years we shared as a chapter were extraordinary in so many ways - no doubt in large part because of the many incredible people I’ve had the privilege of meeting through this organization. We more than doubled our membership and hosted many great leaders whom I still respect, including then-Secretary Brian Kemp. It is regrettable that my service must end in this way, but I simply could not allow the current leadership of the national party to speak for me anymore. I hope that in my time leading our chapter I have represented our shared principles and Georgia Tech well.

All the best and Go Jackets,
Jacob Chambers",1,LABEL_1,0.9998647,0.00013533341,0.9998647

Hey guys, some of you might recognize me from an earlier post I made about my Day In The Life video at Tech. Thank you for all the comments and views! I really appreciate it.

 Now, as I ramp up production for more upcoming videos, I've decided to make a 'show' of sorts on my channel, The Horuscope Weekly. These videos will be uploaded once a week, though the exact day of the week is TBD.

Once I have enough video ideas come in (and all ideas MUST be from other people, that's part of the point of this show), I'll put out the first video where I explain exactly what this show's all about, why I decided to start it in the first place, and what y'all can expect from it.

If you have ideas on what videos you'd like to see, please leave them down in the comments, and I will pick some out and start with those:)

9509,"Hey reddit! My name is Ryan. I transfered to Stanford from community college in 2016, graduated from undergrad in 2019, and am now working on my coterm (which is a master's degree started concurrently with undergrad, for those new to Stanford).

I'm pretty involved in CS at Stanford, and I wanted to see if I could help answer people's questions. Some things I can speak to:

* Course selection: I'm familiar with most common CS classes here and am happy to give advice on classes to take. I am head TA for a new intro CS class this quarter (CS 106AX), so I'm especially interested in helping people new to CS start off in the best class for their background.
* Teaching: I have TA'ed several different classes, both as an undergrad and a grad student. I also lectured (as the primary instructor) for CS 110 (our Unix systems class) last summer.
* Internships and software engineering: I've worked in a national lab (Sandia), at a startup (Expanse), at a big company (Facebook), at a nonprofit (Khan Academy), and started my own startup in a past life.

I'm also happy to answer other questions about my Stanford experience. Some topics off the top of my head:

* Transferring and adjusting to Stanford
* Staffing in an undergraduate dorm
* Playing/recording music on campus
* Anything on my website (reberhardt.com)
* Other random life things? AMA!

This week is pretty busy, so I may not respond right away, but I'll keep answering for as long as people are asking questions. Hope this is helpful!",1,LABEL_1,0.9998171,0.00018286597,0.9998171

9517,"Hi!

I am a grad student from Europe who will be doing a research stay at UC Berkeley for a couple of months starting this October. I will arrive in the US a couple of weeks earlier and was planning to visit some places in California (a couple of friends from home are coming with me for this ""tourism"" part).

Long story short, I'll have a rental car which I plan to drive to Berkeley and have it with me for the first 3 or 4 days to help carry my move-in stuff, baggage, do the first ""big"" shopping of things for my apartment, etc. Then I will return the car and walk or bike to campus for the remaining of my stay. 

All of this is to say that please bear (go!) with me since I have never lived not only in the US but in any city the size/type of Berkeley.

I have read the parking section on the City of Berkeley's website as well as several posts in this sub, but I still have some doubts. My apartment is located in RPP area J, so I assume I cannot park the car on or around my street Mon to Fri from 8am to 7pm, for more than 2 hours. However, how is this enforced? Does it mean 2 hours a day? What if I park the car for 2 hrs and then move it to a different spot on the same street (or the same RPP zone) and leave it there for another 2 hours, is this allowed? What does ""that block"" refer to in the following sentence from the [city's website](https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Customer_Service/Home/RPP_Residential_Preferential_Parking.aspx#enforcement) ""Those without an annual or visitor permit can park for a total of two hours on either side of that block""? In the same way, I assume that if I park the car at 7pm then I wouldn't need to move it until 10am the following day (8am to 10am being the 2-hr allowed free parking).

I have another question on the boundaries of the RPP areas. Looking at the [map](https://www.cityofberkeley.info/uploadedFiles/Public_Works/Level_3_-_Transportation/RPP_R(1).pdf), I understand the different areas marked with letters and colors. However, what does the gray line that surrounds the whole map mean? It says ""RPP-boundary"", so I assume that outside this boundary there is free parking on the street (apart from any kind of particular restrictions on particular streets). What about the white zones inside the ""RPP-boundary"" that don't seem to belong to any area? Is there free parking there? For instance, I see there's a big zone west of Adeline St that may be convenient for me that seems to not belong to any RPP area. Is parking there free and unrestricted?

Finally, apart from all these regulations and ticket avoidance, what about the safety of the car? Do you guys believe it is safe to park a car overnight without supervision in any of the areas that I've mentioned (all of them seem ""quiet"" and residential)?

I have lived in LA and the housing market is certainly difficult there but New York is probably a lot worse and more on a level with SF. How is the subsidized housing in general and is it even possible to find any other place to live somewhere close to Columbia with such budget constraints ? 

It was also mentioned that it would be possible to potentially teach undergrad classes during the breaks and earn a salary that way to supplement the stipend, how much that would be I really do not know but I would be glad if someone could give me an estimate.

I would be awesome if some PhD students would be able to give me some insight on if it is possible to make ends meet with the stipend and other options or if it is as tough at looks at first glance considering the CoL in NY.

 Everyone that I know who has transferred to a UC has also finished OCHEM beforehand. I have emailed the senior admissions advisor at UCSC and he also stated it was highly recommended to complete the series.

If I complete the series at my community college I'd be here for another year just taking that class and physics. However my chem prof. said I could apply for internships and do volunteer work in the meantime.

I have been here from fall 2016 to now.  I feel like I am ready to leave but everyone keeps advising against it without completing the series.

For the uninitiated, gender critical feminism is a brand of feminism that recognizes that womanhood is defined by certain lived experiences, and not something that anyone can just identify with. I am making this post in order to gauge interest in a club dedicated Gender Critical Feminism. Our mission for creating this club is to educate students about the realities of trans ideology and create an environment where actual women's concerns are taken seriously and proper solutions can be discussed. I have already met with some people who are interested and we have already come up with some demands for GT:    

* We demand that the Women's Resource Center be made available only to biological women.   
* We demand that GT block all sites that host pornographic or otherwise sexually explicit content. Additionally, all sexually explicit material e.g. movies, books, magazines, video games, etc. must be banned from campus, even electronic content. A community that normalizes porn is a community that disrespects women.    
* We demand that GT strictly enforce gender separation in campus restrooms and locker rooms. Men do not belong in women's restrooms, regardless of how they identify.   
* We demand that the CRC designate at least 4 hours a day as women-only hours (no TIMs). The CRC must take steps to ensure women's safety while working out.  
* We demand that GT scrub any pro-trans content on its website.  
* We demand that any planned or future drag/crossdressing shows be banned. These shows make a mockery out of femininity and encourage gender deviancy.   

These are just the demands that we have thought of so far. I hope we can have more discussions once this club starts.",1,LABEL_1,0.99987054,0.00012945148,0.99987054

I'm taking MCB 102 this semester and have a couple questions about the course. There are 2 pop quizzes for each section of this course. The first section (pKa, pH, protein structure, etc.) is being taught by Merchant this semester.

2) If you've taken the class, do you have any advice on how to study for these quizzes?

3) If you're currently taking the class, what resources are helping you understand the material? So far I've been reviewing the webcasted lectures and looking through the book, but I feel like there's probably more I can do.

Holomont Technologies, Inc. is a Cornell-affiliated, early-stage technology startup incorporated in May 2017 which focuses on **consumer-oriented mobile app development and IoT communication hardware**. We are **a productivity and efficiency company**. We obsess over saving our customers time and effort. Currently, we aim to **revolutionize points of transaction** by eliminating the 'wait line' and facilitating information exchange at an unprecedented speed and scale. We're starting by tackling professional events (i.e. career fairs, trade shows, networking events) and common appointments (i.e. doctor visits, job interviews).

Beyond the formal, standard 'blurb' about our company that we share with investors, we aim to be Cornell's **first 'company'-'project team' hybrid**. As many of you may have noticed, our marketing headline is ""Rejected from a project team?"" (or some variant) and makes very little mention of our actual line of products. This is for good reason. **We aim to provide as many driven and committed Cornell students as possible with the opportunity to be part of an impactful organization and own equity in their work output.** We've taken the best elements of a project team and merged them with the core elements of a company. To that end, when you join Holomont Technologies, Inc., you will have **a unique level of independence and influence** on the direction of our company. Unlike at traditional project teams, you are not working for free, to further someone else's vision, or towards a meaningless competition with us. Our aim is to empower you with the platform and tools to envision, develop, and market app-oriented ideas that have a major impact on the Cornell community and (hopefully) the world, while keeping an eye on our productivity and efficiency focus and another eye on profitability.

We are looking to hire for many roles from marketing to engineering to everything in between. We have a couple of senior-level executive positions and many entry-level positions. We want you! If you are interested in working for this unique type of early-stage technology startup, consider applying for a position at [**apply.holomont.com**](http://apply.holomont.com/).

At the moment I have a group of people whom I call friends, but my relationship to them feels empty and one-sided. I feel like none of them care about me, or about whether I even exist. If I were to magically disappear none of them would  notice, and even if they did they wouldn't care. Any contact with them has to be initiated by me; I'm not liked enough by any of them to be the one who's messaged first. Sometimes, even when I am the one who speaks first, I'm just ignored and forgotten about. It's the kind of thing where, if I stop contacting any of them, the relationship would probably end because none of them would ever initiate contact. They don't treat each other this way, but it is the way I'm treated. They would never exclude each other from a group event, but my exclusion means nothing to them really. I love them, but they don't seem to love me back.

I haven't felt this way before. In the past I've been lucky to have had friends who valued me, but at this school I've struggled. And right now it feels like I'm at a stage where everyone has already formed their own cliques--like there's no hope of meeting different people who're willing to make room for someone like me.

The typical suggestion is to ""join clubs,"" but it often feels as though people you meet in clubs want the scope of their and your relationship to be limited to interactions within the organization. ""Club friends"" are your ""club friends."" Are there groups on campus where people aren't like this?

I'm sorry if I come off as needy or desperate, but all I want is the feeling of belonging. All I want are friends who value my presence, friends who actually care and who want to be around me.

***Speech monitored by ‘open expression observer’***

PHILADELPHIA – Heather Mac Donald provokes strong reactions in audiences when she speaks on campus. Black Lives Matter protesters [**repeatedly disrupted**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/war-cops-author-heather-mac-donald-shouted-ucla-hysterical-black-lives-matter-protest/) the author of “The War on Cops” when she spoke at UCLA nearly two years ago.

Her detractors at the University of Pennsylvania on Thursday night were better behaved. Yet even the presence of a university-sent “open expression observer” didn’t discourage the largely hostile audience from frequently interrupting Mac Donald.

They also tried to stump the Manhattan Institute scholar with questions, went off topic and snapped their fingers in unison when others in the audience answered.

Mac Donald spoke at the invitation of the Ivy League university’s conservative newspaper, [***The UPenn Statesman***](https://www.facebook.com/events/784348905263192/), about her latest book, “The Diversity Delusion.”

Dear Ithaca Campus Community,

Y’all know what happened last week on frat life drama. 

As I noted in my [November 19 community message](http://t01.list.cornell.edu/t/2925802/62429839/1204042/1044/), the unregistered fraternity party, during which freshmen were served alcohol and participated in drinking games, and all members got shitfaced and violated a number of Cornell’s Greek life policies. I find it particularly fucked up that Phi Kappa Psi had just attended a judicial hearing the day before for additional fuckery. The chapter has been placed on interim suspension pending a full review by the Greek judicial system because they never should’ve fucked with me. 

Regrettably, this is not an isolated incident as Greek life is just a bunch of assholes. We have on this campus, as do many of our peers on their campuses, a persistent culture of fuckery in the Greek-letter system; a pattern that dates back years, if not decades, and one that I have witnessed during my two-and-a-half years as Cornell’s president. Indeed, people tried to fuck with me over hazing back in the winter of 2018 and I announced a set of new Greek policies in May of that year. At that time, naysayers told me that the new policies would not shut this shit down. Unfortunately, those naysayers were fuckin right. In the 19 months since those new policies went into effect, fully six Greek organizations have engaged in behavior so problematic as to merit suspension of their recognition by the university. This number does not include the current interim suspension of the bitches at Phi Kappa Psi.

The full copy is attached for this reform, but I know once y’all see bullet points you stop reading so I won’t go any further. In conclusion, I’m trying and y’all are making this shit super fucking hard. Get your shit together. 

In the words of Lil Wayne, “If you ain’t gonna ride, fly, than you might as well hate.”

Sincerely,

Martha E. Pollack

9745,"So I’m sure many of you have seen the jobs4knights.com written on whiteboards across campus. The gist of it is that they tell you they have this great opportunity to work at $15/hr and have an opportunity for $140’000 in scholarships or something like that if you work for them. Needless to say it’s too good to be true. 

The first time I came into contact with jobs4knights was actually through the messaging portion of Webcourses (canvas) where a student from UCF messaged me about this great job opportunity. 

I filled out the application which is actually just a google form to get your personal information and then decided that was kinda sus maybe I should do some research. Turns out it’s for this company called Vector which has a shady list of not paying employees and doing other illegal things, just check out the wiki and you’ll see what I mean. 

I got a phone call from Vector and decided to pick it up to see what other information I could find about the job because they didn’t really give any info about it anywhere really. 

Initially everything sounded very professional like you would expect from a real job offer and they very quickly asked if I could come in for an interview. Again not describing what the job was. Also they said that they work with the UCF career center which I don’t think is true at all. 

So I pressed the person on the phone about the details of employment there, knowing full well that this company works in loopholes so they don’t have to pay their employees and sure enough the more questions I asked the worse it got. 

As an entry level employee, you do get paid $15 an hour, but you can only work so many hours based on how many “appointments” are made available to you. These appointments are for a set amount of time, for example one hour and the way it works is that you set up a meeting with a family member or friend and at the end of the hour they sign your appointment form so you can get your money.

First of all this means that you could speak to someone for more than an hour but only get paid for one hour because of the fixed length of the “appointment.”

Second of all, they determine how many appointments you can get and they will give you more only if you meet commission quotas. 

Third of all, you can imagine that they don’t want you to sit down and talk to the same person again and again without them buying anything, so it’s on you to find more people in order to get more appointments. 

On paper they pay their employees $15/hr and they don’t have a door to door employee selling stuff. In reality you don’t get paid for any of the time it takes to find a customer and at the end of the day there are only so many uncles and aunts you have. So a lot of the customers fall into the “friends” category and friends of friends and friends of friends of friends etc. 

When you get to talking to people you don’t know very well, it’s hard to get them to sign your appointment paper and a lot of people probably don’t want to buy the product so what might happen is you talk to someone for 20 mins but they say no and don’t sign your paper and you try this for 3 people and now you’ve worked an hour for free. 

They did say that they have done away with the deposit required for the product before you can sell it but I have a feeling there’s still some sort of training book you have to pay for. 

I ended my conversation with saying that I know that this company has made its money from robbing young high school and college students of their money and I want nothing to do with a company like that even at 15/hr plus commission and scholarships and the person on the phone simply said okay have a nice day and hung up. 

The employees are very obviously given commission for recruiting new employees because I must’ve gotten 100 phone calls before and after I had my conversation which shows that they really don’t care and just want to add a number to their spreadsheet. 



TL;DR

Don’t go anywhere near jobs4knights/vector marketing. They don’t pay you properly through a loophole and you have to make sales in order to get hours. You’ll end up working for free a lot. The people who actually make money get it from recruiting new employees.",1,LABEL_1,0.99986565,0.00013430757,0.99986565

First on the application itself: I'm under the impression that being accepted to take SCPD courses as a non-degree student isn't really that competitive a process and so my statement of purpose doesn't really have to be edited to perfection. I have a BS and MS degree in Economics where we did a lot of calculus/linear algebra in minimising different loss functions so I'm hoping I tick the main boxes. Am I right, or is SCPD a lot more competitive to be accepted into than I think? It'd be good to know if so :)

Second on prerequisites: it's been a while since my MS degree and I'm looking to brush up on my math in the few months before the course starts. I recently went through basic calculus, and I gather the most important thing to do next is some linear algebra. I was considering working through either 'introduction to linear algebra' by Strang, or 'linear algebra done right' by Axler. I know they are two different levels of rigour/proof-based-ness, so I was wondering if anyone could say which one is more appropriate as a prerequisite for the CS229 course?

Or maybe I'm way off the mark and there's something better I should do as preparation :)

Engineering ‘23 living in the quad here and I have a problem that maybe y’all can help solve. 

I have a single in the quad. My room is small and I like it a lot, but it does have one problem; the walls are incredibly thin and my hall mates can hear any loud noises I make.

On Halloween I got railed by a jock from Swarthmore and we both had a great time. So, we made some noise. We composed a half hour long symphony of moans, creaks from those cheap quad twin beds, bangs on the wall, claps and slaps. The night was amazing.

The next morning, I passed a neighbor in the hall; she giggled and asked me how my night went. It was clear that she overheard last night’s  symphony of the soul. 

I’ve never been so embarrassed and I never want this to happen again. Anybody have recommendations so I can fuck in privacy?",1,LABEL_1,0.99982375,0.0001762054,0.99982375

So ultimately my long-term goal is PA (Physician Assistant) program. But of course, if you're familiar with the pre-reqs, I have to gain anywhere between 1000-2000 hours of experience before I can even think about applying for a PA program. I was thinking of gaining this experience by getting my Medical Assistant (MA) certification.  Here is like my general timeline of how I want things to go:

Spring 2020: Apply for a MA program at a CC.

Fall 2020: Hopefully start MA program. I don't think MA programs are full-time, so I'd like to be working as well. I've been thinking about some entry level job as an administrative assistant or something, idk. Any help with this would be amazinnggg.

Spring 2021: Hopefully be done with MA program. Start looking for jobs.

Fall 2021: Hopefully I have an MA job. During this time, I was thinking of taking/retaking some classes at a CC that I need for PA school (Physiology, Anatomy, Stats, etc). 

\*fast forward to Fall 2022..maybe even Spring 2023\* apply for PA programs!!!

Anyway I got really off track, but like my ultimate question is where the heck do you find entry level jobs? Did you move back home after college? Did you get your own place immediately after college? I really wanna get my own place but rent is so expensive.

Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love health care and (in the least morbid way possible) I love being in a hospital, so i’m 99% sure I want to work in one.

I thought I wanted to do Pre-Med, but as I look to my future I’m starting to realize that I chose that as a way to make my parents happy and not as a way to make myself happy. I played around with the idea of doing nursing in high school and got really interested in it, but my parents shot it down and told me I would be “wasting my education” if I did that, and I believed them, so I got rid of the idea completely. 

Now as the semester comes to a close, I’m realizing I’m struggling with my classes because I’m not passionate about the future I’ve created for myself. I’ve been joking about switching to nursing since i came here, but now I’m feeling really serious about it. I was going to stay in Neuroscience and do their Pre-Nurse Practioner path, but I realized I wasn’t a huge fan of the department recently and now I’m thinking I’m going to switch to the Nursing major. 

I looked on the website and I won’t have the gpa after this semester (because I was struggling) to switch to the Pre-Nursing major, so I’m thinking I’m going to stay in Neuroscience but ignore the classes they tell me to take and take the classes I need to apply for the Nursing program. The good news is, I already have credit for all the courses Pre-Nursing majors are taking now. I emailed the department, but since it’s scheduling season, I was sent an automated message telling me not to expect a reply for 2-3 business days so that’s why I’m turning to Reddit to help answer some of my questions.

I’m a little confused about applying to the program. Do I have to have all of my pre-requisite classes completed by the time I apply, or do I just need to have them scheduled and ready to take? 

I’m also very stressed about the gpa I have now and the odds of me getting into the program because of it. I am in Chem 1210 and Bio 1113 this semester (which I’m realizing are difficult to take your first semester of college, especially when you don’t have solid studying habits) and I know I’ll probably get a B or B+ in Bio, but Chem is a toss up because of the weighting. It’s looking like I’ll probably get a B- though. Even if I do very well next semester, will my odds still be low to get into the program?

We are a club operating out of FloMo aimed at encouraging a healthy and enriching pooping culture here on campus while spreading sustainable and equitable pooping practices globally. After the overwhelming support and turnout at last night's meeting, the SPI board has decided to open applications to the SPI 2019-20 Competitive League--how does it work? 

  
\- We use an app developed right here on campus called ""Poop Map."" It is available for free on both Apple and Android, and it essentially allows users to review the bathrooms they used and the poops themselves.

\- **Participants will join the ""SPI 19-20"" Competitive league by downloading the app, Poop Map, creating a profile, clicking ""Leagues"" at the bottom right, pressing ""Join"" and then typing ""SPI 19-20"". Enrollment is open!**

\- Last year, we had a league of over 200 strong, and a map quite literally covered in pins. Our goal this year is to outpoop our previous efforts; moreover, we have recently gotten wind of the fact that a certain UC Berkeley has also created a poop league, so we will focus efforts this year on reconnaissance and sabotage. In fact, I will delete this post shortly so as they do not see it. 

\- The requirements for membership are quite strict; we expect at least seven weekly logs, however, joining the league is not binding. Casual poopers are welcome too, they just won't get any t-shirts or get to go on the retreat. Special prizes will be given throughout the year to whoever poops the most and in the most varied locations.

If you have any questions or reservations, please feel free to pm me or shoot an email to [stdpoop@stanford.edu](mailto:stdpoop@stanford.edu)! We would love to see you at any of our biweekly meetings :)",1,LABEL_1,0.999843,0.00015698903,0.999843

TL;DR at bottom

I'm currently a 3rd year CS student, and am trying to come up with my class schedule for next (my final) semester at Berkeley. I am trying to get more experience with AI and have taken 188 this semester. 

I was planning on taking 162 next semester because I have heard it is very important for a Software engineer, but also some people have spoken differently, saying depending on your focus as a Software engineer. I'm trying to decide between 162, and taking 189 with 182 (if that's even possible/recommended). 

From those with work experience, how important is 162? I'm not planning to remain a software engineer for too much of my life (trying to move up to project manager ASAP, as pretentious as that might sound) and am wondering which class combo will give me the best way to reach that path. (I would also be more interested in AI development both for engineering as well as product management)

But it doesn’t matter how few hours I study, I am always way ahead in the class and when new material comes I’m still too busy laughing at how easy the previous week’s material was. And with some classes I comprehend the material so much that I feel like I can’t go to office hours because I don’t even know WHAT to ask. I know it’s because there’s no need to study - I never seem to need much time to do actual practice problems, because I waste too much time playing games on my phone during class that it doesn’t seem necessary to do homework if I’m going to ace it anyway (right?)

Then shit is hitting the fan now that midterms are here. I hate overhearing conversations of “oh yeah that wasn’t too bad” from people I KNOW know what they’re doing in the class when I’m over here flying through exams getting As like nothing.

I just hate always being so ahead even though I love the material. It’s almost self-sabotage choosing to do something that I am so “gifted” at because I like doing it, but I can’t go back to acing everything and being bored.

So I know for a FACT that I will fail Bio 93 this quarter. I just had a hard time adjusting to college as a freshman. I’ve worked on my mental health and quit my job recently which has made things much easier, but it’s too late in the quarter to make a difference.

I’ve been doing the bare minimum for this class, and I take full responsibility if I don’t pass. But it’s discouraging to say the least. Im a Bio major, and I’m failing my first Bio class. I love Bio, but I feel like switching majors now. 

I’m definitely going to retake this class next quarter, but that will put me a step back, so I don’t even know anymore. 

Mostly I’m afraid that I’m never going to bounce back from this and my GPA will be in shambles. I know that the first quarter is rough for everyone, but I never thought I’d straight up fail a class.

Those who have had Dr. Callam for Ochem I in the past, what has been the range for the lowest A percentage? In other words, the syllabus currently states that an 87% is an A; obviously there will be some sort of curve; so, will an 85, 84, 82 etc become the lowest A?

- have knowledge for the future as I believe this will be required by most businesses. 
- will be/currently assembling an “A-Team” to develop a business. I want to be able to more effectively communicate, and spot help with the “A-Team.” :)

9956,"At first glance, the [2004 Humanitarian Bowl](https://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=240030202), a relatively obscure bowl game in Boise, was a fairly uninteresting, lopsided game between two wholly average programs. The Yellow Jackets took an early lead in the first quarter and enjoyed a 10-3 lead at halftime; the second half was a perfect storm of explosive offense and unforgiving defense in which Tech scored 42 points while only allowing the Golden Hurricane a single touchdown. Tech stymied Tulsa's run game, holding them to -56 (*yes, that's a negative*) yards--Tulsa's worst-ever rushing performance in the 125-year history of their football program. 

This matchup was the most recent of the [three](http://www.winsipedia.com/tulsa/vs/georgia-tech) between the two storied institutions (the previous two occurred in 1944 and 1945, with a Tech and Tulsa win, respectively). These programs have only met at bowl games and have no particular bad blood between one another off the field; however, these three games were the only occasion in which the **heaviest mascot in FBS football (the Golden Hurricane) competed against the lightest (the Yellow Jacket**).

An [SBNation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obtRtrk42a8) places the weight of a single yellow jacket at 0.0001 lbs and (perhaps very unscientifically) estimates the weight of an entire hurricane made of gold to be 1,182,000,000,000 lbs. This mascot weight differential of 1,181,999,999,999.9999 pounds is the largest that has and will ever occur in an FBS football game until a university with a lighter or heavier mascot joins the division or until an existing school adopts a new, unconventional mascot. 

I don't know when Georgia Tech will play Tulsa again. Perhaps there will be another 65-year hiatus. But I hope not. Personally, I would love to cheer on our tiny mascot against its behemoth counterparts and will be watching intently next time Tech's and Tulsa's paths cross.",1,LABEL_1,0.999785,0.0002150385,0.999785

A student should only request residency classification using one of these categories if they do not qualify as either an independent or a dependent student.

If you look up the incident on google, this is the first article: ([https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/](https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/))

&gt;The night before he vanished, the college freshman had dinner with his mother, then went to a frat event, the Miami Herald reported.  
&gt;  
&gt;*He was last seen leaving the Phi Kappa Psi house* around 9:30 p.m. but had not been heard from after the gathering, police said.

Most articles give the same information, but I contend that this information is incorrect, but I do not have absolutely concrete evidence.

I heard from someone that Phi Kappa Psi was holding a dirty rush event not at their house, but at the nearby City of Ithaca Cemetery. I don't have the means to investigate this claim any further, but perhaps someone who hears about this post might. 

If it were true that the event had been held at the cemetery and not the house, Phi Kappa Psi would not want to reveal this information, because they would have to face the repercussions of holding a dirty rush event, and especially of holding one in such a place.

This change of locations might seem like a minor change of details, but this change in details could have meant the difference between life and death, but I am not able to make any certain claim.

I do not know what was happening at the event, and I do not know whether Antonio left from the cemetery or from the house to return back to North Campus, but I believe that by revealing this information, we might discover something about the dangers of holding dirty rush events at cemeteries, or dirty rush events outdoors, or dirty rush events at all, and maybe frats will learn from this and no longer hold these sort of events, or maybe Cornell will crack down on these events much harder.

Comment below if you have any details contributing to my account, or if you disagree with anything I have said. Talk to your friends about this, and try to get Phi Kappa Psi to reveal the true nature of the event they were holding that night. Even if it means punishment for them, that should be a small price to pay to lower the risk of such a tragedy happening to another student.

I wish to apply for both Spring and Fall of the coming year as I have received external funding for both semesters.

So if I want the grant for Spring 2020, do I need to fill this form (maybe this isn't just for 2019 but for 2019-2020? I am confused as August 31 is already gone) or wait for 2020's form to be made available? In case of the latter, any idea when the form will be made available? Also, if the form is up after start of term (January 27, 2020), I will have no choice but to apply after already started with my classes. In that case, will I be granted funds?

After I get there, in order to ease the financial burden, I was planning on co-oping as soon as I could (spring or summer semester). *I'm aware this path is a long and bumpy road...* Luckily I am able to fulfill all of the conditional transfer requirements at my local community college.

Anyway, today I found out about the Dual Degree program that has a partnership with Emory (among other schools). I think a business degree from Emory would be extremely valuable so that made the Dual Degree path interesting to me. A few questions:

1. How does a business degree from Emory stack up to a business degree from Tech (if I was to try and double major)? Emory is ranked 15 on US News and Reporting while Tech is ranked 21. Is is worth it to pursue Emory?
2. Is it possible to co-op after transferring from Emory as a part of the dual degree? I'm sure it's uncommon since you're already doing so much with the getting a second degree from a second institution but do they let you?
3. Is it ever ""too late"" to co-op? If I decide to transfer to Tech next fall, I'll be a sophomore and if I don't land a job that year, I'll be stuck as a Junior trying to co-op. 
4. Are you able to add a minor at Tech with the dual degree as well?

I'm going to do some more reading and call an adviser at Tech tomorrow but any insight is welcome.

10043,"hi all! i have a question for anyone who might relate and can offer som advice!! :)

so first!! as some background information , im a freshman at cornell. i didn’t go to the best high school academically, and most of the people at my school either go to community colleges, local colleges, or the military (which isn’t bad or anything!! but it’s a detail that helps with my question!!). im an out of state student , too!

basically, ever since i got into cornell during senior year, a lot of my friends began treating me differently and kind of harshly (comments like “you only got into cornell since your black” or “you think you’re too good for us now”), so even going into cornell left a weird vibe for us before i left. and while there, it kinda sucked to see my friends back home hang out together all the time and even have classes together. buuut, each time i came home, id try to visit them and spend time with them, and they would stillllll only hang out together and/or it would just feel like a much different vibe, which kinda sucked and made me feel bad. this break has been the hardest since a lot of old high school drama was brought up by them and a lot of bitterness /resentment was shown from them.  i now pretty much have dropped a lot of my friends from high school and have been super bored with nothing to do in my hometown :(( it’s been sad because i guess things just feel so lonely and stagnant back home? like there’s never much going on and most people just stick to who they know from high school (since everyone basically stays here), hence leading them to still have high school like habits (a lot of gossip and rumors) :// like there are other friends from high school who i love too, but they mainly just party, smoke, drink, etc (which isn’t bad or anything!! i completely understand!!) when hanging with people and im not into that.  

i just really dislike the environment here. buuut i do love to see and spend time with my family during these breaks!! but i also feel like id be muchhh muchhh happier if i stay at cornell / maybe explore ny during breaks (plus itd probably save money tbh).

so my actual question!! do you guys feel this dilemma of your hometown not really feeling like home anymore? and for out of state students, how have you’ve been navigating being away from home (missing family, hometown friends, etc.)? also, for those who don’t go back to their hometowns or haven’t in the past, what do you do instead?

super sorry that was a lot!! and i hope this didn’t come off the wrong way at all!! things just have been making me kinda sad and stuff, so i just wanted to explore some options !! thank u guys!! 💞",1,LABEL_1,0.99988794,0.00011205121,0.99988794

10061,"Hi everyone, Penn has been my dream school for about three years. I applied to Penn right out of high school with subpar grades and essays. I applied at the last minute because I didn't think I would even want to go to Penn, but after I submitted my application, I researched Penn more and I realized Penn would be a great fit for me. I regret my decision to submit a half-assed application in high school.

During my freshman year in college, I went in trying to enjoy my college experience, but I realized my school isn't really the best school for me for a variety of reasons. I ended up deciding to apply to Penn and one other school to transfer during the second semester of my freshman year. Unfortunately, I was rejected again from both schools because I'm an idiot and I procrastinated on my essays. My essays ended up being garbage because of my procrastination but also because I didn't know how to articulate what I wanted to gain from transferring. A friend read one of my essays and told me he couldn't even decipher why I wanted to transfer! However, this time around, my grades were much better -- near 4.0 in hard classes like calculus 3 and statistics and stuff.

However, despite receiving two rejections, I think I still wanna apply to Penn one last time as a junior transfer. Over the past couple of months, I've been reflecting on what I want out of college and I finally think I'm able to put it into words. 

At my current school, my social life is stunted. I currently go to a school that is dominated by greek life; something like 40% of undergrads are affiliated. I don't have a big problem with this, but as you can imagine greek life dominates the social scene of my school. Unfortunately for me, I don't like the taste of alcohol, even with it mixed, and I find it hard to connect with random people at fraternity parties as I'm kinda a nerd. My school has a lot of school clubs, but most of them are either professional-oriented, sports teams, or multicultural-based. This is great, in fact I have joined many of the professionally-oriented ones, but the others are not my cup of tea. I realize that if I went into college being on a sports team, I think I would have found a group of friends much more quickly. My school does not have sailing, one of the only sports I enjoy, but Penn does and it looks like a lot of fun. Additionally, I'm gay and, although my school is very accepting of LGBT people/issues (I'm grateful for this), the number of LGBT people at my school is quite small. At the LGBT club's meetings, less than ten people show up each week for the meetings. Also, there are like the same ten to twenty people on dating apps (lol). The reason I'm so drawn to Penn is because it is in Philadelphia which is a great city to be gay in. Penn is more than twice the size of my current school and I'm really drawn by this. I initially thought I wanted a small school, but a large school will have a larger LGBT population and more school clubs/things to do. This will be amplified at Penn because it is in Philadelphia. 

Academically, my school is fine. My GPA has declined to a 3.86, and the coursework is challenging. I love my professors, and I'm doing some awesome research. The only thing I wish my school had more of is computer science classes, particularly computer graphics classes. I spoke to my friend at CMU, and he said he wanted to stay at CMU for another year to take full advantage of the classes there. I'm only in my second year at my school, and I'm almost halfway through all of the computer science courses my school offers, and some of them are highly specialized and don't really interest me such as bioinformatics.

I need an outside opinion: should I apply to Penn again or not? I didn't articulate this at all in my previous applications to Penn. Should I take my gripes somewhere else? This year I'm thinking about applying to many other schools to transfer to such as USC. Thanks for taking the time to read this!",1,LABEL_1,0.9998707,0.00012925308,0.9998707

10173,"I saw that we get a second enrollment pass on September 17th for fall quarter. I was hoping to change one of my lecture times for CHEM 14A. However, I'm confused how the enrollment on the 17th works. That day when I logon to the class planner should I drop my original CHEM 14A lecture and then enroll in the lecture time I want? Is it possible to enroll in the lecture I want and then drop the original's lecture so I'm safe, because if I drop my original lecture and can't get the other time I want I might not get the class at all. 

TLDR: When enrolling for a second time is it better to enroll in the class you want than drop the original class you had. Or do you have to drop the class you first signed up for and then enroll in your other desired class/lecture.

Hello! I am a psychology student from LIU-Brooklyn and I would like to ask you to be a participant in my research. This study is designed to help us better understand the personality characteristics of people who participate in Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG) and how this relates to their interpersonal behaviors in their daily lives.

You will fill out a series of questionnaires and will be asked to create and audio record narratives after observing several picture cards. This study will require about 50 minutes of your time. As the study focuses on MMORPG players, you are eligible to participate if you are an active player in one or more MMORPGs. You will also have to reside in the United States and speak English as your primary language due to the narrative component of this study.

Upon completion of the study, you will be offered a **$10 online Amazon gift card**. Additionally, you may find the study interesting!

You will also provide information that may help clinical psychologists understand the relationship between personality characteristics and face-to-face interpersonal behaviors in individuals who play MMORPGs.

10234,"I agree with the sentiment that this is not entirely SA’s fault. The calendar committee is made up of mostly faculty/staff with the SA added on. However, if you read the report to the committee comments at the end, you can see that only 2 students (both I presume are SA) commented on the issue. The longest part of **both** students’ comments (pg. 36-37) is about how the new calendar would affect the amount of time IFC and Panhell members have to spend at home over break. Neither comment mentions the increased stress of fewer study days. As an IFC member, I would like to clarify to both members of the SA that commented that **I am here to learn first and socialize second.** I return to school early **by choice**. I study as much as I can because Cornell is a hard school and I am here to learn what I am being taught. The fact that nobody on SA dissented to switching the calendar because of student mental health (nobody on SA voted for the current [as it was] calendar) is horrifying. We elect you guys to represent the interests of the students and it is abundantly clear that you failed to do so. So, yes, the entire calendar committee is to blame for this travesty, but the SA is supposed to have our backs just as we had theirs during SA elections.

I was wondering whether anyone here has been successful in using SCPD courses (taken online) to meet the CS prerequisite that most MSCS programs have?

My own situation is that I live in the UK and have a BS and MS in Economics (from top universities here with 3.7-4.0 GPA equivalents I think). I want to apply to the US for MSCS programs next year (for Fall 2021 entry) and as most of them require some CS background I'm looking around for ways I can acquire the credits in the next 1-2 years. SCPD's certificate looks like one solid option. Another is Oregon State University's online post-bacc in CS, which confers a complete BS and is cheaper per credit hour but I'm thinking that the brand name recognition of Stanford might help - maybe the courses will be perceived as more rigorous.

Another thing I'd be after is getting letters of recommendation from professors - anyone know if this is possible if you take an active student role in a SCPD course?

10376,"I’m a first semester freshman going through some major problems. In short, I haven’t attended a single class or done any work since the end of the first prelims. A combination of physical and mental health issues that were snowballing since senior year high school, combined with family issues and complete social isolation, brought me to the point where I was missing classes and struggling to stay emotionally stable enough to seek help from CAPS. One bad therapy session sort of tipped me into breaking and I haven’t been to classes, done work, or spoken in person to anyone since. I can’t believe so much time has passed so fast. Nobody ever noticed I was gone and I never received any emails or texts or even notifications on Canvas about grades or my absence, and although that’s something I should have expected with the freedom and vastness of college it only made me feel worse.

Somehow finals are only a week away, and it’s probably impossible to salvage any of my classes. I have not registered for spring classes yet either, and I wouldn’t know how I could possibly fare in them without knowing most of what was taught in the prerequisite classes I took this semester. From what I’ve found searching here, I can expect to be put on a leave of absence for a semester? I’m not sure, but I desperately do not want to go back home, and I’m afraid it’ll only make things worse to have to stay there when family was such a big part of the problem in the first place.

I felt so lethargic and depressed I literally did nothing most days, and it took a lot of effort to send the few early emails I did manage to send, which didn’t really go very far. I’m only just now even stabilizing my sleep schedule enough to be up at this time and I don’t know what to do at this point, if anything at all can be done. Who can I go to? What will happen to my financial aid status, or my status as a student? Should I even register for spring classes?",1,LABEL_1,0.99989104,0.00010899425,0.99989104

10402,"Dear friends:
As you know, this was my last season with the Yellow Jacket Marching Band.  But as I leave, here are some final remarks for the rest of y'all.

This season definitely was not the most ideal on many fronts.  Losing the right to play chords for a good portion of the home schedule.  Losing to an FCS school.  More frustrating losses.  And of course, the band's ongoing struggle with marketing.  But despite that, y'all still did a great job this season!  Y'all brought the energy every game from kickoff to the last whistle regardless of the score.  You supported the team through thick and thin with passion, honor, grace, and valor.  And you performed a kick-ass halftime show that paid tribute to the music of this great city!  And through it all, I was proud to serve alongside you one last time!

Which is why I implore you: never let that spirit die!  This season's team was young and scrappy, but raw and unrefined.  And despite the talent on the roster there was a lot of unrefined, raw, and at times undisciplined football.  But there was also a team that kept fighting and never gave in regardless of the score.  To me, what I saw was a team that had bought into Geoff Collins's effort-based culture: the first step in a deep rebuild.  And it is my belief that eventually that effort and grit and tenacity is going to translate into winning seasons.  Perhaps sooner than anyone anticipates.

That aside, there is one critical reason you cannot let that spirit die.  Together, the Georgia Tech Band, Goldrush, Color Guard, and Cheer, represent the loudest, proudest, and most passionate group in the entire Georgia Tech fanbase.  You are at the front lines of cheering for this team and you have to shoulder that responsibility every game.  Whether that's on the field, in the stands, or outside the stadium before games, you have one responsibility on game days: to lead and to set the example.
May that be your cry.  And may you all do it together as a family week in and week out.
Empower those men on the football team to do what they came here to do.  And that wasn't to play around.  It was to take care of business.  And fight.  And win!

WE GONNA FIGHT
TILL WE CAN'T FIGHT NO MORE!!
GONNA LIE DOWN AND BLEED AWHILE,
THEN WE GONNA GET UP AND FIGHT SOME MORE!!!

Turn the Yellow Jackets loose next season!!!

It seems like everybody here has no time to foster a meaningful relationship with another person, and instead chooses to hook up. This culture is pervasive, and seems to be taken to the extreme. 

I was booty called Sunday night. When I got to her room, I could tell something was wrong. She explained that she was behind schedule on her CIS homework, and that she could only have sex if she could work on her homework at the same time. 

It seemed like a fine idea to me; it would check two things from the to do list at once. So, with my face buried in my Spanish textbook, and her torso hunched over a MacBook Pro opened to Codio.com, we shared eight sweaty minutes of doggy style productivity.

The highlight of the evening was when she asked if I’d try BDSM. I agreed and she pulled out an Orgo textbook and asked me punish her.  
So I turned to Chapter 12, and asked her review questions. 

Each synthesis question cracked like a whip. As she demanded, “MORE!” and the pages turned, I took a moment to reflect...

I had come to her room searching for companionship, but when I came in her room, I found only two burned-out shells of people, yearning for a feeling.

This isn’t love, and this isn’t learning.

We will be holding a pistol fundamentals workshop on **Saturday, September 28th. We will be meeting at the Student Center Parking Lot at 11:30 AM. We will be leaving the parking lot promptly at 12:00 PM.** It is a ~40 minute trip from Georgia Tech to our shooting range, and we typically shoot for 2-2.5 hours; we will most likely  be back on campus around 4:30 PM.

This workshop will be most useful to people who are novice/beginner pistol shooters or who want to learn/reinforce  the many fundamentals of pistol shooting in a small group, hands-on, range environment. The workshop will focus on fundamentals, with a good amount of dry fire practice before doing live fire with rimfire and centerfire handguns. **In order to make sure all participants receive focused instruction, we will be limiting this this outing to 7 people only.** We will be holding additional instructional outings throughout the semester, if you signed up for this outing but were not selected you will get top priority for the next one.

This class WON'T cover more complex topics such as drawing from holster, fast mag changes, etc. **The end goal of this class is for you to be able to effectively put rounds on target during slow fire, with a decent grouping.**

If you need a centerfire gun, we can loan you a gun to train on (indicate caliber preference in the Google Form, subject to availability).

If you have one, you should bring your own centerfire pistol and magazines (and a rimfire if you would like, please let us know). In any case, we will provide the ammo (common service calibers including: 9mm, .40, and .45).

I am a UCF student, in the Texts &amp; Technology PhD program, performing a study regarding the usability of telemedicine communications. 

I am looking for UCF undergraduates to participate in an one-time, one-hour study where you will interact with a website on a computer and your smartphone and talk out loud your thoughts during this interaction. The purpose of the study is to find out how easy it is for people to find information on a website. 

In order to participate, you must be 18 years of age or older and required to bring a smartphone and be willing to use it to access the internet for one activity. You will also need to agree to be video recorded. All data transport, analysis, and storage, will be done by the PI and using a password-protected USB, computer, and data analysis software. All data will remain confidential, and all video recordings with identifiable data will be destroyed after data analysis is complete. The results of the data, which are de-identified, may be published in future publications or presented at conferences. The study will take place at UCF, in a classroom or computer lab. You will get a $15 Amazon gift card for participating.

I forgive whoever I may offend with this post, but my tastebuds can take the abuse no longer. 

Over the course of my life thus far, I have had over 20 years of experience tasting all sorts of chicken wings from all kinds of different restaurants, including but not limited to Buffalo Wild Wings, Wingstop, Wings over Ithaca, various pizza parlors, and Nasties. So you can say that my taste in chicken wings is perhaps one of the most refined there is. I therefore believe that I am qualified to testify on behalf of the university on the quality of West Campus’ chicken wings.

It appears to me that West Campus serves two types of chicken wings:

1. The good kind.
2. The bad kind.

It seems that the type of wings served on West alternates every day, completely irrespective of dining hall. I have had both types of wings in Cook, Bethe, Keeton, and Rose. 

Today’s wings, served in Bethe, were the bad kind. They were over-seasoned, excessively fatty and greasy, and devoid of all chicken-like taste. 

These type of wings are so over-seasoned that I can predict with 100% accuracy which type of wings (type one or two) are served in the dining hall on any given day just by walking in and sniffing the air. 

The wings served yesterday in Keeton, however, were the good kind. They were crispy, but not too crispy, and of quality taste. I place them on a pedestal above Wings Over Ithaca, but below Buffalo Wild Wings and Wingstop. They are of perfect quality for a university ranked 3rd in the US for campus food. 

The wings today, however, don’t even make the list and are so awful that Cornell should drop at least 10 ranks in the list of universities with the best dining hall food. 

I implore all of you to help me find a way to help rectify this wing situation so that we may all enjoy tasteful chicken wings on West on any given day. 

Thank you.",1,LABEL_1,0.99979216,0.00020784335,0.99979216

Technically, it doesn’t count as physics 2 at tech, it counts as a physics elective. My question is, should I still apply, as they might take this into consideration and still give me a chance?

10541,"Just got accepted into LSP through ED 1 and I'm ecstatic because NYU is my dream school! I have a few questions concerning the Liberal Studies Core Program:

1.  What are the differences between The Liberal Studies Core Program and Global Liberal Studies Program? How do I know which one I'm in?
2. How flexible is LSP when choosing classes, and is the program especially good for students who still don't know what to major in?
3. I will be spending my first year away at a global site. Is it true that it's harder to find and make friends at the global sites because classes are a lot smaller?
4. Where will I be staying (housing) once I return to NYC during my second year?
5. Does LSP award class credits for AP test exam scores of 4 or higher? 
6. Will all the courses I'm taking for the first two years be very similar to those in other NYU schools (mostly General Education courses)? I've heard people say LSP courses are easier; are the classes not as academically rewarding/rigorous/insightful? 
7. If I know what major I want early on, will I be able to take courses that fulfill the graduation requirements for that major? Will failing to do so prevent me from graduating in 4 years?
8. What's the process of declaring a major at CAS, Steinhardt, Stern, and Tisch after I finish the program? I know there's an application for the latter two schools, and I'm wondering if LSP students get priority acceptance to these schools? I'm undecided about my major and I'm concerned that I won't be able study the major I want once I've made my mind.
9. There seems to be a notion that LSP students are students who barely got in, and are therefore less intelligent/qualified to attend NYU. This statement is disheartening, and I just want to know how prevalent this perspective is held by other students?

 Would you say most of your classmates when you started off freshman year knew about engineering? Like I’m talking beyond the basic chem and physics. Like will they expect us to know anything from high school about like electrical or mechanical engineering. BTW I’m looking to pursue CS and have some coding experience.

13. Schultz had attained a grade point average of 3.9 as of the time of his death.

14. Schultz was majoring in engineering.

15. Like many other Georgia Tech students, Scott Schultz suffered from mental health issues.

4

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 5 of 12

16. Those mental health issues included, but were not limited to, clinical depression.

📷

5

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 6 of 12

28. Schultz’s appearance corresponded to the description he provided to the 911 dispatcher – he was a white male with long blonde hair dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans.

29. Each of the officers saw that Schultz was walking slowly. 30. Each of the officers saw that Schultz was alone.  
31. Each of the officers saw that Schultz’ arms were at his side. 32. Officers drew their handguns and pointed them at Schultz. 33. Schultz was barefoot.

34. Schultz was verbally calm.  
35. Schultz did not state any threat to either of the officers.  
36. Schultz did not move his arms in a violent or aggressive manner. 37. One officer shouted at Schultz, “Speak.”  
38. Schultz did not immediately respond.  
39. One officer yelled at Schultz, asking for his name,  
40. Schultz did not immediately respond.  
41. Each of the officers was twenty or more feet in distance from

Schultz’s position. As Schultz moved slowly, officers adjusted their position to keep a safe distance from Schultz.

42. Schultz paused and turned the position of his body so that he was facing several of the officers.

6

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 7 of 12

43. Schultz slowly walked a few steps in the direction of the three officers.

44. One of the three officers told Schultz not to move.

45. At the time that he was told not to move, Schultz’ arms remained at his side.

46. At the time that he was told not to move, Schultz was facing in the direction of the three officers.

47. Each of the officers observed that Schultz was not acting rationally and was not responding rationally to officer commands.

48. Schultz’s actions as of the time that he was told not to move were consistent with a person who is experiencing a mental health crisis and were actions which a reasonably trained law enforcement officer would recognize as such.

49. One or more of the four officers had received training designed to equip police officers with the observational skills to judge when a subject whom they are confronting is undergoing a mental health crisis or is otherwise engaging in behavior reflective of mental illness.

50. The specialized training, Crisis Intervention Techniques, trains an officer in methods to de-escalate a potentially dangerous situation when

7

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 8 of 12

dealing with a person undergoing a mental health crisis or engaging in behavior reflective of mental illness.

51. Officer Beck was not one of those officers.

52. Several of the officers at the scene remained calm and followed standard de-escalation techniques without initiating physical force directed at Scott Schultz.

53. Unlike the other officers, Officer Beck did not de-escalate and instead used physical force.

54. Immediately after Schultz was told not to move by one of his fellow officers, Beck shot Schultz – firing his weapon one time.

55. Beck was the only officer to fire his weapon at Schultz.

56. At the time that Beck fired his weapon, Schultz had taken no physical or verbal action which constituted a threat to the physical safety of Beck or the other officers.

57. At the time that Beck fired his weapon, Schultz had taken no physical or verbal action which constituted a threat to the physical safety of another person.

58. At the time that Beck fired his weapon, according to news reporting at the time, the majority of Georgia Tech’s police officers had not completed the Crisis Intervention training.

8

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 9 of 12

59. The steps taken by Georgia Tech to train its officers in Crisis Intervention Techniques were clearly insufficient to prevent Schultz’s death.

60. The failure to properly train its police officers in Crisis Intervention Techniques was the result of inaction and decisional failures which occurred well in advance of Schultz’ death.

61. The need for such training was well known within the law enforcement community.

62. Studies published years in advance of Schultz’s death estimated that “at least half” of all fatal police encounters involve persons with psychiatric disorders. Kelley Bouchard, “*Across Nation, Unsettling Acceptance When Mentally Ill in Crisis are Killed*,” Portland Press Herald, Dec. 9, 2012.

63. Once he was shot, Schultz did not die immediately.

64. Schultz endured pain and emotional harm in anticipation of his own death.

65. The death certificate declared, correctly, that Schultz’s death was caused by a gunshot wound to his torso.

66. Schultz was pronounced dead just after midnight on the morning of September 17, 2017.

9

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 10 of 12

67. Schultz’s death was the result of Georgia Tech’s and the State of Georgia’s failure over time to properly train their personnel to act in such a way as to prevent the exclusion of persons such as Scott Schultz from the safety to which all students were entitled on the campus of Georgia Tech.

68. As of the preparation of this Complaint, Plaintiffs have, through their counsel, repeatedly sought, without success, to obtain the investiga- tive records of Georgia Tech, of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, of the City of Atlanta, and the Office of the District Attorney of Fulton County, Georgia. The records sought include, but are not limited to, witness statements, photographic and auditory recordings, still photos, ballistics evidence, and physical evidence. None of those records have been produced.

69. As a result of the denial of access to the information contained within those files, Plaintiffs anticipate that an Amendment to this Complaint may be appropriate in the future.

CAUSES OF ACTION  
70. The actions of Tyler Austin Beck violated the constitutional right

of Scott Schultz to be free from unreasonable seizures as established by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Beck’s actions not only caused physical harm to Scott Schultz, they killed him.

10

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 11 of 12

71. The Board Of Regents Of The University System Of Georgia By And On Behalf Of Georgia Institute Of Technology is and has been at all relevant times the recipient of federal financial assistance. Part of that financial assistance has been used to fund the operations, construction and/or maintenance of Georgia Tech. By its actions or inactions, Georgia Tech denied Scott Schultz the equal access to the benefit of its services, programs or activities in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794 and the regulations promulgated thereto and in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and such denial is actionable through Title II of said Act.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
For and upon the foregoing, Plaintiffs pray that this Court:

a. Afford them a trial by jury as to all claims and issues for which a jury is available.

b. Award them all damages available to the Estate of Scott Schultz which are permitted by the laws of the State of Georgia and the laws of the United States – damages from each of the Defendants.

11

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 12 of 12

c. Award William Schultz and Lynne Schultz all damages which are available as a result of Scott Schultz’s wrongful death – damages from each of the Defendants.

d. Award the Plaintiffs such costs and attorneys’ fees as are available by operation of the laws of the State of Georgia and of the United States.

So submitted on this the 11th day of September, 2019.

I've never withdrawn any class before. However, I don't think that I can handle computer Vision course. this course is out of my capabilities. Thus, I am thinking to drop it. 

Since I never withdrew before, I have no idea how this affects to my financial aid. Can anyone have experience ? 

Should I pay something after drop?

I am OOS student receiving full amount of FAFSA and 7500 $ Tech Grant per semester.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're planning to take any CSE courses that involve programming in C/C++ or are taking any right now, you'd likely be aware of how annoying Segmentation Faults are to deal with.  \[Stensal\]([https://stensal.com/](https://stensal.com/)) is a free-to-use cloud IDE that has built-in functionality to help users debug segfaults in their code, which was created to make programming in C/C++ pain-free. If a segfault occurs during program execution, the built-in console will output a straightforward and informative message about where the segfault occurred and why, which makes debugging a breeze. You can even upload your own files to the IDE as well, so you can have a uniform work environment for your assignments. The tool was developed to help CS students and C/C++ learners in general have a less frustrating and more rewarding experience with C/C++, so hopefully some of you guys will find it helpful!

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions/comments/concerns/etc, feel free to join the \[Discord server\]([https://discord.gg/3dzgKZH](https://discord.gg/3dzgKZH)), which was created as a community for C/C++ learners and students like yourselves. Happy coding!",1,LABEL_1,0.9998375,0.00016251112,0.9998375

10664,"I'm giving up on Cornell. I hate it here. I am tired, burned out and have crippling depression. I didn't get out of bed for two weeks and everyone expected me to act like I was fine and do psets and prelims. It's so much harder to make friends here and people seem miserable and depressed. I was genuinely looking forward to becoming a software developer but Cornell has made me hate the idea of school. I'm a junior and every semester my grades have been in the shitter. I don't party, I don't go to club meetings anymore, I don't do sports, I don't have a job, I don't volunteer, I don't have anything to show for any semester I have been here except numerous all nighters spent in PSB followed by bombing prelims and massive student debt. 

Everyone is so self obsessed and the competition is toxic. People seem to do things for the sake of being seen doing them and because they are expected to do them. Today I watched my friend share about his internship offer and no one bothered to congratulate him. All that followed was a pathetic attempt to one up each other. Professors don't seem to care about a student's well being. They almost seem to be getting satisfaction from their classes/prelims breaking students. Why is depression so normalized here? I've heard students openly say they are very depressed and no one seems to bat an eye. It takes weeks to get an apt. with a mental health professional at Cornell health. 

There seems to be an overarching standard of measure for every action I take. I am tired of hearing bs from students threatening to drop a class for being one SD below a prelim mean, or breaking down because they didn't get a call back from goldman sachs after their HireVue. There seems to be no life in this place. Everything is just a prestige and numbers game. 

To top it all off, the mentality of ""if you don't like it, then leave"" seems to be everywhere. Emailed my prof about a bad grade on an assignment and he suggested dropping the class, talked to another professor about $450 books I can't afford and he suggested dropping the class, talked to a mental health professional about having mental breakdowns and he suggested skipping town, mentioned discomfort over offensive anti LGBTQ comments about my friend at a club and they suggested I walk away from the conversation. Is leaving the only option? 

I am tired of being tired, burned out and depressed. Every day of being here makes me feel like I don't have a life outside of Cornell to look forward to. I go back home and I have to be all smiles and have all these lunches with high schoolers and parents of kids who would give a kidney to go here. I have gotten to the point where I don't bother to sugar coat it. Cornell is a miserable place, the ivy league degree is very valuable but it comes at the cost of a person's mental health and identity outside of beinga cornellian. I talk to a lot of people daily and it's disgusting how the one thing I have continuously heard from freshmen and seniors alike is how they hate it here and can't wait to get out. It's alarming to hear a freshman who has only been here 3 months say they can't wait to leave.

I toured Columbia this past summer and really fell in love with it, and even though I’m considering two other ED options (Brown and UPenn), this will likely be the one I choose. Since I’m not 100% certain yet (and since it’s really important that I know I want to go to a school before I petition my school’s founders to let me ED), I’d love to hear commentary from Columbia students regarding anything such as:

1. What the general atmosphere is like
2. How the professors are (if they’re accessible, overload you with work, etc.)
3. How competitive it is in CC
4. If you think going to Columbia is worth the work you put in, money you pay, other schools you turned down, etc.
5. What the student community is like
6. How connected Columbia is to the city

After running through the last 300 posts on r/Cornell looking at every single comment, checking the flair of the user commenting I determined the following:

Number of unique CS vs AEP majors on r/Cornell:

CS: 44

AEP: 22

This number seemed suspicious to me, as I would argue that there is far more than a 2:1 ratio of CS to AEP majors at Cornell, but WHATEVER. Maybe it was just a coincidence. I decided to explore further. I then ran through those accounts to see what percent of each were created within the last year:

 Percent of the above accounts created in the last year:

CS: (6/44) = .1363636...

AEP: (16/22) = .72727272...

ODD. This seems like a statistically significant result to me. I took it one step further and logged the dates on which all of the AEP accounts were created, they are as follows:

I relied on my FAFSA EFC of approximately a $1000 and the Upenn Net Price Calculator of around $10,000 to ""demonstrate my need"" that Upenn promises to meet for every student. 

And right now I'm sitting on a 79K estimated total cost of attendance, and I think it just does not make any sense that I have to pay 8 times my NPC and 80 times my EFC? In which case I will not be able to attend obviously. 

Their website says that even people above 200K+ income receives financial aid, so I believe there must be a mistake. I submitted a few forms late, right after 11/4, but I have confirmation emails about them. I wanted to check whether they had any missing documents before considering my aid, but the only thing that the financial aid office could do was tell me to appeal, which I certainly am. 

If anyone has any idea what could have possibly happened, or if there's a way I can get more information on how my evaluation went down, that would be much appreciated. I heard appealing takes months, so I hope to be able to take action or at least get some information from their office soon—I'm just unsure how...

10828,"I’ve been seeing CAPS for anxiety problems and have thankfully been improving. However, a recent incident hit me really hard, and as much I wanted to cry throughout roughly the past week, I don’t know how to talk to my friends about it. Figured it’d be good if I let it out during my session tomorrow.

I know some people go to CAPS sessions just to cry. But low key it’s my fourth session, and I’ve acted pretty positive and cheerful throughout the first three, so I don’t know if it’s appropriate to do so anymore. Sorry for this random post, but any insight helps. Thanks!",1,LABEL_1,0.9998822,0.00011771803,0.9998822
