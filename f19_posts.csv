Subject to Dismissal?,"This past quarter I doubled the amount of hours I work, was way too involved with an extracurricular (it ended up taking up several hours of time a week), struggled with anxiety, and was overall just bad at balancing things. I am a 4th year hoping to graduate in the spring or summer!

After a really challenging quarter, I ended up getting a C+, a C, and an F in NPB 101. I am a psych major but I am doing the BS (NPB is required for that). I got about a 1.3/4 GPA this quarter and received a subject for academic dismissal notification. I have scheduled my counseling appointment and am working on the thing youre supposed to fill out, but I am incredibly worried.

I absolutely cannot be dismissed or even take a quarter off. I am ready to work really hard next quarter (quitting one of my jobs, taking time off from extracurriculars). Has anyone had an experience where they were subject to dismissal but were just placed on probation/ were ok to continue as long as they got their grades up? any advice?",1577754912,1,0

Feeling defeated,"I ended my first quarter as a transfer with minimal progress and a very low GPA because I would barely go to class and always try to catch up before an exam. 

I was extremely homesick and just too depressed to leave my apartment. I tried to make appointments with a counselor but they just never had availability and even cancelled on me on one occasion.

Every time I go back home I dread coming back to Davis, even though I have some friends and hobbies I enjoy doing. It just kills me to come back knowing how bad I’m doing up there in every aspect. 

I have been considering dropping out but I feel like I need to keep reminding myself. “It’s your first quarter!” But I also find myself daydreaming about going to school closed to home.

Do most students understand how curves work?,"I am a Junior and I've been thinking about this for a while.

For the past 2 and a half years, after every single exam (especially after the final grades are out) people seem to constantly flood piazza (or any other choice of communication) with questions regarding curves. A lot of them just didn't make sense to me. I wanted to discuss about this for a while.

So basically what I noticed is that professors usually aim for a 70~75% average on an exam, and set that as a C or C+. If the average is close enough, or if the average is higher than the target, the class usually isn't curved (unless the average is too high, in which case a downcurve can be applied in very rare cases)

If the average is lower than the target, professors curve the class to have a C or C+ average. For example, getting a 66% on an exam where the average was 50%, you will likely get curved to a B or B+. 

Students also seem to ask for curves even when the class average is well over 80% with plenty of chances given by the professor for extra credit and whatnot. Most of the time if someone asks a question about a curve, it gets serenaded with a thread of replies asking about the same thing.

We're all lonely. Let's fix that: UPDATE,"Wow! This gained far more traction and excitement than I expected! Let's do it!

**The goal of this event** is to provide an open forum and easy opportunity for us, who are feeling a bit lonely, to make some new friends. I understand some are more reserved/introverted than others but judging by the comments in the first thread it's clear to me that this will be a very open and friendly community. It's okay to approach at your own pace, no one will force you; we're happy you're here.  
**Remember:** We're here to make friends, it's wise to avoid hot topics. We all come from different backgrounds and hold different perspectives, they're all valid, let's respect that. Let's be a positive and welcoming environment.

**WHERE/WHEN UPDATE:**   
***When***: 4pm, Sunday, October 20th. After looking through all the comments on the original post I saw that Sunday late-afternoon would be a more fitting time.   
***Where***: E-Street Plaza. Due to so much interest we are moving the meetup spot to the E-Street Plaza. This location is very public/open and will allow us to make plans by ear and find what can accommodate us best. E-Street Plaza is in downtown Davis and has Baskin-Robins, Taqueria El Burrito, and is across from De'Veres Irish Pub. [https://goo.gl/maps/6LCXL1uF4EnScSxi8](https://goo.gl/maps/6LCXL1uF4EnScSxi8)

And he said, and I quote, “I know, but I’m too lazy.” 

So later that night, after he went he went to bed, I fished out all of the textbooks from the trash can and febreezed them. 

The next day I went to the bookstore and his books got me $180.

A clarification.,"To a specific user who I've already blocked early this morning and will not be named:

The whole reason I wasted what little money I have on chocolate and face paint was not for ""attention."" If I wanted attention I'd do something a lot cheaper, like jumping off a building or getting hit by a bus.

The reason I bought those things--with personal money, mind you, not the group's--was to draw more people towards the movement. There are a lot of people who have no idea what's going on, all the American students see is a bunch of strangers yelling in a foreign language.

I figured, hey, *I* like chocolate, so therefore, other people must like chocolate too! So if people like chocolate, they're going to naturally be thrilled by *free* chocolate. I thought it would be a good way to pull people into the protest who would otherwise have no reason to get involved, and hopefully in doing so, teach them about the movement and get them on our side.

As for the face paint, I wanted a way for the protestors and protest supporters to express their beliefs without vandalizing the school. Posters can be torn down, and chalking is against the rules. But there's no rule against face paint, and you can't easily remove it from someone else.

Not only that, but posters can only be in certain stationary locations. You know what can go anywhere, though? All of *us*! We can wander around the school bearing the Hong Kong flower and words of support, and not only will people see it, but they'll have the opportunity to ask the painted person, ""hey, what's all this about?"" So they're not just *seeing* our support. They're interacting with us, and learning about Hong Kong!

I mean, I get where you're coming from. The protests have been bloody and it's not something to make light of. It's a serious subject, and the protestors deserve respect and recognition. Which is exactly why I'm trying to attract people towards the movement.

My hope is that when people see the painted faces tomorrow, they'll want to ask, ""hey, what does that flower symbolize?"" ""Hey, why does it look like your eye was shot out?"" ""Hey, what do those foreign symbols mean?""

I want to make people curious, because curiosity is what drives people to educate themselves.",1571362965,0,0

Pro-Chinese Government Propaganda in this Sub and on Campus: Observations and Patterns,"**Introduction**

In the many discussions in this sub regarding the pro-freedom protests in Hong Kong, I’ve observed several recurring themes, talking points, and strategies by commenters and posters who have taken a stance in favor of mainland China’s authoritarian government (hereafter, the “CPC” for ""Communist Party of China""). Below is a brief summary of these rhetorical observations, along with brief rebuttals.

For background and reference, the protestors in Hong Kong have five demands and objectives. The first, “the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process,” involves the main precipitating event of the protests, which is a proposed bill that would remove the limited due process that is currently protected in Hong Kong by exposing Hong Citizens to direct political persecution in mainland China. The last, “the resignation of Carrie Lam and the implementation of universal suffrage for Legislative Council and Chief Executive elections,” would ensure a degree of democratic self-governance in Hong Kong while remaining part of China. The remaining three, “the retraction of the ‘riot’ characterization,” “the release and exoneration of arrested protesters,” and “the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests” are meant to address the ongoing brutal attempt by the government to suppress and discredit the protestors.

For China’s part, democratization in Hong Kong presents an existential threat to their regime. Historically, nothing destabilizes an authoritarian regime more consistently than bordering a democracy. It’s hard for subjects to accept authoritarianism and oppression when free people live on the other side of an imaginary line. China is currently separated from its closest democracies by seas, mountains, and buffer states. The prospect of a free democratic Hong Kong bordering the Chinese mainland has motivated a strong and violent response against the protestors by the Chinese government, even in the face of international condemnation.

Below, I’ve catalogued nine of the recurring themes, talking points, and strategies in pro-CPC propaganda on this sub. Even this post, which ended up being longer than I expected, captures neither the true breadth of the problem nor the depth to which some users have bought into China’s propaganda. A deeper rhetorical analysis would require more space than this post can afford and more time than I have to offer. For starters, I made the decision not to directly quote any specific user spreading propaganda, partially because I don’t want to call out anyone in particular or encourage brigading, although I recognize the lack of direct quotes may weaken my generalizations of those users’ arguments. I also don’t provide supporting evidence for my claims of extensive police brutality—which will likely be noted by those commenters who favor the Chinese government—because the main purpose of this writeup is to discuss the rhetoric on this sub, while I assume by now we’re all too familiar with the plight of the protestors.

&amp;#x200B;

**Using the term “Brainwashing”**

The first and perhaps most clever recurring theme in the pro-CPC posts is the use of the term “brainwashing.” Why would pro-CPC Redditors use this term so consistently? “Brainwashing” is a term that evokes a cartoonish image of people getting hypnotized by pocket watches. The term is meant to immediately denigrate any discussion of China’s extensive and pervasive propaganda campaign. Joking about the term “brainwashing” is also a great way to endear oneself to the audience. But, as we have seen, while the pro-CPC commenters in our sub aren’t brainwashed with swirly eyes, they have bought into much of the Chinese government’s propaganda and are parroting it here.

Pro-CPC commenters using this strategy will say things like, “We’re not brainwashed, we want to hear both sides of the issue” or “I’m just a scary brainwashed foreign student here to answer your questions lol.” Notice that these kinds of phrases make any following discussion of propaganda seem silly while also making the pro-CPC commenters seem reasonable and even funny.

While we’re on the topic of manipulative terminology, it’s worth noting that there are far less clever but equally purposeful attempts to control the narrative through specific terms. The most notable, of course, is to refer to the protests and protestors as “riots” and “rioters.” Other tactics, like using “western values” instead of “human rights” or using “China” and “Chinese people” instead of “the Chinese government” get their own sections below. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Cultivating Apathy**

When people think of the term “propaganda” they often imagine an authoritarian government trying to make their people believe incorrect or even impossible things, like that time that North Korea told its subjects that it found an ancient unicorn lair. The most effective and insidious propaganda isn’t a spread of lies, but a spread of apathy. Getting people to believe your lies is hard, but getting people to stop caring is an easy and effective way to control people. In short, authoritarian governments usually try to get their people to believe that their own beliefs and actions don’t matter, because the outcome will be the same regardless of any action they might take or opinion they might hold.

This strategy has been very noticeable among the pro-CPC posts in this sub. When confronted about their opinions of the Hong Kong protestors’ demands, the response is usually something like, “I don’t care either way, because they’re not going to get their demands met anyway.” Then, having dodged the question about content of protestors’ demands, they can move onto the other recurring themes and talking points of the propaganda.

&amp;#x200B;

**Twisting Hong Kong’s fight for freedom into a persecution of Chinese people**

The protests in Hong Kong are a conflict between the people of Hong Kong and an oppressive authoritarian government. The outcome of the conflict will determine the fate of human rights for millions of people living in Hong Kong and their descendants.

The authoritarian versus freedom fighter nature of the conflict puts the Chinese government in a bad light, obviously. So what is the best way for the government to spin the conflict in its own favor? The answer is to recast the conflict as an imposition of western values on the Chinese people, thus making the discussion one about cultural colonization, racism, and the preservation of Chinese values.

We see this in our subreddit whenever those defending the Chinese government attempt to frame the goals of the Hong Kong protests as “western” or suggest that democracy or human rights in general are somehow incompatible with Chinese values. This ignores that both democracy and a respect for human rights have been successful in a wide variety of cultures throughout the world. This is not only true in Asia in general (see India, the world’s largest democracy) and East Asia specifically (see Japan and South Korea), but even in an actual country populated by Chinese people (see Taiwan, which even if you don’t want to call it a country, is at the very least a functionally independent Chinese island democratically governed by its own people). Democracy has been successful in such a wide variety of countries because the core tenents of democracy—that people should control and be protected from their own government—is not incompatible with any culture, it’s merely incompatible with authoritarian political interests.

Don’t let the rhetoric distract you from the fact that this fight is one between the Chinese people and the Chinese government over their human rights. Siding with the people against their government doesn’t make you a westerner, it just makes you right.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conflating the merits of their opinion with their right to have an opinion**

In the specific case here at UC Davis of pro-CPC students holding their own counter-rallies, we see one of the oldest talking points of those who would use freedom of speech against itself. Several times, we have seen commenters say that they just want to have their own rally and table to share their own views of the Hong Kong protestors. How can you be against the pro-CPC rally if you support the freedoms of speech and assembly?

Those who have lived their lives in oppression might think this is a clever or even profound argument, but those who have lived in the free world are more than familiar with this fallacy by now. It’s the same question every time, always in a new wrapper. “How can you be against Nazi’s marching down your streets yet call yourself a defender of freedom?” or “How can you criticize that person’s remarks? Even if they’re sexist, what about their freedom of speech?”

The answer, of course, is not that we’re against anyone expressing him/her/their-self. If you want to spend your time in a free country to speak out against freedom, then go ahead. But respecting your right to speak doesn’t mean that we have to like your message or respect you for sharing that message. Nor does it mean that we can’t or won’t meet your speech with our own. Freedom to speak is not a mandate to be heard.

&amp;#x200B;

**Refusal to engage with the content of the protestors’ message**

&amp;

**Focusing on the protestors’ symbols rather than the protestors’ message**

I believe that most common strategy of Pro-CPC commenters is their refusal to directly engage the substance of the Hong Kong protestors’ message and demands. Every attempt to solicit a response regarding the five demands of the Hong Kong protestors are ignored or met with quick deflection. This is not surprising, because the demands are far too reasonable to attack directly, leaving deflection as an obvious strategy.

Many of these deflections are to other talking points discussed elsewhere in this post. Here, however, I want to discuss one specific form of deflection—the focus on symbols rather than message. Shifting the discussion to symbols from messages is an incredibly effective strategy when backed into a corner; I’m sure we all employ it from time to time. Symbols are powerful, yet easy to take out of context and easy to assign one’s own meaning. But let’s humor the pro-CPC commenters for a moment and take a look at the actual symbolic arguments they’ve made to distract from the substantive arguments against their government.

For those who don’t know, the UK returned control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, ending over 100 years of foreign rule of the city. Many in Hong Kong feared that the turnover would end many legal protections of their rights that existed under colonial government but which were not protected in China. As these fears have turned out to be very justified, some protestors have turned to the colonial flag of Hong Kong as a message to Chinese and local governments that they and their rights were stronger under foreign occupation than they are now under domestic rule.

Pro-CPC propaganda, however, has seized upon the protestors’ use of the old colonial flag to claim that the protestors are secretly intent on independence or-quite ridiculously-upon return to British colonial rule. This allows the Chinese government to shift the conversation to the preservation of the Chinese state instead of focusing on the actual demands of the protestors, which are quite limited in scope. Don’t let them deflect to symbols; keep the focus on substance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dehumanization of persecuted groups, namely Uyghurs in China**

When confronted about the extensive state violence against the Uyghur population, keep an eye out for two key responses. First, of course, is deflection and minimization (e.g. “I haven’t heard that much about it, but I don’t think it’s as bad as the media makes it sound"" followed by a subject change). The second is the oldest trick in the book for oppressing minorities: dehumanization. This second point seems to have a lot of buy-in from Chinese commenters, which isn’t surprising because people everywhere have always been eager to buy into any narrative that presents different people as inferior.

In the case of Uyghurs, look for commenters portraying them as especially violent (e.g. “the government had to ban knives where Uyghurs live because they keep trying to stab each other”). This, in turn, builds into a narrative that any state action against the Uyghur population (which, they insist, is minimal) is necessary for the Uyghur’s own good and for the protection of the rest of China. If these themes sound familiar, they should. We’ve seen it many times before, at home and abroad. States don’t persecute minorities for their own good, they do it because the minority group is in the way.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cherry-picking, Exaggerating, Hypocrisy, and False Equivalence**

The hypocrisy and cherry-picking of the pro-CPC commenters deserve their own post, because there is a lot to unpack. In this one section, I want to briefly highlight what to look for.  

All messages, politics, and symbols aside, there are two indisputable truths about the Hong Kong protests. Firstly, the protestors have been extraordinarily peaceful. Even if the very limited but very repeated allegations of violence by the protestors were true, the violent crime rate among the protestors is much lower than a given city of equivalent size. Do the propagandists really not think that a protest of well over a million people wouldn’t have any bad actors? Or are they hoping that we’re that stupid? If anyone tries to convince you that the protestors have been anything other than restrained and peaceful, especially given the circumstances, don’t give them an inch of respect, because they aren’t giving you any.

Secondly, the violence perpetrated by the state against their people in Hong Kong is extraordinarily excessive and atrocious. This is not the actions of a few bad actors within the police force; it is a coordinated and widespread effort by the state to violently quell, intimidate, and suppress their people. Do not let them convince you that both sides are at fault. One side is marching for their freedom, the other is attacking the people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Imposing their own Rules, Ignoring History**

Above, I noted that the propagandists will highlight even the most isolated incident of violence by the protestors as evidence that the protests are generally violent. I also noted that the propagandists try to frame the protests as a secret succession movement. But while it’s abundantly clear that both accusations are patently false, I ask, “why would it matter if the protests were violent riots for independence?”

The propagandists have tried to establish a premise in the debate that all violent protest and all calls for independence would delegitimize the protests at large. But have they forgotten American history or have they also forgotten their own? Weren’t the origins of current US and Chinese states built upon violent uprisings against the incumbent governments? Furthermore, aren’t these revolutions seen as morally justified in their current respective countries? Violence in popular uprisings doesn’t invalidate the uprising or, if it does, then both the United States and China are both built upon illegitimate foundations. In short, the propagandists have been so busy trying to trick us into thinking the Hong Kong protests are violent, they haven’t actually made a case for why they shouldn’t be violent. They are, after all, fighting for their freedom.  So if someone tells you that the Hong Kong protests are too violent, tell them that means China should surrender itself to Taiwan, the last remnant of the government mainland China violently overthrew 70 years ago.

The case of commenters discrediting the protests as a secret independence movement is a somewhat hilarious example of propaganda meant for a Chinese audience finding itself in the wrong forum. This talking point is meant to pander to a common and strong desire in the Chinese population for a unified country, by evoking the specter of succession. This obviously doesn’t land too well in the United States, which was built around the idea that violent succession is justified and necessary in the pursuit freedom, liberty, and democracy. So, as a tip to the pro-CPC commenters, maybe avoid talking points that make the American readers associate the Hong Kong revolutionaries with our founding fathers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Justifying human rights abuses by China’s economic growth**

One final common pro-Chinese government talking point is that the numerous, large, and ongoing human human rights violations throughout China are justified by China’s economic growth over the past few decades. Let’s breeze past how morally repugnant that argument is, because if you think that’s a legitimate justification, no internet rant is going to save you. Instead, let’s take a look at the causal claim that China’s growth is due to its humanitarian atrocities. I argue that with proper perspective, China’s growth has, at best, happened despite its authoritarian government and, at worst, has been greatly delayed by its authoritarianism.

Authoritarianism in general is strongly associated with lower economic growth, although the causal relationship between government type and economic performance is not entirely understood. China is the exception to the poor economic performance of totalitarian government. And even then, controlling for its large population, it’s not an impressive exception with a GDP per capita roughly equivalent to Mexico.

China is the largest country in the world by far, controls resource-rich territory, and has had its current regime for 70 years. The fact that they are now the second largest economy in the world isn’t surprising. The question isn’t why it’s doing well now; the question is why it took so long to catch up. Apologists for the CPC might say that China simply started with next to nothing 70 years ago following the Japanese occupation. Nonetheless, the numbers speak for themselves. Of the other top-ten economies, almost all were devastated by World War Two, yet they managed rebound faster and stronger than China with just a fraction of the population and without committing crimes against humanity. And if we’re talking about growth rate, sure it’s high, but it’s easy to grow a lot when your baseline is so low.  China’s government, policies, and actions have delayed their inevitable economic growth by decades.

You can look into my post history where I believe it shows that Im in a quite neutral position regarding the HK movement, and I think my experience as someone from mainland can give you an indepth view of the side that you don’t usually see — the side of mainland Chinese students. The majority of mainland Chinese students do not support and are against the movenment in HK for two main reasons to my knowledge, and I will go over each one of them and explain why they see it that way. 

1. They believe HK protest is a violent separatist movement that’s trying to make HK an indepedent country.

They view it this way mainly due to how the protests are displayed by the state media. The state medias show footage of police and mainland Chinese getting beaten up by masked protesters, pictures of protesters waving British national flags, videos of protesters damaging the public properties, and more. Did these things really happen? Likely yes. Did they do it just because they are violent thugs? Probably no. Do they make up the majority of the protesters? Likely no. However, the state medias use this footages to paint the protest to be about HK independence and mentions nothing about the five demands. Many of you asked in the AMA why HK independence is a bad thing and why it angers mainland Chinese so much. HK independence is a highly sensitive topic due to two things. First, it is just not possible in anyway. HK has no military of its own, is in the middle of mainland China, and has its infrastructures, such as power plants and water reservoirs, are all in mainland.  Second, it’s due to history of HK. HK was a colony leased to the British in 1800s, and the lease has always to be seen as a shame over the entire Chinese race because it shows how weak Chinese were and how Chinese were treated like slaves that would just give out their territory for opium. Fortunately for people in HK, British brought in a western democratic system, trades, and modern technology, which improved the economy by a sustantial degree. This sounds pretty positive, but it leads to the next reason that mainland Chinese dislikes the movement.

2. Many mainland Chinese believe HKers see them as an inferior race.

Under British rule, HK exceeded PRC (People’s Republic of China, aka mainland China) economically by a huge amount with its GDP being higher than PRC for decades. Because of this, many mainland Chinese immigrated to HK, and as what usually happens during a period that had a lot of immigration, discrimination and xnophobia happens. Mainland immigrants were given derogatory terms, such as “阿燦”, “大陸哩”, “大陸仔”, “支那人”, etc (you have to google them since each one has a history). Later during the infamous Chinese Milk Scandal, many mainlanders went to HK to buy milk powder for their children because they lost trust in Chinese brands. They bought so much that many HKers couldn’t even buy for their own because they were OOS. This brought mainland Chinese a new derogotary term, “locusts.” And of course, the state media reported all of this to the mainland Chinese to show them how HKers see them as inferior. 

(Below is a personal experience that I first hesitated to include because I could be biased due to many factors, but i tried my best to write it as close to what happened as possible. Sample size of encounters is not large either where N ≈ 15)

When I went to HK over several ocasions,  i found some really consistant patterns of how people treated me. I do not speak Cantonese, so I have to use Mandarin or English. Although HKers dont speak mandarin, they use very similar written language as mainland (traditional vs simplified Chinese). Because of this, I would type out things in traditional Chinese and show it to then. All of the questions pretty mich started with “hi, sorry for bothering. I’m from mainland and can’t speak Cantonese. Can you show me how to ...”. With this method, people most of the time responded in a really cold manner without any facial expression. I was just thinking maybe it was just that HK is a busy city and everyone is in a hurry until I started asking questions in English. Whenever I asked in English, people tend to smile a lot and respond my questions patiently. I am not the only one who have had this experience and was surprised when one of my friends bought up experience of his in a conversation where he found this pattern, too. Was it due to xenophobia or the bad stereotypical image of mainland tourists? Maybe. Was it just due to HKers feel more comfortable with English than mandarin? Perhaps. But one thing for sure was that I felt uncomfortable with identifying myself as someone from mainland and many people in China see this as discrimination.


Because of these, many mainland Chinese have a very biased view on anything that HKers do. Even if they did know the five demands, it would still be difficult to make them support the movements because of this nationalism and ethnicity related bias.",1571338717,45,0

"Has anyone gone through dismissal, retroactive withdrawal, and/or readmission?","Has anyone had a retroactive withdrawal approved or have gone through the dismissal/readmission process? 

I was dismissed for the 19-20 school year because of minimum progress and gpa standing. I spoke to the college dean advisors and they said one of my readmission conditions would be to retroactively withdraw from the quarter(s) that put me in a gpa deficit. If my petition for withdrawal goes through, I may be eligible to continue in winter/spring 2020. If my petition doesn't go through, I would have to wait until summer session 2020 to fix my gpa and minimum progress deficits. I believe my petition is strong as I do have a valid reason for my poor performance, but the "" [to drop or withdraw retroactively are the most difficult cases for the Committee to evaluate](https://academicsenate.ucdavis.edu/committees/grade-changes)"" from the grade changes committee page has me worried because its an understandably strict policy action. 

My withdrawal petition won't be evaluated by the board until the 15th of next month but the winter readmission application is due at the end of this month so I've nonstop stressing. I just don't know what I'll do if I'm dismissed until next summer as I'm unable to work and going back home isn't an option. I'm a transfer so I have no leftover lower division courses left take at CC and I'm two (!!) quarters away from graduating. 

I just feel so alone because I'm in this situation and I can not talk to my friends (who can't relate) about it. If anyone's been through dismissal/readmission/retroactive actions and can give me some advice or input (pm is fine) it would be greatly appreciated.",1571312158,6,0

We have seen many many posts about loneliness among UCD students, especially since the quarter has started. I feel like we're all feeling lonely in one way or another (you're not alone!) and I'd like to encourage us to do something about it.

I'd like to propose we organize a time and place to actually meet up and socialize! I would guess Saturday evening to be a time people are generally free, and downtown or campus a good place to meet. I'd vote maybe 6pm at Phil's coffee.

Please comment below any interest in this along with your major, your currently academic year, and some of your interests/hobbies.
I.e.: I'm an economics major who just transferred (3rd year) from San Diego. I like cars/motorcycles, the UCD minecraft server, and memes 🤙

Winter Quarter Jobs,"Hey guys!

 I was wondering how hard/easy it would be to find a job as a coffee shop barista/retail associate/similar jobs in winter quarter? I know employers tend to look for new employees with the come and go of each quarter, but where should I look for them? I've tried google, snagajob, and other job boards, but I haven't had much luck (for beginning fall quarter). Also, should I apply late december? Or wait until I'm back to Davis before I start filling out applications?

Thank you so much!",1572408853,9,0

Vista Energy,"To anyone that doesn’t know, Vista Energy is a 3rd party energy provider that often claims they’re part of PGE and that they can lower your bill.

Life after graduation???,"Hello, I'm currently a 4th year psychology major and I'm graduating in Spring 2020 (hopefully!) I know it's a little far in the future to be thinking about what I'm going to do immediately after my lease is up in August 2020, but um yeah the thoughts loom anyway. 

So ultimately my long-term goal is PA (Physician Assistant) program. But of course, if you're familiar with the pre-reqs, I have to gain anywhere between 1000-2000 hours of experience before I can even think about applying for a PA program. I was thinking of gaining this experience by getting my Medical Assistant (MA) certification.  Here is like my general timeline of how I want things to go:

Spring 2020: Apply for a MA program at a CC.

Fall 2020: Hopefully start MA program. I don't think MA programs are full-time, so I'd like to be working as well. I've been thinking about some entry level job as an administrative assistant or something, idk. Any help with this would be amazinnggg.

Spring 2021: Hopefully be done with MA program. Start looking for jobs.

Fall 2021: Hopefully I have an MA job. During this time, I was thinking of taking/retaking some classes at a CC that I need for PA school (Physiology, Anatomy, Stats, etc). 

\*fast forward to Fall 2022..maybe even Spring 2023\* apply for PA programs!!!

Anyway I got really off track, but like my ultimate question is where the heck do you find entry level jobs? Did you move back home after college? Did you get your own place immediately after college? I really wanna get my own place but rent is so expensive. If you're also on the PA route, what's your plan look like?  &gt;.&lt; HELP pls",1572302399,6,0

Room for sublease during the upcoming fall term,"Hey Ags! 

I am Andreas from Germany and I take part in the GSP of the UCD in my major aerospace engineering. I am looking for a sublease for the upcoming fall term. My budget would be 700$/month.

Some information about me: I started studying mechanical engineering in 2013 at the Technical University of Munich, Bavaria. I finished my bachelor's degree last year and now I am about to finish the master's program of my home university. I like to travel, hang out with friends (and drink the delicious beer from Munich) and do sports. My favorite sports are football (both, the European and the American version), baseball and sailing.

I would be very thankful for every offer or advice.  I would offer myself as a host during the Oktoberfest to whoever helps me out.

I am already in Sacramento, so if you wish to meet me in person, just write me a message here on reddit!

Have a nice day!",1568223512,2,0

STOLEN BIKE,"Hey! My bike was stolen yesterday roughly between 4:50pm-7:55pm from the front of Asmundson Hall. It's a black Raleigh Superbe Hybdrid. Frame Type: F.

Just to clarify, it’s registered under TAPs, I've already filed a report to the police about it, I’m checking for it on Craigslist, and I know it's not likely to be recovered, but I’m hoping somebody might've spotted it.

TIFU by Forgetting to Turn in a Paper... Help?,"Hey everyone, just made a huge mistake so I'm feeling pretty anxious right now. Woke up this morning and felt sick to my stomach, so I elected not to go to class, and ended up falling back asleep. Woke up again and realized I had missed the submission deadline for a research paper by about 20 minutes, and the assignment on canvas was closed.

Immediately I sent an e-mail to my professor and TA with a copy of my paper, apologizing and asking them to please consider my paper in spite of the professor's ""no late papers policy"" due to how little I had missed the deadline by. Waiting to hear back from them now.

This is a pretty big bummer, because I did well on the midterm and thought I did a good job on the paper, so I was hoping to get an A, but now it's possible I won't even pass... I'm a senior and applying to law school to boot, so failing could hurt me pretty badly.

I was just wondering if anyone here had any advice on how to proceed? I know that I messed up badly, but it feels like a huge punishment for an honest mistake. I'm already feeling pretty crappy at the moment, so it kind of feels like the world is ending lol, I guess I just need to know that it's not, and if anyone has any recommendations on how to improve my position, that would be a nice bonus :)",1575413899,1,0

Stuck in Cow Town - and shit sucks.," This campus is too large to make friends easily, and even with friends, it's impossible for everybody to make enough time to have healthy relationships in my group because we are all undergrad stem majors who don't know how to manage time and grades.

Academically, I can barely handle the minimum unit requirement. The mindset in lecture halls feels like a ""don't ask a question unless you know you're right"" one. Along these same lines, ive found students in my major (ANS) to be competitive to a point of pushing me down mentally to step ahead. I don't feel comfortable stating that I don't know an answer anymore. All of my discussion TA's for general classes (chem, bis, ect) are international male students who can't explain things very well, and it gets frustrating very quickly (To no fault of their own, I know they are trying). I  hate the learning mindset this school has, which often doesn't leave room for mistakes and as soon as you get behind there's no returning to your original pace.

I'm depressed and The SHWC doesn't even have enough therapists to see all of us, they're booked out -2 weeks. The online resource crisis line is literally scripted and didn't help at all ""did I help you move from a 'hot moment' to a 'cool calm' today?"" (Yes, that's a quote. The whole conversation went like this). All I needed was human connection and guidance earlier than the two week waiting period they offered.

Davis is accepting more students than it can handle and it's causing issues across the board, from mental health, class impactions, and housing space. 

I don't know how you upper-grads handle this but ive just been smoking weed to manage my anxiety and depression and it's obviously not helping. (no need to lecture there, it's a short term gratifying solution, I know) I don't know what to do, I feel alone, uncared for, uncomfortable, and destined to fail. 
I regret choosing Davis and wish I had gone to CC. I think I just can't handle the pace of this school, and maybe it's just a me problem. I feel it's too late to back out or even transfer to another UC now, I'm in my second year and don't know what my options are until after break because it was the soonest appointment I could get with an academic counselor. 
How do you guys manage it? It's too easy for me to fall into this pit of procrastination and depression, and it's a ruthless cycle.",1575350659,1,0

I’m adjusting poorly here even though I was very excited to be attending here,"Hey y’all, the title pretty much says it all. I feel like a complete loser and what makes it worse is that I’m not a freshman. I’m a transfer student who is very familiar with the quarter system.

I feel so dumb struggling like this because I feel like by now I should be used to this. I’m going on my 4th year of college and I still have no clue as to what I want to do with my life. Fall quarter was extremely rough me having to do deal with being far away from home, the loneliness, struggling class despite putting my hardest efforts, issues with tuition and just overall my poor mental health. 

In cc I was struggling as well because I was in a major that I was unhappy in. But I had Davis as my largest motivation. Prior then, I visited the campus multiple times, met with many advisors and I overall felt safe and excited to one day be coming here. I wanted to attend Davis because I wanted to do well academically and just be in a space where I was happy in. In addition to transferring into a major I was working hard towards. 

Now that I’m here, I’m just reminded of how much of big loser I still am. I’m struggling so much in my classes, I’m having trouble making friends, my plans for covering tuition is falling apart to the point where I have no clue on how I’m gonna pay for next quarter’s tuition, and I’m approaching my last few years of college with no clue as to what I want to do with my life. I’m so scared for my future y’all, all I want to do is call it quits and just go home. I’m starting to think I made mistake coming here despite my initial pure excitement and joy of being accepted here. 

But I’m too terrified of doing that as well. Any advice is much appreciated. I’m just tired of crying every night in my apartment.",1575248877,1,0

Does this seem fair or unfair? What should be done by my peers or I?,"Our midterm chem grade came in and the avg was a 55/103. The head TA claimed in the email some students (my peers and I) did not get 5 minutes and something about the mean in all the test rooms were the same, so nothing will be done about to give my peers or I extra points.
Of course, he is lying a little. Our test room ran out of tests twice, and the test was supposed to start at 730, but we ended up starting at 755, which he gave us until 900, but everyone had to make it to their next classes, so people starting leaving at 850. The test was supposed to be 80 minutes, but in actuality we had around 55-60 minutes. I think it’s unfair, but what should I do about it. I felt like if I had extra time I could have gone back and thought out my answers and checked answers, but I felt rushed, so my performance was bad. I don’t know if telling the professor is worth it. Or if he even cares? Is he going to take the TAs words or believe what we have to say? Any suggestions?
Some people I know have already emailed the professor to make appointments with him to address the issue. But, what he will he even do about this?

How likely am I to get off the waitlist for MAT 145 (Waitlist #13)?,"I was registered for ECS 32B because I wanted to brush on some CS skills before diving into upper-division CS courses. I'm an incoming math major transfer. But this morning  just found out that  I got kicked out of the course because I already met the course equivalence for it (I took Data Structures) at my CC before transferring.

Now I am met with the dilemma of trying to get registered for another course. My two top choices would be ECS 120, and MAT 145. I would rather take MAT 145 this quarter as I heard it wasn't too tough of an upper division math class. Hence, it would make the transition a little smoother. The problem is, there are people on the waitlist already:

ECS 120 - 3 people on the waitlist  
MAT 145 - I am currently #13 on the waitlist

Should I give up on my MAT 145 waitlist odds, and just try to get ECS 120?

Accounting Minor,Hi I’m a junior transfer Man Econ major debating on whether or not to go the Accounting Minor route.  I saw that accounting here at Davis doesn’t actually help furfill the requirements for the CPA even though it’s not something I planned to do. I read somewhere the major is now considered “STEM”?

The thing is class scheldued already seems hectic for me but if I don’t start with the minor this quarter I feel like I might fall behind since some of those classes are only taught once a year. So it’s like is it worth going for this minor even though I’m unsure to pursue this as a career along with this major.

Conflicted between choosing my GE,"Hi! I’m an incoming freshman and i’m lightweight stressed about two of my major classes so i’m trying to find a bearable (not necessarily easy because I know there’s never an easy pass class) GE that won’t hinder my GPA. 

I’m conflicted between choosing AHI 1A with A. Sofroniew and a UHP course COM 139 Shakespeare and the Classical World with Cheryl Ross. They both seem to have good rating on rate my professor but i’m unsure of the workload.

Anyone had any experience leasing an apartment at Davis thru private listings?,"Just a first-year trying to get a head start on housing for next near and I recently discovered some listings for apartments at Davis on third party apartment listing websites (not from the UCD off-campus housing fb page) and also ASUCD's community housing page.  So the listings are of apartments near campus, but there doesn't seem to be an official name affiliated with the apartment complex.  It just seems to be privately owned by one person, if that even makes sense.  So instead of having a name for the apartment complex with an official site, like The Colleges at La Rue for instance, the listing just shows the address of the apartment.  The amenities seem great though, with the apartment being fully furnished and utilities are inclusive.  Is this too good to be true? Are these listings legit and would you say it's reliable to lease from?",1576712382,1,0

a lot of problems- subject to academic dismissal &amp; late major change,"This winter quarter, I got a D+ in chem and only took 14 units. I was on academic probation last quarter as well and because the grades in my other classes weren't significant enough to pull my GPA up(\~1.9 for this quarter), I'm going to be on my second consecutive academic probation. I don't want to be dismissed from UCD and I've done some research here and there that says I can appeal my dismissal. I know I'm not passionate about my major at all and that's why my grades are so low as they are but I really want to fix that. Through my entire life I've been pressured by my family a lot to become a doctor, but I really want to pursue art so I want to change my major to Design. Problem is.. I've been so stubborn about changing majors for so long that I'm already a third year and I'm not sure if I can change my major into something completely different (especially because I already have 134 credits and on the UCD Letters website, it says something about not being about to change after 135 credits) . I'm also not sure whether or not my looming academic dismissal will play part into that either. I wanted to schedule an appointment with the Dean's office ASAP to talk to a counselor about this but it looks like they're completely booked so I can't do it over the oasis appointment booking.

Thoughts on this? (winter quarter),"So, I'm a first year currently taking BIS 2B, MAT 17A, and 2 GEs, and I'm debating which ""path"" I should take. I know I can talk to advisers , but I want to get a student's perspective on this:

\-Take MAT 17B, BIS 2C, and Chem 2A only (start chem series and have 2 labs) or take MAT 17B, BIS 2C, and 2 GEs again to try and finish GE requirements by the end of my first year. The big thing that I'm looking at is i should take Chem now or wait till the beginning of my 2nd year. I know quite a few people saying to take chem now because they wanna take OChem their 2nd year (which I know I'll eventually take)... so if I wait to take gen chem, will it set me back and give me a disadvantage... why not take ochem your 3rd year? 

\-Chem 2A is not offered Spring Quarter and so If I go the Chem route now (Winter: MAT, BIS, CHEM &gt; Spring: MAT, CHEM 2B, 2 GEs) then there's that. I won't be taking BIS 2A till fall quarter next year. Though, if I don't do chem now, can I still be okay taking BIS 2A?

I did a whole 180 for my fall quarter schedule because I was so sure I’d switch my major but I did not do so well on the exams so it has been making me feel more depressed and unmotivated because I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I study everyday, I try my best to go to tutoring and office hours but my work has gone to shit. I sound dramatic but I really am lost. I feel like it’s too late because I’m a sophomore right now and I should’ve thought about it more last year. I feel so stupid and lost, while everyone I know is starting to do internships and clubs for their career path. It feels like I’m back to square 1 while everyone’s ahead of me. I have high goals and expectations for myself but I feel like I shouldn’t aim high because My results aren’t satisfactory. I’ve been isolating myself from everything fun because I feel like I shouldn’t enjoy anything due to how shitty im doing.

What second math class to take with 21C?,"I want to take two math classes next quarter, but I am in a weird spot with taking 21C.

I want to take 67, but that requires 21C as a prerequisite, and also does 22A.

I was thinking of taking 108, because the prerequisite for that is 21B, but I would rather take 67 to satisfy my linear algebra and abstract math.

So, is there another math class that I can take besides 108 for a math major? Or should I just take 108 anyways then 67 because 108 is more in depth than 67. Or, what are the hopes of petitioning into 67?

Sexual Assault,"I want to phrase this carefully so as not to jeopardize my friend's trust or the case that has been brought against her. I just feel frustrated and I want someone to offer insight from the outside. I don't know all the details so that works against me here. My friend was blackout drunk (she had a drinking problem at the time, partially based on the sexual assault she herself suffered a few years prior), at like a house party of a group of UCD students who are part of an organization associated with UCD. The group she was with was also drunk, and some of them possibly blackout drunk. My friend (hereafter ""Friend"") and another girl (let's call her ""2nd girl"") end up in a room together, I know not how. A 3rd girl walks into the room and sees my friend on top of 2nd girl, trying to make out with her or possibly actually making out with her while 2nd girl appeared unconscious. 3rd girl, hereafter ""Accuser,"" accuses my friend of sexual assault to the organization associated with UCD, and ultimately to the appropriate UCD office. Some details: my friend and 2nd girl are comparable in size, 2nd girl being somewhat fitter and taller; my friend has some serious self-esteem problems, history of self-harm, food issues, and hx of severe depression; 2nd girl seems not to have wanted to pursue the case right after it was initiated, but Accuser has a very strong personality and is now spearheading the effort, and getting other members of the group to also contribute to the case (such things as Friend grabbed the crotch of one male of the group while sitting on his lap, Friend inappropriately touched the butt of 2nd Accuser during party, amongst other filings); 2nd girl mysteriously befriended myself and my Friend on facebook maybe a week after the incident. 

I'm not sure what I'm hoping to accomplish by posting this here, I just wish my friend didn't exist in such a vacuum of self-hatred and despair. I wish there was a group on campus not associated with the school that could help her with this. I wish someone non-judicial could intervene. She's like 22, highly intelligent, and she told me she's very suicidal. Don't tell me she should seek professional help or school counseling, I will disregard you, as she would disregard me. She insists on dealing with this herself because she is incredibly stubborn and incredibly hard on herself. Also, she has to spend all her savings on a lawyer for this case. Her family is a little emotionally abusive and has no sympathy for her. She works and lives off-campus. She's afraid she won't graduate and that the sword of Damocles is hanging over her head (my phrasing) so it's difficult for her to do school work, and she normally would be getting straight As (she's STEM). It's just so fucked she feels all persecuted and alone, and I know Accuser is moving forward with the accusations and I think 2nd girl and maybe one other person are going to corroborate, but damn this girl doesn't deserve this.",1573107487,0,0

Looking for Friends,"I'm aware that people have made numerous posts similar to this one so I apologize if this is redundant.

If you don't like reading controversial stuff, then don't read below. 

**Context:** 

2nd year engineering (M)

**Detail:**

So, I've been speaking with a few individuals at this school and I find that I don't 'click' with anyone because we don't have shared mutual interests, so here are mine:

* Philosophy 
* Economics (very little)
* Politics
* Foreign policy

Warning: libertarian rambling below.

**More Detail**

So, I've decided to give some selections regarding what my viewpoints are:

Philosophy:

* reality exists, man can perceive reality, reason is the means of perceiving reality, we have free will
* God doesn't exist, faith is immoral
* mysticism and totalitarianism are linked; for example, Nazi Germany primarily resulted because of Christian faith/self-sacrifice (Plato)
* rights belong to man because man can reason, non-human animals have no rights
* rights are the property of individuals
* taxation is immoral

Economics

* The mixed-economy results in racism. Since people have to create political unions to organize for 'rights,' they do so on grounds related to race. Thus, the lack of free markets encourages racism.

Politics:

* I believe hate speech is free speech
* there shouldn't be as many regulations. for example, there should be no American Medical Association, which is just a cartel. People should be able to receive surgeries from people who have no experience at all so long as they consent
   * corporations 'buy' the gov. to grant them favors. regulations are used by the wealthy to keep competition down.
* cocaine, suicide,etc should all be made legal (although I think of them as immoral)
* i support clean energy but environmental policy would unintentionally harm the poor so I'm against it
* I believe gun rights are a technicality but today gun violence is just a means of political demagoguery
* not planning to vote during the next election. 
* democracy is not inherently good. an ideal gov. would be more akin to a confederacy
* universities should be privatized and deregulated to lower cost and increase quality

Foreign Policy

* should cut military funding by over 70%
* should return from middle east
* unsure regarding israel/palestine. support peaceful resolution.

Social

* racism is bad but those who seek to punish racism have gone the wrong route (I believe in forgiveness and sympathy as a means of ending racism, not totalitarianism)
* i think that women should have the ability to have an abortion during the first trimester. second tri. is a technicality. third should be illegal.
* immigration is a technicality. moderation",1570245544,0,0

I just found out that the OChem series I had taken at a different college will only count as CHE 118A here in Davis.

Has anyone been in a similar situation that could maybe shed some light on what steps I should do? Or does anyone have any insight or advice? Is it possible to petition or argue the evaluation decision? 

As a non-traditional transfer student, I'd actually like to finish my degree on time this time. But it seems like I won't and it's both frustrating and disappointing.

UC Davis TAG/General admission question," So this entire thing has been stressing me tf out lately:

I'm currently a sophomore at De Anza College and am applying to transfer to a UC for the Fall 2020 term. I applied for TAG for UC Davis, and despite my belief that I had met all the requirements for UC Davis for my major (Computer Science), my TAG was not approved, with the stated reason on my UC transfer admission planner portal:

*""Your GPA in a selective major preparatory course or course group falls below the minimum required for your major at the time of TAG submission.""*

The computer science selective course requirements for math for Davis are Math21A, Math21B, and Math21C. I cleared both Math21A and Math21B with my Calculus BC AP Score of 5, so I did not have a GPA for those two courses. So the only course in this series that I was able to take at De Anza was Math21C, which I got a B in. But since Berkeley and UCLA require taking the entire math series, I have also taken additional higher level, more rigorous math courses in which, including Math21C, I received an overall GPA of 3.5 in the MATH-specific selective courses. Here's basically a summary of what classes I took in each series and the grades I received.

\- Math1C (Calculus): B (3.0)- Math 1D (Multivariable Calculus): A (4.0)- Math 2A (Differential Equations): A (4.0)- Math 2B (Linear Algebra): B (4.0)- Math 22 (Discrete Math): In Progress**Overall Math series GPA: 3.5 at time of admission, higher than required GPA of 3.4**

In addition, here is a summary of the Computer Science specific selective major courses I've taken at De Anza:

\-CIS22A (Intro C++): A (4.0)-CIS22B (Intermediate C++): A (4.0)-CIS29 (Advanced C++): A+ (4.0)-CIS22C (Data Structures): B+ (3.3)-CIS40 (Intro Python): A+ (4.0)-CIS41A (Intermediate python): In Progress**Overall Computer Science series GPA: 3.86 at time of admission, higher than required GPA of 3.5**

**My overall UC-Transferable course GPA at time of admission is 3.72, also higher than required GPA of 3.4**

With that being said, since I was not approved for TAG for this special circumstance of having previously cleared both Math21A and Math21B with my AP Score and not allowing them to be counted towards my GPA does that mean that I'm also not eligible for transfer for general admission either, despite having went above and beyond their requirements for math? 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically my question is, **if I wasn't eligible for TAG, will I still be eligible for general admission?** Or am I royally screwed and need to wait another full year at deanza to try and take those two courses for a grade before I can even try to transfer again? (Would be a waste of an entire year of my life).",1574619417,1,0

This may seem contradictory, but I’m not too interested in hands-on stuff, but am attracted to the design aspect of engineering (which is why I’m leaning towards research in engineering) or the theoretical concepts that applied physics might better provide.

Any insight is appreciated!",1574409245,1,0

How panicked should I feel over this recent 100A midterm?,"I'm an *intended* economics major and might get a public policy minor if I ditch being premed. I have Acland for 100A. 

Anyway, I need a B- and C+ in Stats 20 and Economics 100A to meet the cap (they can be interchangeable) but based on distributions/averages it looks like it'd be more likely to get a B- in Econ 100A and a C+ in Stats 20 because the average in 100A is a B and the average in Stats 20 is a B-. 

I kind of wanted to get higher because premed (and maybe law school) but oh well, I'm not that great at econ.

Anyway, I felt a bit shaken walking out of the midterm because I struggled a bit with the last problem (and definitely BS'd the last 5 points and more likely than not made other errors) but at the same time I don't think I *totally failed* (as in I didn't feel like I made *everything* up and didn't write BS down for *every* problem). 

So my questions are:

1) Is it doable to kinda fail every exam and still get a B- or C+ in the class?

2) Does Acland curve generously?

second year at berkeley and ive never felt this lost,"Freshman year I was so happy. The newfound freedom, the constant state of being surrounded by people, the way all the freshmen around me were so eager to make friends and have new experiences---I gained so much confidence and felt that this was really the beginning of the better part of my life. 

It was a slow and gradual buildup, but second year rolls around and I can feel the real anxieties taking over. I'm constantly thinking of how I don't have the professional or research experience to get the cs experience that I want. I really do love programming, but I'm struggling a lot in my current cs course. I know it's always hard to get your foot in the door for this kind of career, and I know I shouldn't compare myself to other people, but seeing my peers doing amazing work and having a great time with their clubs puts a small ache in me because I'm afraid I'll never have that. 

It feels like I'm always playing catch-up, chasing deadline after deadline, but nothing good is coming out of it. I cant find the time or motivation to do the personal projects I want to do, or apply for research that interests me. Every moment that I spend talking to friends or exercising or just laying still, there's always an unsettling guilt sitting in my chest. It's scary because every thought that runs through my head now is sprinkled with anxiety and guilt, and I really don't want that. I just want a chance to pause everything for a second and catch my breath, renew my perspective, but deadlines are still deadlines and time passed is still time passed.

[The Parousia] Chancellor Christ is doing her second AMA in our subreddit! Here are the rules and guidelines I'm enacting in order to ensure a successful AMA.,"**[Link to the AMA from last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/)**
-

**[Link to the AMA coming this Wednesday, Sep 25th](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/d8cvx2/i_am_uc_berkeley_chancellor_carol_christ_ask_me/)**
-

-

-

Our last AMA went so well, Christ is coming back for another!

The Chancellor's reddit account is /u/carolchrist. This is not the actual AMA thread. The actual AMA is pinned to the top of the subreddit, and Christ will start answering questions in two days' time. You will have these two days to think of a question and post it in the thread. 

Please read the [previous AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/) to see which questions were already asked.

-

-

**THE ACTUAL AMA**
-

* **No questions are off-limits. But keep it respectful and formal.**

Christ does not want to limit any sort of questions *at all* for this AMA. Nothing is off-limits. However, you must stay respectful and formal. Make sure you remain respectful and your question will not be removed. 

Joke questions *are* allowed. 

* **The AMA thread will be in contest mode until the actual AMA start time.**

This is because I don't want people to start long discussions before the AMA has begun. We also need time to promote this event on different channels and make sure everyone affiliated with the campus has time to create an account and post their questions. 

The Chancellor will start answering questions this Wednesday at 5:00PM. 

* **Parent comments only**

The Chancellor does not have enough time to read through chains of comments. We want original questions posted as *only* parent comments. If you want to piggyback off of another parent comment you liked, you may refer to it in a parent comment of your own. 

This may seem odd, but we want people to have as many chances as possible to get their questions answered, and we want the AMA to feel like an actual back-and-forth discussion between our community and the Chancellor. 

**All children comments will be deleted until Christ starts her actual AMA. After which children comments will be allowed.** 

Once the Chancellor comes in, I want her answers to be the only child comment to each parent comment. That way, even after this two day delay, you won't have to go hunting for Christ's answers, and you can follow-up on her answers more easily. 

In a future event, we may be able to have the Chancellor answer question that arose from discussions, but I don't want those long-winded discussions to start prematurely. 

-

-

-

---

---

Again, please be on your best behavior. We may have even more events in the future, and maybe the Chancellor would be open to coming to a subreddit meetup. This will only be possible if this AMA goes well. 

Stay respectful, ask your best questions, and 

**GO BEARS!!!**

I am UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ. Ask me anything!,"Hello, Reddit! /u/michaeldirda from the campus public affairs office here. With /u/lulzcakes‘s support we’re bringing back UC Berkeley’s chancellor, Carol Christ, for another Ask Me Anything session this week. We hosted an AMA with the chancellor [for the first time last October](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/), and she loved the format and the opportunity to field so many questions from the campus. 

Some brief background about Chancellor Christ: She first came to Berkeley just shy of fifty years ago to serve as a professor of English, and aside from a stint as president of Smith College from 2002 to 2013 has spent her whole career here. She was appointed Berkeley’s first female chancellor in 2017, and since then has worked extremely hard to fix the campus’ budget, develop a ten-year strategic plan for the campus, address the housing shortage, build community and improve the campus climate for people of all backgrounds, and more. You can learn more about her [on the chancellor’s web site](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellor-christ/biography).

I’m starting this thread now so you can think of questions and start voting on them, and she’ll begin answering on **Wednesday, September 25th at 4 p.m.**

As with last time, I'm just here to help the chancellor navigate Reddit’s non-intuitive interface; she’ll be responding to all questions herself. She says she’ll be happy to talk about whatever the community is interested in, though if there are areas that she does not know well enough she might ask me to circle back on a question if she doesn’t feel that she can fully answer it. 

Thanks so much and ask away!

Business Insider wants to know what a day in the life of a Berkeley student is like,"Hello everyone!

I’m a reporter at Business Insider and I’m working on a project that I thought some of y’all might want to get involved in. **We are interested in writing a feature story that would focus in on what a day in the life is like for an average Berkeley student.** We wrote a piece similar to this about an Oxford student in the past. (link included below). If any of y’all are interested, we would love to work with you to tell your story!

All we would need is about **10 to 15 photos of you documenting your day as a student.** These photos can be as mundane or as crazy as you like. I would also want to briefly chat with you about it all since I would be writing the story. This would be a great way to get your name out there in a major publication and tell the world a little bit about yourself.

Separately, we are also **interested in students who might be willing to share a copy of the essay they wrote that got them into Berkeley.** If you are really proud of your essay and still have a copy, we would love to be able to publish it. **We’d be willing to pay you for your essay.**

If either of these sounds of interest please let me know! Thank y’all.

Commuting to Campus by Motorcycle vs Car,"Hi bears,

Right know, I commute by car and the cost per semester is really expensive if you ask me. I have to pay for a $400-ish dollar parking permit plus about $120 on gas per month (excluding all services involved). To me personal mobility is key, so I cannot rely on BART or the Bus system, but I want to reduce commuting costs and why not, traffic and footprint. Having said that, I have no clue how hard it is to get a parking spot, or if you have to get a student permit, and all the nitty-gritty details regarding to motorcycles on campus.

Does anyone else here feel like no one goes to college to learn? Instead people go here to demonstrate how smart they are.,"Think about it: when class is canceled, people celebrate. Why would people celebrate if they were coming here to learn. This is clear evidence that something else is at play.

Theoretically, you could get a Berkeley education for free if you wanted to. All you'd have to do is start auditing courses as a non-enrolled student. Professors generally don't care when people sit in on courses. Some might even be flattered that a non-enrolled person cared enough to learn the material from them. 

But the reason why people don't to do that is ultimately because most people. don't. want. education. They want a diploma saying they went here, so that they can brag to others, and impress employers with how smart and hardworking they are.

This is pretty sad. 

I hear a lot of political folks talk about how ""education is important"" and how we should make tuition free. But if college isn't about education, and is instead about signaling intelligence, then it makes no sense to make tuition free. Think about it: the system is set up so that employers can determine who is the best worker by their level of education. If everyone has access to higher education, then nobody will be able to get the signaling benefits from going.

It is exactly isomorphic to the situation with a crowded theatre. If one person stands up in the theater, they will reason correctly that ""I will see the film better if I stand up."" However, it does not follow that if every single person in the theater stood up, then they would all be able to see the film better.

College is a filter that lets employers know who is smart and who isn't. Given this, why do people put this system in such a noble light? It's so obviously about getting into the most prestigious institution and being impressive. College has essentially nothing to do with the actual learning.",1569187302,0,0

Question about parking in RPP zones,"Hi!

I am a grad student from Europe who will be doing a research stay at UC Berkeley for a couple of months starting this October. I will arrive in the US a couple of weeks earlier and was planning to visit some places in California (a couple of friends from home are coming with me for this ""tourism"" part).

Long story short, I'll have a rental car which I plan to drive to Berkeley and have it with me for the first 3 or 4 days to help carry my move-in stuff, baggage, do the first ""big"" shopping of things for my apartment, etc. Then I will return the car and walk or bike to campus for the remaining of my stay. 

All of this is to say that please bear (go!) with me since I have never lived not only in the US but in any city the size/type of Berkeley.

I have read the parking section on the City of Berkeley's website as well as several posts in this sub, but I still have some doubts. My apartment is located in RPP area J, so I assume I cannot park the car on or around my street Mon to Fri from 8am to 7pm, for more than 2 hours. However, how is this enforced? Does it mean 2 hours a day? What if I park the car for 2 hrs and then move it to a different spot on the same street (or the same RPP zone) and leave it there for another 2 hours, is this allowed? What does ""that block"" refer to in the following sentence from the [city's website](https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Customer_Service/Home/RPP_Residential_Preferential_Parking.aspx#enforcement) ""Those without an annual or visitor permit can park for a total of two hours on either side of that block""? In the same way, I assume that if I park the car at 7pm then I wouldn't need to move it until 10am the following day (8am to 10am being the 2-hr allowed free parking).

I have another question on the boundaries of the RPP areas. Looking at the [map](https://www.cityofberkeley.info/uploadedFiles/Public_Works/Level_3_-_Transportation/RPP_R(1).pdf), I understand the different areas marked with letters and colors. However, what does the gray line that surrounds the whole map mean? It says ""RPP-boundary"", so I assume that outside this boundary there is free parking on the street (apart from any kind of particular restrictions on particular streets). What about the white zones inside the ""RPP-boundary"" that don't seem to belong to any area? Is there free parking there? For instance, I see there's a big zone west of Adeline St that may be convenient for me that seems to not belong to any RPP area. Is parking there free and unrestricted?

Finally, apart from all these regulations and ticket avoidance, what about the safety of the car? Do you guys believe it is safe to park a car overnight without supervision in any of the areas that I've mentioned (all of them seem ""quiet"" and residential)?

MCB 102 Disc Quizzes,"Hi everyone,

I'm taking MCB 102 this semester and have a couple questions about the course. There are 2 pop quizzes for each section of this course. The first section (pKa, pH, protein structure, etc.) is being taught by Merchant this semester. 

1) What should I expect to see on the quizzes? I know memorizing amino acids is really important for the first quiz, but I'm not sure to which extent I should memorize them. Should I memorize the pKas of side chains as well?

2) If you've taken the class, do you have any advice on how to study for these quizzes?

3) If you're currently taking the class, what resources are helping you understand the material? So far I've been reviewing the webcasted lectures and looking through the book, but I feel like there's probably more I can do.

(Hopeful) Berkeley Transfer Student,"I’m having a bit of a dilemma. 

Last year, I applied to Berkeley as a media studies major and was accepted. Unfortunately, I failed my chemistry class which led me to revoke my acceptance because I could not fulfill the admission requirements. My GPA went from a 3.6 all the way down to a 3.0 because of that chemistry class. 

I plan on reapplying again this year, though my GPA won’t be as competitive and will only be a 3.4 or 3.5. It’s been stressing me out how drastically my GPA has dropped all because of one class (I’ve gotten A’s and B’s only besides that one F). My biggest question is: do I still have a good enough chance in getting into Berkeley? From what I’ve read online, to be accepted to Cal, you must have a 3.6 GPA, however for media studies major, the lowest GPA accepted is 3.2 so I’m hoping that this major isn’t super competitive to get into.

CNR freshman in need of serious advice,"Hello,

I am currently having trouble with my next semester schedule. To provide some background, a general counselor for my college told me that my AP credit can cover all of my breadth requirements (I've heard mixed things about this). This semester I was planning on taking Chem 32 because of my weak chemistry coursework in high school (not AP Chem), but due to some schedule changes I had to drop it. Now knowing its not offered in the spring semester, I am hesitant to take 1A but will be studying the topics on my own. 

I am still not sure how to complete my 2nd semester schedule considering I am done with breadths (?). So far, I'm thinking Math 16B for sure, along with Chem 1A **or** Math 16B and Stats 20. I don't think I could handle all three. Aside from that I'm thinking a DeCal or a class to fill my units, since I am on financial aid. In order to fill my units I was thinking a Freshman Seminar or a one unit intro class to my major. If it comes down to it, I'm also willing to take simple breadth classes just for interest and the unit req (could also use recommendations). I'm also taking an R1B course so I'll hopefully be done with R&amp;C this semester.

I'm meeting my adviser next week to discuss my classes next week so I don't want to go in empty handed.

Thanks in advance!",1570382564,0,0

FAILED MY FIRST MIDTERM AS A FIRST YEAR. WHAT SHOULD I DO? (ASTRO C10),"very clickbait-y title but also 100% truthful. I know my question is a very naive freshman thing of me to ask but: 

I am taking astro c10 for my physical science breadth. I love the professor, do the homework and labs, and I study of course, but even after feeling like I understood the material I still failed the midterm. (The way the questions are phrased are also more conceptual than I'm used to)... many I'm not studying properly for this midterm? 

Besides study more, PNP the class (which I am probably going to do), what other advice do you have for me? I am worried about not even passing the class if I do poorly on the final especially. I need this for the L&amp;S breadth requirement and I don't know what I'd do if I don't pass it. Has anyone else been in this class before in a similar situation? Also are there any tutoring resources for this class, besides generalized physics tutors? It's silly because I feel like I'm learning in the course, I enjoy it, and I don't care about having to PNP it; however, I understood this is supposed to be one of the easier physical science breadths yet my midterm grade did not reflect this obviously.

Math 1B a year after Math 1A at CC; possible?,"Hi all. I'm a transfer student, trying to decide is taking Math 1B in spring at UCB is wise after struggling a lot in Math 1A at CC (came out with a B). Math 1B is notoriously difficult and I already struggle in math (worst subject by far) so I'm trying to evaluate if it would just be smarter to either take it over the summer or at a CC. I realize if I take it at a CC when I apply to grad school or if I really felt compelled, medical school, this would be seen as a bad thing and I would be ""less competitive"". I have to take Math 1B, not taking it is not an option.   

On the flip side Paulin has a great reputation and it's not as if I'm not willing to put in the work. I just get a lot of anxiety during tests and even if I practice perfectly fine I will often not perform as well on math tests. I just don't want to ruin my gpa over this.

Bombed CS 70 Midterm... not sure what to do now,"I actually bombed the first CS 70 midterm.

I'm so upset because I really do love programming and want to be a CS major, but I just... *can't* with math. I know people do DS as an alternative sometimes, but I'm really not interested in data science. I just feel so terrible right now and don't know where to go from here. People will say to work hard and ace the midterm and final, but realistically, I just know that's not happening. Even if I do slightly better on the next exams (which is unlikely), the weight of this bombed midterm has already destroyed a huge part of my grade. With this midterm grade, I can't get the grade I need to declare CS and I'm totally lost right now. I don't want to do any other major :( 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice for this position? I was thinking of dropping and retaking, but then I won't be able to proceed with other technical requirements next semester (I'll have to just take 70 again because I wouldn't know my major yet). Also, I just am unsure if I will do better next time, so if I fail again, I'll waste yet another semester-- and essentially, an entire year-- taking no technicals towards my major. The other option is appealing, but I have no idea if people actually get in through appeals. 

All I know is that I really want to be a CS major, but I think I'm fucked. I don't want to settle for anything else... I just feel like total shit now because I probably won't even be able to declare the major I want.",1571366915,12,0

How hard is 61A for somebody with ~8 years of CS experience?,"Hey,

Chem Bio major here. So I’ve been doing CS as a hobby since I was like 9 years old, and programming is one of my favorite pastimes and I’d consider myself to be pretty good at it.  I am considering minoring in CS, but not if it’ll leave me with no time to take the classes I wouldn’t have the opportunity to learn about otherwise.

So I’m concerned because adding 61A would bring my unit schedule up to 19 units, which for a lazy guy like me seems like a lot.

New to town and need some advice,"Hey guys! 

I am new to town and a few days into my new job as a postdoc at the Berkeley lab. I am trying to settle down and need a bit of advice from you.

1. I have an overseas driving licence. Are they some cheap rentals which accept overseas DLs and dont need a credit card (I have applied for a debit card and its on the way)? I would like to learn to drive on the right side of the road before I can apply for a state DL at the DMV.
2. What are good places/clubs at the university to socialize? And how is it done here?

Help me choosing classes?,"Hello fellow bears, i’m a freshman trying to declare CS and Math double major. I’m currently taking Math 54 and CS 61A and are doing... not terrible but not too good either(projected B+ for 61A and A- for 54)

Anyway, I’d like to take from 16-20 units next semester. Besides either EE16A or EE16B+EE47D, i’m also thinking about taking 61B and either CS70 or Math 55. I’m also thinking about a easy writing class(according to berkeley time)

So my question are as the following:
Give that i’m doubling in math and CS, 
1, should i take math 55 or cs70? imo 70 has better professor but heavy course load(especially with 61B cuz i wanna do well and have a better GPA), while 55 has shitty professor but comparatively lighter course load.
2, should I take 16A or 16B + 47D? taking 16A would be easy for me bc im taking 54 this semester, but it might waster some of my time, especially when I’m trying to double major and graduate in 4 years; on the other hand, 16B and 47D(if i can get enrolled) does put me on a faster pace, but might result in heavier course load and less stable foundation
3, i’m taking 15 units this semester and really want to catch up. one of the reasons i’m not doing ideally this semester is because i tried out a lot of clubs which kind of used up part of my time(as well as the adjustment). i’m wondering if 3 techs + 1 writing(16U) or overall a 16-20 unit schedule is doable.

i was thinking about maybe switching my major to cogsci if im trapped to medical school with neurobiology. im more interested in humanities side of things anyways, but that worries me too because 

1. my first semester would have kind of gone to waste, trying to do pre-reqs for mcb instead of cogsci (or any other major for that matter)

2. cogsci (and other majors i've looked into) is impacted, so i might not even get in. what if i make all this fuss and switch majors for nothing

idk. again my main concern is that theres not a whole lot out there for me if i continue mcb neuro if i refuse to go to med school. most people say i could always do ""research"" but that seems....vague... and murky.....any advice?",1572329574,5,0

"Stressed over CS170, need advice on what to do please","Hi guys, I've been quite stressed over 170 lately and need your advice. I’ll need to provide some details for context, but please stick with me if possible.

I did pretty bad on both midterms, and  now I’m on track for a B-/B. Although a B is an ok grade imo, I am very stressed because I am planning to apply to the 5th year CS  Masters programs (so 170 is important for application purposes) and I strongly dislike all the material in 170. Specifically, I get really really bored and stressed out when reading 170 notes/watching lectures. Tbh, I feel like I’m just learning a bunch of theory that I won’t realy use (I know DP/LP/etc are often tested during coding interviews may be tested during interviews, but I still feel like 170 goes way too deep). **I also studied my ass off for both midterms, but still scored \~0.5-1 std below avg.**

I have a late drop form available, should I P/NP, drop the class, or continue taking it? To provide more context, I am currently also taking Data 100 and 61c, and am on track for A’s in those classes. I have also taken 2 other upper divs in prior semesters and received A-/A’s in them.

I called my sister (an EECS grad) for advice, and she is adamant that I should continue with 170 even it hurts my GPA. She also mentioned that theres only a few weeks left so I might as well just finish it. However, I don’t think my sister understands how much I dislike the class and how stressful it will be for me to study for the final. Please anyone have advice?

This   is audio of the President, Donald J. Trump, demanding a $4 billion   dollar bribe from child rapists to “take a blind eye” on January 3,   2019. Trump becomes one on January 14, 2019.  Also, here is the big   reason the major networks do not report any of it.

//**Download   the video, turn the volume all the way up and put head phones on.  Note:  there is not much to see in the video, the audio is picked up  from  another \[illegal surveillance\] system.** Trump is on a call from with Henry Porter and Gigi Hadid. See page 63. Bribe demand at 10:18am:

I'm taking EE16B next semester, but my worry is that because this wasn't a pure Maths course the Math 54 kids will have a better understanding of Linear Algebra than I do.

Because of this, would it be a good idea to take Math54 and EE16b concurrently next semester, or is it just a waste of a class?

Instead of that option, would perhaps taking Math110 in my sophomore or junior year be perhaps a better idea? Can EE16AB satisfy the Math 54 prerequisite for this class?

News Coverage of last night's protest,,1574358503,1,0
Coulter event,"I can’t believe some of you condone and even support Refuse Fascism and ANTIFA’s actions while wanting lower tuition and cheaper housing for everyone. The more encouraged and welcomed they are, the more the University has to chalk up in security fees and reparations, and the University is using your money (and eventually raising costs) to pay for it. Regardless of whether you’re on the right or left, you should be conscious of this as a Cal student.

Peaceful protest is respectable, but these groups are incapable of that and their respective histories speak for themselves. I don’t care who’s coming to campus - if they’re coming to speak at a public institution they should be allowed to speak without such impediments. Sure, if a speaker has said reprehensible things, then educate people with reason. When you engage with violence and force then you automatically lose all respect amongst the rational, reasonable person whom you are trying to educate.

As Cal students, we should be actively speaking out against these types of groups and let them know that they are not welcome here, whether right or left wing, since we have to foot the bill in the end.",1574354821,1,0

Earlier the powers that be set up a bunch of water filled barricades that are all around the front door of Wheeler.

There are a ton of police around, and when I was walking over past RSF they had a bunch of shuttle buses set up. Not sure what that is all about.

"After 2.5 years of doing CS, I hate academics and CS in general. I want to be a musician. Would it make sense to drop out of Berkeley or should I tough out a degree?","Hey guys,

So throughout high school, I was super passionate about music. I was heavily involved in the music program, being in my schools orchestra, marching band, jazz ensemble, and even choir. But I also focused and did well in academics. I strongly considered a music performance major, and either going down the music performance route or being a music teacher. I play violin, marching percussion (like marching snare), and electric guitar. But I caved to the pressures of my Asian parents who made it clear they were not okay with me pursuing music and I should pursue a more lucrative and practical profession, like CS. So I focused on that, and got into Berkeley.

I've been at Cal for 2.5 years now, and I'm doing kinda well academically while pursuing my CS classes. However, I genuinely hate it. Music is my true passion and what I love, and it would make me happy to drop out and pursue music full-time. I want to be a guitarist doing jazz stuff mostly, and hilariously enough, I wish I attended Berklee school of music on the east coast over Berkeley. 

However, I know quitting college and trying to make it as a musician is reckless financially, and a lot of aspiring musicians, even super talented ones, make ends meat by driving uber and lyft, doing retail jobs, etc. And if I tough it out in CS, and get the degree, I could have a CS job, even though I hate it so much, as a backup that pays pretty well and devote my entire free time to music and making that work, and I could work part-time in CS too to get some dough while trying to get an avenue into music. It's just I love music so much and hate academics and school despite being competent at academics and caved into Asian culture/parent pressures, but you need to put food on the table somehow.

Cosmic Pluralism Studies,"MESSAGE TO EDUCATORS

Hello,

I am writing to educators, academics, and academic institutions to encourage the adoption of a course of study related to the issue of “ufos” (the most commonly used term though the United Stated government and many others today prefer the term “unidentified aerial phenomenon” or “uap”).

Despite the “breaking news” on this subject since the NY Times report of December 2017 (when they identified a Pentagon UFO study program and released Navy pilot film), signs of a continued avoidance to addressing this subject remain.

Nevertheless, there are beginning signs of a growing recognition of the need to address this, no matter where this leads. In September 2019, Politico’s Bryan Bender noted an interesting statement by the Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee, Matk Walker (R-NC). Walker had been making inquiries in a partially frustrated attempt to determine whether the Chinese or Russians have made an extraordinary and dramatic leap in technology. It appears he may be realizing something else may be happening:

“In a recent interview, Walker, a former pastor, also acknowledged that he is open to the possibility that there are no easy explanations—or the answers could change how humanity perceives the known universe.”

Since preparing a course of study for a long-ignored subject may be a difficult and confusing process at the start, I want to identify a resource that can serve as a good starting point for that:

THE UFO ENCYCLOPEDIA, 3rd Edition, Two Volumes, edited by Jerome Clark. (Make sure you get the 2018 released 3rd edition; published by OMNIGRAPHICS.)

There are very limited UFO courses in a very small number of academic institutions; these may serve as helpful models.

There are also a few expensive online UFO courses of study.

Since I have had 50 plus years of intermittently engaging in a concentrated study of the subject, I began in late May 2019 to write educational content for different aspects of this subject:

http://cosmic-pluralism-studies.academy

As stated there, the material can be freely adopted, or utilized in any way, without attribution.

Finally, it would be great to see academic institutions as a safe refuge for encounter experiencers to relate their experiences in a setting that adheres to strict standards in research, something often lacking in the uncredentialed arena of ufology.

Thankyou for considering this.

"CS/Math double wanting to switch to CS/Data Science, but I took Math 55","I'm a CS/math double who took Math 55 instead of 70. 

I've heard I have to take CS 70 to transfer into CS. This is fine by me because I'm currently in Stat 134, so I know a lot of probability. Also I'm probably gonna take EE 126 next semester so I'll know way more probability. Also I need a B in 70 to declare which is apparently below the mean. Long story short I'm not *that* worried. 

I'm wondering if anyone else has been in this situation. Or, if anyone can give insight on what it's like to take a class but ""not receive credit"" for it. 

On that note, would you recommend taking EE 126 and CS 70 (and another CS upper div) at the same time, just so by the time I get to the probability part of 70 I'll get an A on it because it'll be so easy to me? 

I really wanna take EE 126 next sem bc I love the content. I just don't wanna overload my schedule, end up failing 70, and then suddenly I'm no longer a declared CS major.",1575531611,1,0

Why does EE16A course staff blatantly lie to its students every semester?,"I've always wondered why and how it's acceptable.

They say they dont release exam statistics for some bullshit reason of keeping you motivated and to prevent you from comparing yourself to others, but we all know the real reason is because if they did, they'd essentially be caught red handed. I'm also pretty sure EE16A is the only EECS class that does this.

Why do they do this? There are soooo many innocent freshman tweaking hard over their grade and where they stand in the class. Why not implement a more transparent (and not dishonest) grading system, potentially one that actually has set pre-defined grading bins which has a proven track record (see: CS61A).",1575432241,1,0

I guess I also got a little bugged when she kept trying to see what I got right/wrong on the exam as well. However...the biggest issue is that it doesn't really help if both of us are stuck on the same kind of problems and not sure why they thought we would somehow help each other.

TL;DR at bottom

I'm currently a 3rd year CS student, and am trying to come up with my class schedule for next (my final) semester at Berkeley. I am trying to get more experience with AI and have taken 188 this semester. 

I was planning on taking 162 next semester because I have heard it is very important for a Software engineer, but also some people have spoken differently, saying depending on your focus as a Software engineer. I'm trying to decide between 162, and taking 189 with 182 (if that's even possible/recommended). 

From those with work experience, how important is 162? I'm not planning to remain a software engineer for too much of my life (trying to move up to project manager ASAP, as pretentious as that might sound) and am wondering which class combo will give me the best way to reach that path. (I would also be more interested in AI development both for engineering as well as product management)

Thanks in advance!

Ego and reflections,"To preface, I'm a freshman LS CS.

I fucking hate this school. This semester has pushed me to the breaking point and forced me to become a hard-working individual. Before coming to this school my ego was the size of harvard's endowment, and now is more like the size of Berkeley's endowment. Looking back at 61A, it has pushed me so hard and even though I may not get the grade I want I have learned so much and I'm honestly so excited to learn here. We have learned HOF's, lambda's, recursion, tree recursion, trees, OOP, data abstraction, scheme, tail recursion, macros, streams, SQL, iterators, generators and more stuff I am possibly missing. At the beginning of the semester I went full try hard mode, and did well on my first exam, then got cocky and bombed the second one, I am now going full try hard mode on this final and hopefully do well. Im looking at the intro to CS courses at other schools and it doesn't even compare. My giant has ego has shrunk down and been replaced by a sense of self-accomplishment. I hope I do well on the final and get a B+ (was gunning for an A- but fuck the second midterm), but regardless it has been a hard, challenging, yet fulfilling first semester. Can't wait to come back, go full try-hard mode for all 3 midterms and crush 61B.

[Advice Needed] Medical Emergency,"I apologize for any spelling mistakes or errors, I have had to use voice dictation.   


During RRR week, I was involved in an accident that caused bilateral 2nd and 3rd degree burns on my hands. I didn’t want this to effect my studies and was trying to fight through the pain, but my friend dragged me to Tang Center +5 hrs afterwards. Most of the skin on my hands came off. Unfortunately, the physician at Tang called an ambulance and I had to spend the next 6 days in the ICU burn ward at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in SF.  


To make matters worse, I still can’t even write. My hands are shaking so much from the neuropathic pain that everything I write looks like gibberish.

Thoughts on getting a minor in CS while majoring in Physics,"I am currently a freshman and just completed my first semester at Cal. It wasn't as cumbersome since I had taken just one technical course (Math 1A, I'm an international student and didn't know about APs till the end of senior year) and got done with a couple other breadths and university requirements. I'll be taking Physics 5A along with Math 1B next semester. I'm planning to pursue a PhD program after graduation and mostly get into academia after that.

What I have observed from my exposure to the field of research (in physics at least) is that there is a growing need of programming skills for analysis and other purposes. Because of this I was planning to do a minor in CS, hoping that it would help my cause as I pursue higher studies. But what I have heard is that CS courses at Cal are super time consuming and upper division courses are extremely hard to get into even for CS majors. I am also planning to get a double major in Astrophysics for which the lower div prerequisites are the same as that for Physics but except for CS61A, there aren't any course overlaps between CS and Astrophysics. I have 6 more semesters (and 4 summers) for which I have just made a tentative schedule.

I'm dead set on majoring in Physics but not so sure about the Astrophysics and CS part. Is it a feasible path to take? I would love to hear from people who have taken a similar route to this one and advise me on how to manage my schedule. If anyone wants additional info to help me decide, please let me know.

Should I take 188 or 110 along with 126 and 127?,"Definitely taking 126, 127, breadth, reader (13 units), but was wondering whether to add 188 or 110 on top of this.
 
Reasons for 188: I likely want to do ML stuff in the future and really really wanna get started in AI stuff, which is why I wanted to add 188. Maybe will do some fast.ai this break. (Is this relevant for 188?) One point of caution though is that I want to get an A+ to maybe get into BAIR in the future, which may be harder considering this schedule.
 
Reasons for 110: Due to time conflict with breadth I will not be able to attend 188 lecture at all. Also I am self studying Axler (linear algebra done right textbook) over break for fun and I feel like I might as well take 110 to get credit for that as well (Is there strong overlap?)
 
Reasons for another breadth instead: Want to bump my GPA up a little bit and less work. I don't wanna push myself too hard though because last semester I struggled with 61c and 170. Did p well in the classes but found myself working way harder than I thought I would. However this might be because I am bad at project classes and significantly better at math classes, which is better for this intended schedule. Overall, I don't want to work more than 10 hours a day (ideally much less) for the sake of my mental health. In this case, then I will take 188 + 189 + 110 in fall instead of 189 + 188/110, both along with recruiting.

I'm not expecting straight A's but I do want to maintain a trend upwards with my grades (B- and up). Ultimately I'd rather take classes that I am interested in than take classes to get A's.

 But I messed up my final and got 67.65%. That pulled my total points down to 262.96 / 300.00, which is 87.65%. So, I got an A- in the course.

Now I'm being punished for plagiarism and for sure gonna get a D in the class even if I ace the final. Pretty sucky :) Being that it's my first semester, it's just so embarrassing if I have to tell my friends that or if I have to apply for anything with my GPA now.

Having Second Thoughts About Committing to GS.... Am I Wrong?,"As the title says, I've had second thoughts on committing to GS since I received my acceptance. 

If the ""School of General Studies"" really is just an (awkward) administrative title, why does Columbia's website promote the fact that ""GS Students take the same classes and have the same professors as CC and SEAS students"". If that's the case, why even separate a body of students administratively, if they are taking the same classes and have the same professors?

I understand CC vs SEAS. Different core requirements. But the GS core is practically the same as the CC Core, save for 2 or 3 classes (I think?).

Then theres the whole issue with lack of proper financial aid, diploma typed in English (instead of Latin), etc. Little things here and there that make GS less ""desirable"" than CC.

On a more personal note, I'm transferring in with an Associate's Degree, with around 75 credits. I've received offers from other schools who accepted anywhere from 60-70 of those credits, but Columbia only accepted 31 according to the transfer credit report I received.

I learned about GS 2 years ago and I was ecstatic to have the opportunity to attend a school like Columbia. I worked super hard to maintain a really high GPA, taking 4 classes in the evening while working full time during the day etc. I was so happy when I got accepted. But reading forums, it seems a lot of people are dissatisfied with GS and feel like ""second class citizens"", and that combined with less than half of my credits being transferred makes me hesitant to accept Columbia's offer. It would probably take me 3 years to finish my Bachelor's now. 

**TL/DR: Got accepted to Columbia GS, hesitant to commit because of the ""General Studies"" stigma and less than half of my credits being transferred/accepted. Is it worth the ""Ivy League Education""? Can anyone in GS tell me what your experience has been so far, honestly?**",1575683528,1,0

Spanish Placement Test,"Hello, I have some questions about the Spanish placement test I was hoping some people could answer.

I felt fairly confident through the whole thing, having spent a few weeks refamiliarizing myself with the first two levels.

Slight Bashing Post: Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health,"Disclaimer: Bashing is just an overstatement, but I just want to know what other people liked/disliked about the Columbia Mailman SPH program, so I'll start. I recently graduated and have my degree in Epi. 

Pros: 

\-In NYC

\-#4 ranked PH program in the nation

\-Alumni network/career services/connections

\-Is a quality program (in my opinion), which gave me the skills that I needed for my job today

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\-Too friggin EXPENSIVE

\-Not as diverse as they make it out to be (at least in Epi and Biostats, there were virtually no Black people. I have nothing against people of other races/ethnicities, but being the only Black person in a lot of the classes for your department/certificate was isolating. People constantly talk about health disparities and issues that affect people of color, yet they talk about it from an abstract sense, have no friends of color, refuse to walk past 169th street in Washington Heights, act as if Africa and South Asia are the only places with people suffering from health issues, etc. It was very irritating.

\-Restrictions for certain certificates

\-More condescending/arrogant people compared to my state school (which I KINDA feel like I should've gone to)

\-We were charged all of this tuition, but received a ridiculously small summer stipend ($250), little to no scholarships, barely any free food at seminars lol, etc.

Rude lady in John Jay dining hall,"Do y'all know that one African American woman that swipes people into John Jay? She has short hair and glasses. Well I think she is excessively rude. I understand that she deals with hundreds (if not thousands) of people a day, but there's no need to make me feel like an idiot or a child everytime I entire the dining hall. If she was just DMV level rude I would be fine, but this is next level. Here are some examples:

- Very recently I asked about the meal options for restrictive diets and she quickly said ""I'm not telling you, it's none of your business. It doesn't apply to you"". Immediately she assumed my religion and dietary restrictions based on my appearance. The options very well could have applied to me as I have both Jewish and Muslim family members. 

- Another day she handed me back the wrong ID and actually tried to argue with me that it was mine. I don't know what was implied by her assumption of my appearance again, but I don't think I looked anything like the person on the wrong ID she handed me. Needless to say I was offended and embarrassed by the scene she caused.

- Just today she tried to tell me that I was returning my EcoReps box incorrectly, when just days prior SHE is the one who rudely told me to do it that way. 

There are so many more rude things she has said and done to me in that short window of time from swiping in to exiting. 

And I'm not normally a complainer or one to get offended, but this is just irritating. I'm definitely not spoiled either. She just makes me feel stupid and uncomfortable while I'm just trying to eat.

Everyone else in John Jay is so nice. Particular the woman that works behind the grain bowl station and the woman at the action station. They really make up for the swiping lady's bullshit.

TL; DR is there any way to file a complaint against rude workers like her. Really it's just her. And maybe a way to submit compliments for good staff members. Also, has anyone had a similar experience with her or someone else?",1568922422,60,0

Black Ivy League professor: ‘I would much rather my children interact with drugs than with police’," “I would much rather my own children interact with drugs than with the police.”

That statement comes from Columbia University Professor Carl Hart in a recent *Washington Post* [**op-ed**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/10/05/ivy-league-professor-i-would-much-rather-my-own-children-interact-with-drugs-than-with-the-police/) that he penned arguing “the killing of black people by the police has been on a regular schedule.”

Psychology Professor Hart writes that drug effects are “predictable,” but encounters with police “often” end with dead black people.

Dr. Hart, the first black professor tenured in the natural sciences at Columbia University, teaches a psychology course titled “Drugs and Behavior,” and is known for [**his research**](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/fac-bios/HartC/faculty.html) in narcotics and drug addiction – both from a scholarly angle as well as personal experience.

“I speak candidly about my past and who I am,” Hart writes in the op-ed. “In fact, ‘High Price,’ my science memoir, is one of the required readings for \[my\] course. In it, I detail my imperfections and past drug use and sales. I also lay out a blueprint for how one can succeed as a scientist and academic in a world that despises one’s people.”

Question on Grades for Applying to General Studies,"I am thinking of applying to GS in about a year and had a question on my course history/grades at my current community college.

Do you think those 3 grades may hurt my chances of being accepted?

When to take physics?,"Hey all,

I'm a first-year with class registration tomorrow and still have no idea what to do. Right now I'm following the pre-med track (not sure about major, maybe psych) but considering switching to either architecture or some sort of engineering. I have most of my classes laid out so far, but I'm not sure for my last class whether to take a psych, architecture, or physics class (physics now would allow me to switch to engineering more easily), or something else entirely.

My main question about physics is, for pre-med I would only need to do two semesters, but for engineering most majors require at least three. My advisor said I should wait to start physics in the fall so that I could go through the first (or only) two semesters right next to each other, but I'm not sure if I should.

Is everyone at Columbia just a pretentious asshole?,"This is a rant/cry for help

I went on a second date with a guy last night and it was okay, but we were smoking a blunt in the park after and he suggested that we go back to his room, and when I said no he goes quiet for a minute and says, “I had a 4.0 GPA last year.” He later called me basic for liking Harry Potter (yeah, it might be basic, but I like what I like). 

The whole experience made me kind of hate the entire Columbia population because it feels like everyone here is just obsessed with being better than everyone else. I know not everyone is like that, but it feels like most people are. I haven’t found any genuine people that I feel like I can really connect with. I feel like I can’t show my real humor or interests to anyone. This poor guy I went out with had to listen to me passionately talk about classic Tetris for far too long. Does anyone have suggestions for ways to meet people that are just normal human beings not suffering from imposter syndrome? I’m interested in the Esports club because I play a lot of PC games, but I’m kind of intimidated by that because of my skill level.

Intensive chem for pre-med,"Hey, quick-ish question about chem for a pre-med first year.

Honestly I'm fine with that on its own, but I also have Wei Min, who I've heard is the absolute worst, and honestly feel a little over my head in that class.

I could also take gen chem, which would definitely be a weight off my back, so my question is, do you think med-schools would care if I took intensive chem? Would that show more rigor or something, or would they not distinguish between that and gen chem?",1568170728,0,0

Can anyone help me with student loans?,"COA for the academic year is $67,468 and I was given $31,545 in scholarships and grants (including Federal Loans), which means I need to cover the remainder through other means. I have applied to a bunch of private student loan lenders but none of them would approve me unless I have a cosigner. I've applied to Sallie Mae, Citizens Bank, College Ave, Discover, Credible, and Ascent. Only Ascent approved however they only gave me $9,500 and that is obviously not enough. I'm still waiting for Discover and I hope I get the amount I need.

I thought I'd be able to get approved since I have good credit history (790) and I have my own income through my part-time job. I didn't want my parents to cosign since I don't want to burden them but it's not like they can cosign for me either way since they have very terrible credit history and they have their own money problems. I'm also worried about paying the bill that is due this September 13, which amounts to a hefty $13,000.

It's hard to schedule an appointment with the Office of Educational Financing, yet I was able to get one for tomorrow although it conflicts with the last 30 mins of my last class so I hope my professor can give me an excuse to leave early.

SEAS majors - Thoughts on Stress/Core?,"Hey all,

I'm a senior who thought that Columbia SEAS would be my first choice. I was planning on EDing as a CS/Applied Math major, but I've been reading this subreddit and the Spec lately and the whole ""stress culture"" at Columbia has left me with some doubts.

1. A reason why I'm thinking of applying to Columbia is because of the Core, since I've always wanted to become exposed to the works that have changed society and also widen my perspectives intellectually. However, further research makes it seem like the Core holds a lot of students back from taking other electives related to their area of interest. Since CS majors would also have to declare a track along with their major, the heavy courseload seems to make balancing life and school extremely difficult for engineering students. Is this true? How are engineering students able to balance clubs, double majoring/minoring, the Core, and just plain having fun all at once?
2. What is your honest review of the Core coming from a STEM background? Reading Plato, Adam Smith, Descartes, etc. seems like an incredibly enriching experience, but how much does the Core detract from your major? On paper, the Core sounds great to me, but are the classes really that intellectually stimulating and easy to balance with your major? How has the Core affected your mindset on the world as an engineer, and do you believe I could have an experience like that anywhere else? Is the Core really much more different than say, taking some philosophy/classics/econ electives at Stanford? 
3. Are grades inflated or deflated in the engineering school? I've heard mixed opinions on this, but it seems like grades overall still stress students out. In terms of employability, would the existence of grade deflation hurt?
4. Many articles/reviews have also pointed out the fact that Columbia's administration is terrible and their failure to encourage community and school spirit, throwing kids into loneliness and stress. Is it really that hard to find sociable groups around campus? I'm not that interested in partying/tailgating at football games like at a flagship state school, but I still want the chances to meet new people and belong part of a tightknit, small group of friends that I'm able to rely on throughout college. I understand that Columbia does attract an individualistic student body who don't mind veering off campus into NYC, which is fine since I do see myself as an independent person. But, still would rather explore the city with a small circle of friends rather than by myself. How much is Columbia's sense of individualism really ""freedom"" rather than isolation or loneliness? 
5. There are many negatives that I've pointed out about the school, but are these just troubles of college or are they actually exclusive to Columbia? Are the negative reviews on the Spec, Niche, Unigo, etc. a result of the activist/vocal minority at Columbia, or do these opinions actually reflect the Columbian experience?",1567355341,2,0

Feeling alone and without real friends,"I know this isn't a unique feeling, especially not at Columbia, but what I need is advice and perhaps some assurance from people who have been in a similar boat.

At the moment I have a group of people whom I call friends, but my relationship to them feels empty and one-sided. I feel like none of them care about me, or about whether I even exist. If I were to magically disappear none of them would  notice, and even if they did they wouldn't care. Any contact with them has to be initiated by me; I'm not liked enough by any of them to be the one who's messaged first. Sometimes, even when I am the one who speaks first, I'm just ignored and forgotten about. It's the kind of thing where, if I stop contacting any of them, the relationship would probably end because none of them would ever initiate contact. They don't treat each other this way, but it is the way I'm treated. They would never exclude each other from a group event, but my exclusion means nothing to them really. I love them, but they don't seem to love me back.

I haven't felt this way before. In the past I've been lucky to have had friends who valued me, but at this school I've struggled. And right now it feels like I'm at a stage where everyone has already formed their own cliques--like there's no hope of meeting different people who're willing to make room for someone like me.

The typical suggestion is to ""join clubs,"" but it often feels as though people you meet in clubs want the scope of their and your relationship to be limited to interactions within the organization. ""Club friends"" are your ""club friends."" Are there groups on campus where people aren't like this?

I'm sorry if I come off as needy or desperate, but all I want is the feeling of belonging. All I want are friends who value my presence, friends who actually care and who want to be around me. I don't know what to do. All I know is that I feel lost and alone. How do I change this?",1573103191,35,0

Columbia’s community,"Hey, I’m a junior in high school. At the moment, Columbia is my top choice for ED. I’m on a full academic scholarship at my school, and one of the constraints on it is that I’m technically not allowed to apply early decision anywhere (but I can petition the founders of the school to let me do so). 

I toured Columbia this past summer and really fell in love with it, and even though I’m considering two other ED options (Brown and UPenn), this will likely be the one I choose. Since I’m not 100% certain yet (and since it’s really important that I know I want to go to a school before I petition my school’s founders to let me ED), I’d love to hear commentary from Columbia students regarding anything such as:

1. What the general atmosphere is like
2. How the professors are (if they’re accessible, overload you with work, etc.)
3. How competitive it is in CC
4. If you think going to Columbia is worth the work you put in, money you pay, other schools you turned down, etc.
5. What the student community is like
6. How connected Columbia is to the city
7. Anything else you feel is relevant to know before applying

Financial Aid Prédicament,"I just got accepted to Columbia as an early decision applicant, but the financial aid package that I’ve received severely threatens my ability to attend. 

Context: My parents are divorced, and I live with my mother more than 50% of the time. In cooperation with Columbia’s financial aid procedure, my mother filled out the FAFSA and my father filled out the CSS Non-Custodial Parent Profile. My mother made it clear from the beginning that she isn’t able to pay anything for my college education. She completed the FAFSA in hopes that we would qualify for grants. 

Due to my father’s income, Columbia did not give us any sort of aid, meaning that my dad and I would have to pay the full $80,000 per year. The problem is that, despite his income on paper, my father isn’t by any means capable of paying that kind of money. He financially supports his unemployed wife, my brother who is also in college, his mother, my mother, and his extended family. My father may be the most affluent person in my family, but we do not have generational wealth. He has people to take care of and bills to pay, not to mention that he is old and thinking about retirement. 

My question to y’all is, is there any possibility of me qualifying for aid? I haven’t formally appealed my financial aid package, and to be completely transparent, I’m ignorant to the logistics of the process. Is my situation even legitimate in the eyes of Columbia? 

ANY ideas, suggestions, or explanations would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to ask clarification questions as well. Columbia is my dream school and somehow I got accepted. The possibility that my ideal college experience may be inaccessible due to an inaccurate assessment of my financial circumstances is troubling. I sincerely thank y’all for reading this terribly long post. At this point, my back is against the wall.",1577515745,1,0

The Difference Between Columbia and Barnard,"I know that this is a question that’s often asked, but I’m too lazy to do the research so please just entertain my question.

I also understand that Barnard has a different atmosphere, etc. from Columbia and all that. However, because Columbia College is so similar to Barnard (with students from one taking classes at the other), what even is the point of applying to Columbia instead of Barnard? I get that they have different atmospheres or whatever, but is there any tangible advantage to going to Columbia instead of Barnard? Especially so if I have a statistically better chance of getting into Barnard. 

Also, please don’t tell me that Barnard and Columbia are one and the same. I get that Barnard is OF Columbia University, but I can apply to them separately on the Common App and that is how I’m referring to them.

Federal Work Study Advice!,"Hey fellow lions! (roar, lions, roar!!)

I was recently accepted to Columbia College in the class of 2024, and I'm so excited!

As a part of the financial aid package, I'll be doing Federal Work-Study. I don't know if I'm putting too much info out in the open, but I'm expected to make at least $3,090 dollars + min. Student Contribution of $2,400 to pay my Student Responsibility.

I have questions!

What type of jobs are available? 

Are there jobs that could cater to your major? (I listed Sociology, Comparative Lit &amp; Society, &amp; English as potential majors.) Or even interests (for me, that would be things like writing, history, and music)?

Are the off-campus jobs like the stores near off-campus or is it that you would be going off-campus to do these jobs? (hope that made sense...)

How many hours would you recommend working as a freshman (sophomore, junior, senior...)?

Are there jobs you would recommend more? Or jobs that you wouldn't recommend at all? Are there good beginner worker jobs?

How is the general community within these jobs? I'm an introvert, but I'm curious as to if the work environment is more solo or united... (I'm sure it probably depends.)

Did you have wiggle room in your finances for personal expenses, shopping, or going out?

Were you able to maintain a balance between work-school-social lives?

How do/did keep track of your finances overall?

Any reflections or tips in retrospect? I know that a lot of students do work-study or something along those lines, so I'd love to hear different perspectives!

Sorry if I sound kind of ignorant, just trying to learn as much as I can to make this experience affordable and smooth sailing! I'm coming from a background virtually no work experience other than tutoring on and off at my school during the school year. 

I'll also be working on scholarships &amp; getting a job in my town toward the summer to pay the minimum contribution of $2,400 before school starts, so maybe I'll have more experience by then.

Competitive Admission for 3-2 Program Columbia,"Hey guys, I'm currently at a partnered institution for Columbia's 3-2 program.  I'm planning on submitting on sending in an application this December when the applications open. GPA wise, I'm above the requirements for my year. My GPA also shows a growth curve each semester. However during my very first semester at my college, some conflicts with my physics (major course) caused me to get a B- in the course, dropping me out of the guaranteed admission for the program. After this happened, I simply have been trying to push through and try my best, but now that Columbia has gotten rid of guaranteed admission for 3-2 new comers, I'm getting quite restless. For anyone that knows or has experienced the 3-2 admission process, do you think I have a chance?",1572504001,2,0

Lab director made weird comment about my height,"Recently, my class and I went on a trip to one of the science labs at Columbia to see how they work. The lab director greeted and presented her work to us. At one point, she began talking about correlation vs. causation and that’s where she made a comment about my body that made me really uncomfortable. She said something like, “On average, men are taller than women, but [gesturing toward me] I bet some of these girls are taller than you. So the correlation isn’t true all the time.” For the record, they’re not, which somehow makes the comment even more insulting. Everyone in the room laughed, and I was so taken aback that I didn’t say anything.

I found the whole experience very disturbing, and I lost interest in the rest of the presentation. Should I tell someone at Columbia or my school?

(high school senior) Information on University Writing/Music Humanities,"Hello Columbia students (or grads)!

I'm currently writing my Early Applications for Columbia and I wanted to get some clarification from you guys before sending my essays in. I attended a Columbia Info Session and they provided a rundown of the Core Courses and what they're about. So for my Why Columbia? Essay, I'm essentially writing about the Core and the specific programs I'm interested in. However, I can't quite remember what the representative exactly said in the info session, as the rundown was pretty fast. For example, in Music Humanities, do you learn about the history of music composers? In University Writing, do you get to explore philosophical questions like ""What is reality?"" If not, what Core Courses do you do that? I already checked the website but only found short summaries of the course descriptions that didn't really answer my question. If I could get some facts and information from people who actually took these courses, it would mean a lot! Thanks :)",1572045149,2,0

Transferring into Columbia - worth it?,"Hello everyone. I was wondering if it would be worth it to transfer to Columbia after two years at a public state school. I am studying astronomy and physics at a school that isn’t prestigious at all, but it does have pretty decent rankings for those programs. Columbia has been my dream school, and unfortunately I got rejected applying last year as an incoming freshman. I was wondering some things: 

a. What are people’s thoughts on the physics/astronomy program at columbia?
b. I know columbia has the core. I was wondering if I transferred in after two years, I could still graduate in the next two years? 
c. Would it be better to stay at my current school and graduate without loans, or to transfer to columbia and accrue some student debt?
d. If I got rejected applying as a first year last year, would I even have a chance at getting in as a transfer? 

Thank you!",1571978063,8,0

Hi I am a prospective student who is having trouble figuring out if I should apply to CC or SEAS.,"In short, I really love Columbia and it’s one of my top schools; however, I’m seriously debating on applying to CC or SEAS. I plan to major in biochemistry or biomedical engineering but I also want to apply to med school after graduation. I know that CC has more humanities core classes while SEAS is more “pick and choose” the English requirements with more emphasis on physics, CS, chem, etc. The thing I’m afraid about for SEAS is grade deflation bc I’ve heard the engineering school tend to have a lower GPA than CC. The only reason why I’m cautious about that is because med school weigh GPA pretty heavily (or so I’ve heard). Could I do engineering related/lab research at CC? Is it hard to do internal transfers? Does Fu really have a bad deflation? I’m not afraid of work, but I don’t want to relive my high school experience (aka sleeping at 3-4 am because of homework or some other meeting/projects).

"If you are considering buying Leetcode Premuim, now is the time (Because Student Discount is here!)","Hey guys, I have to say first that I am not any sales people from Leetcode, I am just a miserable SDE job seeker.  

If you are okay with the non-premium version, it's totally fine. However, if you have considered about premium but wasn't sure then, now is the best time.  Here is a short version of why and a longer one. 

In short, it's not only $99 for a year for students, and it used to be $159.

&amp;#x200B;

The longer one is:

I am poor and going to Columbia only makes me even poorer (and that's why I want to be an SDE). I have been waiting for this discount for months (I only do monthly subscription over these months, which cost me a lot again). And now, the deal is in front of me, but they need 50 ppl from the same .edu email to subscribe in order to activate the deal. We already have 37 ppl now, so just about a dozen to go. I don't want to miss it, that's why I am desperately posting here. Plus, I also don't want anyone (poor SDE job seeker) like me to miss this deal. 

Premium gives you access to all questions and frequency (for me that's the most important one, because it super helpful in this interview season to go through all frequent questions under a company's tag before tech interviewing with that company). 

Anyway, thanks for your time, and good luck everyone with job hunting.",1570151674,2,0

Hello! I am a psychology student from LIU-Brooklyn and I would like to ask you to be a participant in my research. This study is designed to help us better understand the personality characteristics of people who participate in Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG) and how this relates to their interpersonal behaviors in their daily lives.

You will fill out a series of questionnaires and will be asked to create and audio record narratives after observing several picture cards. This study will require about 50 minutes of your time. As the study focuses on MMORPG players, you are eligible to participate if you are an active player in one or more MMORPGs. You will also have to reside in the United States and speak English as your primary language due to the narrative component of this study.

Upon completion of the study, you will be offered a **$10 online Amazon gift card**. Additionally, you may find the study interesting!

You will also provide information that may help clinical psychologists understand the relationship between personality characteristics and face-to-face interpersonal behaviors in individuals who play MMORPGs.

Is it possible to manage all of this plus the core classes but still have time for internships/clubs/social life?

Potential Columbia GS student concerned,"Let me preface this all with the short version. I got two emails from Columbia GS, one saying to register for an online information session and the other telling me to make sure to apply before October 1st for an early action deadline. Basically the question is does this mean anything or am I just on a mailing list? Are they actually interested in getting me into their university?


Now with that out of the way, I am an older student who didn't jump into college right out of the gate. I'm 24 now and enrolled in a community college. Despite my laughably low highschool grades, my community college grades are near a perfect 4.0. As a result of that I was invited to the honor society Phi Theta Kappa. I was wondering if something like that put me on the radar for Columbia GS? 

After the trials and tribulations I grew up with, I can't imagine so, positive like that happening to me. I'm pretty much drained of hope so I'm so unsure about all of this. Flabbergasted really. I haven't sent in my application, it's just the emails make it seem like they actually want me and that's such a strange and foreign notion for me.

Feeling sad vibes due to low GPA and mild imposter syndrome,"Hey guys,

I’ve been feeling a little worse for wear this midterm season for a couple of reasons and I wanted to know your thoughts / advice on my current situation. 


Basically what’s been fucking me up most is that I received a bad grade in one class my freshman fall semester and it absolutely destroyed my cumulative GPA. The class was in a subject (stem) not at all related to my major (humanities-oriented) if that’s important . I’m a sophomore in CC currently and I’m trying really hard in my classes this semester so I can nudge that number a little higher, but it seems hopeless at times because after two semesters I’m sitting at just below a 3.0. Honestly this has been killing my confidence and I haven’t told a single person except my mom about it (love you mom) because I’m just super embarrassed about it. Sometimes, albeit rarely, people will joke with condescension about how they know someone with a 2 point something GPA and I’ll just be chilling there like *yeah haha that’s rough hahaha* but on the inside I definitely shrivel a little. 

I’ve been trying to hype myself up through the reassurance that if I get stellar grades for the rest of college I’ll show an “upward trend” which will indicate growth and ability to learn from mistakes. This is actually pretty much what happened in HS for me (got meh grades freshman year and straight A’s junior year), but from a career / grad school standpoint I can’t help but stress. I know for certain fields like finance they won’t even look at your GPA if it’s below a certain cutoff, but to what extent are there exceptions to this via networking, professional/research experience and the like? And how does this vary among competitive fields? I’m feeling the same semi-desperation when it comes to grad school, specifically law. 

Coupled with this is the fact that I feel like an absolute retard in 1004 Java compared to the others in the class. I generally haven’t experienced imposter syndrome since I’ve been here but it seems like the class is easy for most people while I’m having a hard time understanding what are pretty abstract concepts defined using a ton of terminology I’ve never heard before, especially since I came into the knowing literally nothing about computers except how to use Windows XP and Office 2010 (deadass. on my Mac I can use the internet and that’s about it) It gets hard not to psych yourself out and have spiraling thoughts along the lines of *dang seas and stem kids are way smarter than me and a stem degree probably seems way more impressive than a humanities one so I should switch my major to stem to be more eye-catching to employers even if its at the expense of enjoying school* ... especially since I was pretty good at math and whatnot in HS but I just do not shape up to the level of talent in STEM here.

All in all I definitely just needed to throw a pity party for myself and I don’t think like this always, but these thoughts are still frequent enough to give me a hard time.  

TL;DR: Have just below a 3.0 GPA after two semesters in CC. Feeling dejected and nervous about my future. How important / unimportant is one’s GPA in the grand scheme of things? And do people really find Java easy on the first go?",1571118029,27,0

We will accept the documents either electronically or in paper form via postal mail or fax.""

If first quarter grades do need to be sent, then based on Columbia's FAQ should they be sent via the midyear report or in another way? I thought the midyear report is only sent after being deferred or accepted and would only show semester grades?

Bad high school GPA as somebody trying to transfer into the sophomore class?,"Hello, I wanted to transfer to Northwestern, but I have a couple of issues on my side. I have a good GPA (est. at about 3.8) from the best State School in New York (it's ranked like #80), but I have a pretty bad HS GPA (It's a 3.3). 

My high school was super rigorous and prestigious, it's ranked very highly and all my courses from there count as APs. Even though some people would say that that reflects well on my application, I still consider it a blight on my application. People say that for transfer applicants who have low GPAs on the college side, if they would be competitive applicants during their high school years, they have a decent shot, but I haven't heard much from the converse-- students with low HS GPA and good college GPAs. My extracurriculars are fine, I'm doing an M&amp;A case competition that I'm scoring pretty well in, finance society, and poker club (oddly enough, haha, Poker is just fun).

Parking gates question.,"North campus parking garage. (Evanston)


I sometimes drive to campus.  I have a lot of late classes.  I noticed that if I leave after 6pm, usually the exit gates are open so I dont have to pay for parking (even if I arrived before 4). 

Yesterday though, the gates were still down for entry and exit at 7pm.  So I did have to pay $9 to exit. 

Is this the norm or are the gates usually open and someone just forgot yesterday? Before I've seen the entry gates open at 4, and the exit by 6.

It’s time to pinch off a holiday yule log, but you can’t just drop down in any old bathroom. Toilets of the main doors of tech? Horrible. Dirty, busy, and old. Mudd is better, but also a high traffic zone. So what are your favorite dookie destinations? Rate your picks using the following categories: 
Traffic- Ideally you want to be in a location that isn’t busy. This means the thrones are likely to be polished and no public poopers anxiety
Cleanliness- Who wants to sit in someone else’s debauchery? Options should be consistently clean. 
Utility- Is the bathroom laid out in a way that facilitates business conduction? This does not mean the bathroom needs to be easy to access but the internal layout should provide comfort to those doing the deed.

Is it worth switching from McCormick to Weinberg CS at this point?,"I'm currently a second-year in McCormick CS and I was considering transferring to Weinberg solely because I can't handle any more engineering classes (i.e. the classes to fulfill the ""basic engineering"" requirement).

I've already completed the EAs and DTCs, so I've already done most of the classes that are only required for McCormick and not Weinberg. I just have to take two more engineering classes and the public speaking class, then the rest of the classes are the same as if I were in Weinberg.

By this point it seems silly to me to switch to Weinberg since I'm already almost done with the engineering requirements. Maybe I should lighten up my course work a bit, but each quarter it becomes more and more difficult to finish the engineering classes.

Additionally, I just never felt like I fit in with others at my school. It's hard to label myself as an ""engineer."" idk what Weinberg people are labelled as lol but I feel like I'm the person who would rather take various courses in various subjects, which is what Weinberg is about.

Any advice?

Concerned ED applicant,"Hi, I'm a senior in HS and am in the process of applying ED to Northwestern. I was wondering how competitive the School of Education and Social Policy (SESP) is; it seems as if they only accept around 40-50 students per year. I am trying to decide between applying for the college of arts and Sciences (Weinberg) or to SESP. I can't really decide between them, but I want to know if it'll reduce my acceptance chance if I apply to SESP. Also, does NU accept by school or directly to the college. Thank you",1571952346,0,0

High school senior here! Applying to HPME with a pretty serious complication.,"I'm a high-school senior, trying to apply to HPME. I have already been accepted to apply to the program after review. The program requires a recommendation letter from an English teacher, but that's a little bit of an issue for me. In 9th and 10th, I had two different English teachers, both of whom are unreachable, and even if they were reachable I wouldn't request a rec letter because they were fired for abusive conduct and the like. They were bad teachers. In 11th grade, I didn't take an English class and got credit by exam instead. Now in 12th grade, I have a good teacher, but the issue is that she's only been at our school for a week now, and doesn't really know who I am. I have no idea how I'm gonna get a recommendation for the program, and I was really looking forward to applying. Any suggestions?",1571892210,8,0

I've tried joining clubs and stuff thinking it would help with a social life, but haven't really connected with anyone and think maybe a more social scene is more for me.

Question for Cog Sci/Neuro/Psych majors,"I’m currently a freshman and I came in to NU intending to major in neuroscience. However, I’ve realized that the neuroscience major seems to consist of mostly premeds, and I’m not sure I need all of the required biology and physics for what I hope to do. I’m more interested in psychological clinical work or research which will require a PhD rather than med school. It seems that the cognitive science major is very interdisciplinary and that many of the grads go on to conduct research, which is more aligned with my goals. I have become interested in CSD and linguistics, so I like that cog sci would allow me to explore these areas as well. However, I’m not sure about career opportunities with a cog sci degree (since I’m not totally sure of what i want to do), and I’m worried I’m not understanding what this major is about because I keep hearing it being related to comp sci and programming. I know I don’t need to choose a major yet, but I’m starting to think about these different major options and would love any input. Thank you!",1572827400,3,0

Northwestern University shows precisely how to not be a journalist," 

***Photographs and source-gathering are basic, non-negotiable parts of the job***

It is bad enough when students at an elite university demand the school’s newspaper stop doings it job, as happened [**at Harvard recently.**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/harvard-immigration-activists-furious-that-student-newspaper-asked-ice-for-comment/) It is worse still when a school’s newspaper vows to stop doing the job itself, as happened at Northwestern University [**earlier this month.**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/student-journalists-apologize-for-taking-photos-of-protesters-at-a-public-protest/) There, responding to activist outcry over its coverage of a campus protest, the editors of *The Daily Northwestern* apologized for taking photographs of the event and for reaching out to students for comment via the school’s directory. The paper also apologized for naming the subjects of interviews. “We will…work to balance the need for information and the potential harm our news coverage may cause,” the editors wrote.

This is a silly joke. If a newspaper seeks to “balance” its coverage by taking down photographs and voluntarily making it harder to contact relevant sources, it’s intentionally hobbling itself, in this case for no other reason than that some students weren’t happy about being associated with a public newsworthy event. Everyday journalism is apparently now viewed by campus activists as evil and “harmful,” but it’s another thing entirely that campus journalists actually bought into it.

More info on Northwestern SCS,"Hello,

I have a friend who may not have had the most traditional childhood and was only able to obtain an associates degree between work and other life issues.  Now with stuff under control, my friend is looking to finish undergrad and obtain a Bachelor's degree at the age of 23.  My friend got accepted into Northwestern SPS and I just want to make sure my friend isn't getting taken advantage of as I don't know anything about the program.   My friend will be taking out a loan to go to school.

I have read some yelp reviews and while I understand that the instruction may be of less quality than the regular NU program, does my friend still get to put BS or BA from Northwestern University on the resume?  Or does my friend need to specify it is from the SPS program.  Additionally, I understand how much you get out of the program depends on how much you get in, but is the education (knowledge taught) on par with most undergrad programs around the area like UIC, Loyola, Depaul, etc..  Northwestern was chosen because of the evening classes as my friend needs to continue to work to pay bills and afford school.  Some schools like UIC do not offer evening undergraduate classes.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.",1573846838,1,0

My take on the Jeff Sessions protesting controversy,"I posted a version of this as a response in another /r/northwestern thread but I thought it deserved it's own thread since the original thread was based on a faux ""news"" source.  I'm writing this as a far left progressive worried about the future of our cause adopting ""purity tests"".  This is counterproductive, especially in this situation.

Here are some facts:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If you don’t want to be contacted via the university directory then you can opt out.

&amp;#x200B;

2. If you are in a public space then you have no expectation of privacy.

&amp;#x200B;

3. If you’re protesting something the point of the protest is to garner attention. Therefore, you should expect attention if you protest. (This is usually how you change opinions.)

&amp;#x200B;

4. A reporters job has two basic functions, observe and report. 

&amp;#x200B;

5. \*\*History has shown that “traumatic” photos can sway public opinion for the better.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

6. Life is messy, protesting is messier. If you protest then be prepared, things may not go as planned. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

IMO, adding intermediate steps to item 4 either turns journalism into propaganda or it makes journalism complicit in censorship.  

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I believe that “traumatic”  photos, such as those of police  brutality should be reported.  \*\*History has shown many times that “traumatic” photos can sway public opinion toward rectifying harmful practices\*\*.  This happened when children laborers were photographed near the turn of the century, it ended the practice of child labor.  Photo and TV images of the Vietnam war helped sway public opinion.  Etc. etc.  I can see the point that rating hungry news agencies have taken the tack of publicizing salacious stories, but that is not the case at all here. Finally, I don’t understand the statement from the girl who asked to have her photo changed.  It was something along the lines of “we wanted national attention.”  So b/c the daily NU was not “national” then it was not ok to photo police brutalizing her and the other protesters?

&amp;#x200B;

Chamber music for nonmajors?,"Hi everyone, I’m not a Bienen student but I still take playing violin pretty seriously and would like to participate in chamber music here.

I found something on Morse. The apartment complex itself looks great, but I don’t know how safe the area is. I’ve read posts on r/Chicago from a few years ago that cite gang violence and muggings. I’ve heard people say that “you’re fine as long as you’re not an idiot,” and, quite frankly I’m not sure what that means. I’m brown if it’s worth anything, and I am planning to present trans femme.

I've previously taken 349 and did pretty well, but this Fall Quarter I'm also taking 3 other CS project courses so I don't want an AI course that will take up too much time in my schedule. Unlike 349, I've heard that the instructors for 348 and 375 are often rated poorer. This is a concern for me if the assignments are demanding. 

I've also taken other data science courses already so my goal with either taking 375 or 348 would be for fulfilling CS major requirements.",1567540006,2,0

how much do grades and GPA actually matter?,"I'm a first-year in Weinberg (pretty sure I'm declaring a poli sci major and Spanish minor next quarter) and I've been tentatively thinking about going to law school after I graduate here. In high school I was very anal about my grades and I got a 4.0 (which I know is not going to happen while I'm here at NU lol) but I still am striving to have very good grades and do well in my classes in general. With grades coming out today and my professors slowly adding stuff in on Canvas, I'm just wondering how much this will actually all matter? Like I know if I want to go to one of the really top-tier law schools I'm going to need a ridiculously high GPA but, like, let's say I average an A- and my GPA ends up being around a 3.7. That's good.. right?

Sororities for A Mixed Girl (non-identity based),"Hi! Class of '24 student here looking for some advice on sororities. 

I'm half black and half Chinese and grew up in a predominantly white and Asian community. I'm from the South where sororities at state schools are synonymous with being air headed and shallow, but a few friends who attend college in T20 schools (UChicago, Harvard, Yale) have told me that sororities at T20s are a lot better. 

Culturally, I wouldn't feel comfortable in a ""black sorority"" just because I have a disconnect with the black identity, so I'm really just looking for a really social and educated group of gals without any racial affiliations. 

My main priority is being social. Continuing some philanthropy from high school (youth + education focused) is also something I'm really interested in, if certain sororities prioritize that. 

Any suggestions, tips, warnings, or concerns would be greatly appreciated! 

(I don't really care about rankings, but if there are sororities I should avoid because they get warnings from admin, I'd like to know too!)",1576381377,1,0

Is it normal for CAPS to say you can't see a counselor for months?,"I went to the counseling center in September and think I conveyed pretty well that I was struggling and dealing with suicidal thoughts.

I've heard terrible things about CAPS but still I'm kind of astonished that this is normal. I made it clear that I have suicidal thoughts and am not able to access outside counseling. What do they expect me to do for several months? Would the university really rather have dead kids than finance CAPS a little better?

Transfer student feeling out of place,"Hi there. I was gonna make a throwaway account for this post but I figured I might be able to talk to someone helpful so yea here it goes~

I’m a new transfer student and I commute and I’m just feeling so out of place and depressed. I haven’t gone to school for the last few days and I know if I continue down this road it’ll be even more tough later. But I just can’t seem to find motivation and I’m so not used to such a big campus or class sizes of the amount of work you’re expected to put in. I knew I should’ve expected this, but now that it’s reality I am scared. I don’t want to mess up but I don’t feel like I belong here. I did go to the counseling center but it’s a short term thing and my appts have to be scheduled for a few weeks out. I’m doing what I can but would love to hear from other transfer students (or anyone) about how they adjusted to this. Thank you guys

Business Economics FAQ,"Hey everyone!

We're the Undergraduate Business Association, a general business club open to all majors. Lately we've received a lot of questions about business econ, and seen quite a few on this sub too. We decided to compile some of the most frequently asked questions for future reference, since it can be surprisingly difficult to get a thorough answer for some of these. Let's get into it:

**What is the difference between business admin and business econ?**

Business econ (BE) has a much higher emphasis on economics than business admin (BA), and can generally be described as straight economics with a couple business topics mixed in. The BE coursework is about 75% econ and 25% business, while obviously the BA requirements are pretty much exclusively business courses. BE is slightly more math heavy and the general consensus is that it can be a little bit harder than BA, but it's still not too bad for most people. Also, BE is **not** technically part of the business school, and actually falls under the school of social sciences (important for major restrictions and academic advising).

**Should I transfer into business econ or business admin?**

BA is usually everyone's first choice, while BE is the backup. However, less than 10 people per *year* successfully transfer into BA, while BE is relatively easy to get. It is worth noting though that yes, **BE is a valid alternative for BA**, even if it is significantly different. We'll get into that in the next question.

**Does being a business econ major instead of a business admin major affect my career choices?**

For the most part, no. Job outcomes are about the same, most employers don't know the difference between the two majors or don't really care either way. You might get asked why you didn't ""choose"" business admin (even though that's usually everyone's first choice), but as long as you give a good answer about how you really enjoy the econ side of the business world you'll do fine. Either way though, internships are really important as both BA and BE majors in order to start a successful career after college.

**Will I still be able to network as a business econ major?**

Yes. You'll still be welcome in most if not all of the business organizations on campus, which is a great way to network and experience more about what the business world is. 

**Should I get a Merage school minor as a business econ major? I.e. management, accounting, or entrepreneurship**

It's a good idea. What most people don't know is that you don't actually have to apply for the minor in order to graduate with it; if you took the required classes then you get it regardless. Most of the time there are still some spots open when major restrictions lift on a business school class (also, upper div management courses that are online do not have major restrictions to begin with), so it's entirely possible to do. There's a lot of overlap in BE and BA minor classes as well, just make sure to take the business versions of courses whenever you can since often they fill requirements for both BE and the business minors (for example, MGMT 30A fills the accounting requirement for both while the econ version does not)

Got more questions, or have something to add? Let us know in the comments! We'd be happy to give you personalized help at our meetings as well, or contact us via the info in our profile.

Do you support Andrew Yang in the 2020 election? Want to volunteer on-campus to spread the campaign? Come join the Yang Gang at UCI and help us secure a $1000/month UBI for every American (details inside!),"[SIGN UP HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRBAmgd-q3UjLwNgia26IbZFDsFDVw49Y1B804PBiguK0T9Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Hey Anteaters, I’m starting a Yang Gang at UCI in collaboration with the Orange County Yang Gang and we’re looking for motivated students who want to spread the Yang 2020 campaign on campus. Our primary activities will include: tabling, canvassing, fundraising, registering voters, and posting flyers. If you’re in the Yang Gang already I shouldn’t need to convince you any further, so sign up now and we’ll send you more details shortly. DM me if you want to be extra-involved and help run the club, because we definitely need people like you! (also don’t forget to join /r/YangforPresidentHQ)

Never heard of Andrew Yang? Put simply, he’s the Asian man running for president who wants to give every American adult $1000 a month. It sounds almost too good to be true, but it’s surprisingly the best solution to eliminate poverty and prepare Americans for the future as automation &amp; globalization ramp up. He is competing for the Democratic nomination in a highly-contested primary race, and is currently between 4th-6th place depending on what metrics you look at. His 21st-century platform consists of over 100 policies, including:

* The “Freedom Dividend”: universal basic income of $1000/month for every American adult
* Medicare-for-All
* Student loan debt forgiveness
* Federal legalization of marijuana https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1170048318686318593
* Combating climate change
* Giving people property rights over their data
* Reducing cost of higher education
* Eliminating private prisons and reducing mass incarceration
* Much, much more at [https://www.yang2020.com/policies/](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/)

If that piqued your interest, sign up today or stop by the Yang 2020 booth on Ring Road on Thursday, October 17 to find out more. In the meantime, no one can convince you better than Andrew Yang himself, so listen to the first few minutes of his [Joe Rogan appearance](https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8) and hear why you deserve $1000 a month. Feel free to ask any questions below and I’ll be happy to answer them, whether it’s about the club or Yang’s policies ;)

Welcome to Incoming Freshmen and Transfers to UCI! Step 7: Searching /r/UCI,"One of the most useful things to learn about /r/UCI is to look for prior posts that have the same information you are looking for. If using a computer to open Reddit, you will have a search bar at the top of the screen that says “search /r/UCI” just click there and type a general term for your search such as: parking

If you are using your phone and a web browser, you have on the upper right corner the icon of a magnifying glass to access the search bar.

Or if you install the Reddit app, on the top of the page you will see the icon of a magnifying glass followed by r/UCI. 

Sometimes the search function is not as good as google so you can use google to do the same using these format:

Question about COM to CGS,"Hi, I’m a second year U/U student, and I hope to get into CGS. I’m currently taking ICS 32 this fall quarter, which i feel blessed to have gotten into, but I’m worried about a particular requirement for CGS. My Math 2A grade is fine, but I fucked up Math 2B pretty bad, and ended up with a C-. The CGS requirement states that you need a C or above after taking in Math 2A,2B,6B, OR 6D. Did I fuck myself taking 2B when it was technically optional for COM? Or is it possible that they won’t count the C- for my Math 2B? I planned on retaking it next quarter, but I’m not sure how long it takes grades to come out, and I have to change majors by spring quarter I believe. I’m afraid I won’t be able to change majors by then because I either fuck up Math 2B again or the grade won’t appear until later on. I really hope that they’ll ignore the C- part for Math 2B since Math 2A is sufficient but if not then that is a big :-(",1572474645,0,0

I really wanted to work at the library, I like the environment , but I feel bad for just quitting after I just started working this quarter (it’s barely week 5 now! )
My friend told me to just quit and take the offer at the lib. Only thing is I want to  be able to put down work on my resume and working short term is a big no to put on my resume (otherwise I’d be seen as a job hopper :( ) 
I don’t even know if I’ll continue working at the library next quarter because of classes and another commitment (but I do like how I can work on the weekends). That’s why I’m not sure if I should just stick with my dining job until the end of the quarter, put that on my resume and then just not work next quarter OR take the offer at the lib and continue working next quarter. (If I take the offer and quit next quarter then well I wouldn’t have anything on my resume :/)

"Leaving and Joining MAE projects in the middle of the year (Dropping and then Volunteering?) Has anyone tried this, and any good advice for a new project?","So pretty much I joined a new project this school year, it didn't pan out to anything I expected it to be, there's no design work available so not only is it boring but I'm getting grilled every check in for not having any actual design work completed.                    

The nail in the coffin right now is that my 2 design team groupmates pretty much never correspond to any of my messages and its getting kind of old after 4 weeks of barely being able to plan anything. I ask for available times and they obviously put only hours they'd like, and then even do a switcharoo on those times.  Take days to answer messages, asking if they can put files on the drive takes  way too long.... etc.                  

**So my first question is what luck have you guys had with getting the Dean's approval to drop MAE 189**                 

**The second is, what projects do you recommend, that :**

I can join in the middle of the year (maybe start rolling in integrating into the team this quarter). 

Give you more opportunities to be part of the design decisions of the team (rather than just a few people making decisions about design, concepts, and specifications) and giving you busy tasks may or may not be of any use and that would get you grilled every single check in by Walter  (kind of a huge plus). Anything with lots of open dialogue

 It would also be nice if there was more freedom to fail, (benefit)

You don't have to sign up for MAE 189 (optional) 

 I know that was contradictory with getting work that doesn't get you fucked in check ins, but I like the idea of actually being part of the decision making process and having more freedom to fail on something and maybe be able to explore new fields of study more (ME/AE but interested in some embedded/computer architecture stuff for example). I'm not saying this as an exact need, but an offchance benefit                

I'm interested in a lot of topics within ME/AE. This list is kind of based on my experiences on a few projects I've been on.....",1572336747,1,0

ICS 45C Thornton Project 3 Question,Yo I'm confused about one thing. The project says that a HashMap should be initialized to use a default hash function. Why is that the case ? I understand he wants all HashMap objects built with the default constructor to use a default hash function that we write. He also wants another constructor that makes a HashMap that uses a particular hash function. How are keys supposed to be hashed by a member variable function if the HashMap is initialized with no keys/values. HashMaps are initialized with some HashFunction and also 10 Node pointers that each point to nullptr. Shouldn't a hash function be used when you add keys to the HashMap so it should be a part of the add function? How/when do you access the HashFunction that is part of the HashMap object? I'm just confused about how we are supposed to use a HashFunction that is part of an initialized object rather than just a member function part of the class. I feel dumb idk.,1574576605,1,0

Strange man in and around UCI,"**PSA**\- I and two girls that I know were stopped by the same man in/around UCI on different occasions. We were asked questions by this man, he would not leave or stop talking to any of us. We believe he hangs around UTC and UCI a lot waiting for people to walk by to talk to; these events occurred in a span of two days.

One of us was stopped on ring road around 5pm, One of us on the bridge to UTC around 930pm, and another in UTC around 8pm.

Physical Description- black rectangular glasses, black nike hat, black jacket, dark blue jeans, olive to white skin, about 5'11 and early 20s

All of us were initially approached by this man by being asked what our ancestry was, then followed up with questions about Anthropology, Social Media, and were asked about our majors, and if we were single.

He told me his name was Adam, and when asking for my number I saw that there were less than 5 contacts in his phone, one of them being named 'Chicken'.

I know this may not seem like a big deal but oftentimes, sex traffickers will approach women and ask seemingly innocent questions in order to make them less afraid of them. He did not want to let any of us go, and stopped all of us when we were looking down, wearing headphones, and most importantly, walking alone.

Do people actually cheat off of others on exams?,"So... I had a midterm a few days ago, and I couldn't help but notice how the person a seat away from me was constantly looking in my direction. They even used the writing tablet that was on their left rather than the one on the right, which was attached to their chair, which provided them with the perfect view of my exam booklet. (They were not left handed either.) 

The midterm was open book and open notes. A little less than halfway into the exam, I noticed how this person was spending a great amount of their time flipping through their notebook filled with their class notes and looking at their notes. They would write only when I began writing. At one point I looked directly at their direction, and they stopped flipping and looking through their notebook and began writing. 

After I had answered every question and checked my answers, I closed my test booklet and turned my exam in; the person next to me also closed theirs at the same time and did the same.  

Do people actually cheat off of others on exams?

Taking a big L,"Hi all,

So I know for a FACT that I will fail Bio 93 this quarter. I just had a hard time adjusting to college as a freshman. I’ve worked on my mental health and quit my job recently which has made things much easier, but it’s too late in the quarter to make a difference.

I’ve been doing the bare minimum for this class, and I take full responsibility if I don’t pass. But it’s discouraging to say the least. Im a Bio major, and I’m failing my first Bio class. I love Bio, but I feel like switching majors now. 

I’m definitely going to retake this class next quarter, but that will put me a step back, so I don’t even know anymore. 

Mostly I’m afraid that I’m never going to bounce back from this and my GPA will be in shambles. I know that the first quarter is rough for everyone, but I never thought I’d straight up fail a class. 

Do you guys have any advice as to how I can recover from this, or do y’all think I should consider changing my major?",1574402727,1,0

- have knowledge for the future as I believe this will be required by most businesses. 
- will be/currently assembling an “A-Team” to develop a business. I want to be able to more effectively communicate, and spot help with the “A-Team.” :)

got fucked by School of Bio Sci,"So I was put on an Academic Hold during the summer because I was unable to complete the CHEM51 series. I got an email saying I had to pass the series (including the labs) during both summer sessions or else I had to be forced to switch my major by Sept. 16th or else my Fall 2019 courses will be dropped. Either that or I had to withdraw from UCI, which is fucking stupid. 

Anyway, I worked my ass off during the summer and passed 51B, 51C, and 51LC. (Definitely don't recommend anyone to do it because learning two o.chem courses in five weeks each isn't fun lmao)

My official, passing grades were up on Sept. 19th but by then my classes dropped, including BIO100, a prerequisite to literally all of my upper divs. Basically, I can't finish my degree unless I get the class. The class has no waitlist and it is IMPOSSIBLE to find an open spot. I went to the BioSci counselors yesterday and they were SO HELPFUL when they basically told me to fuck off and keep checking WebReg. 

I get that they can't help every student and that they can't do anything with the WebReg system, but that's literally the last thing I wanted to hear and I'm so fucking tired of dealing with their shit I'm sorry. I made it this far into my upcoming senior year and I've jumped through their hoops with dealing with two back-to-back o.chem courses (and lab) during both summer sessions and I really can't deal with having 0 units right now.   


My plan rn to to see the BIO100 professor on the first day of class to see what they can do, but aside from that I'm really at a loss of what I can do. If anyone has any insight at all I'd really appreciate it :(",1569341187,100,0

Douglas' no technology rule,"I got an iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil to use this year. My plan is to go paperless if it helps the environment even a little bit. I really like the convenience I get from using my iPad. The app I use allows for infinite notebooks with unlimited pages, folders, styles, etc. Needless to say, I have everything I need in one place. Even textbooks.

I'm taking Anthro 41A with Douglas, and I read through the syllabus which states ""Laptops, net-books and the use of any other wireless devices are NOT permitted in either the lecture or discussion section."" Exceptions are only accommodated if authorized by the student disabilities office.

I do think this is unfair to people like me who are trying to conserve. I don't want to go out and buy paper and other tools to accompany this one class that I really want to keep when I already have these tools on my iPad.

Math 5B with Qing Nie or Math 2B with Pluta,"Hi,

As a senior Bio major I have the option of taking Math 2B/5B. I am very bad at Calculus, I had to retake Math 2A. I have heard that math 5 series is easier compared to the 2 series. I don't know how accurate that statement is but overall I believe it depends on the professor and how easy/hard their midterms are. I can take Math 5B with Qing Nie  or Math 2B with Pluta. I know that Pluta is well recommended by many students for math 2b but the class have a common final which sucks for all. Qing Nie has bad ratings on rate my professor for math 2D, it is his first time teaching 5B I believe. Both classes fit my schedule and I am only taking 12 units next quarter so I'll have plenty of time to study for either class but I would really want to take a class that is easier like I still don't understand limits/derivatives/integrals lol.

ICS 33 is v depressing :(,"I am taking 33 this quarter and it honestly has been going well until literally the last week after the third in lab which the professor just added this quarter. grades recently came out, and I got the partial points, and he added 5.7 normalization points, which was very nice of him and i really appreciate his thoughtfulness. then i checked my grade and calculated it. turns out i needed only THREE more points to get that 72.5% avg for in lab exams :') the students' ability in this class is just very skewed. seeing the grade distribution for the 3rd in lab, my takeaway is that 50% of the class are geniuses and 50% are just the normal students. so 50% of the class are stable and the other 50% is just close to or bound to fail. comparing it to the first n second in labs (which almost everyone did well), the high number of kids who didnt do well for third in lab shows that this in lab was waaay harder than usual, it would've been more fair if he provided like 6 different questions and give us options (which alfaro did for the midterm n final). i also think it's unfair for kids taking it this quarter when this new in lab is added. im sure many kids wouldn't be failing atm if there were only the first n second in labs. all this new exam did was just make it HARDER for avg students to pass the class. :( i honestly think 5.7 points isnt enough for many of us, and it would've been better to at least drop the lowest in lab like other instructors did. its just that knowing you're failing right on the last week of the quarter is extremely devastating and all these 9 weeks was just me with this false idea that im doing well... and then week 10 i just turn into trash in the blink of an eye. the finish line is literally right in front of me... 

idk... i’ve just been really really really really sad these past few days... :(",1575627826,1,0

I've been constantly crying in the bathroom almost every day since its the only place I don't really feel judged. I was expecting to get out of my comfort zone when I first arrived, but I've been feeling a lot worse. I'm not really sure what I want to do major-related either so I really feel like there's not really a drive to keep pushing me forward. I'm kinda in a dark hole right now just counting until the day is over for the next day to repeat. I'm getting scared that I'm losing myself. Everything feels so suffocating. I want to give up.

Failing a Major Req Class,"So...

Will an F raise a flag for the dean, like will they kick me out for getting an actual F or will they still let me retake ics33 without question (until I (hopefully not) fail it again)?

Status of Klefstad’s CS 122B,"Hello everybody, I'm one of the people helping with this quarters CS 122B class. I was also involved in the process of remaking the class over summer after I took it last spring with Professor Klefstad.
​
The class got a large amount of complaints last quarter and at the end some students and I volunteered to work over summer to help fix a lot of the problems.
​
I wanted to give an update to how the class is now for anyone thinking of taking it next quarter or at any future offerings.
​
If you guys have any questions feel free to leave a question and I can get back to you.
​
# Updates
​
### Homework
**Last Quarter:** The homework documentation went through a large amount of changes after they were assigned. On top of this some homework assignments gave too many tasks.
​
**Fix:** We updated all the homework documentation, removing contradictions and errors, and have since remove some of the tasks to make them more simple and manageable.
​
### Test Cases
**Last Quarter:** The test cases where either given right before the assignments were due or not at all. Usually when the test cases came out there where still problems with the test cases themselves. This also came with the tests being run on Postman making them very difficult to read or create new tests.
​
**Fix:** We created a Test Suite that contains all the tests. All the test cases are JUnit tests and can be run against the homework assignments easily. It also JUnit so its much easier to read and work with than Postman.
This quarter the tests were not provided at the very start, but the current plan is to release all the complete Test Suite at the start of the class.
​
### Grading
**Last Quarter:** The grading changed during the quarter in order to help students, this included increasing deadlines, and added additional regrades. During the regular grading schedule we had to request for regrades when problems where coming up with fail compilations or simple mistakes in our code.
​
**Fix:** Besides the creation of the Test Suite to ensure better scores we are also creating a Testing Service that you can call to grade your current assignment at any time before the deadline and will give you your score and you can request as many grade requests as you want before the deadline. This change is tentative at the moment as it is still being proceed and should be ready by next quarter. We also added a fixed date for all homeworks to be regraded so students don't need to worry about requesting them.
​
### FrontEnd
**Last Quarter:** The FrontEnd last quarter was made in JavaScript, and was a lot to work in in the week we had to complete the FrontEnd.
​
**Change:** More of a change that an actual fix is now the FrontEnd is done in React, and comes with starter code to help the start of the assignment.",1575601813,1,0

Fall 2020 Transfer,"Hello everyone!

It’s 1am in the morning as I am writing post because I’ve been so stressed out and sad ever since I turned in my UC applications. I am a third year CC student and I applied to UCI, majoring in Biomedical Engineering so I just want to ask for advices/tips as well as the chance of me getting accepted. I currently have a UC transferable GPA of 3.49 so I think Im qualified for TAG? I also was an engineering intern at a medical company so i don’t know if that will increase my chance of getting accepted or not. The main reason why I’m stressed out is because I heard BME is quite competitive and Im fear for my life that my GPA will drop below a 3.4 (bc of physics and calc) by spring quarter. Another thing is that I have like 125 quarter units so I don’t know if that will ruin my chance or not. I don’t know if this might increase my chance of getting accepted but I wrote a pretty solid UC essay. If you know any CC applicants who got accepted into BME OR any stories about BME, feel free to share! Thank you so much you guys!",1575536766,1,0

I was wondering if Humanities Core (currently 1A/1AS) had a curve associated with the grades I'll get for both courses. My seminar leader did not post a clear-cut syllabus on where grade cutoffs were, so is it correct to assume that an

 A/A+ is from 100\~92ish, 

A- is from 92-90ish

B+ is from 89-87ish, and so forth?

Because I believe I am hovering around the 89-91 range (on both 1A and 1AS) so I was hoping on finding out whether I'd have a chance of getting an A- in ""both"" courses.

How bad is Burley? People I know really did not like her class and recommend against taking her. 

So ultimately, it seems like in comparison between Burley vs. Hughes, Hughes seems to be the better option. Can someone comment on this? Which professor do you guys recommend? Although the trio was supposed to be the best option for the previous bio 93 class, I got my ass handed to me from the first midterm, but improved after that, so I wouldn’t say I’m an exceptionally good at biology, but would prefer a class where extra effort and tryharding will at least yield an A, lol.

Recently I had to retake ICS32 , my grade changed from F to B- which I’m pretty proud of.
I also am retaking ICS6B Bc I got a C-.
Additionally, I have a warning of academic dishonesty (trust it’s an official warning). 
I know that if my gpa is high enough, which I ensure it will, and that since it’s a warning, I’ll still be able to transfer into Informatics. (I’ve researched this 100x so I’m sure and I asked the ICS academic department and others on this subreddit). But basically I’m just anxious and nervous about having to wait until the end of Winter quarter to apply to see if they accept it. I have a backup plan of majoring in Physics, and a backup backup plan of Film or Public Health Science.

**I found a lost item. How should I report it and how much information am I allowed to give?**

State the item that was lost, where and approximately what time you found it, and whether or not it was returned to a lost and found location (e.g. UCIPD). Avoid mentioning specific details of the lost item so the person who lost it can state identifying details to confirm their ownership of the item.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is my schedule doable?**

We can't exactly say what's best for you, but you can consider a couple things: Generally speaking, GEs will be easier than Math/Science/CS courses. 8 am classes are going to be tougher on you than late 5pm+ classes, while approximately noontime is generally the sweet spot. Taking around 3-4 classes (12-18 units) is a good amount and while taking more classes is manageable, it will very likely be tough. If you are very used to studying and high workloads and want to get your credits ASAP, then go for it. Remember that since we're on a quarter systems, classes go by very quickly.

UCI Test Kitchen Recipes #6: Root Beer Floats and Ice Cream Sodas (Brandywine/Dessert),"The dining halls at UCI try their best to appeal to a lot of different  tastes and appetites with their food choices, but sometimes you want  something more filling or satisfying, but don't want to go to UTC or  another place to get food. UCI Test Kitchen serves to help that problem,  creating new food ideas with ingredients found throughout the dining  hall stations.

For this edition of UCI Test Kitchen, we'll be kicking off the weekend with ice cream sodas, including the beloved root beer float!

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

2-3 scoops of vanilla ice cream (use chocolate for the ice cream soda variant; Honeycakes station)

1/2 glass of root beer (root beer float; any soda fountain with a touchscreen)

1/4 glass sparkling water (ice cream soda; any soda fountain with a touchscreen)

1/4 glass milk (ice cream soda; various)

1/4 glass chocolate milk (ice cream soda; various)

Whipped cream (optional; Second Breakfast station)

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:**

1a.) If making an ice cream soda, fill the glass about halfway with a mixture of sparkling water, milk, and chocolate milk, then mix until foamy

1b.) If making a root beer float, simply fill a glass halfway with root beer (with an optional added flavor of vanilla)

2.) Carefully transfer the ice cream from the bowl into the glass

3.) Top with whipped cream and any other toppings

&amp;#x200B;

Most everyone has had (and loves) root beer floats, but not as many people know of its lesser tasted version, the chocolate ice cream soda (pictured here). Both have their own signature flavor profile, so try out both with different toppings and soda-to-ice cream ratios and see which one you like best! Enjoy!

*\*Note: Some ingredients depend on what options the dining hall puts out for the day, so some parts of the recipes may not be readily available for  every time of day. Most recipes/locations are based off of Brandywine's stations.*

How many W's is too many? Advice needed,"For some context, I had a medical problem that required surgery at the begging of the semester. I feel all better now but I'm currently failing so many courses due to the circumstances that I think I need to take a W in my math course to allow myself more room to try and dig myself out of all the other holes I'm currently in. Math builds on itself so much I'm not sure I have the time to try and get caught up. The W would also drop me to below full-time hours. 

This would be my third W though as I took 2 at a previous school. One was 1st year spring for a semester with 17 credits with 2 Lab Science courses during which my pet dog got cancer and died. I dropped an unneeded for my major Bio class. The other was 2nd year spring I dropped Multi because while I was doing fine it was an hour and in traffic hour and a half commute one way and I also had Chem, Phys 2, and Linear last Spring. I made an A on Multi on the retake. 

Am I screwing myself for job applications or grad school applications (MBA or Law) later down the line even with a 4 or hopefully still close to 4 G.P.A. ? Only this W I'm contemplating would show up on my GT transcript as the other 2 were at another school. Thanks for any advice?",1568316589,4,0

Looking for a photographer willing to take a cosplay photoshoot,"Hiyo! I enjoy cosplaying a lot and plan to see myself competing in many competitions and conventions in the area. I'm a freshman CompE major. Most of my cosplay revolves around armor and weapons, as well as other props. However, I didn't have much room in my car to bring much cosplay, so now I'm excited to build a whole new collection here at GA Tech.

The year-long project I'm currently working on is Bondrewd, the Lord of Dawn from the popular anime and manga, Made in Abyss. It's even my first time using 3D printers instead of Pepakura, which is like a kind of origami printing thing. I've even been printing 2 12 hour prints each weekday between the Invention Studio and the HIVE, mainly in preparation for the upcoming Anime Weekend Atlanta. 

However, I've run into quite a problem. I suck at taking photos, and I don't own any fancy cameras. I would like to run several photoshoots throughout the year to detail the progress I make in the cosplay (cuz it's going to evolve). I might even be able to pay (depends on the circumstances). So yeah, looking for a photographer.

Sahaj Patel BSAE 2020, Accion Systems ( [https://www.matthewisakowitzfellowship.org/sahaj-patel](https://www.matthewisakowitzfellowship.org/sahaj-patel) )

The application is quite extensive but if you or anyone you know meets the following requirements please send the application form their way! The MIFP is major agnostic so even if you are not AE please consider applying! If you have any questions feel free to comment before and I'll do my best to answer them or pass them along to the rest of the fellows! Also, be sure to [attend our info session next week in Guggenheim 442](https://ae.gatech.edu/event/info-session-brooke-owens-and-matthew-isakowitz-fellowship) where last year's fellows will go over the program in more detail and give advice on how to put together a stellar application!

Requirements:

* At the time of application, is a **college junior, college senior, or graduate student** who intends to pursue a **full-time career in the commercial spaceflight industry**. 
   * *Commercial space* is broadly defined as activities in entrepreneurship, intrapreneurship, and innovation that will enable new or dramatically improved products or services that do not depend solely on government cost-plus contracting to prove viable. In its most aspiring terms, commercial space promises to alter the space industry through new business models that will open up the space frontier.
* Has earned an **engineering or science degree**, or is working towards one at the time the Fellowship begins. 
* Has a diversity in experience and academic interests such as in engineering, science, management, business, and other related fields that can be related to commercial space.

"Tired, unmotivated, and in need of advice","Hi, I'm a first year HTS student. Aside from that, I've had an ongoing issue of being unmotivated and finding or doing schoolwork or studying pointless. I can even remember doing this in elementary school with the easiest of projects, and procrastinating on a small 3 sentence summary on a book chapter until the day it was due. I just didn't see why I should care other than needing to get good grades to eventually make good money. I am relatively smart. When I study, I usually understand things pretty easily. But, for years I have only really joined harder programs and courses or pushed myself to be academically ""successful"" or try to be the top percent in anything I do because I feel that if I don't I'm a failure. I don't know what I want to do and feel lost. I feel like if I don't find a career I want to go towards soon, I will have no opportunity to feel motivated based off of enjoying my future. I'm afraid that I will continue to live like this, working hard to be the best or trying to survive vs doing it because I like it. I have learned to be a Jack of all trades, but lover of none. Even when I do find something I might enjoy, I think to myself ""can I actually make money off of this? Will I be struggling financially like my parents and the people around me forever?"" I can most definitely blame this stupid school system in the US and that's likely found globally, but I think it's best to conform for now as I always have. I just want to know for sure that I'll have stability, but that desire for stability and success is being driven without an actual road to drive on. I've been free falling off a cliff with no bottom I feel like for years now. No, I'm not suicidal. I'm stuck in that annoying ""I don't want to be here in this state anymore, but I don't want to die either"". I just want to be a better me at least if I can't find a better setting. I should just go see my therapist again. I feel like I'll soon relapse into that state of utter uck. I just want a sense of direction and motivation. What should I do?

TLDR What can I do to stop being a lazy mofo and achieve a sense of direction and motivation to do my work and figure out what to do with my life?

Come Shoot with the Marksmanship Club!,"Hello Everyone!

We will be holding a pistol fundamentals workshop on **Saturday, September 28th. We will be meeting at the Student Center Parking Lot at 11:30 AM. We will be leaving the parking lot promptly at 12:00 PM.** It is a ~40 minute trip from Georgia Tech to our shooting range, and we typically shoot for 2-2.5 hours; we will most likely  be back on campus around 4:30 PM.

This workshop will be most useful to people who are novice/beginner pistol shooters or who want to learn/reinforce  the many fundamentals of pistol shooting in a small group, hands-on, range environment. The workshop will focus on fundamentals, with a good amount of dry fire practice before doing live fire with rimfire and centerfire handguns. **In order to make sure all participants receive focused instruction, we will be limiting this this outing to 7 people only.** We will be holding additional instructional outings throughout the semester, if you signed up for this outing but were not selected you will get top priority for the next one.

This class WON'T cover more complex topics such as drawing from holster, fast mag changes, etc. **The end goal of this class is for you to be able to effectively put rounds on target during slow fire, with a decent grouping.**

If you need a centerfire gun, we can loan you a gun to train on (indicate caliber preference in the Google Form, subject to availability).

If you have one, you should bring your own centerfire pistol and magazines (and a rimfire if you would like, please let us know). In any case, we will provide the ammo (common service calibers including: 9mm, .40, and .45). 

 

**If you are interested in attending this workshop, please fill out the following Google Form:**

ME classes on the side as an ID major?,"I'm currently an undergrad studying Industrial Design, but Tech has some of the best engineering programs in the country. I love ID and I would never change my major, but I would like to know if it would be worthwhile to learn some engineering on the side. I have some open credits in my last three semesters. Are there any ME classes that would potentially help me in the future (i.e. in communicating with engineers, design for manufacturing/assembly, a better understanding of technology/innovation, etc.), or would focusing on ID be more beneficial? I'm potentially interested in innovative design along the likes of Dyson, both design and mechanical-tech heavy. Tech does not offer an ME minor; the closest would be AE, Physics, or Robotics. But would taking some classes potentially help me enter a more tech heavy field while job searching?

In memoriam: James Strock,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:

I want to bring you an update to last night’s message. It is with a heavy heart that I share with you that James Strock, a second-year student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, passed away after a swimming accident yesterday.

James, who was originally from Uganda, moved to the United States at age 16. He worked hard to adapt and excelled academically, according to his parents. James was a computer engineering major and an active member of our campus community. He was an avid user of the Campus Recreational Center and attended campus ministry. He completed a co-op program with DataPath in Lawrenceville this past summer.

On behalf of Georgia Tech, we offer our deepest condolences to James’ family and friends during this difficult time. I have been in constant contact with his family and will continue to be there to support them.

This is a tragic loss, and I urge you take advantage of the counseling services that are available on campus. Grief counseling is available through the Counseling Center (counseling.gatech.edu) in the Student Services (Flag) Building from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. throughout the week and after-hours by calling 404-894-2575. Staff and faculty may find support through the Employee Assistance Program at hwb.gatech.edu/eap.

under the Americans with Disabilities Act – 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 – 29 U.S.C. § 794, for the failure of the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia to properly accommodate students having a mental health type of medical crisis and develop adequate policies, including adequate officer training, for taking students who are in a mental health/medical crisis into custody.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
1. This action arises under the authority vested in the Court by virtue

of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 1988, and 28 U.S.C. § 1313 and 1343(3). The conduct giving rise to this action occurred on the Atlanta, Georgia campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Fulton County, Georgia, and venue is thereby proper in the Atlanta Division of the Northern District of Georgia.

The Board of Regents, along with Georgia Tech, is a public entity which receives financial assistance from the government of the United States of America and is subject to the provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 794, and 42 U.S.C. 2000d-7.

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 6 of 12

28. Schultz’s appearance corresponded to the description he provided to the 911 dispatcher – he was a white male with long blonde hair dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans.

29. Each of the officers saw that Schultz was walking slowly. 30. Each of the officers saw that Schultz was alone.  
31. Each of the officers saw that Schultz’ arms were at his side. 32. Officers drew their handguns and pointed them at Schultz. 33. Schultz was barefoot.

34. Schultz was verbally calm.  
35. Schultz did not state any threat to either of the officers.  
36. Schultz did not move his arms in a violent or aggressive manner. 37. One officer shouted at Schultz, “Speak.”  
38. Schultz did not immediately respond.  
39. One officer yelled at Schultz, asking for his name,  
40. Schultz did not immediately respond.  
41. Each of the officers was twenty or more feet in distance from

Schultz’s position. As Schultz moved slowly, officers adjusted their position to keep a safe distance from Schultz.

42. Schultz paused and turned the position of his body so that he was facing several of the officers.

6

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 7 of 12

43. Schultz slowly walked a few steps in the direction of the three officers.

44. One of the three officers told Schultz not to move.

45. At the time that he was told not to move, Schultz’ arms remained at his side.

46. At the time that he was told not to move, Schultz was facing in the direction of the three officers.

47. Each of the officers observed that Schultz was not acting rationally and was not responding rationally to officer commands.

48. Schultz’s actions as of the time that he was told not to move were consistent with a person who is experiencing a mental health crisis and were actions which a reasonably trained law enforcement officer would recognize as such.

49. One or more of the four officers had received training designed to equip police officers with the observational skills to judge when a subject whom they are confronting is undergoing a mental health crisis or is otherwise engaging in behavior reflective of mental illness.

50. The specialized training, Crisis Intervention Techniques, trains an officer in methods to de-escalate a potentially dangerous situation when

7

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 8 of 12

dealing with a person undergoing a mental health crisis or engaging in behavior reflective of mental illness.

51. Officer Beck was not one of those officers.

52. Several of the officers at the scene remained calm and followed standard de-escalation techniques without initiating physical force directed at Scott Schultz.

53. Unlike the other officers, Officer Beck did not de-escalate and instead used physical force.

54. Immediately after Schultz was told not to move by one of his fellow officers, Beck shot Schultz – firing his weapon one time.

55. Beck was the only officer to fire his weapon at Schultz.

56. At the time that Beck fired his weapon, Schultz had taken no physical or verbal action which constituted a threat to the physical safety of Beck or the other officers.

57. At the time that Beck fired his weapon, Schultz had taken no physical or verbal action which constituted a threat to the physical safety of another person.

58. At the time that Beck fired his weapon, according to news reporting at the time, the majority of Georgia Tech’s police officers had not completed the Crisis Intervention training.

8

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 9 of 12

59. The steps taken by Georgia Tech to train its officers in Crisis Intervention Techniques were clearly insufficient to prevent Schultz’s death.

60. The failure to properly train its police officers in Crisis Intervention Techniques was the result of inaction and decisional failures which occurred well in advance of Schultz’ death.

61. The need for such training was well known within the law enforcement community.

62. Studies published years in advance of Schultz’s death estimated that “at least half” of all fatal police encounters involve persons with psychiatric disorders. Kelley Bouchard, “*Across Nation, Unsettling Acceptance When Mentally Ill in Crisis are Killed*,” Portland Press Herald, Dec. 9, 2012.

63. Once he was shot, Schultz did not die immediately.

64. Schultz endured pain and emotional harm in anticipation of his own death.

65. The death certificate declared, correctly, that Schultz’s death was caused by a gunshot wound to his torso.

66. Schultz was pronounced dead just after midnight on the morning of September 17, 2017.

9

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 10 of 12

67. Schultz’s death was the result of Georgia Tech’s and the State of Georgia’s failure over time to properly train their personnel to act in such a way as to prevent the exclusion of persons such as Scott Schultz from the safety to which all students were entitled on the campus of Georgia Tech.

68. As of the preparation of this Complaint, Plaintiffs have, through their counsel, repeatedly sought, without success, to obtain the investiga- tive records of Georgia Tech, of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, of the City of Atlanta, and the Office of the District Attorney of Fulton County, Georgia. The records sought include, but are not limited to, witness statements, photographic and auditory recordings, still photos, ballistics evidence, and physical evidence. None of those records have been produced.

69. As a result of the denial of access to the information contained within those files, Plaintiffs anticipate that an Amendment to this Complaint may be appropriate in the future.

CAUSES OF ACTION  
70. The actions of Tyler Austin Beck violated the constitutional right

of Scott Schultz to be free from unreasonable seizures as established by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Beck’s actions not only caused physical harm to Scott Schultz, they killed him.

10

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 11 of 12

71. The Board Of Regents Of The University System Of Georgia By And On Behalf Of Georgia Institute Of Technology is and has been at all relevant times the recipient of federal financial assistance. Part of that financial assistance has been used to fund the operations, construction and/or maintenance of Georgia Tech. By its actions or inactions, Georgia Tech denied Scott Schultz the equal access to the benefit of its services, programs or activities in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794 and the regulations promulgated thereto and in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and such denial is actionable through Title II of said Act.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
For and upon the foregoing, Plaintiffs pray that this Court:

a. Afford them a trial by jury as to all claims and issues for which a jury is available.

b. Award them all damages available to the Estate of Scott Schultz which are permitted by the laws of the State of Georgia and the laws of the United States – damages from each of the Defendants.

11

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 12 of 12

c. Award William Schultz and Lynne Schultz all damages which are available as a result of Scott Schultz’s wrongful death – damages from each of the Defendants.

d. Award the Plaintiffs such costs and attorneys’ fees as are available by operation of the laws of the State of Georgia and of the United States.

So submitted on this the 11th day of September, 2019.

For those how have taken this class (ISYE 3770) in the past, do you have any study guides / study tips / practice exams you could share with me. 

Our professor is a really nice guy, but he tends to teach very little in class, he likes to talk a lot and go on tangents about the most random things. Not gonna name him, but those who had his class probably know who I'm talking about.

We had very little notes and no lecture slides provided, I have the book but I feel it would help if I had some extra material to help out greatly.

I was definitely there a year ago, and I've spent 2019 getting deeper into open source, and would love to have a place to share this really awesome aspect of the software world with others! As far as structure goes, we'd probably have some open coding times weekly/biweekly for people to work on their projects, and maybe host a technical talk every month or so covering some aspect of open source software, either from a student or a local professional.

In Memoriam: Vamsi Konjeti,"Dear students, faculty and staff,


It is with great sadness that I write today to inform you of the passing of Vamsi Konjeti. a second-year student in Mechanical Engineering from Brentwood, Tennessee.


I met with Vamsi’s family earlier today to express our deepest condolences on behalf of the entire Tech community. The loss of a classmate and fellow member of our community is difficult for all of us, but especially for the students and faculty that knew Vamsi best. 


Counseling services have been offered to Vamsi’s roommates and close friends. Please remember that Georgia Tech offers multiple services and resources in support of the community, and I urge you to take advantage of the counseling services that are available. Grief counseling and mental health support for students is available through the Center for Assessment, Referral and Education (care.gatech.edu) on the first floor of the Smithgall Student Services (Flag) building from 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. throughout the week and after-hours by calling 404-894-2575. Staff and faculty may find support through the Employee Assistance Program at hwb.gatech.edu/eap. 


If you are in need of immediate assistance, you can also contact the Georgia Crisis &amp; Access Line at 1-800-715-4225 which is staffed with professional counselors 24 hours per day, every day, to assist those with urgent and emergency needs. 


Please take care of yourselves and each other and keep Vamsi's family in your thoughts.

Additionally, the parking map shows the entire structure as available for my parking with no distinction between top or bottom and no indication of meter pay.

THAT NONSENSE ASIDE: one of the parking tickets given to me alleges I parked in a completely different location, w29, more than a hundred meters from where I actually was. They included helpful photos of my car's position a football field away from where they said it was. Obviously I can't be charged for that, right? It didn't happen.

Wrong, the appealed got denied. Allegedly, by a ""jury of my peers"", heavily implied by PTS to me to be fellow students, but I sincerely doubt one of our own would fuck us over like that. Additionally, PTS told me that if my appeal got denied, I would have the option to plead my case to them in person. I see no such option for appeal online. How do I do this? Did they lie to me?

Yo my name ain’t Will but I see all 1100 got this email lmao,"Dear Will,
 
We apologize that an inadvertent mistake like this has negatively impacted you and other students and the broader community at Georgian Tech. We also want to assure you that Georgia Tech takes the security of our students’ information seriously and have convened an emergency response team to implement immediate corrective action and explore additional steps for student impacted by the data disclosure.
 
A staff member in our unit was attempting to send an invitation to approximately 1100 undergraduates to attend a lunch and learn event with one of our corporate partners who provide internships/coops/employment opportunities to our students. The staff member inadvertently/mistakenly attached the data file to the mass email invitation instead of the PDF flyer that provided the actual invitation to the event with date/time/location information.
 
President Cabrera has appointed Professor Raheem Beyah, Vice President of Interdisciplinary Research and expert in cybersecurity, to lead an effort to investigate existing vulnerabilities in data access across the Institute and implement whatever changes are necessary to deal with the most critical of them. Dr. Beyah will coordinate the work of the Office of Information Technology (OIT) and other administrative and academic units and will engage internal and external consultants as needed. He will report directly to the president. 
 
We have communicated information about this incident to affected students, faculty and staff via direct email and Daily Digest updates and we will continue to do so. To view our communications, visit https://news.gatech.edu/2019/11/07/tech-responds-student-data-disclosure .\
 
We will keep you informed about what we learn from our investigation of this incident and inform as to what additional improvements we intend to make to ensure student rights protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) are protected. In addition to notifying those impacted in the disclosure, Georgia Tech immediately reported the matter to the University System of Georgia and U.S. Department of Education. For more information, please visit https://legal.gatech.edu/ferpa .

Tips for Dealing with Long Tests?,"I do... ok in my classes and will score at or slightly above the average on most tests at Tech; in these situations, I usually take almost all the test time. However, every semester I have one or two tests in classes that tank my average due to their length.

 I am slow and methodical with my math, else I oft make mistakes confusing numbers. (For whatever reason, I will confuse 1-7, 3-9-8 a lot and will swap numbers 54 = 45). For example, I had a Simulation test that was long I did not finish. The average was a 70, but I scored a 50 on it! I also notice whenever tests are curved I do worse than when they are not compared to the average. I know it's my last year here and you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but are there any methods to use on my crib sheets or to speed up my mathematical work?

Locked classroom policy?,"Just wondering the rationale of why classrooms and meeting rooms are always locked when not in use, or at least on the weekends and hours outside of normal class times. I'm questioning this because on numerous occasions, I would have liked a nice study space, with normal chairs and tables at a usable height. However, there are not many great places to plop down and do a lot of work by yourself. A lot of would-be perfect places to study at Tech are ""collaborative spaces"" or locked without reservation. 

Living on West, I feel that half the space in willage is inconvenient for studying, whether it's because it's loud, there aren't good tables with the chairs, or because it's just designed to be a common space rather than having dedicated silent study space. The next closest options are Kendeda (which is BEAUTIFUL) or the student center. But once you go inside Kendeda you quickly realize study space is almost non-existent. There's a ton of potential space to be used, but the huge classrooms are locked when not in use, and the tiny student space is filled with fancy chairs and stools. The student center faces the same problems as willage, yet arguably worse.

I fear that, as Georgia Tech constructs new buildings and renovates old ones, they're putting too much of a focus on 'collaborative' spaces and making things appear modern and attractive. I'm hopeful for the new library renewal to provide a large amount of student space. (look at this!  [https://www.bnim.com/project/price-gilbert-and-crosland-tower-library-renewal](https://www.bnim.com/project/price-gilbert-and-crosland-tower-library-renewal) ). Honestly, I want something that resembles even one floor of Crosland, on West, that I can just grind out math at 11:58 p.m. without having to walk 15 minutes.

Anyone who lives in Modera Midtown or any apartment near campus?,"I am an OOS transfer and looking for a rental right now. Because my current school ends around on Dec 20th-ish, and considering that the first day of the class of GaTech is on Jan 6th (and FASET orientation is on Jan 3rd), I really have little time for a house hunting. It is nearly impossible for me to look at houses in person because it is 10+ hr driving from here. Also, I need to move everything with my two dogs, so I need an address to move stuff before I hire a mover.

So, I've been browsing Zillow and Trulia for rentals, and I narrrowed down to a few apartments, and then I checked reviews of each one of them on Yelp and I had to cross out everything because the reviews were so bad and it seemed like they were no place for living. But after crossing out those apts, I can't really find any other options :( 

So, I am trying to reconsider my lists... and if anyone is living near campus, any recommendation would be appreciated.

My budget is less than 2k/month, and what I am looking for is safe, quiet, smoke-free enivronment.

So my list included (No offense to anyone who lives here. I only know about these places from what I read online. they all have bad reviews on Yelp but I commented for those who have extremely bad reviews),
 
1. Baltimore at midtown(Yelp reviews were too horrible so I am not considering here at all)
2.  Modera midtown
3. Skyhouse midtown

College Republicans President just resigned over the impeachment inquiry,"Got this email:

Hello friends.

A week ago, the House of Representatives voted to formalize the process of impeaching the President. I was disappointed to see that not a single Republican voted in favor. While the Democrats’ approach to this process has been far from perfect, it has becomeabundantly clear that our President has unlawfully abused the trust placed in him via the office that he holds. His actions with respect to the ongoing scandal regarding his communications with the President of Ukraine are without explanation or excuse. An ever-increasing body of evidence indicates that our President has broken the law, and if someone claims to uphold the constitution, then the appropriate response is clear: these actions must be investigated, and the President must be held responsible.

I have always considered myself a Republican. My views on policy and governing principles have not changed during the course of this administration, even while the national party has contorted itself and abandoned some of its longest-standing principles toplacate its current leader in the White House. In fact, these principles – respect for our constitution, rule of law, and the belief that the President should be held to the highest ethical standards – are what led me to conclude that I must separate myself from the GOP and support the ongoing impeachment inquiry. It brings me no joy to break with a party that, for years, I have seen as holding the best solutions to so many political questions. It is clear, however, that the present-day national Republican Party, with few exceptions, cares more about defending the indefensible in an attempt to cling to their own power than pursuing truth and justice. This party has lost sight of the values that made it unique and has fallen into the trap of chasing the whims of one man who constantly lies, brings shame to our country, and defies our constitution. This is the same man who, when speaking of John McCain, said he prefers those who ""weren't captured"" despite his several deferments from duty. While Senator McCain sat in aVietcong prison cell, the President described avoiding contracting STDs as ""his own personal Vietnam."" The President’s term will come to an end – his leadership is temporary. However, the stains he has placed on the party he represents and the conservativemovement will be recorded forever in history. I sincerely hope that the mantle of Republican leadership one day returns to those who value honor, dignity, and conservative principles, but those currently at the helm of the Party seem to be charting a course towards a much darker future for the GOP.

Many people who share my views have stayed silent, hoping that soon enough the embarrassment of the current administration will blow over and we can pretend this presidency never happened. That is simply not possible – it is increasingly clear that continued silence is tantamount to complicity. Those of us who cannot abide by this President’s actions must make clear where we stand. The reluctance of the party to separate itself from its leader, or even to criticize him on his worst mistakes, shows that change from the inside is not currently possible. As such, I will be stepping down as Chairman of the College Republicans at Georgia Tech, effective immediately. If there is no tolerance for dissent and no appetite for following the law in the national GOP, I must respectfully part ways. I believe there is much good to be recovered from this political organization, but that is all it is – a political organization. It does not, and should not, dominate our lives. I, for one cannot support the actions of the current leaders of the party, and so I will be, for the time being, separating myself from their leadership.

The last two years we shared as a chapter were extraordinary in so many ways - no doubt in large part because of the many incredible people I’ve had the privilege of meeting through this organization. We more than doubled our membership and hosted many great leaders whom I still respect, including then-Secretary Brian Kemp. It is regrettable that my service must end in this way, but I simply could not allow the current leadership of the national party to speak for me anymore. I hope that in my time leading our chapter I have represented our shared principles and Georgia Tech well.

All the best and Go Jackets,

I am making this post in order to gauge interest in a club dedicated Gender Critical Feminism. Our mission for creating this club is to educate students about the realities of trans ideology and create an environment where actual women's concerns are taken seriously and proper solutions can be discussed. I have already met with some people who are interested and we have already come up with some demands for GT:    

* We demand that the Women's Resource Center be made available only to biological women.   
* We demand that GT block all sites that host pornographic or otherwise sexually explicit content. Additionally, all sexually explicit material e.g. movies, books, magazines, video games, etc. must be banned from campus, even electronic content. A community that normalizes porn is a community that disrespects women.    
* We demand that GT strictly enforce gender separation in campus restrooms and locker rooms. Men do not belong in women's restrooms, regardless of how they identify.   
* We demand that the CRC designate at least 4 hours a day as women-only hours (no TIMs). The CRC must take steps to ensure women's safety while working out.  
* We demand that GT scrub any pro-trans content on its website.  
* We demand that any planned or future drag/crossdressing shows be banned. These shows make a mockery out of femininity and encourage gender deviancy.   

These are just the demands that we have thought of so far. I hope we can have more discussions once this club starts.",1571264979,0,0

Dropping Corequisite,"Hey y'all, so spring classes came out today and looks like the original schedule I was planning on is going out the window.

However, after ECE 2031 this semester, I really don't want to take ECE 3043 in the spring (the corequisite for 3040), as I don't want two semesters ruined in a row due to time sink lab classes.

Looking for GA Tech students interested in music and emotion!,"Hi there! We the team at[ www.ensu.com](https://www.ensu.com/), are building an app related to music listening and emotions. The premise is that if you listen to Spotify, we can help you understand how your music listening correlates to mood / emotion states (specific for you), as well as giving you new insights around patterns in your moods and emotions over time.

We're a team of mental health passionate people who are all recently out of college, and we're looking to get input from Georgia Tech students (we're designing the app specifically for college students) on the concept and the app. We're still in beta so would appreciate y'all signingup and giving us feedback!

Dual Degree program or REPP?,"My son is currently in the dual degree program, pre-engineering, at Georgia College. If he stays on his current track, he'll finish at GC in the fall of 2020 and will then transfer to GT spring 2021 for a minimum 2 more years. However, he is now considering changing to the REPP program, which will (we think), have him eligible to transfer to GT after next semester and finish overall a bit more quickly. Unfortunately, his advisor has basically told him to ""do what he thinks best.""  I'm looking for a little more than that. One thing we're concerned with is his Zell Miller scholarship. With dual degree, his time in school is a minimum full year longer than Zell will pay for. Is anyone familiar with both programs that can give us some guidance as to which route is best?

The myth called achievement,"A significant percentage of the students at this school are truly struggling. It's not new and I'm glad people now feel safe enough to reach out to the community about it. I want to help, and this might be a message you **need** to hear.

If you're reading this as a fellow student, there's a good chance you've got a million things occupying your head at this very moment. Enough things to cloud judgement and distort thought. I'm asking you take a break from inside your head and zoom out to view your life from above.

What you might see is that you look like a point on a plane of the cartesian persuasion, located at what we call the present moment. It's got an infinite number of bumpy paths extending in all directions. Like... really bumpy--keep your arms and legs in the car at all times.

Every hill is a high in your life. Every valley is a low.

At our altitude, these might look small (not necessarily--I'm not trying to make light of tragedy). That embarrassing thing you did last week? Approximately every person except you forgot about it not even 10 seconds following. Got a job offer? You are a MF'ing G (I cannot emphasize this more, getting employed is the reason you *willingly* came to Tech!!). Same thing, though.

If you're like me, you have at *least* a few crippling insecurities. Times I've failed to perform. Making below average grades in my classes. Bombed every single one of my two phone screens this semester. I'm extremely into that girl, better play it cool and pretend like she doesn't exist (works every\* time). Is there a job ~~beyond retail~~ I'm... actually qualified for?

If you're like me, you probably want to change too. We all have an ideal image of ourselves we can visualize. Mine goes to sleep every night at a reasonable time, excited for the next day. Puts forth his best effort, in all things, irrespective of his emotional state. Has a 10.75 inch jimmy john... You get what I'm saying.

Let's call this ideal version of yourself Big-Dick-Energy-Chad-You (BDECY).

Why in the world do we all feel so rushed to reach this ideal? BDECY is mostly achievable. Look, I know 'Biggest-Dick-Icarus' (BDI) did it in 2 years while volunteering in Africa, but what does that have to do with you? It's possible you're a late bloomer and it'll be another 5 years? 10 years? 20? Who knows and who cares. It's entirely possible BDI had a helping hand, arm, *and* leg, or maybe not; It truly does not matter.

So your work hasn't impacted the lives of strangers yet. So not everyone likes you. So you've got noticeable flaws. So you've fallen way (waaaaaaaay) short of where you thought you'd be at this point in your life.

So... wait, why do we care about these things again?

If you're like me, your younger, ignorant self, often lauded as a (future) world-impactor, set up some self-expectations that don't make a whole lot of sense under closer scrutiny. 

**You've put all your self-worth eggs in the achievement basket.**

The truth is, it's an anomaly to drive up a steep mountain in the plane of reality and make it to the top without falling off and sustaining major trauma. Besides, once your altitude gets high, you have no choice but to keep moving up. *To stop is to fall all the way back down*. BDI is the one who's actually out of place. He will have to bust ass for the rest of his life just to *maintain* his position.

I'm going to challenge you to stop looking at paths leading up mountains and aim for something flatter. Look for a wide path rising slowly and steadily. Give yourself permission to fuck up. And be there to support yourself when it inevitably happens.

Don't totally let go of BDECY, but rather realize you may never reach that ideal, nor should you feel pressured to. Realize that BDI is exposing himself to a *dangerous* way of life. A way of life taking him to a summit, alone. **Any path that puts you above everyone else, by definition, leaves you there on your own.**

Now zoom back into the close view of your life. Take stock of your surroundings. Stop looking directly down or directly up. Instead look at the horizon and find a gentle slope leading up, but advance slowly, deliberately. You've got plenty of time to gain momentum before hitting the gas.

Determine your success, not based off of where you are, but based off of any small thing you did this day/week/month/year that moved you ever so slightly towards your ideal self. **Something that's trivial to everyone else might be huge for you.** And give yourself a pat on the back. You've made it this far.

**tl;dr: Stop focusing on who you think you should have been by now. Instead, pay attention to whether or not you're moving in a positive direction. Achievement is not a sustainable source of self-worth. When you let go of the need to be special, it will free you.**",1571197555,160,0

I am disappointed in myself.,"I am a freshman cs major. I only barely got into this school (waitlisted) and I am very happy that I made it in. This is my second semester. I did fine over the summer but I'm finding fall semester so much more difficult. High school barely took any effort for me. I did study and do all my homework, but nothing in high school was ever hard. Now that I'm halfway through my second semester I feel like I've lost all my drive and I'm just a below average student who shouldn't even be here. I'm taking 4 classes and doing fine in three of them, but I got a 40 my first calculus test a few weeks ago and I feel like such an idiot. I understood the concepts, I just was too anxious to study. I don't even know how to study, because I've never taken a hard class before. I don't know what to do, I don't have any self-discipline left because I'm always exhausted and I've skipped class many times. I need some kind of structure to follow, but I know I'm an adult now who's expected to be able to take care of myself. I keep slipping into depression and wanting to give up. I feel like this situation isn't uncommon for students but I still feel so alone when everyone around me seems to already be so skilled at working hard studying and resisting distractions. I'm so disappointed that I went from the top of my class in my tiny high school to someone who's struggling to manage with only 12 credit hours. I went to the counseling center and they told me to leave and go find help somewhere else. I don't know where else to go. Was anyone else in a similar situation freshman year? What did you do? I don't want to sound so dramatic over one bad test, by feel like I'm already so deep in mediocrity it's impossible to improve myself. I really don't want to give up though, I love computer science and I'm proud to be a tech student. Where can I find help? What can I do? Sorry for the long post, I just really want to not feel so alone.",1571193688,54,0

Reusing passwords, that's no fun…

This makes it easy for hacker bums.

Here at cyber we want to relay,

Some password tips to keep the spooks away!

&amp;#x200B;

\- Use a password manager application. You only need to remember one password and the application will create unique, complex and long passwords for every website.

\- Never use the same password on multiple sites, a password manager will help you with this!

\- Avoid passwords based on a dictionary word or something about you. A password manager will ALSO help you with this, awesome!

\- Enable multi-factor authentication on any site that has it available.

ECE Courses,"I've been through this thread and asked in the mega-registration thread already but still wasn't sure:

How is this currents schedule for Spring as an EE:

ECE 2035 - Linda Wills

MATH 2551 - Undecided (Hao Liu, Shuenn, Lubinsky but 8AMs tho)

(1) I was going to originally put ECE 2031 in place of MATH 2551 and take multi. over SOUP but have been advised by several people against it, especially with 2026. But I kinda want 2031 to be able to take 3040 in Fall 2020. Thoughts?

(2) Still undecided between 2035 and 2036. 2036 seems more fun with more usage of the mbed kit but at the same time, I've heard I wouldn't learn much at all especially having taken CS1331 and am planning to take ECE 4180 in the future anyway. Aside from C/Assembly vs. C++, what other content differences are there in the two courses and for those of you already familiar with Object-Oriented Programming, do you feel like you gained anything from the 2036?

Tech Campus is about to become a Surveillance Valley,"Our professor just got done talking about what his research is about and where its headed. One of the things that's part of his research is helping GTPD turn all the cameras on campus into a mesh network, so that they can track all the cars.

With little modding (*if this isn't already integrated but they aren't telling us*) they could add **facial recognition tracking**.

The camera network will be able to log the precise time and location a vehicle was spotted *(as their police cruisers already do, those are the camera looking things on the back of their cars)*, how long before they map every face to a time and location on campus?

There's a reason why [San Francisco banned facial recognition](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco.html), and [Atlanta is one of the leading cities in the US at camera](https://atlanta.curbed.com/2019/8/21/20825981/atlanta-big-brother-cctv-camera-surveillance) surveillance, how long before our campus / our city turns into a level of facial recognition that China has?

HS SENIOR!!!
Now that 90% have clicked off already, for the general population left who are kind, can you answer this quick question.

 Would you say most of your classmates when you started off freshman year knew about engineering? Like I’m talking beyond the basic chem and physics. Like will they expect us to know anything from high school about like electrical or mechanical engineering. BTW I’m looking to pursue CS and have some coding experience. So my second question is, since this college is full of geniuses, were most students already gods at coding? Please estimate but let me know, cause if everyone already knows a lot I am screwed to say the least",1572404292,0,0

[Exchange] How exams work in Georgia Tech,"Hi, my friends and I will be coming to GT as exchanges students (ECE) in Spring 2020. We are working on course matching now but the final exam/matrix is quite confusing. It would be great if someone can help to explain to us how it works (or link a document).

Here are some questions

* If the same module has multiple sessions, each with different exam date on the matrix, does it mean that this module has different groups of people sitting for the same paper at different dates and times?
* How do I tell which module has/doesn't have an exam? e.g. ECE 2045 doesn't have exam while ECE 2035 have even though both are quite similar(?) in nature. The course catalogue doesn't always explicitly state whether the module has a final and how the weights are like for the assessments.

international student confused about CPT,"I really wanna get an internship over the next summer and I was planning on applying to as many companies I could find online. I was told by several different people that I should try to use CPT as it’d be good to have all of OPT left when I graduate in 2022. The thing is I did a lot of research and I’m still confused af on how they work especially here at Tech.

First of all, is it actually true that I should go for CPT? I read that the internship would need to count towards my degree, so I should register it through C2D2. But what does that even mean?? So do I get credit counted as electives or something? Does that imply I couldn’t get paid? Also, about the whole process: do I just apply to companies and then after I get an offer I apply for CPT at Tech? Is that how it works?

Another thing: I was told that the companies wouldn’t need to sponsor me since I’m a sophomore and it would be just an internship with extremely low chances of them offering me a full job after I graduate. Is that true? If anyone can answer any of the questions that’d be great! Also any advice you have on what I should do (like CPT or OPT) would be greatly appreciated... thanks!!

Stressed? Brain feels like mush from studying? The idea of spending 5 days with your family a bit daunting? Try LARPing!,"LARPing is Live Action Play Playing - like any RPG, except instead of sitting in a dark room lit only by your 30"" monitor, you play outside and hit nerds with sticks. Its an incredibly cathartic release, not to mention all the benefits of physical exercise on your brain and grades and the like.  

[Xadune](https://xadune.com/) is a Victorian Gaslamp LARP centered in Atlanta.  It is lightest-touch combat, roleplay heavy, and extremely new-player and new-LARPer friendly.  We are hosting their next game November 29th - December 1st at Indian Springs State Park.  Just an hour south of Tech on 75, it provides the perfect (temporary) escape from finals, essays, and overbearing family members who insist that you are *so smart,* so you'll be just fine on your finals. You can come by for the whole event, or part of it, or whatever you like, but I assure you you'll have a great time. 

Best of all? Trying the game out is free! If you come out to be a 'Monster' - where you get to play the various villains, antagonists, and crunchies the players are pitted against, admission is free! We will provide you with all the costuming and weapons needed to play, as well as run you through the rules and safety instructions.  Just bring comfy shoes and warm clothes. 

If you really like the idea of LARPing and want to play as a Player Character, show your Buzzcard at Check-In to get $10 off admission.  

Xadune really helped me when I was at Tech.  I was, as many are, overwhelmed by the workload and I would get caught in a spiral of *I have to do more*. Taking a break from academic things, getting some fresh air and exercise, and making friends outside of Tech really helped me be able to focus on my schoolwork when I got back.  I probably wouldn't have graduated if I hadn't have found LARPing, just because having a not-Tech-focused hobby kept me sane.

Exempt CS 1331 if you did well in CS 1316?,"Title. I'm a CompE transfer student looking to declare a CS minor.

While looking into exactly what CS 1316 satisfies I stumbled across [this PowerPoint](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2009/cs1316_summer/presentations/CS1316-where_it_fits.pdf) claiming that ""A student with strong performance in CS 1316
can jump directly to CS 1332."" I passed my CS 1302 with a (high) A.

I'm a first year currently in freshman housing. I was wondering everyone's thoughts and experiences  living off campus, likely in home park, or in Harris. Next year, I'm thinking that NAV/on campus apartments and most of the other typical apartments near Tech would be too much.

Here are the main questions I have:

* Do not plan on buying any meal plan next year, so will likely need to cook in some in kitchen
   * Can you even do this in Harris? And if so, how inconvenient is it?
* How much can I realistically expect to spend on a room in Home Park?
   * I was estimating $600-700 including utilities. Is this realistic?
   * Could I potentially sublease during the summer if I intern elsewhere for 80% or so, or is that too optimistic?
* How do the communities compare?

Currently I have a 4.3 gpa and I hope to keep that through the next semester. I plan on taking Calc 3, Linear Algebra, Chem 1212K, Span 1002, and Online Nursing's 2010 for the spring year. Rough estimate of credit hours completed by Spring 2020 is 69 or 70 hrs. I have a couple of questions regarding the transfer process.

1. How are my chances looking? 
2. How difficult is it to transfer into the EE program at GT?
3. The workload at Gsu is pretty chill. How much of a workload increase should I expect?

Transfer question,"So I am looking to apply to transfer to tech for summer. Right now I am a computer engineering major at UGA. To transfer as a computer engineering major to tech, I need chem 1, which I never took, so I am applying as a CS major. For the CS major, I need 2 consecutive lab science electives, ex. Phys 1 with lab and Phys 2 with lab. I took Phys 1 with lab, but due to scheduling conflicts, I had to take a different version of physics 2 at UGA which didn’t have a dedicated lab section, and was only 3 hours as opposed to 4. Technically, it doesn’t count as physics 2 at tech, it counts as a physics elective. My question is, should I still apply, as they might take this into consideration and still give me a chance? The application has a section which allows you to explain certain course selections and why you took them. Would they offer conditional acceptances also? I was thinking about just applying for the computer engineering major but thought I might have a better chance at the CS major. Please only legitimate and serious answers, thanks.",1577648505,1,0
Is it worth it to pursue a minor or double-major?,"Hello! I'm currently a third-year CS major and have lately been thinking about pursuing a minor or double major. I was thinking about doing another hard science like Chemistry or BME(leaning more on BME). The thing is that I have almost no clue on the difficulty of these programs but more importantly, don't even know if it would be worth pursuing. I've had a few internships that were all in enterprise or business software and have been feeling sick of it so I thought that minoring or double majoring in one of these would allow me to specialize in software tailored to biotech or maybe even try and do something completely different like premed or research. I think I've just been in a very doubtful phase in regards to my future.

I'm also worried about my graduation time. As of now, I am due to already graduate a semester late and since I haven't even started the BME track, I'd have to start with GenChem and GenBio. This means that my graduation time would be pushed back a full year or even more. At this point, is it even worth it for me to try this? How difficult would it be and would it be? Would the end result be worth it on my diploma?

Stallworth vs Kantwon for CS 1371,"Hey guys, I'm trying to compare both professors for CS 1371 and had a quick question. I know everybody says to take Kantwon (he has a 70% A rate) over all of the other professors (next highest is Stallworth with 33%). If the tests are the same, why is there such a large difference in A rates? One of my friends even said that Kantwon's lecturers/notes are posted online.

Thanks and sorry if this is a dumb question. I looked through previous posts and nobody really addressed what the difference was, just that Kantwon is crazy good.",1577219353,1,0

Transferring into Georgia Tech,"Hi! 

I'm a freshman in another university (not going to say unless it's important which it may very well be) and I've been thinking about transferring into Georgia Tech.

I saw on the website that applications open January 15th, and that historically the acceptance rate isn't that high for transfer students. 

People in gatech that have transferred into this school, is there anything special I should know? What is the application like? Are there any important people I can talk to? Or is it just another high school to college application? 

I'm also interested in how good of a chance I have at transferring but I don't feel like spewing my stats here as of yet. If there's any kind soul in this subreddit that has enough spare time to PM me about the process I'd greatly appreciate it.

Georgia Tech was my dream school in high school, and it is still my dream school; any help would be greatly appreciated.

Immunizations question for a transfer to ATL from GTL,"If anyone has any experience with this recently or currently and can answer these questions, I would be so so grateful! I have called multiple numbers and left multiple voicemails, and have emailed and got an unhelpful auto reply. I just got back from GTL in France, and tbe transfer was late notice so it's been a bit of a rush. I only saw the immunizations come up on my housing contract and realized I needed to do this to be in Atlanta. 

My immunizations are incomplete only for the varicella and meningococcal vaccines. The first I have History (not accepted) and the second was apparently waived when I went to my undergrad school. I don't know why I never got this one. 

My questions are (based on what I can accomplish without having to spend $300 to get these vaccines):

1. GT accepts a titer for varicella, but it might be as late as January 10th when I get the results . Does anyone know if they let someone start on campus conditionally until their record is complete?

2. On the form it says that the meningococcal vaccines is required for all students under 22. It doesn't say ""only"" though, making me wonder if it is okay to not have this vaccine, as I am over 22.

Any experience and help would be appreciated!",1576996402,1,0

A PSA about tomorrow's Syracuse game,"GT MBB plays Syracuse tomorrow at noon, and playing Syracuse at home comes with slightly different expectations than other games. Namely, airball.

If you're not familiar with the chant, when you're in the crowd and the opposing player completely misses the rim/backboard with a shot, that's an airball, and you're supposed to remind him of it every single time he has the ball defensively, by chanting ""Airball"" at him. 

We did this to Syracuse about two years ago and it completely shut down one of their starters - John Gillon went 2-10 from the field and 1-7 from three and finished the game with just 7 points. [Some Syracuse fan got so fed up with the airball chants that he called Josh Pastner to complain.](https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/cuse-fan-complains-about-air-ball-chant-georgia-tech-coach-phones-him-back/) Pastner's response was to have [Air-ball t-shirts](https://twitter.com/GTAthletics/status/958469608826179584?s=19) in advance of their next home game against the Orange.

So, what does this mean? Saturday, bring a lot of energy, an airball t-shirt if you have it, and get ready to hound whichever poor soul from Syracuse dares to airball first with the chants. Saturday, noon, McCamish, be there!",1575654201,1,0
Can we have a lab due during finals?,"One of my professors made our last lab due on December 12th, right at the end of finals, I believe.  Some students have complained about it being due during finals.  The professor wrote:                     

&gt; There has been a concern raised about the fact that the final assignment (Lab 10) is due during the final exam period.  I just wanted to reassure everyone that this is clearly within the rules because it is given in lieu of a final exam.  The GT rules state ""No assessment other than a final examination or its replacement may be due during the Final Examination Period.""  This assignment is considered as a replacement for the final exam.

&gt; Best of luck on Lab 10 and hope you enjoyed the course.

Judging by rule [12.D.1](http://catalog.gatech.edu/rules/12/), wouldn't this have to be on our syllabus to be valid?

HELP! Made bad choices and might be kicked out,"I desperately would like some advice as a grad student.

I'm counting these two subjects as Cs since I'm a bit below average. Thus my GPA becomes 4+2+2/3 = 2.66. Gatech's academic probation warning is 2.7 for masters students.

Now's a good time to review Institute exam and reading day policies.,"If something feels unfair about any outstanding class assignments or your final exams, now's a great time to familiarize yourself with the Institute Exam and Reading Day policies. The policies apply to both undergrad and grad classes and are taken seriously by administration.  If, after reading them, you believe there is a serious violation, talk to the professor and/or submit a grievance. Response times for end-of-semester grievances are typically very fast. Ask specifically for anonymity if it's important to you. 

I don't want to encourage complaining for the sake of complaining, but if you are truly being treated unfairly and in a manner inconsistent with these policies, know that there are people dedicated to making things right for you and your classmates. Instructors need to play by the rules as well.

Find the new Under the Couch and I'll give you money,"Hello! It's me, your friendly university Musician's Network president (until spring semester at least)!

Under the Couch is a student run arts space and music venue. It is the home of Musician's Network and its shows, and MN helps put on shows and events for many other organizations and departments within the space. During the daytime it serves as a relaxing public lounge with music and ~atmosphere~. There are also practice spaces and a studio. 

I don't know how many of you remember or were previously informed, but Under the Couch will be going down with the upcoming Student Center demolition in May 2020, and there are no plans for a new one to be built when the new Campus Center is constructed. Only the Musician's Network practice spaces and studio will remain. 

This, however, does not have to be the end of student-run arts space on campus.

After a meeting with VP of Campus Services Kasey Helton,  Senior Director of the Student Center Lindsay Bryant, and Undergraduate Student Body President Pooja Juvekar, Musician's Network is now looking for alternative locations around campus to serve as a location for a new Under the Couch.

There are a few wants/needs that would make a location suitable:

* Ability to accommodate 50+ persons at capacity
* Ability to install a sound system (big speakers/equipment and sound booth)
* Ability to be loud and play amplified music
* Space to install a stage and lighting
* Space to store equipment
* Easy access for patrons and load-in
* Bathroom Access
* Space to function as a daytime lounge
* Visibility 

Not all of these necessarily need to be met, but the more the better


We have a few ideas so far. Some are just shots in the dark/completely off the wall, and that's fine. We're brainstorming now and we'll look into further feasibility in the future.

* Living Learning Communities room near the wing zone
* Woody's Food Court
* Second Floor of Barnes and Noble
* Rec Tech space on East Campus
* Rent a storefront in Tech Square 
* Somewhere near the football stadium??
* Somewhere around the biotech quad??
* Somewhere at the Bill Moore Student Success Center??
* Biltmore Building Basement?? 
* Dalney Parking Deck??

So not all of these are overseen by Campus Services. The easiest solution would likely be under them but starting a conversation with a different department could also be possible.


ANYHOW

If you have any good ideas about underused spaces on campus that could suit our needs, I want to hear them!! I'll venmo $5 for every good, unique suggestion (this is me personally, not the club or any other gt organization). Thank you for your help!

GTRI is conveniently located on campus (minus the Cobb County Research Facility in Smyrna) and hires many Tech students every year. The URIP is a 10 week summer internship, where students work 40 hours a week and get paid upwards of $20 an hour to work on a project outlined by a GTRI Researcher.  

You can apply to as many projects as you want at [https://urip.gtri.gatech.edu](https://urip.gtri.gatech.edu) by the deadline of January 17th, and update your project preferences by January 28th, then offer letters go out February 3rd-7th for students that have been chosen. You can see all of the projects as well as some FAQs and the timeline at the link above. I was also an intern this past summer, and I still work there part-time now, so I’m able to answer any questions you may have about GTRI or the URIP specifically.

Getting a job in Atlanta,"Hi guys, 

First of all, congrats on finishing up this semester!

Long story short, I failed all the interviews for the positions with Atlanta firms/ offices of big firms in Atlanta. Now I have only one onsite interview on hand which is out-of-state. I really need to get a job in Atlanta since I just got married and my spouse has a good job here.

I don’t know if it’s just me but I do have difficulty in getting jobs here. Will defend my thesis and graduate in spring so now I am really worried. Can anyone give me some tips about how to get a job in Atlanta? 

My background is more on statistics and finance, and I minored in computer science. 
I have internship experiences with local healthcare firms. Any guidance will be appreciated.

An open letter to the Georgia Tech Marching Band,"Dear friends:
As you know, this was my last season with the Yellow Jacket Marching Band.  But as I leave, here are some final remarks for the rest of y'all.

This season definitely was not the most ideal on many fronts.  Losing the right to play chords for a good portion of the home schedule.  Losing to an FCS school.  More frustrating losses.  And of course, the band's ongoing struggle with marketing.  But despite that, y'all still did a great job this season!  Y'all brought the energy every game from kickoff to the last whistle regardless of the score.  You supported the team through thick and thin with passion, honor, grace, and valor.  And you performed a kick-ass halftime show that paid tribute to the music of this great city!  And through it all, I was proud to serve alongside you one last time!

Which is why I implore you: never let that spirit die!  This season's team was young and scrappy, but raw and unrefined.  And despite the talent on the roster there was a lot of unrefined, raw, and at times undisciplined football.  But there was also a team that kept fighting and never gave in regardless of the score.  To me, what I saw was a team that had bought into Geoff Collins's effort-based culture: the first step in a deep rebuild.  And it is my belief that eventually that effort and grit and tenacity is going to translate into winning seasons.  Perhaps sooner than anyone anticipates.

That aside, there is one critical reason you cannot let that spirit die.  Together, the Georgia Tech Band, Goldrush, Color Guard, and Cheer, represent the loudest, proudest, and most passionate group in the entire Georgia Tech fanbase.  You are at the front lines of cheering for this team and you have to shoulder that responsibility every game.  Whether that's on the field, in the stands, or outside the stadium before games, you have one responsibility on game days: to lead and to set the example.
May that be your cry.  And may you all do it together as a family week in and week out.
Empower those men on the football team to do what they came here to do.  And that wasn't to play around.  It was to take care of business.  And fight.  And win!

WE GONNA FIGHT
TILL WE CAN'T FIGHT NO MORE!!
GONNA LIE DOWN AND BLEED AWHILE,
THEN WE GONNA GET UP AND FIGHT SOME MORE!!!

GT undergraduate applicant query,"Dear Yellow Jackets,

Congrats on the finish of the finals. Merry Christmas and happy break.

Need advice for two of my ""potential freshman"" friends

Background

Both of them have visited GT and love the ambiance and students body. Both of them have excellent standardized testing  scores, will be their class's valedictorian or salutatorian, have decent ECs and both of them are OOS (full fees).

Candidate A

Wants to definitely become a Doctor so Med school it is. He is super keen to come to GT but parents and friends are warning about grade deflation and high pressure at GT. The general advice given to him is to land up at one of the smaller Ivys, relatively chill, collect the 4.0/4.0 and move on to Med school. So the question is whether Med schools/Grad schools recognize that GT is much more harder than your typical Ivy in terms of grade deflation and rigor of curriculum. Other things being equal(hard work motivation etc.), Will a say 3.6 at GT be ranked superior than say a 3.9 from Brown. 

Please, the aim is not to disparage GT or Ivys but realistically figure out the trade offs. ( [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/20/why-grade-inflation-even-at-harvard-is-a-big-problem/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/20/why-grade-inflation-even-at-harvard-is-a-big-problem/)  or   [https://www.studentsreview.com/viewprofile.php3?k=1230783522&amp;u=331](https://www.studentsreview.com/viewprofile.php3?k=1230783522&amp;u=331) ).  

&amp;#x200B;

Candidate B 

Is super keen to  join GT. She is from Florida, has a number of relatives and friends in Georgia. She has allergy issues in minus zero weather (realizes that she will be miserable in cold weather Ivys) and loves hot and humid Hotlanta. Candidate has \~&gt; 75% percentile credentials.  Off-late GT has started deferring over qualified candidates in order to yield protect. Early application is already done. Candidate B wants your advice on what to do from now till Jan 18 (results date) to tell the admissions team that she is super keen and will definitely join if given a chance (please please), please don't deffer or reject thinking that the candidate will go off to Ivys instead of coming to GT.

Thank you",1576414511,1,0
The 2004 Humanitarian Bowl (Georgia Tech vs. Tulsa): The largest weight disparity between school mascots,"At first glance, the [2004 Humanitarian Bowl](https://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=240030202), a relatively obscure bowl game in Boise, was a fairly uninteresting, lopsided game between two wholly average programs. The Yellow Jackets took an early lead in the first quarter and enjoyed a 10-3 lead at halftime; the second half was a perfect storm of explosive offense and unforgiving defense in which Tech scored 42 points while only allowing the Golden Hurricane a single touchdown. Tech stymied Tulsa's run game, holding them to -56 (*yes, that's a negative*) yards--Tulsa's worst-ever rushing performance in the 125-year history of their football program. 

This matchup was the most recent of the [three](http://www.winsipedia.com/tulsa/vs/georgia-tech) between the two storied institutions (the previous two occurred in 1944 and 1945, with a Tech and Tulsa win, respectively). These programs have only met at bowl games and have no particular bad blood between one another off the field; however, these three games were the only occasion in which the **heaviest mascot in FBS football (the Golden Hurricane) competed against the lightest (the Yellow Jacket**).

An [SBNation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obtRtrk42a8) places the weight of a single yellow jacket at 0.0001 lbs and (perhaps very unscientifically) estimates the weight of an entire hurricane made of gold to be 1,182,000,000,000 lbs. This mascot weight differential of 1,181,999,999,999.9999 pounds is the largest that has and will ever occur in an FBS football game until a university with a lighter or heavier mascot joins the division or until an existing school adopts a new, unconventional mascot. 

I don't know when Georgia Tech will play Tulsa again. Perhaps there will be another 65-year hiatus. But I hope not. Personally, I would love to cheer on our tiny mascot against its behemoth counterparts and will be watching intently next time Tech's and Tulsa's paths cross.",1576385889,1,0

Dual Degree + Co-op ???,"I am a tech legacy (both my parents went), so I'm planning on taking advantage of the conditional transfer pathway to transfer fall 2020 as an AE and am interested in doubling that with business administration and a minor in Physics. After I get there, in order to ease the financial burden, I was planning on co-oping as soon as I could (spring or summer semester). *I'm aware this path is a long and bumpy road...* Luckily I am able to fulfill all of the conditional transfer requirements at my local community college.

Anyway, today I found out about the Dual Degree program that has a partnership with Emory (among other schools). I think a business degree from Emory would be extremely valuable so that made the Dual Degree path interesting to me. A few questions:

1. How does a business degree from Emory stack up to a business degree from Tech (if I was to try and double major)? Emory is ranked 15 on US News and Reporting while Tech is ranked 21. Is is worth it to pursue Emory?
2. Is it possible to co-op after transferring from Emory as a part of the dual degree? I'm sure it's uncommon since you're already doing so much with the getting a second degree from a second institution but do they let you?
3. Is it ever ""too late"" to co-op? If I decide to transfer to Tech next fall, I'll be a sophomore and if I don't land a job that year, I'll be stuck as a Junior trying to co-op. 
4. Are you able to add a minor at Tech with the dual degree as well?

I'm going to do some more reading and call an adviser at Tech tomorrow but any insight is welcome.

Tovey or not Tovey: Struggling ISyE student needs advice,"I am just coming off a rough semester where despite studying my ass of I will probably get at the very most a low C in Math 2551 and 2027.

Next semester I plan to take Math 2603 with Jing Hao and ISyE 3232 with Craig Tovey.


The issue is that Jing Hao is fairly new and from what I have heard about her she is terrible and her class is very hard.
I think my Multivariable Calculus class this semester was bullshit and the final was unnecessarily hard and I am tired of taking bullshit math classes that profesors make unneccessarily hard. Since this is her first semester at Tech I don't know if she curves grades or if the majority of students get terrible grades.

For anyone who took Jing this semester, should I drop or is a B possible with decent effort ?


Now onto Craig Tovey. Reading his rate my professor makes it seem like he is a nightmare professor.  He has been at Tech for over 20 years and on course critique some of his classes have extremely low GPA's( as low 1.83). However for 3232 his GPA seems kind of decent but has up to 20% of students withdraw from the class possibly inflating the GPA.



I have had a rough semester and I want some kind of relief. I am willing to work hard but I don't want a class where I have to give an A level effort and just spend the entire semester stressing just to pass.

I don't need to take either class next semester but in doing so I would be progressing in my degree. Tovey is not the only professor teaching 3232 but all the other ones are full and the waitlist are also almost full. Apparently Jing Hao is the only one teaching 2603 next semesrer.


Anyone who just took Jing Hao for 2603 or Tovey for 3232 should I drop either of these classes and wait a semester to hopefully take it with a better professor ?


Or is a B achievable with hard but not over the top work ?",1576288373,1,0

Tax time coming up: Important things to remember,"As an American citizen, I love paying taxes, but as a person who requires money, I love tax refunds even more. Here's some quick reminders for college students:

1. If you receive a W-2, you MUST fill out a tax form. Generally go to Turbotax or H&amp;R Block online unless you have a very special situation
2. If you worked in multiple states, you must pay taxes based on where you worked. In RARE occasions, you may also have to pay taxes based on where you lived.
3. You may only claim yourself as a dependent if no one else can. Figure this out with your parents.
4. If you are an immigrant and by some miracle (praise God) got a job in the US, you must pay US taxes.
5. Room and Board are generally not eligible for deductions and credits like Tuition and Fees.
6. The American Opportunity Tax Credit is a Godsend. Claim it if you can, and make sure you are eligible. It goes up to 2500 dollars in tax credits.
7. You can only receive the American Opportunity Tax Credit for four years of post-high school. It is a credit not a deduction meaning that it reduces tax burden, not taxable income.
8. As a Graduate student, you may be eligible for the Lifetime Opportunity Tax Credit. If you started Grad school in the fall of your fourth year, you may still be eligible for the American Opportunity Tax Credit. The American Opportunity Tax Credit can provide a refund of up to 1000 in some circumstances and is usually the better bet if you can take it if you don't earn much income.
9. Keep your T1098. Forward to your parents if necessary.
10. Keep track of unreimbursed Medical expenses and be sure to deduct them if they are eligible.
11. Fellowships are income if they surpass eligible expenses. Make sure to keep tabs on Fellowships earned and have enough to potentially pay taxes on them.
12. You may be required to fill out a paper form for special tax purposes (Like working in multiple states.)
13. The American Opportunity Tax credit cannot be used for expenses not required by the institute, but the Lifetime Opportunity Tax Credit can. Keep track of books you buy even if not for school.
14. Georgia Tech REQUIRES a computer as a condition of enrollment according to the student handbook. This means that a computer does qualify as an expense for the purposes of the American Opportunity Tax Credit as the university require it.
15. If you worked as a waitress, waiter, or contractor, your tips or payments ARE income and you may have to pay taxes based on what you earned. You likely won't get a refund in this situation and may end up owing.
16. If you have any investments or a interest bearing money market or sweep accounts, you may be required to pay taxes on capital gains or dividends regardless of whether you took money out. In the future, consider a Roth IRA.
17. Cryptocurrency gains are taxable. Consult Turbotax for more on this one and as always HODL. 
18. It's better to hire an accountant than to go to jail. Be especially cognizant if you started a small business this year.
19. Being married changes the tax rules, keep this in mind if you got married (Congrats!)
20. If your employer is paying for part of your tuition, this will decrease eligibility for credits.
21. If you are an older student with a low income and fit certain rules, you may be eligible for the earned income tax credit. Ask Turbotax.
22. I think that's it. Correct me or ask questions if you have them.
23. THwG and congrats on finals. Thanks for reading.

W's Effect on PhD Admissions?,"Hey guys! So in the Spring, I took a W in a class that's somewhat related to my major, but not a requirement. I originally took the class since it was a prerequisite for a major I was originally thinking of switching into. I was doing well in the class, but I realized I wasn't really interested in the subject and wanted to focus on my newfound passion for my original major. Fast forward seven months and I'm thinking of dropping another class this semester that's completely unrelated to my major. Due to scheduling conflict in Phase II, I didn't end up with all the classes I wanted and had to take a humanities course that I expected to be not too difficult and somewhat fun. However, two weeks into the class I realized it has a very heavy workload (essays every week - I didn't know this since I wasn't even registered for the class on syllabus day) and the subject is so boring to the point that I fall asleep every other class. I would much rather spend my time with major classes, research, or just getting exercise hours in.

Problem is it's always a dream of mine to be a professor and going into academia. How much will PhD programs here at Tech (or similar schools) care if I have these two W's on my transcript? I've been reading posts about this and I'm getting mixed results; some say they won't care at all and others say it may hurt. I know graduate schools care more about experience, recommendation letters, GPA, and GRE, but it seems like with the exception of a high GPA, I don't have a particularly strong application compared with other students here. Will having two W's hurt my chances even more in this case and destroy my dreams? Any input is much appreciated, thanks in advance!",1568996918,4,0

Is Calc BC Necessary for Wharton?,"(I posted this to a2c but didn’t get any responses so I’m posting here too)

I'm a junior from Canada in the IB Diploma Program at my school. My school (along with all IB schools in my city) doesn't offer IB Math HL, so I have to take IB Math Analysis SL (pretty much the equivalent of AP Calc AB). My top choice school is Wharton, and the dean of admissions at Penn recently posted [this](https://www.page217.org/ib-curricular-changes/) on his blog, which, in short, explains that Math Analysis HL is the best option for applicants in the IB program, and that Math Analysis HL ""would not be \[their\] first preference for students interested in business.""

I understand that colleges tend not to penalize students for not taking a class because it not available at their school, but I am able to self study and take the AP Calculus BC exam (but not take the class) at another school in my area. Would this increase my chances at all and make up for not being able to take a rigorous math course? I am sure I can handle all of the contents of AP Calc BC (and likely score a 5), but if it would make no difference to my application, I would probably rather spend the time that I would use studying for that exam by studying for my other classes and doing extracurriculars. If I were to take the exam, I would probably want to do so this year so that I am less busy next year. I am just a bit worried because I don't want to be at a disadvantage as a result of not being able to take the class.

TL;DR: Will self studying AP Calc BC (which is not offered at my school) help my application to Wharton, or is it not worth the effort?",1568811093,1,0

"I need to give it up, right?","Hi everyone, Penn has been my dream school for about three years. I applied to Penn right out of high school with subpar grades and essays. I applied at the last minute because I didn't think I would even want to go to Penn, but after I submitted my application, I researched Penn more and I realized Penn would be a great fit for me. I regret my decision to submit a half-assed application in high school.

During my freshman year in college, I went in trying to enjoy my college experience, but I realized my school isn't really the best school for me for a variety of reasons. I ended up deciding to apply to Penn and one other school to transfer during the second semester of my freshman year. Unfortunately, I was rejected again from both schools because I'm an idiot and I procrastinated on my essays. My essays ended up being garbage because of my procrastination but also because I didn't know how to articulate what I wanted to gain from transferring. A friend read one of my essays and told me he couldn't even decipher why I wanted to transfer! However, this time around, my grades were much better -- near 4.0 in hard classes like calculus 3 and statistics and stuff.

However, despite receiving two rejections, I think I still wanna apply to Penn one last time as a junior transfer. Over the past couple of months, I've been reflecting on what I want out of college and I finally think I'm able to put it into words. 

At my current school, my social life is stunted. I currently go to a school that is dominated by greek life; something like 40% of undergrads are affiliated. I don't have a big problem with this, but as you can imagine greek life dominates the social scene of my school. Unfortunately for me, I don't like the taste of alcohol, even with it mixed, and I find it hard to connect with random people at fraternity parties as I'm kinda a nerd. My school has a lot of school clubs, but most of them are either professional-oriented, sports teams, or multicultural-based. This is great, in fact I have joined many of the professionally-oriented ones, but the others are not my cup of tea. I realize that if I went into college being on a sports team, I think I would have found a group of friends much more quickly. My school does not have sailing, one of the only sports I enjoy, but Penn does and it looks like a lot of fun. Additionally, I'm gay and, although my school is very accepting of LGBT people/issues (I'm grateful for this), the number of LGBT people at my school is quite small. At the LGBT club's meetings, less than ten people show up each week for the meetings. Also, there are like the same ten to twenty people on dating apps (lol). The reason I'm so drawn to Penn is because it is in Philadelphia which is a great city to be gay in. Penn is more than twice the size of my current school and I'm really drawn by this. I initially thought I wanted a small school, but a large school will have a larger LGBT population and more school clubs/things to do. This will be amplified at Penn because it is in Philadelphia. 

Academically, my school is fine. My GPA has declined to a 3.86, and the coursework is challenging. I love my professors, and I'm doing some awesome research. The only thing I wish my school had more of is computer science classes, particularly computer graphics classes. I spoke to my friend at CMU, and he said he wanted to stay at CMU for another year to take full advantage of the classes there. I'm only in my second year at my school, and I'm almost halfway through all of the computer science courses my school offers, and some of them are highly specialized and don't really interest me such as bioinformatics.

I need an outside opinion: should I apply to Penn again or not? I didn't articulate this at all in my previous applications to Penn. Should I take my gripes somewhere else? This year I'm thinking about applying to many other schools to transfer to such as USC. Thanks for taking the time to read this!",1569937419,1,0

Math 202 Seminar Grading?,I’m currently taking math202 seminar and I wanted to now if anyone had any experience with grade outcomes. Reason being is probably over half the class has dropped since day one (like 10 people left) and we haven’t gotten any grades back. The homeworks are super number theory heavy and not much instruction is given on proof techniques. Grading of proofs can really be on a sliding scale so I’m worried. I’m more than happy to slug through the course if most students get As but I don’t know whats going on.

CSCI vs CSAS at UPenn,"Hi, 

I am currently a senior applying to UPenn ED for Computer Science, and I am having difficulty choosing between a CSCI major and a CSAS major.

For context, I take the IB curriculum, and I take Math, Physics, Economics, Computer Science, Chinese, and English Literature. I have a keen interest for Computer Science especially after I interned at an AI company, and I am hoping to go into the direction of a software engineer/data scientist.

I've looked at the CIS website and my understanding is that CSCI is the more common Computer Science major, whereas ASCS has a lot more flexibility with other disciplines. It also seems as though CSCI is much more demanding than ASCS. I would assume that I would be more suited towards the CSCI program since my current courses are heavily STEM based, but I also am interested in the humanities, hence my interest in ASCS.

As of now, I am leaning towards CSCI and then perhaps switching to the other if I change my mind, but I was wondering how easy it is to switch between the two? Is there a difference in the stereotype of people that take these two different programs? Also, if anyone has an idea of which program has more competitive admissions, that would be great. Or any information about these two programs in general :)

Thank you!",1567831282,2,0

Anything and Everything about Penn Alumni Interviews! [ED/QB Fall 2019 Edition],"'Tis the season for Alumni Interviews for ED and Questbridge Applicants.

Most (BUT NOT ALL AND IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T GET ONE) applicants will have an interview anytime between now and the end of November. 

Feel free to ask specific questions to people here (and check out previous threads below), there are multiple alumni interviewers that are active on this sub (including me). The best advice I can give is to be prepared, speak your truth, be an advocate for yourself (the interview is NOT the time to be humble), and try to have a relaxing, comfortable conversation about your strengths and experiences. Also, definitely research things about Penn that you can specifically reference to when explaining why you want to come to Penn. Also don't google your interviewer. It's super weird when you do this.

That's pretty much all there is to it. BUT if you are freaking out a bit, here's some other information that may be helpful:

QUESTIONS YOU MAY GET/MIGHT WANT TO HAVE ANSWERS TO

Recommended questions for interviewers:

Note: You shouldn't memorize any answers to these questions. They should come naturally. It's helpful to prepare to make sure you hit on a few key points you want to get across, but if you sound like a robot, it won't look good. These are just RECOMMENDED questions, so you aren't guaranteed to get any of them (In fact, many interviewers don't know this lists exists and won't use any of these questions). During my interviews, I usually start off with a few questions that I want to make sure I get, but the conversation that follows usually comes natural (i.e., I ask follow up questions that relate to what the applicant says).

*General introduction*

Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?

How would your friends describe you?

What experiences have you had with people who are different from you?

What would you like the Admissions office to know that might not appear in your application?

*Academic and Personal interests*

What do you most like learning about?

How do you learn best?

Relationships at Penn,"Hey guys, thanks for reading this because I need some advice. I’m a new transfer student here, and I’ve been on a few dates this past week... I’m confused. 

It seems like everybody here has no time to foster a meaningful relationship with another person, and instead chooses to hook up. This culture is pervasive, and seems to be taken to the extreme. 

I was booty called Sunday night. When I got to her room, I could tell something was wrong. She explained that she was behind schedule on her CIS homework, and that she could only have sex if she could work on her homework at the same time. 

It seemed like a fine idea to me; it would check two things from the to do list at once. So, with my face buried in my Spanish textbook, and her torso hunched over a MacBook Pro opened to Codio.com, we shared eight sweaty minutes of doggy style productivity.

The highlight of the evening was when she asked if I’d try BDSM. I agreed and she pulled out an Orgo textbook and asked me punish her.  
So I turned to Chapter 12, and asked her review questions. 

Each synthesis question cracked like a whip. As she demanded, “MORE!” and the pages turned, I took a moment to reflect...

I had come to her room searching for companionship, but when I came in her room, I found only two burned-out shells of people, yearning for a feeling.

This isn’t love, and this isn’t learning. 

How can I find a happy relationship in a place like this?",1571120438,119,0

Making Friends Around Campus,"I have seen quite a few posts about new students feeling lonely and decided to post about it. I hope you guys will find it useful. The main advice given for such posts is to join a club or go out there and start talking to people around you. It's easier said than done. It may work with some people, but not always.

I used to be an international student and I know all the struggles they go through (far away from families, friends, new culture, new language, the list goes on). After I graduated not so long ago, I decided to create a platform to help international students make friends at their new colleges and help them feel more comfortable.

I published my mobile app about 2-3 months ago, and what I found out was quite interesting. So many local students from different universities signed up (even more than internationals), and I realized that this can be a great way for students to meet new people, make friends, go to college events together, overcome social anxiety.

I would be very happy, even if I could help one person. If anyone is interested, feel free to comment below.",1570981081,7,0

Need a Health/Technology related Research Topic? (Graduates or other),"I'm working on a project and I'm nearing the testing/research stages. I was informed by a school-board member that many graduate students seek out research topics regularly, so I thought I'd start by posting here. I'm not sure exactly what information you'd want to know, but I'll start here and add more if there's any feedback.

**Topic:**
Health/Technology

**Description:**
https://www.higenemonkey.com/

We've built an interactive handwashing platform that uses an automatic faucet and a screen. We just took it to the Philly Maker Faire, so there's plenty of pictures/videos for you to check it out but feel free to reach out too. Anyway, we'd like to measure it's effectiveness.

**What the device is capable of measuring**
* Length of time a person washes their hands
* Average amount of people who do/don't wash for 20 seconds (CDC recommended length)
* How many people skip out altogether
* Effectiveness of device compared to nothing at all

**Research Questions**
* On average, how long do people wash their hands?
* Does the device increase the number of people that wash their hands on a daily/weekly/monthly basis?

**Facts:**
* Handwashing is the #1 method for disease prevention
* 95% of people don't wash their hands the correct amount of time
* 1 in 5 people skip washing their hands

He curves all of his classes to an A. Even those fintech Whartonites can squeak by with an A- and go on to so-so Masters programs at University of Rochester. His T.A.s grade on intent over result.

Legacy Op-Ed in Daily Pennsylvanian,"I agree that legacy status should not factor in to college admissions decisions. In fact, I take the extreme view that only grades, test scores, and perhaps Science Olympiad medals and the like should be considered when applying to college.

This is my first year here at Penn as a master’s student and the student body here seems to be more mean-spirited than I anticipated. There are ways to disagree with someone’s argument without completely denigrating them. 

P.S. There are actually arguments in favor of giving legacies a leg-up in admissions. As the author alluded to, legacies are more likely to donate to the university, which benefits all who attend. Granted, I don’t think this benefit outweighs the cost of unfair admissions, but we don’t have to treat anyone who points out this fact like they are a contemptible human being.",1570506887,8,0

Anyway, I just posted a new video on my channel ([https://youtu.be/T5BZ5feGVyo](https://youtu.be/T5BZ5feGVyo)) and thought I could elaborate a bit on the point made in the video.

The main point is **there are numerous resources in colleges available to students which, in the midst of all the academic pressure and chaos, are often not publicized/made known.** As an example, Penn has a First Folio edition of Shakespeare (printed in 1623 and is the only reliable text for all of Shakespeare's 20 plays), or a digital library that allows you to rent equipments worth tens of thousands of dollars. All of my friends on campus that I've talked to did not even know of their existences, let alone actually using those resources.

I was recently at a talk where the guy told the audience to get that NSO flyer with all the resources and do a few each month. You really do not know what you'll end up finding out about Penn.

I need some help with the question 4 in PFAS. The question goes: ”From the sources listed below, what do you estimate contributing towards your education will be. Do not include anticipated financial aid.” So does this mean that how much would we pay if UPenn wouldnt give any aid or how much can we afford to pay?

Our family has enough assetts pay the 80k/year   but it would take all our savings so we wouldnt do that. But if needed we COULD do it. So should I list that 80k?

Or if it asks how much we want/really afford to pay, how can we know that amount? Just estimate it? Like 20k per year is something we could do without problem :P

The next morning, I passed a neighbor in the hall; she giggled and asked me how my night went. It was clear that she overheard last night’s  symphony of the soul.

Her detractors at the University of Pennsylvania on Thursday night were better behaved. Yet even the presence of a university-sent “open expression observer” didn’t discourage the largely hostile audience from frequently interrupting Mac Donald.

They also tried to stump the Manhattan Institute scholar with questions, went off topic and snapped their fingers in unison when others in the audience answered.

Mac Donald spoke at the invitation of the Ivy League university’s conservative newspaper, [***The UPenn Statesman***](https://www.facebook.com/events/784348905263192/), about her latest book, “The Diversity Delusion.”

"Penn program drops GRE for admission, claiming ‘biased’ test hurts women, minorities"," ***‘We will not discriminate against you’ based on ‘biased’ test***

Does the Graduate Record Examination primarily benefit rich white men, or level the playing field for less privileged students to compete for admissions slots?

The University of Pennsylvania’s philosophy doctoral program is taking the first view, ditching the GRE not only as an admissions requirement but also promising to ignore GRE scores if applicants provide them.

In a statement shared on the philosophy blog [***Leiter Reports***](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2018/09/penn-philosophy-will-not-require-gre-for-phd-applicants-this-year.html), Chair Michael Weisberg said the decision to blacklist the GRE was “unanimous” in the department.

Not only does the requirement harm low-income applicants and offer “unfair advantages” to applicants of means – namely, score review and test prep services for extra fees – but women and “underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities” fare more poorly on the GRE, Weisberg claimed.

Varsity esports at UPenn,"Hey guys, my name is Patrick and I own an esports consulting company called All On Esports Activators. My passion is building esports programs on college campuses. I think every school in the country can benefit from an esports program and I'd love to see one at UPenn. One of the biggest challenges for college administrations making the leap into esports is not knowing how many students really want an esports program. This program can include anything from a school funded club all the way to a varsity team that gives scholarships to its players. To address this challenge, I have started a survey that I'm hoping you guys would be willing to take. I'm trying to get this survey to as many schools as possible.

"How hard/math intensive is an econ+stats double major at Upenn? Also, does Wharton look better to recruiters(preferably to a consulting firm like McKinsey) than an econ+ stats double major? Many people have told me that a specific business degree does not look as good.","Hi all,

I am planning on applying to Stanford, UPenn, and UChicago next year and doing econ and stats as a double major, but I had a few questions. 

1) Is econ and stats in Liberal Arts and Sciences or is it in Wharton? Are there even specific business undergrad majors? If it is not in Wharton, is taking majors like Finance or Marketing just as good as taking econ and stats if I want to eventually get an MBA and get a management position? I know that Wharton is renowned but I don't know how much a specific major will help. 

2) How hard is an econ and stats double major? I know that prestigious schools are really hard, and I wanted to know if UPenn is the same or if it is relatively easy to the other prestigious schools.

3) Is econ and stats going to help me find a consulting internship out of college and eventually help me get an MBA?

4) How much calculus would be needed for this double degree? I stopped after Calc BC and I am only taking Comp Sci as my math in senior year because I don't want to do Calc 3.

5) Is grade deflation a thing and will it hurt me?

Thank you for your help!",1576364425,1,0

Successfully applying for Penn jobs,"  

UPenn has a highly competitive job market and if you are truly serious about starting a career at UPenn, you will need to begin with putting together an exceptional application packet. I am a hiring officer for entry level positions for my department at UPenn. I mainly hire from outside of the UPenn community. With that being said, one entry level vacancy can garner over 200 applicants. If you want your application to stand out above the others you NEED to do you research on the department and job description. Please look like you are interested in working for the department and read the department’s website. (Google is a wonderful tool). A well written cover letter that correlates your skills and experience with the job description will get you far. We need to know why you want to work in the department, what are your professional goals. (Never say that you want the Penn benefits, we already know that, we want to know more about what kind of challenges you are looking for in your career and why you think working in this department is interesting.) This is Penn and strong writing and communication skills are a necessity for any job, demonstrating these skills in your cover letter is the best way for you to tell us how your skills will benefit the department and why you want to do this type of work, etc. If you are unsure how to write a clear cover letter, Google it! There are plenty of examples out there to give you a jumping off point. Next, make sure your resume is up to date, use the correct formatting so it is streamlined and clear. We do not want to see an eight page resume (double spaced with weird formatting), it’s a big distraction, and as a hiring officer trying to screen hundreds of applications, these get trashed first. Streamline your resume so it is easy to read and get someone to proof read it before you upload it to the job portal. Your resume should not be longer than one page (unless your employment history supports more pages or you have publications to list).  Again, if you are unsure how to format your resume correctly, Google it! Happy job hunting and GOOD LUCK!!!",1576179545,1,0

I am a CS major and am hoping to transfer to the M&amp;T program at the end of freshman year.  Here are my questions:

what math class should I take (I think I can skip up till math 240 since I know Linear Algebra and Differential equations)?

What should my first-semester freshman schedule look like? (CIS 160?  which freshman seminar course? any Wharton classes I can take since I want some exposure to these as well). How many CS classes should I take etc?

Any other good websites for incoming freshmen where we can learn about Penn CS in general apart from Reddit, college confidential, the FB groups, etc?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!

Any other advice you give me would be very valuable to me.",1577142847,1,0

Financial Aid: How effective is the Appeal Process?,"Hello! I'm a newly admitted ED student, but I'm heavily disappointed at the lack of financial aid that I expected. 

I relied on my FAFSA EFC of approximately a $1000 and the Upenn Net Price Calculator of around $10,000 to ""demonstrate my need"" that Upenn promises to meet for every student. 

And right now I'm sitting on a 79K estimated total cost of attendance, and I think it just does not make any sense that I have to pay 8 times my NPC and 80 times my EFC? In which case I will not be able to attend obviously. 

Their website says that even people above 200K+ income receives financial aid, so I believe there must be a mistake. I submitted a few forms late, right after 11/4, but I have confirmation emails about them. I wanted to check whether they had any missing documents before considering my aid, but the only thing that the financial aid office could do was tell me to appeal, which I certainly am. 

If anyone has any idea what could have possibly happened, or if there's a way I can get more information on how my evaluation went down, that would be much appreciated. I heard appealing takes months, so I hope to be able to take action or at least get some information from their office soon—I'm just unsure how...

"Cornell, grad life and other stuff","This is just a rant. Things I wanted to shout out from the top of the Clock Tower, but obviously never did. Here goes.

If you've been to PSB or Clark Hall, by the physics office, you'll see quite a few posters saying ""physics department cares"", ""how are you? No, really, how are you?"", ""Physics is inclusive"" and what not. Everyday I see those and I think to myself, ""how hypocritical can they get?"". 

I didn't come here expecting a romantic grad life, working on world-changing stuff and all. But I did want to survive. And from my first day of interactions with the professors, I've been constantly discouraged. My already low self-esteem didn't help either. Surely, professors only have the students' best interests at heart. I was so naïve I actually trusted them. I guess I wasn't used to this level of elitism because all through my school and my undergrad, I was constantly encouraged and I was really lucky to have good professors who actually cared. 

I listened. Mostly because I was hoping to work with them. ""We will deem you worthy of being considered if you prove yourself exceptional in your battles"", they said. ""I'll prove myself, elders"", I said. I did not. I won't say I'm the tail of the class, that's just hanging on, but I'm not the head either. More of the underbelly. And it definitely isn't because I'm not working hard. Despite all the corny pep talk that people will give you, I've realised that you can't always achieve what you want by working hard enough. 

Now, the ingredients are just right for my mental decline. A lot of stressed out students seek asylum at Cornell health and I did, too. I had to because I was already on medication. Need to get my pills somewhere. They're a whole different clump of unprofessionalism. Appointments are insanely hard to get, nothing ever happens on my time, and I've even had to miss a few doses because they couldn't get my medication ready on time. 

That was last year. Come summer, there's a hiatus. The sun, the birds, the breeze, the waterfalls. And poof, it's gone. Another bout of the grind starts. And I can see myself going down the same road again.

 I'm not sure where to go from here. 

I didn't want to put down people who actually do care, maybe I'm just unlucky in that I keep meeting those who only turn away. The professors that I've met don't have the slightest inkling about how to help someone, I don't expect them to actively do anything, just listen. 

I don't wish to be a drag but I was told by my psychologist that talking about it more freely would help and I don't have any other platforms. So, thou art my heathen.

If you've read till here, thank you for that. If you haven't that's okay.

To Arch. Majors: A few questions from an applicant,"(I hope I'm posting this in the right sub, I'm sorry if it's not) Hello everybody, I'm a senior that is most likely applying to Cornell ED. Some background: My school offers a lot of math and science classes, and so I've taken some accelerated math courses (from pre calc up to Calc AB), and I really got into physics (AP 2, C Mechanics &amp; EM), but I'm also part of the design major at my school. So I'm really passionate about art and design, and I wanna see if I can expand that passion into Architecture here. Anyway:

1. What's it like paying for a five-year course? Is it significantly more challenging than a traditional four years? 
2. Any small things that makes you think arch stands out at Cornell? I've heard so pretty good things, but I'd like to hear some firsthand experiences 
3. Do you love what you do as an arch major? 

Thanks, and sorry if these questions are annoying. I know there's an admissions thread, but I have no idea how to get there or if this should be there. To be honest, I'm teetering between EP and AAP. I feel like AAP would be a fit for me as someone who's also into design, and I'd have a way to stand out between the applicants as opposed to going to EP. But an architecture education also seems quite an expensive investment, and if that's the case I wanna know if it's doable or if I'd have a good return. Thanks you guys.",1569297053,1,0

New Club Idea! Let Them Eat Cake,"After reading, hearing about, and going through the experience myself, I came up with a club idea that goes against the notion of exclusive clubs at Cornell. 

This club would be called ""Let Them Eat Cake"", modeled after the idea that if we students can't ""get that bread"", we should at least be allowed to eat cake. 

So, of course, this club would have no application process, and everyone is welcome to join. During our weekly or biweekly meetings, students would all get together to enjoy a slice of cake or another type of snack and commiserate with each other over our problems at Cornell.

I've seen that a lot of people suffer from Imposter Syndrome at Cornell. Despite the fact that we're at one of the top institutions in America, excessive competitiveness and this inherent need to show off or act confident lead to a toxic or depressing environment where none of us (or a small amount of us) can feel truly confident.

Let me know what you think of the idea! I'm not sure if an organization like this could be approved, but I was wondering how all of you guys felt about it.",1569257195,115,0

"Rejected from Cornell AppDev or DTI? Consider applying to Holomont Technologies, Inc. Applications close October 15th!","Apply to join Holomont Technologies, Inc. this Fall! **Applications opened on September 15th, 2019 and will close on October 15th, 2019.**

Holomont Technologies, Inc. is a Cornell-affiliated, early-stage technology startup incorporated in May 2017 which focuses on **consumer-oriented mobile app development and IoT communication hardware**. We are **a productivity and efficiency company**. We obsess over saving our customers time and effort. Currently, we aim to **revolutionize points of transaction** by eliminating the 'wait line' and facilitating information exchange at an unprecedented speed and scale. We're starting by tackling professional events (i.e. career fairs, trade shows, networking events) and common appointments (i.e. doctor visits, job interviews).

Beyond the formal, standard 'blurb' about our company that we share with investors, we aim to be Cornell's **first 'company'-'project team' hybrid**. As many of you may have noticed, our marketing headline is ""Rejected from a project team?"" (or some variant) and makes very little mention of our actual line of products. This is for good reason. **We aim to provide as many driven and committed Cornell students as possible with the opportunity to be part of an impactful organization and own equity in their work output.** We've taken the best elements of a project team and merged them with the core elements of a company. To that end, when you join Holomont Technologies, Inc., you will have **a unique level of independence and influence** on the direction of our company. Unlike at traditional project teams, you are not working for free, to further someone else's vision, or towards a meaningless competition with us. Our aim is to empower you with the platform and tools to envision, develop, and market app-oriented ideas that have a major impact on the Cornell community and (hopefully) the world, while keeping an eye on our productivity and efficiency focus and another eye on profitability.

We are looking to hire for many roles from marketing to engineering to everything in between. We have a couple of senior-level executive positions and many entry-level positions. We want you! If you are interested in working for this unique type of early-stage technology startup, consider applying for a position at [**apply.holomont.com**](http://apply.holomont.com/).

Is it essential to take PHYS 1116 / 2217 as a physics major even w/ AP Phys C creds?,"So I got a 5 on Physics C Mech and E&amp;M and my school's curricula for both were fairly deep (relativity, etc.) 

Because I want to double major in another STEM field (EES) I would really rather not take like 8 credits worth of classes if I don't need to. If I took the 1cr. Intro to Special Relativity (2216) to ""catch"" up on what I missed from 1116 and then took 2218 (Honors Phys3), would I really be at **that** much of a disadvantage as opposed to repeating Phys. 1 and 2? Would it be a real problem when getting to 2218 or higher level physics classes, as well as applying to physics or physics-related Ph.D. programs?

Stupid question about career fair,"So I have sweaty hands regardless of whether I'm  feeling nervous or the temperature of the room. It's pretty much a nonstop thing. After observing career fair today, I noticed a whole lot of shaking hands, which is probably expected as its proper manners when introducing yourself. The dilemma I have is that, because I have sweaty hands, i kind of find it embarassing to shake hands with prospective employers. Not to mention the fact that I dont want them to feel grossed out by a sudden wet touch. But on the other hand, telling them I dont want to shake because I have sweaty hands after they've already extended the arm forward seems pretty rude and awkward as well. 

It's really a trivial thing but it's been on my mind for a while. Anyone have any tips? I've already tried products like drysol which only reduces a small amount of the sweat. Not looking for medical advice such as get surgery done, eat this or that, etc.",1568227126,4,0

I believe you guys have seen a lot videos recording the policemen beating the protester. I am going to share with you guys what happening in Hong Kong now is the protesters are scaring and attacking people who have different opinions: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-GR88q8pIw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-GR88q8pIw) This one is the protesters destroying shops and banks:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etahicd5htQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etahicd5htQ).

Help please: ADHD at Cornell,"My doctor at Cornell health recently told me that he's about 95% positive I have ADHD. I've known for years that I struggle with anxiety and occasionally depression, but I never thought I had ADHD until now. We are still in the process of testing me and figuring out what medication and accommodations are best, but that will take 1-2 months, so until then, does anyone have any tips for succeeding at Cornell when you have this disability? I, as with just about everyone here, did really well in high school, and cruised by without studying because I went to a very easy, low-income public school, and while my teachers picked up on some issues that I had, they still gave me As and turned the other cheek because they had students with far far greater problems to worry about. Now, I've been doing very poorly since I've been here. I'm a sophomore, I have an unemployable, low GPA, and I am basically incapable of: getting all my work done on time, getting to class on time, remembering to do things, bringing materials to class, etc, and I piss my teachers off basically every day, and of course lose participation credit, shit like that, all the time. Last year, in chem 2070, i would routinely get 60% on what were actually pretty decent lab reports that would have otherwise gotten 80-90% because i'd hand them in 2-3 days late every week because I couldn't stop fucking up and managing my time poorly. It takes me 4 hours to do something we are expected to do in 1 because I get so distracted and exhausted. I get yelled at in lecture for going on my phone or a TA tells me to stop going on Reddit, when I didn't even realize I was doing that. All of this piles up, and halfway through the week, I lose all motivation to focus, or do anything really, and sometimes even stop attending class, (yes I know that's bad). Sorry, this is super long, but does anyone have any advice? Please do not respond if you don't know anything about ADHD/related problems or do not believe it is a real thing.",1570237516,13,0

When Tardos was about to finish explaining the algorithm, he raised his hand and asked “what if I bought all of the women with BRBs instead?”

Tardos was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, but you’d ruin the algorithm.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually whipped out his student ID card, saying he was ready to purchase some girlfriends.

He turned to me and said “want to be a part of my stable matching?” I told him that I couldn't date someone who has shit in their hair. He said said that he washed it out in the shower. Then I told him that the rest of his body also smells like shit. He said it's because his suitemate poops in the shower. I told him it would take 250 BRBs for me to be his girlfriend, and he declined saying he only had 100 left. After this encounter he went on r/Cornell to whine about the prelim tomorrow.",1571267075,19,0

What's Unique about Economics at Cornell Arts and Sciences?,,1571170845,0,0
Thoughts on Chinese government,"With all the riots currently going on in HK, I thought I’d chime in with my two cents as well. Any objective onlooker would probably say that China has fared quite well in the past few decades. This assessment seems sensible. Back in the 80s the USA’s economy was more than twenty times the size of China’s, but today China has never been closer to overtaking the US as the world’s largest economy. Not all is well for China tho. I personally think that it is not a matter of ‘if,’ but ‘when,’ that the communist government will collapse, and with all the increasing power that the government wields thanks to artificial intelligence, we should expect a cataclysmic upheaval when that collapse eventually occurs. 

There’s one crucial difference between capitalism and communism: in real life, the former works and the latter doesn’t. My main goal here, however, is not to explicate the impossibility of central planning to achieve the efficiency results of capitalism in the long run. Rather, I’m trying to show what would structurally emerge from a system of long-term central planning, and hopefully convince you of the inevitable collapse of communist regimes. 

Contrary to Western popular belief, the communist party is not a band of villains trying to take control of the coercive apparatus of the state and utilize it to their own benefit at the expense of oppressing the citizens. The vast majority of communists are genuinely nice people looking for a centrally planned socioeconomic order based upon common ownership to establish a more egalitarian state. But the task is complex: any systematic central planning necessitates an immense amount of unbridled power. In fact, its very success depends on the extent to which the leaders achieve such power. So the desire to maximize power is not a cause, but a consequence of the desire to centralize decision making. 

Unfortunately, this perpetual need for absolute authority turns out to be highly dangerous, not least because it directly paves the way for totalitarianism. A totalitarian rule is and has always been a long-term logical consequence of an unscrupulous and unrestrained system of central planning. 

Note, however, that totalitarianism isn’t a synonym for failure (think the New Deal period -- not exactly a totalitarian rule, but you get the idea). That being said, totalitarianism is certainly a recipe for disaster in the long run. Everything seems fine when the economy is booming. But when something goes awry (say an economic mismanagement resulting in a national famine), everything goes south. We basically wind up with a vicious cycle, where a government crackdown on a disgruntled public leads to more public disapproval which in turn leads to more government crackdowns. And the fact that China has been making massive leaps in artificial intelligence is even more cause for alarm. One could only wish they would not be there to witness the bloodbath.  

If capitalism is the “extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work for the benefit of all,” then communism is the equally extraordinary tragedy where men with the best of intentions will somehow lead us all to a hellish political, social, and economic existence. Hayek had it spot-on when he said, “Is there a greater tragedy imaginable than that, in our endeavour consciously to shape our future in accordance with high ideals, we should in fact unwittingly produce the very opposite of what we have been striving for?” A great tragedy indeed.",1571169268,0,0

It’s just uncomfortable, and doesn’t the other person on the phone line judge you when they hear your echoey voice or a flush sound in the background?! Maybe I have this wrong, and there’s a cultural norm somewhere in this word I need to go educate myself on... 

I’m not saying don’t ever go to the restroom with your phone. I get it. Some people sneak in a quick text or watch a short video to pass the time (and you can’t deny it, there are enough studies out there to say men do it). But a full fledged phone conversation? Really?!

Hidden Information About Antonio Tsialas' Death,"# The purpose of this post is not to needlessly bring back the pain caused by the tragic death of Antonio Tsialas--the purpose of this post is to try to ensure that what happened to Antonio will never happen again.

If you look up the incident on google, this is the first article: ([https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/](https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/))

&gt;The night before he vanished, the college freshman had dinner with his mother, then went to a frat event, the Miami Herald reported.  
&gt;  
&gt;*He was last seen leaving the Phi Kappa Psi house* around 9:30 p.m. but had not been heard from after the gathering, police said.

Most articles give the same information, but I contend that this information is incorrect, but I do not have absolutely concrete evidence.

I heard from someone that Phi Kappa Psi was holding a dirty rush event not at their house, but at the nearby City of Ithaca Cemetery. I don't have the means to investigate this claim any further, but perhaps someone who hears about this post might. 

If it were true that the event had been held at the cemetery and not the house, Phi Kappa Psi would not want to reveal this information, because they would have to face the repercussions of holding a dirty rush event, and especially of holding one in such a place.

This change of locations might seem like a minor change of details, but this change in details could have meant the difference between life and death, but I am not able to make any certain claim.

I do not know what was happening at the event, and I do not know whether Antonio left from the cemetery or from the house to return back to North Campus, but I believe that by revealing this information, we might discover something about the dangers of holding dirty rush events at cemeteries, or dirty rush events outdoors, or dirty rush events at all, and maybe frats will learn from this and no longer hold these sort of events, or maybe Cornell will crack down on these events much harder.

Comment below if you have any details contributing to my account, or if you disagree with anything I have said. Talk to your friends about this, and try to get Phi Kappa Psi to reveal the true nature of the event they were holding that night. Even if it means punishment for them, that should be a small price to pay to lower the risk of such a tragedy happening to another student.

Thank you for reading through this.",1572312811,21,0
question for econ majors,"just looking through courses to take for next semester 

I'm really interested in behavioral economics but I noticed there was a 3000 level course and a 4000 level course. The two don't seem to be substitutes. Can anyone who has some prior knowledge about the two courses explain the difference to me? The 3000 level course is called Behavioral Economics and Public Policy while the 4000 level course is just called Behavioral Economics (but I suspect will also include public policy in its material) Is it okay to take both or is that redundant. And if it is okay to take both, should I take the 3000 one first and then the 4000 one?",1572312043,6,0
Unexplored Details Regarding the Death of Antonio Tsialas,"\##My purpose for writing post is to try to prevent what happened to Antonio from happening to anyone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will reference this article for the purposes of this post, seeing as it's the first article that comes up on google search.

[https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/](https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/)

The article states the following, which is the same information as most other articles on the matter: 

\&gt; The night before he vanished, the college freshman had dinner with his mother, then went to a frat event, [the Miami Herald reported](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/coconut-grove/article236702618.html).

\&gt; He was last seen leaving the Phi Kappa Psi house around 9:30 p.m. but had not been heard from after the gathering, police said.

\&gt; Campus police reported that they found his body Saturday afternoon at the base of Fall Creek gorge.

&amp;#x200B;

Notice the second sentence I quoted, which states he was last seen leaving the Phi Kappa Psi house. 

\#The missing detail is that the frat event was a dirty rush event being held at the nearby City of Ithaca Cemetery, not the Phi Kappa Psi House. He was most likely not last seen as the Phi Kappa Psi house, but rather at the cemetery at the frat event.

[Note that the cemetery is right by Phi Kappa Psi](https://preview.redd.it/nxqfjvd5pdv31.png?width=1522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74850aad7642c61790e251314bd5aeedf4080303)

I do not have hard evidence to convince anyone of this, but I learned that these were the true circumstances of that frat event by word of mouth. I am not absolutely sure that my claims are correct, but since I believe there is a possibility they are correct, it is worthwhile to explore them, since perhaps we will uncover the truth about the incident, and learn how to prevent this from happening. If this incident did partly stem from a frat holding a dirty rush event at the cemetery, then I hope we learn from this and work to eliminate those events to any degree.  

I hope you talk about this post to me, to your friends, to anyone else. I hope we create conversation about this and work to get to the bottom of this tragedy. I hope the frat faces chooses to be punished for what might have been a terrible choice of event, so that all frats and the university can learn to never host events like that again. I hope there is a change made so that this does not happen again. 

If anyone has any supporting details or questions, please comment below. Thank you.",1572311591,1,0

Mentally Checked Out,"I'm not sure if anyone else feels this way, but I feel burnt out and I've just mentally checked out of school. I see a counselor but that only does so much. I've fallen out of love with my major (CS) and it's a constant battle between wanting to enjoy it and just hating it. I feel like I don't belong and it's just really lonely doing this major. I do cs-related activities but those aren't really places to find study groups or make friends with other cs people (a lot of the interactions feel so artificial and out of pity that I didn't come with anyone to the event). 

I've also just checked out of my schoolwork in general. I'm doing great in most classes but there's one CS class that I'm almost certain I'm failing. And granted, it's my fault that I didn't go to enough OH and basically getting below the mean on almost everything, but it gets hard to even get out of bed when you hate everything about your life. I've just started to take meds to let me go to sleep because I'd rather let the year pass than deal with this any more; I do the basic minimum and try to save my awful CS grade but that's it. I'm genuinely not good at CS, it was a tough road to maintain above a 3.0 gpa, but I'm a senior and it's too late to switch.

The only reason I haven't offed myself is that I don't want to leave my mom with my debt and who am I to fuck up her holidays?

I'm giving up,"I'm giving up on Cornell. I hate it here. I am tired, burned out and have crippling depression. I didn't get out of bed for two weeks and everyone expected me to act like I was fine and do psets and prelims. It's so much harder to make friends here and people seem miserable and depressed. I was genuinely looking forward to becoming a software developer but Cornell has made me hate the idea of school. I'm a junior and every semester my grades have been in the shitter. I don't party, I don't go to club meetings anymore, I don't do sports, I don't have a job, I don't volunteer, I don't have anything to show for any semester I have been here except numerous all nighters spent in PSB followed by bombing prelims and massive student debt. 

Everyone is so self obsessed and the competition is toxic. People seem to do things for the sake of being seen doing them and because they are expected to do them. Today I watched my friend share about his internship offer and no one bothered to congratulate him. All that followed was a pathetic attempt to one up each other. Professors don't seem to care about a student's well being. They almost seem to be getting satisfaction from their classes/prelims breaking students. Why is depression so normalized here? I've heard students openly say they are very depressed and no one seems to bat an eye. It takes weeks to get an apt. with a mental health professional at Cornell health. 

There seems to be an overarching standard of measure for every action I take. I am tired of hearing bs from students threatening to drop a class for being one SD below a prelim mean, or breaking down because they didn't get a call back from goldman sachs after their HireVue. There seems to be no life in this place. Everything is just a prestige and numbers game. 

To top it all off, the mentality of ""if you don't like it, then leave"" seems to be everywhere. Emailed my prof about a bad grade on an assignment and he suggested dropping the class, talked to another professor about $450 books I can't afford and he suggested dropping the class, talked to a mental health professional about having mental breakdowns and he suggested skipping town, mentioned discomfort over offensive anti LGBTQ comments about my friend at a club and they suggested I walk away from the conversation. Is leaving the only option? 

I am tired of being tired, burned out and depressed. Every day of being here makes me feel like I don't have a life outside of Cornell to look forward to. I go back home and I have to be all smiles and have all these lunches with high schoolers and parents of kids who would give a kidney to go here. I have gotten to the point where I don't bother to sugar coat it. Cornell is a miserable place, the ivy league degree is very valuable but it comes at the cost of a person's mental health and identity outside of beinga cornellian. I talk to a lot of people daily and it's disgusting how the one thing I have continuously heard from freshmen and seniors alike is how they hate it here and can't wait to get out. It's alarming to hear a freshman who has only been here 3 months say they can't wait to leave. 

I can't do this anymore.",1574473950,1,0

I... I don’t know what happened in MATH 2930 lecture today...,"We had just spent 40 minutes solving a simple linear system of two equations when Professor Strogatz... he just, he said “Now I’m going to show you all something just for pleasure.” My innocent mind thought “oh boy! Another Laplace transform!” Man, was i wrong...

He proceeds to tell us how we will have “M^eat” on the te^-st. And how “we have the meats”. 

At this point, I’m confused. Where is he going with this? Is it a metaphor for the limitations of what “exponentials can kill?” 

He goes on to tell us about how his wife gave him a plaque labeled “Stephen Strogatz: Over Explainer”. He was so proud. As he shed a tear, he unzipped his pants and sat the biggest penis I have ever seen right on the table at the front of the lecture hall. 

“I told you it was bigger than Trump’s.”

The room fell into silence. When he showed us the graphs of near-resonance frequencies of forced vibrations, no one ACTUALLY believed his dong was that big. Then everyone erupted in applause. I had never seen anything like it. 

Now, I’m reeling. I don’t know what to think of it all. My brain is in shock. I can’t process anything. I think I need to break up with my boyfriend because nothing will ever match what I saw on that lecture hall table today. In my mind all day, all I hear is Stephen Strogatz saying his own name over and over: “Stephen Strogatz, Stephen Strogatz, Stephen Strogatz....”",1574451007,1,0

Does Cornell rescind acceptances often?,"Hi guys, 

As you can tell, I'm a senior in high school. From freshman through junior year, my grades were all A's with a total of 3 B's on my transcript. I worked pretty hard and I tried my best. My academics were my focus and I tried to take as many rigorous courses as I could. However, this year, my grades are slipping. It is NOT due to senioritis. I have gotten two major leadership roles this year (president of a club and major leadership role in JROTC), and I am taking 6 AP classes at the moment. I have never taken this many all in one year before. But because of that, I have 2 B's and a C right now. My B's are in AP Chem and AP calc, and my C is in AP Physics mechanics. I'm applying as a life science major and it is not physics-heavy at all so I know my strong suit does not need to be in physics. I applied to Cornell ED and I am worried that on the chance that I get in, all my hard work will have been for naught because of  my senior year transcript and they'll rescind my acceptance. 

Were any of you in my situation as a HS senior? Will this happen? Any help or info would be appreciated. My anxiety is just through the roof right now and I don't think my grades will change drastically. Also I'm sorry if these types of posts aren't allowed, I can delete them if need be.",1574431849,1,0

The only info attached to the account is an email address, Cornell.family.donations@gmail.com. I’m pretty sure it’s a scam because I couldn’t find anything through googling the name or email address. But my PayPal account has nothing but my personal email and name, so I’m not sure how anyone would get access and/or know that I go to Cornell. 

Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone else got a similar transfer or has any insight as to what I should do, I.e. return the money, contact PayPal, keep the money etc. Any advice is much appreciated!",1573573962,1,0
Need help making Cake Club (Let Them Eat Cake) a reality,"Hey guys!

The more time I've spent talking to people at Cornell and browsing this sub, the more I think that Let Them Eat Cake needs to be a real club. 

(Here is the link for those who didn't see my previous post)
https://reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/d894s0/new_club_idea_let_them_eat_cake/

There are not enough resources for Cornell students to abate their loneliness or stress from everything that happens here. While I thought of the club as something that specifically goes against the notion of exclusivity, I now think that it could focus more on inclusivity and making sure that there's a place for everyone.

Of course, everyone would still be welcome to come and enjoy cake (please do), but my hope is that all of the people who have felt or expressed loneliness here at Cornell could find solace through this club.

On that note, I would love to make this club a real thing, but I don't feel like I can do everything on my own. There's a fair amount of planning that would need to go into doing everything for this club. Would any of you guys be interested in helping me out?

Feel free to comment or message me if you might want to help out. I think that meeting as a group and figuring everything out would probably be the best way to take tangible steps towards making the club.",1573572379,1,0

First he did a double take at the bus stop. Another time I was at the pasta station in the dining hall and while I was scooping, I just happened to look up and he was staring right at me. One time when I caught him staring, I smiled at him- and he got this dear in the headlights look. At that point I was like either he likes me or I look like a dead relative, I couldn’t think of any other possible explanations.

So after a while I was like you know what, I’m tired of the speculation. Cuffing season is here and I thought he was kind of cute.

For Sophomores and Freshman enrolling in Physics classes this week,"Enrollment information has been shared by some of your programs and colleges. There is also enrollment information on most of the classes on the roster. Further information is provided below.

PHYS 2208: Priority is given to students who cannot satisfy their Physics requirement with PHYS 1102. If you cannot self-enroll in PHYS 2208 via Student Center, you should add yourself to the Physics [waitlist](https://www.physics.cornell.edu). If you only list one option for section and lab, you may be passed over for students who have been more flexible and listed more section options. Do not enroll in electives during lecture times.  If you need to add filler classes for financial aid purposes, do not add classes that meet during your requested section times. Your schedule will be reviewed to ensure spots you requested do not cause conflicts with classes in which you're already enrolled. Placements will be made in mid-December, directly through your college registrar. Due to the class having 38 separate components, it is not possible to give you your chances for enrollment to the class or a particular section. Most of the waitlist for 2207 was enrolled in their requested, or agreed upon, sections this semester.

PHYS 1112, 2213, 2214: There is no waitlist for this sequence and all seats in all sections have been released to Student Center. If you are flexible with your schedule you will be able to enroll.  If there are no open discussions or labs that fit your schedule, see the Physics Course Coordinator in 121 Clark Hall during your add/drop period. Sections will not be filled beyond capacity during the pre-enrollment period. 

PHYS 1116, 2217, &amp; 2218 are on the waitlist.

The swap feature works for Physics classes. If you are enrolled in a class and wish to change to a different open section, you can safely use the [swap](https://www.physics.cornell.edu/swap) feature without risk of dropping the class.",1573436838,1,0

"Possible ILR Transfer questions: dorms, greek life and changes to major.","So I'm currently am attending another school for a year under the guaranteed transfer program (where you start at Cornell sophomore year.) I really like my life currently so I have a few questions before fully committing to the transfer. 

1) Where do people in sophomore years (and specifically transfers) live? I already had a year in the dorms so I don't know if I would like to do it again. Are the dorms for sophomores better? Are you placed with other transfer students?

2) I would want to join a frat, but as I know the big rush is in spring for freshman. Could I still join as a sophomore in the fall rush or even waiting for spring rush in sophomore year?

3) Since a year already passed would it be hard to switch my major or school from ILR to something else? I like ILR but I would like the option of switching majors to be available if I don't end up liking it that much. Do many people switch in sophomore year and how easy is it?",1575676291,1,0

Graduate Student Assaults Undergraduate Student: They don’t intend to share the campus with undergrads.,"
I am a graduate PhD student in the Hotel School and witnessed an assault by Ankur Mulji on an undergrad last night.

Ankur approached an undergraduate student and harassed the individual with threats on a sidewalk as the undergraduate student was waiting for the bus, and continuously stating that the individual ""does not belong at Cornell because he/she is an undergraduate student"". Ankur also continued his verbal assault, stating that ""undergraduates are scum and do not have any jobs when they graduate Cornell"" and other racial slurs directed towards the student's home country, and that he himself is part of the ""prestigious Baker Program, and will make sure the [undergraduate student] will have an awful time at Cornell"". Ankur then continued to attempt to physically intimidate the undergraduate student by standing right against the student's physical body, physically slapping the undergraduate student's chest, and stated that he will follow the student onto the bus when the student explicitly told Ankur ""to get away"". Ankur only stopped when the student stated that he/she will call the police if the behavior does not stop, and Ankur walked away saying that ""[the student] made a mistake, and he (Ankur) will be seeing the student real soon"". All of these assaults and threats were because the undergraduate student was merely waiting for a night time bus on the sidewalk, as Ankur pushed past the student, only to turn around to tell the student to ""move the fuck off the sidewalk"".

This conduct by a graduate student clearly indicates a distinct pattern from Ankur of hatred towards undergraduate students, which is completely unacceptable as Cornell now host nearly 15,000 undergraduate students during the school year. The physical and verbal threats for harm is completely unacceptable from graduate students, especially as they are often times a lot older and stronger than undergraduates that just entered college. I also believe Cornell shouldn't allow this type of behavior at all from graduate students or permit the acceptance and existence of these types of graduate students, whom do not intend to ""share"" the campus with undergraduates, as this erodes from the ""Cornell Community"" that we all sought to build here on campus. This feeling of graduate superiority, egotism, and hate should not exist on our campus, to the point of nearly a hate crime, as it specifically targets undergraduate students.",1575670025,1,0

Alternatives to exercise,"Dear Cornell community,

This semester has left me profoundly tired, mentally and physically. I sleep four hours a night and I really wish I had time to get back on my summer routine, which was so much more regimented and healthy because of my job.

In particular, I miss my running routine. I used to run five miles a day and at the end of the summer I had an ass you could bounce a quarter off. This semester, though, has left me with an ass so flat you could rollerblade on it

I miss my ass and wish it weren’t so profoundly flattened. I don’t have the time to exercise like that anymore so I was wondering if anyone could recommend me any good BUTT IMPLANT surgeons in the area. I’m looking for a really good dude with minimum ten years experience. Gannett won’t cut it—I’m looking for a truly top-of-the-line,  one-of-a-kind ass surgeon. I need a miraculous ass restoration and an experience I can sing about for years to come.

Bottom line is, homeboy is really just tryna get a hot bum that the ladies stare after. Help me out here my friends",1575661656,1,0

What’s going to happen to me?,"I’m a first semester freshman going through some major problems. In short, I haven’t attended a single class or done any work since the end of the first prelims. A combination of physical and mental health issues that were snowballing since senior year high school, combined with family issues and complete social isolation, brought me to the point where I was missing classes and struggling to stay emotionally stable enough to seek help from CAPS. One bad therapy session sort of tipped me into breaking and I haven’t been to classes, done work, or spoken in person to anyone since. I can’t believe so much time has passed so fast. Nobody ever noticed I was gone and I never received any emails or texts or even notifications on Canvas about grades or my absence, and although that’s something I should have expected with the freedom and vastness of college it only made me feel worse.

Somehow finals are only a week away, and it’s probably impossible to salvage any of my classes. I have not registered for spring classes yet either, and I wouldn’t know how I could possibly fare in them without knowing most of what was taught in the prerequisite classes I took this semester. From what I’ve found searching here, I can expect to be put on a leave of absence for a semester? I’m not sure, but I desperately do not want to go back home, and I’m afraid it’ll only make things worse to have to stay there when family was such a big part of the problem in the first place.

I felt so lethargic and depressed I literally did nothing most days, and it took a lot of effort to send the few early emails I did manage to send, which didn’t really go very far. I’m only just now even stabilizing my sleep schedule enough to be up at this time and I don’t know what to do at this point, if anything at all can be done. Who can I go to? What will happen to my financial aid status, or my status as a student? Should I even register for spring classes?",1575563289,1,0

"Oh, What a View.","You know, I haven't achieved anything significant in life. No particularly impressive sports records, no Olympiads, no out of the world scores in school or SAT. Then why would I try to be placed among immortals? Why did I spend all that money to get rejected? I don't know. I have some questions. I have a little something that drives me. It's those questions. I like the sciences. I like to study stuff. I like libraries. It's like this humongous collection of summaries of great people's life's works over hundreds, thousands of years. How wonderful does that sound. We won't get to know all of it. I was so sad when we had to choose our streams in grade 11 because I'll never know what studying microeconomics or geology is like, not in a classroom environment. We had this TV show on Nickelodeon where some dudes did some work in a workshop, and I have dreamt so many times of all the wonderful things I could do in there, of all the innovations that I could come up with, of how it's going to make life a little better for some people. I was going to choose the conventional Joint Entrance Examination path like every other High schooler in India and then I stumbled across Glorious to View, and my childhood self was like Holy shit these places actually exist! I scored terribly in class 11 because I was too enchanted by the wonderful world of CS courses on Coursera. I scored low on the SAT despite topping my maths class in school because they cut 90 marks for like 4 wrong questions in Math. I obviously don't like to think of it but deep down I know so well I'm not getting to go there. Missing out on not the academics but a community of higher thinkers, a group who's as imperfect and motivated and curious as I am. I've missed out on a lot of things in life, but this is a little different. The mods are gonna remove this for being antagonistic anyway. But to everyone who's in that place, busy being a God, and everyone who's on the other side of the fence, just trying to survive, I hope you do yourself proud, more than anyone else. The difference we seek for can come in a plethora of ways and methods. A Cornell education is just one of them. There's something in those gorges, something about that remote location, something humble about the air in that place. Something that invites you to dance. Something that beckons you to explore, something that tingles your curiosity to make you dig deeper and strive harder. I like that feeling. Ah, I'm romanticising this once again.

This is my fourth winter in Ithaca, and the fourth winter of my life. I love it.

People get together to go outside and play. Not on their phones. Interacting with other people. You can’t keep your phone out for too long or your fingers will freeze! Cold weather forces people to interact with each other more which makes existing around Cornell and Ithaca that much better. People are willing to be social instead of just so hyper focused on work and grades.

People have fun, play games, and interact with nature and the world and people and architecture around them. The snow connects people. I don’t see this happening during the spring/summer/fall nearly as much.

On the Quality of West Campus’ Chicken Wings,"Dear friends, fellow students, university faculty, and other lurkers,

I forgive whoever I may offend with this post, but my tastebuds can take the abuse no longer. 

Over the course of my life thus far, I have had over 20 years of experience tasting all sorts of chicken wings from all kinds of different restaurants, including but not limited to Buffalo Wild Wings, Wingstop, Wings over Ithaca, various pizza parlors, and Nasties. So you can say that my taste in chicken wings is perhaps one of the most refined there is. I therefore believe that I am qualified to testify on behalf of the university on the quality of West Campus’ chicken wings.

It appears to me that West Campus serves two types of chicken wings:

1. The good kind.
2. The bad kind.

It seems that the type of wings served on West alternates every day, completely irrespective of dining hall. I have had both types of wings in Cook, Bethe, Keeton, and Rose. 

Today’s wings, served in Bethe, were the bad kind. They were over-seasoned, excessively fatty and greasy, and devoid of all chicken-like taste. 

These type of wings are so over-seasoned that I can predict with 100% accuracy which type of wings (type one or two) are served in the dining hall on any given day just by walking in and sniffing the air. 

The wings served yesterday in Keeton, however, were the good kind. They were crispy, but not too crispy, and of quality taste. I place them on a pedestal above Wings Over Ithaca, but below Buffalo Wild Wings and Wingstop. They are of perfect quality for a university ranked 3rd in the US for campus food. 

The wings today, however, don’t even make the list and are so awful that Cornell should drop at least 10 ranks in the list of universities with the best dining hall food. 

I implore all of you to help me find a way to help rectify this wing situation so that we may all enjoy tasteful chicken wings on West on any given day. 

Thank you.",1575325888,1,0

The Decade in Review,"As the decade comes to a close and we draw 10 years closer to the impending climate apocalypse, the moderators of r/Cornell thought the timing was apt for a history lesson, because we know how much y'all love breadth requirements.   
  
The Cornell subreddit was, apparently, created roughly 10 years ago by u/drboda, who has been inactive for the last 10 years and has fewer posts on his account than I can count on one hand. It is truly remarkable that the spirit of this subreddit's founder has survived intact in its current users. Speaking of which, we have gone from just u/drboda and his alts to 16,674 readers at the time of writing, of which at this time approximately 22 AEP majors are active. We've also grown to a daily subscription rate in the mid double digits, and a monthly view rate of over 2 million for each of the last 2 months, of which, again, about 22 were unique. Through that time, we've seen moderators come and go, including u/laveritecestla (AEP '18) and u/TheD3xus (AEP MS '19), who recently graduated and who you may be familiar with. Some grad student and alumni lurkers may even be familiar with even older mods such as u/ConvexPreferences (unflaired), u/Enyo287 (graduation date unknown), u/TheIndigoSky (AEP '14) and u/SamuelGompers (EP '13), who had to be removed by force by reddit admins some time ago. He was actually so old AEP hadn't yet rebranded and was known as just EP. Some speculate this is due to Cornell's recent trend of grade inflation, before which there were no As given. Let that serve as a reminder: things could always be worse.     
  
If you're currently a Cornell student, you were probably between 7-14 years old at the start of the decade. Some of you probably spoke no English at that time or lived in a totally different country. Many of you probably didn't even know what Cornell was, or had never thought about going to college at all. We're 100% sure you were all fucking nerds tho.     
     
The world has changed a lot since 2010. Back then Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen was one of the most popular shows on television. People watched the Office on NBC, not Netflix. Snapchat didn't exist and Uber was a year old. The most popular song of 2010 was TiK ToK. Now it's an app, and owned by China.   
  
Cornell has changed a lot too. In 2010 our President was not Martha Pollack, a CS theorist, but James Skorton, a cardiologist. Imagine hiring someone to run a university who makes financial decisions like majoring in psychology. Martha has an h-index of 51. We didn't make that up, fucking chad she is. David motherfucking Gries has an h-index of 40. Who has more programming experience now, bitch?  
  
Some of the people reading this are probably ED admits or even RD applicants, so it seems appropriate to discuss how the university has changed in this regard, too. For the class of 2023, Cornell had an overall admission rate of 10.6%, and an ED rate of 22.6%. For the class of 2014, the statistics were 18.4% and 32.7%, respectively. By contrast, Harvard's admission stats were 7% for RD and no one knows the EA rate because they apparently didn't have it. Cornell's RD rate in 2018 was 8%, to put that in perspective. Idk about the rest of you, but this was actually more in line with current numbers than I expected. Notably, just 4 years earlier (Class of 2010) the admissions rate was actually 25%, with an ED rate of 40% for Cornell, and 9% and 20% for Harvard. I know this because I accidentally looked up these statistics instead of the relevant ones from a decade ago. Oops.    
    
Speaking of mistakes, let's go over some of the big ones. The 2010s looked so promising coming in, and yet we all ended up at Cornell. We are sincerely disappointed in all of you. More seriously, we made many mistakes this decade as a species, and learned from few of them. I'm going to get political for a moment. In 2010, we finally came together to give healthcare to the American people. 10 years later, we need GoFundMe to cover basic operations. In 2010, we elected the most conservative generation of politicians ever to the US government. Now, in 2019, we are poised to do the same again. Globally, Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring signaled a departure from the systemic oppression of earlier eras. Today, people in Hong Kong fight to defend their basic liberties from a dictator, and we deface even meager symbols of support for their people. But hey, at least we got some good memes out of it.           
   
Perhaps the greatest growth in the 2010s has been in the meme sector. One of the most popular memes of 2010 was a picture of Keanu Reeves. People still get massive karma with the same exact picture of Keanu Reeves. In 2010, people got their memes on reddit and cheezburger. Now, people still get their memes on reddit. Truly a transformative decade it has been.    
  
We want to give a shoutout to the r/Cornell community. Y'all are pretty dank. This community is by far the best Ivy shitposting subreddit, not that we really have any competition. But we are also helpful, welcoming, and insightful. Everyone in this subreddit contributes positively to the community, and we all really enjoy helping to keep this community spam-free for all of you.   
    
Here's to the continued perpetual growth of the AEP major, and another decade as the #1 Ivy shitposting sub. Whether you had a great decade or a shitty one, keep in mind: in just 100 more years, you'll finally be allowed to talk about 2110 finals on this sub again, and maybe Gries will even join you himself. Until then, shut the fuck up, and have a happy new year.

hometown dilemma (?) during breaks,"hi all! i have a question for anyone who might relate and can offer som advice!! :)

so first!! as some background information , im a freshman at cornell. i didn’t go to the best high school academically, and most of the people at my school either go to community colleges, local colleges, or the military (which isn’t bad or anything!! but it’s a detail that helps with my question!!). im an out of state student , too!

basically, ever since i got into cornell during senior year, a lot of my friends began treating me differently and kind of harshly (comments like “you only got into cornell since your black” or “you think you’re too good for us now”), so even going into cornell left a weird vibe for us before i left. and while there, it kinda sucked to see my friends back home hang out together all the time and even have classes together. buuut, each time i came home, id try to visit them and spend time with them, and they would stillllll only hang out together and/or it would just feel like a much different vibe, which kinda sucked and made me feel bad. this break has been the hardest since a lot of old high school drama was brought up by them and a lot of bitterness /resentment was shown from them.  i now pretty much have dropped a lot of my friends from high school and have been super bored with nothing to do in my hometown :(( it’s been sad because i guess things just feel so lonely and stagnant back home? like there’s never much going on and most people just stick to who they know from high school (since everyone basically stays here), hence leading them to still have high school like habits (a lot of gossip and rumors) :// like there are other friends from high school who i love too, but they mainly just party, smoke, drink, etc (which isn’t bad or anything!! i completely understand!!) when hanging with people and im not into that.  

i just really dislike the environment here. buuut i do love to see and spend time with my family during these breaks!! but i also feel like id be muchhh muchhh happier if i stay at cornell / maybe explore ny during breaks (plus itd probably save money tbh).

so my actual question!! do you guys feel this dilemma of your hometown not really feeling like home anymore? and for out of state students, how have you’ve been navigating being away from home (missing family, hometown friends, etc.)? also, for those who don’t go back to their hometowns or haven’t in the past, what do you do instead?

super sorry that was a lot!! and i hope this didn’t come off the wrong way at all!! things just have been making me kinda sad and stuff, so i just wanted to explore some options !! thank u guys!! 💞",1577700900,1,0

With that being said, we need to make this sub even better. If Ivies get on us over anything we need a sub to rub in their face. That's why I propose this one secret doctors hate to make your sub bigger: upvote downvote icons that represent Cornell


Harvard and Yale both have them and we can't let them boast their prestige like that, we need to show them we're on equal playing field. I'm thinking the upvote can be the Cornell logo and the downvote can be the okenshield stir fry.

Help with 2080,"I’m a sophomore planning to take 2080 in spring semester (I know that most bio majors take 2070/2080 their freshman year, but I came in undeclared so I didn’t take them last year). I have AP Chem credit that got me out of taking 2070, but I’m pretty worried about a couple things:

1. It’s been a hot second since I took AP chem (senior year of high school), and my teacher was also shit. I taught all the material to myself and as a result it didn’t really stick in my mind afterwards. So, essentially, I don’t really remember anything.
2. I’ve heard some horror stories about 2070 and am worrying that I’ll be coming into 2080 woefully unprepared.

Something that helped me make friends,"is getting a job on campus! I know that sometimes students are not able to work for a number of reasons, but if it's in your control I would highly recommend getting a job somewhere that requires you to work with people (not like a desk job where interaction is usually discouraged). The dining services for example are always hiring. I've worked a ton of different jobs since high school and I have to say, the co-worker bond is super easy to develop. You're usually dealing with the same type of grueling work, the same terrible boss(es), the same terrible customers/patrons. 

My first two semesters here I was really lonely and had no ""go-to"" friends so to speak to eat with, study with, or hang out with. Then after I started working, one of my co-worker friends decided to grab dinner after a shift, and then she introduced me to her friends. It's all been uphill from there.

The AEP plot thickens,"After taking some time last night to explore the AEP plot further, I decided it would be best to create a bot to do some digging into the concept of one AEP major controlling r/Cornell. After running through the last 300 posts on r/Cornell looking at every single comment, checking the flair of the user commenting I determined the following:

Number of unique CS vs AEP majors on r/Cornell:

CS: 44

AEP: 22

This number seemed suspicious to me, as I would argue that there is far more than a 2:1 ratio of CS to AEP majors at Cornell, but WHATEVER. Maybe it was just a coincidence. I decided to explore further. I then ran through those accounts to see what percent of each were created within the last year:

 Percent of the above accounts created in the last year:

CS: (6/44) = .1363636...

AEP: (16/22) = .72727272...

ODD. This seems like a statistically significant result to me. I took it one step further and logged the dates on which all of the AEP accounts were created, they are as follows:

Financial Aid,"  For early decision, I have been admitted to the College of Engineering class of 2024. I was celebrating this fact until the evening of Christmas Eve, when I received my financial aid offer. From what I can discern, my family is expected to pay the full price of $75,868 for one academic year. To be clear, I was expecting to receive minimal aid, but I have been all but blatantly rejected by the financial aid office. I understand that the university awards no merit-based financial aid, but I took my admission under early decision to mean that I was wanted on campus. I take offense to the fact that the university cannot offer me a dime. As far as colleges went, I was not ignorant to the fact that Cornell would be a costlier option, but I imagined a greater cost would be somewhat justified. There is no justification for a direct $300,000 expense over four years.

  I would not usually discuss the following details in a public forum, but, for background, they feel pertinent. I am an only child. My father, (who is looking to retire in the coming years) has an annual income of $90,000. My mother has an income of $10,000 - $30,000 from her investments. The problem lies within my mom’s assets, totaling approximately $1.3 million in said investments. I have never considered my family to be rich nor upper class. We live pretty conservatively, seeing as we could not recoup any major expenses through income. My mom worked hard to attain that level of financial security, and I take even greater offense to the fact that Cornell sees it as theirs for the taking, but I digress.

  Let me consider some hypotheticals for a moment. The cost above is strictly for undergrad. At this time, I am considering (or would at least like the option of) going to med school.  Forgive my rough estimate, but I would predict this to be an additional $300,000 (especially if it is at Cornell). For my mom to raise the combined total in cash, she would likely incur an expense closer to $1 million (accounting for hefty tax penalties and other costs associated with liquidating that quantity of assets). I cannot, in good conscience, ask my mom to spend the bulk of her savings on my education, nor would I be comfortable taking on that kind of debt myself.

  Perhaps I have been naïve in not paying enough attention to costs. I bring this to the subreddit in the hopes that someone can share a similar experience. Is this the expected (adjusted) cost of attending Cornell? Having just gotten this news, I have not been able to contact the office of financial aid due to the holiday. I fully intend on asking for my decision to be reviewed, but do I have any realistic recourse? Perhaps most importantly, is four years at Cornell worth $300,000? I had strong doubts that I would be admitted to the College of Engineering, but I never considered that I would be priced out of a school marketing itself as the most progressive ivy. I am questioning whether my admission was based on merit or merely my ability to pay. I hope to join you guys in the fall, but that may not be a possibility.

By the way, Merry Christmas everyone!",1577275692,1,0

This break, I realized why I love it so much and I honestly feel shitty for it.

I love it more because I'm away from my family. 

Small family, so we really 'rely' on each other. Guess in some way it can be taken as overbearing parents. Not academically, but just really really tight. mostly in a good way, but stressful nonetheless. 

I've never had this much freedom. My parents always gave me alot, but I've never taken advantage of it. being here with them basically stuck in this house is honestly frustrating. I already got into an argument with them earlier tonight. the worst part is that they are honestly wonderful and I know many would love to be part of a family like this.

I just miss the routine I developed there. Sure i have friends home too but honestly after making these cornell friends i dont really want to go back to some of my toxic 'friends'

I feel like an asshole wanting to get away from this family. I am blessed in so many ways and I feel ungrateful. My parents have been nothing but supportive all through my life but I just cant stand the independence I had there.

I am mainly worried because both of these courses are related to engineering. Other than these two classes I have 3 other APs and another reg class, all of which I am confident I will be able to finish with As in.

Dear Ithaca Campus Community,

Y’all know what happened last week on frat life drama. 

As I noted in my [November 19 community message](http://t01.list.cornell.edu/t/2925802/62429839/1204042/1044/), the unregistered fraternity party, during which freshmen were served alcohol and participated in drinking games, and all members got shitfaced and violated a number of Cornell’s Greek life policies. I find it particularly fucked up that Phi Kappa Psi had just attended a judicial hearing the day before for additional fuckery. The chapter has been placed on interim suspension pending a full review by the Greek judicial system because they never should’ve fucked with me. 

Regrettably, this is not an isolated incident as Greek life is just a bunch of assholes. We have on this campus, as do many of our peers on their campuses, a persistent culture of fuckery in the Greek-letter system; a pattern that dates back years, if not decades, and one that I have witnessed during my two-and-a-half years as Cornell’s president. Indeed, people tried to fuck with me over hazing back in the winter of 2018 and I announced a set of new Greek policies in May of that year. At that time, naysayers told me that the new policies would not shut this shit down. Unfortunately, those naysayers were fuckin right. In the 19 months since those new policies went into effect, fully six Greek organizations have engaged in behavior so problematic as to merit suspension of their recognition by the university. This number does not include the current interim suspension of the bitches at Phi Kappa Psi.

The full copy is attached for this reform, but I know once y’all see bullet points you stop reading so I won’t go any further. In conclusion, I’m trying and y’all are making this shit super fucking hard. Get your shit together. 

In the words of Lil Wayne, “If you ain’t gonna ride, fly, than you might as well hate.”

Sincerely,

Martha E. Pollack

One of the guys i live with has a girlfriend majoring in [less common major], and i have a friend also majoring in it, so i asked her if they know each other. Turns out they were partners together on a big group project this semester. 

I met someone in a club here. A few months later i found out my friend from high school is his cousin. Im also from the midwest so it's not like one of those from nyc everyone already knows each other stories.

To the individuals who took it upon themselves to destroy the snowman that we had built between Becker and Rose today:,"Why did you do this? What manner of negativity possessed you to perform such a cruel and selfish act?

To every poor soul in PHYS 2213...,"Listen up, guys. I'm looking through the approximately 500 practice problems that Ivan the Terrible posted, and I've come to the realization that I simply don't have the mental effort to work through these, or to even attempt to just interpret the answer keys. 

This entire class really has been a team effort, from piggybacking off of each other's questions in office hours, to the lecture questions, and especially to the CO-OPs. The final for this class is frankly just one big annoyance at this point. So I say, let's keep that same energy going into the final, and let's collectively agree to make the mean really, really abysmally low. Like, I'm talking lower than your chances of getting that internship at Goldman or SpaceX, lower than your GPA, lower than your self esteem. To the tryhards/kids to whom electromagnetism just comes naturally, good for you, guys, but on the final, please just take one for the team and write down ""Jσε"" for every question, and maybe whatever poor unsuspecting TA grades your questions will have the particular misfortune of writing ""joe who?"" on your test. If you're not into that, you could always just do the test to the best of your ability, then do what you do for the Learning Catalytics in lecture and simply raise all your answers to the zero power at the end of the test.

The means for the prelims were both pretty low, the class is curved to a B+, we get 3 problem sets dropped, and it's really just not worth it to study at this point... I think we can all agree that this is the best move for everyone involved. If you have any specific questions on how to be really bad at physics, feel free to contact me, it's one of the few things I consider myself to be an expert at.",1576613303,1,0

It’s not all SA’s fault but the SA is at fault. Some thoughts:,"I agree with the sentiment that this is not entirely SA’s fault. The calendar committee is made up of mostly faculty/staff with the SA added on. However, if you read the report to the committee comments at the end, you can see that only 2 students (both I presume are SA) commented on the issue. The longest part of **both** students’ comments (pg. 36-37) is about how the new calendar would affect the amount of time IFC and Panhell members have to spend at home over break. Neither comment mentions the increased stress of fewer study days. As an IFC member, I would like to clarify to both members of the SA that commented that **I am here to learn first and socialize second.** I return to school early **by choice**. I study as much as I can because Cornell is a hard school and I am here to learn what I am being taught. The fact that nobody on SA dissented to switching the calendar because of student mental health (nobody on SA voted for the current [as it was] calendar) is horrifying. We elect you guys to represent the interests of the students and it is abundantly clear that you failed to do so. So, yes, the entire calendar committee is to blame for this travesty, but the SA is supposed to have our backs just as we had theirs during SA elections.

Student Assembly,"Admins are laughing at us all blame the exam scheduling crisis on the student assembly, most of whom graduated before the schedule changes went into full effect. Only a bunch of fools would let the students make any sort of meaningful decision (schedule, admin fees, etc.) by fools like the students. It is far too likely that the SA is a scapegoat organization that can be used to push these agendas without any backlash – they can just point back at the student body and say that we elected the SA. 

Even if there was a ""real"" vote on such decisions, there had to have been influence (direct or indirect) from the administration. Most people already are aware of the fishy circumstances regarding elections here, as we can recall candidates in the past being disqualified for reasons that to this day remain ambiguous. If I were a betting person (I'm not), I would place a good deal of cash on designating student elections as bullshit as the student assembly's role in making legitimate decisions. Remember when free printing began in October? Me neither. 

That's because the school realized it *cost money*, so rather than directly saying ""no"" after an approval was prematurely made, the administration launched a succession of committees, meetings, and other bureaucratic requirements designed to do nothing but slow the process down. Just wait until next semester, when it gets delayed again.

There are actually a fair number of probable ulterior reasons for a final exam schedule change (such as higher internship/job ranking, etc). Some bad ones are related to rush week, and reducing (HA!) the stress the final exam period puts the students. In fact, just about every other shit reason like this is listed in the well-known decision report, which is but another sad byproduct of the business-like, bureaucratic-based system that this place has running. Over 100 page report of what? Whoever got paid to write that was probably giggling the whole time at how fucked things were going to turn out. 

If you were as infuriated as I was to get kicked out of the library at 12 the day before an exam, rather than say, ""fuck the SA, fuck gov majors, fuck the frats"" keep in mind who actually has control of such decisions. A truly student-supportive school would have looked a proposal to *take away study time* and prevented such an idiotic concept at all costs. So write a letter to the registrar or somebody like CEO Martha and ask, what in the fuck is going on?

Please listen to the new petitioners!! They want Ohio to switch to renewable energy!,"I know, the petitioners the past few weeks were aggressive, annoying, and we all wanted them gone. We will call the annoying ones petitioner A. 

There are new petitioners on campus right now, I will call them petitioner B. They have new sign sheets that are vertical, whereas petitioner A sheets were horizontal. 

Petitioner B is a petition to have Ohio switch to more renewable energy sources instead of using coal. They were here awhile ago but OSU banned them for a couple weeks because a student got into an altercation with one of them (I don’t know all the info on that)

Petitioner A will be directly affected by changing to renewable energy, they work with coal and their business would lose a big chunk of money if we switch to renewable energy. However, renewable energy is so much better for the environment and would provide a large amount of jobs to replace the jobs we would lose in the coal business!! 

Also, petitioner A people were getting paid per signature, petitioner B people are purely activists trying to have Ohio switch to more sustainable practices.

As I’m sure you’ve noticed, there have been tons of petitioners flooding campus talking about government bailouts, climate change, and energy efficiency standards. Currently a battle ensues between the coal and nuclear lobbyists and the environmental organizations.

Earlier this year, House Bill 6 was signed by the governor allowing two of Ohio’s coal companies and two nuclear companies to disregard Ohio’s energy efficiency standards. In addition, they are increasing Ohioan’s energy taxes to provide money for four governmental bailouts of those same companies. When a bill is signed by the governor it goes straight into effect without receiving votes from citizens. 

There are two petitions currently floating around campus: one by the environmentalists and one by the coal/nuclear lobbyists. The environmentalists are petitioning to gain ballot access on a referendum to house bill 6. This allows a vote on Election Day for, or against, this bill, hoping to kill it at the polls. These petitioners are identifiable by a large paper packet attached to their petitions, containing: an explanation to what the petition is, a certification from the attorney general that this is a legal petition, and they always ask if you’re a registered voter of Ohio before allowing you to sign the petition. Some of them are paid, some are volunteers. However, NONE of them are paid per signature. The other petition is from the coal and nuclear companies who hope to stop the referendum from reaching the polls because they assume people will vote against it. They are identifiable by one page petitions with a statement of certification at the bottom. They are not verified by the attorney general, so have no seal of approval to verify they are real. This is a political tactic called blocking. Blocking is used to confuse the public into thinking they already signed the petition so there is no need to sign again if they are ever approached by the environmentalists. People doing this are called blockers, and are paid $8 per signature. They typically do not ask if you’re registered to vote. 

I hope this clears things up!",1571326381,109,0

Petitioning to take 19 credits,"Anyone here successfully petition for 19 credit hours of classes their freshman year?

Anyway, I talked to my advisor the other day and was told that I probably won’t get approved for the 19 credits. I currently have As/A-‘s and am taking 17 credit hours. I’m also in a few different sport clubs that I plan on quitting next semester that take up about 18 hours of my week. I’m wondering if anyone knows what my chances are of actually getting approved?

I talked to the advisor a few days ago about that, and I was told they'd take the Calc 2 over the calc 1.  That being said, the *and prerequisites* part confuses me.

Anyways, with the preface all done, I recall hearing in my survey class (from the instructor) that after you get 180 credit hours, osu stops giving you some sort of monetary benefit?

The student was friendly, but he scratched my old lenses when checking my prescription (I went back to complain and got free lenses so there’s that) and the entire exam took nearly 3 hours (you’re a guinea pig and the student goes through a lot of tests that aren’t necessary for a young adult). An actual doctor needs to check the student’s work... you get bright lights and lasers shined in your eyes not once but twice!

I need help but I don’t know what to do,"Hello all, 

This semester has been probably the hardest of my life. Im in the engineering field and I honestly don’t know what to do. Its my 3rd year of college and i feel helpless. Its my first semester on the main campus i spent the last 2 on a regional campus. Im currently looking at most likely getting all Ds or Ds and Cs my current GPA is 2.4. ( yes i know my gpa really isnt that good however over the first 2 years of college i had a lot of untimely deaths in my family and close circle of friends life was hard) My course load has been 2 different engineering courses one high level math course and a general chemistry course. Its not that i don’t care about my academics because i really do. I’ve been too embarrassed about my academic struggles to go to people about them especially with my family because they would probably shun me and I’d be viewed as a disgrace or disappointment. Obviously i want to do well and i want to graduate from this school. I really enjoy the track i am on and the things I study in class but i get this feeling that I either A) don’t belong there or B) cant keep focus long enough to grasp all concepts in lectures. My recent failure has ultimately pushed me into a hopeless depression that I can’t seem to free myself from. I do live on campus as well. Yes i made a throwaway account for this because people might know me. I appreciate any meaningful feedback on what i can do to fix this and I appreciate anyone who actually took the time to read about my personal problems i don’t ever open up about my feelings to anyone.

Financial Aid Not Disbursed,"I recently enrolled in classes for the spring 2020 semester. At the advice of my advisor, I enrolled in three courses totaling 15 credit hours. I wasn't able to get a seat in one of them, so I was only enrolled in 11 hours worth of courses, technically not a full time student. 

The tuition payment date for spring semester is coming up in december and when I looked at my buckeyelink statement of account I found that only a small portion of my financial aid was being applied to the total. I've enrolled in an additional class now, thinking that maybe my credit hours were the issue (this was about 30 minutes ago).

If anyone has had this problen before, should I expect the rest of the financial aid to come through soon, or should I be worried?

Thanks.",1574371611,1,0

Late Scholarship Payment and Fees Due,"I have a few external scholarships that I have to send updates in order to receive money for the following semester (term grades and the new bill). I'm pretty sure fees are due today and I haven't heard anything about one of my scholarships. Buckeyelink is closed and the scholarship trustees are not answering their phone or responding to email. I don't want to get slapped with any late fees, so I'm considering paying off the rest of my balance and hoping to get it back as a refund when my scholarship finally comes through

Does anyone know if making such a payment will alter my financial aid package in any way (i.e., will I get hosed of my refund if I make this payment myself rather than allowing my scholarship to pay it and missing out on a chunk of my refund due to late fees)?

Tired of the Crime?,"I honestly just wanted to make the most recent post possible about this to really gauge if maybe I'm not alone in worrying about this stuff.  I have to take a fifth year to finish up at OSU, but I have spent both of my off campus years in a high rise apartment building 2 steps from campus making it perfect for avoiding violent/confrontational crime at all costs.  However, it's incredibly expensive and I can't afford to keep living there for another year and so my sorry butt is now left frantically searching for living options with no experience with dealing with the dangers that seem to come with housing literally any further.  Is anyone else just tired of seeing the neighborhood notices spread closer and closer to campus and further West of High and North of Lane? Some of them sound like absolute horror stories to me, some in the middle of the day, early night time, it doesn't seem to matter where or when you are anymore.  I have no idea where to even try looking for housing with the combination of not having roommates, a budget, and what may be an irrational fear of Columbus and that itself terrifies me too.  As in to the point of wishing I could take all my last classes online so I can move back home to a place I can walk to my car at 5 PM without fear of being held at gunpoint.  These notices have long spread from 4th street, too.  Almost all of them for the past year or two have been north of 13th it seems and many near Waldeck (very close to campus and very north).  I know I'm being dramatic about it but honestly I don't have people to walk everywhere with, and how do you even leave the house after 5 PM during winter? Maybe I'm done with OSU in general at this point from being here so long lol but I'm ready to leave these muggers behind.

Despite meeting all the criteria he outlined (in syllabus) for each assignment (but no mention of point value for specific criteria), and turning in great work, he has taken more points from me and my classmates than we think is right or fair. 

His justification for the point deductions is weak, and everything has been along the lines of “but I wanted this...” - which has been mentioned after the assignments were turned in and not before.

Final Exam Stories,"With the approach of everyone’s favorite week of the year, I thought I’d share my favorite final exam story I’ve had so far.

Last semester I had a class that normally started at 12:45 and the final was from 12-1:45. I wrote down the correct time of the final and everything, but on the day of, I mixed the two up and just had the idea that the final was starting at 12:45 instead of 12. My boyfriend called me a few minutes after 12 and asked what time my final was, and the slow horror set in that my final had already started. I was at home, so it took me about 20 minutes to run to my class, but when I got there, **the professor wasn’t there yet**. The class was completely full and everyone was just as confused as I was. Turns out he had made the same mistake I had and thought the final started at 12:45. I couldn’t believe my luck.

Anyone else have any good final exam stories? Horror stories, funny stories, etc.?",1575584668,1,0

Rent/lease for fall 2020,"Hey r/OSU 
I know I made a post about this before, but now I'm actively searching and advertising for a place to rent/lease for fall 2020. I already have one person (a friend of mine from high school) who's going to be moving with me, but because rent is so high in the city, I'm also potentially looking for a third signer. If you're looking for someone to take your lease, or someone to lease with please send me a message with details. Ideally the apartment/house would allow pets (dogs and/or cats), and would be close to campus or a bus stop/shuttle.  I'm not trying to go over $1050 a month, but again, as rent is pricey that number is a bit flexible.

Complaining about 2 PSYCH professors,"So I’ve had a few experiences with 2 Psychology individual professors that I believe have hindered my ability to learn in their classes.

Professor 1) Their office hours where during my classes so I followed the advice listed on the syllabus and emailed them to schedule office hours outside of their normal ones. The first time I scheduled with them I waited outside their office and they never showed up, after emailing them to ask where they were they responded by saying they’d completely forgotten we’d made an appointment. The second time I scheduled to meet with them I again waited outside their office and when they didn’t show up I emailed them and they said they’d written down the wrong date in their planner and weren’t there and didn’t show up again. Afterward, we finally arranged to meet before class started, they walked in at 10:10 when class began at 10:20 and gave me the midterm I’d wanted to go over and told me to ask them if I had any questions, the whole experience felt rushed and was generally unhelpful as they tried to cram it in just before class began.

Professor 2) I again tried to arrange office hours outside of their normal ones because theirs were during times I had classes. We had arranged to meet before class time, at 9:15 when the class started at 9:35. I arrived at 9:15 and waited for them as they weren’t there yet, they strolled in at 9:25 and when I went up to the podium to ask them go over the quiz we’d recently taken (which I’d explained in our email exchange) they claimed we “didn’t have time before class.” This bothered me because they were the party that showed up late. Afterward he came up to me individually and claimed we’d never officially scheduled an appointment to meet before class. After going over our emails I’d had said to him “thank you, I’ll see you before class on Tuesday” so we definitely had made the appointment official. I emailed him a screenshot of the email we’re I had confirmed our appointment and asked if we could make another appointment before our next class, he never responded and the experience in class made me uncomfortable with going to him for help going forward.

Sorry for the long explanations but I was wondering if either, both, or neither of these situations are grounds for filing a complaint against these professors? Thank you for your help in advance.",1572455802,4,0

Switching to Nursing,"I’m nearing the end of my first semester here at OSU as a Neuroscience Pre-Med major, and i’m starting to think it isn’t the right path for me. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love health care and (in the least morbid way possible) I love being in a hospital, so i’m 99% sure I want to work in one.

I thought I wanted to do Pre-Med, but as I look to my future I’m starting to realize that I chose that as a way to make my parents happy and not as a way to make myself happy. I played around with the idea of doing nursing in high school and got really interested in it, but my parents shot it down and told me I would be “wasting my education” if I did that, and I believed them, so I got rid of the idea completely. 

Now as the semester comes to a close, I’m realizing I’m struggling with my classes because I’m not passionate about the future I’ve created for myself. I’ve been joking about switching to nursing since i came here, but now I’m feeling really serious about it. I was going to stay in Neuroscience and do their Pre-Nurse Practioner path, but I realized I wasn’t a huge fan of the department recently and now I’m thinking I’m going to switch to the Nursing major. 

I looked on the website and I won’t have the gpa after this semester (because I was struggling) to switch to the Pre-Nursing major, so I’m thinking I’m going to stay in Neuroscience but ignore the classes they tell me to take and take the classes I need to apply for the Nursing program. The good news is, I already have credit for all the courses Pre-Nursing majors are taking now. I emailed the department, but since it’s scheduling season, I was sent an automated message telling me not to expect a reply for 2-3 business days so that’s why I’m turning to Reddit to help answer some of my questions.

I’m a little confused about applying to the program. Do I have to have all of my pre-requisite classes completed by the time I apply, or do I just need to have them scheduled and ready to take? 

I’m also very stressed about the gpa I have now and the odds of me getting into the program because of it. I am in Chem 1210 and Bio 1113 this semester (which I’m realizing are difficult to take your first semester of college, especially when you don’t have solid studying habits) and I know I’ll probably get a B or B+ in Bio, but Chem is a toss up because of the weighting. It’s looking like I’ll probably get a B- though. Even if I do very well next semester, will my odds still be low to get into the program? I’ve seen people say they were stressed about getting in with a 3.9.",1572380330,1,0

Harding Hospital/other psych hospitals in Columbus,"Hey guys. Long story short, I’m in a pretty bad spot mentally right now and I need help. I want to admit myself to a psychiatric hospital before it gets even worse and it looks like Harding is the closest option I have, but am open to alternatives if anyone has any recommendations because I’ve heard some not so great things about Harding. I’ve been put into a psychiatric hospital before and that included them escorting me to there with an ambulance. I’d like to avoid that if I possibly can because neither myself nor my parents can really afford all the fees that come along with that, being put in the hospital alone is most likely going to financially wreck my family and I if it’s anything like last time.

We got a message the day of the exam that the submission had been fixed, though I had finished early and forgot that I had errors in the first place, assuming I had handed it in already since I never submit assignments late.

Okay, momentarily seemed normal, until he stood up to reveal he was naked from the waist down and made it fully aware to me he was jacking off. 

I’ve seen a lot of weird and bad shit in my life so it didn’t bother me personally too much but I know it could be a lot for other people (it still creeped me tf out). I was so in “keep walking mode” and “don’t look back” as I could see him staring at me whilst still standing the whole time I walked by in my peripheral I didn’t get the house number to potentially report it, but if you’re walking down Neal somewhere around the intersection with 7th (I think) beware of this creep He’s probably done with his show now but I’m not sure when the next showing is.

I don’t want to say this guy was definitely an OSU student, but he probably was because of age and location and man, if you’re on here what the actual fuck. Not only are you a creep but I’d hate for people (especially as it looks like a lot of parents are visiting this weekend) to think this is what all the young guys at OSU at like because I know they are not.

Selling student football tickets to non-students/young alums with BuckID with move to mobile tickets? How is this playing out?,"  

Old fogey here! I graduated a few years ago but kept my BuckID and the paper tickets made life so easy the past couple of years to go to the games.   
 

I pay above face value for some of the premium games (but waaaaaay below Stubhub, etc.) – college student makes some extra cash. We all win.   
 

I had no idea OSU made the move to e-tickets until this skull session a few weeks ago: [https://www.elevenwarriors.com/skull-sessions/2019/09/106696/ohio-state-football-urban-meyer-competitive-retire-coaching-student-ticket-decline-sales-alabama-plan-bribe](https://www.elevenwarriors.com/skull-sessions/2019/09/106696/ohio-state-football-urban-meyer-competitive-retire-coaching-student-ticket-decline-sales-alabama-plan-bribe)

 

Not surprised given most sporting events are moving to 100% mobile but wondering how this is playing out at OSU. I saw a few Reddit threads on this early in the season but didn’t sound like people had a handle on what was going on. I figure there were a lot of out of town people visiting for the UC and Miami games – how did that go? How hard was it to transfer student tickets to non-students?  
 

So cutting to the chase, if a couple alum friends and I want to go to game and possibly sit with our grad school friends – how do we do that? Going to Cbus for homecoming this weekend, on the fence about the game due to the new ticket policies.   
 

I’m skeptical of screenshots since doesn’t Ticketmaster use rotating barcodes now? Is adding to Apple Wallet a way around this? How much is the fee for students to upgrade the ticket to transfer to me?  
 

Any insight, guidance or advice would be great appreciate. Go Bucks!",1570205356,0,0

Experienced Problems at OSD?,"Story: I submitted all the documents needed for determining eligibility in June for taking summer classes. I'm a student diagnosed (at a young age) with ADHD and I have received accommodations at my previous schools. I submitted documents and met with XXXX (I do not know if I'm allowed to state the name of the specialist) at the initial intake appointment and was stated I can get accommodations on a provisional basis. After that, I tried contacting her several times (since mid-august) even dropped in at the OSD office several days but no response. The front desk and call answering people kept telling me I cannot meet until after Sept 2nd week. I explained to them several times the summer class is over by that time and why would I need to meet then. 

My final attempt of trying to contact: I dropped into the office still not allowed to meet so I called after one-hour, same response then called again after 3-4 hours (a different person answered) started giving me the same typical story you have to make an appointment bla bla... and I responded back saying you guys keep saying you don't have appointments then how can i meet..... I finally said a bit angrily I need you to transfer me to this person and the person on the line responded back saying she is busy and I told the girl on the phone tell her that I'm calling regarding a summer class and that I need a response. 

She took my name and then finally transferred and here she responds to me I will submit docs to the committee but I cannot guarantee you will get any accommodations (My first thought: was she thinking I gave docs for her to hold on to them or something and what the hell was she doing without submitting docs to committee all this time). She responds to me that my documents are years old (All medical docs submitted were within the last 10 months). I had patience and asked her can you proceed with the current school accommodations letter and the submitted docs and then within 2days I was approved minimum accommodations and she itself told to me meet a different specialist (IDK why).

Long story short: I completely felt like she completely ignored (neglected needs) me on purpose but IDK if that's how the OSD office at UCSD works since this was my first time interacting with the office. I honestly feel bad for those students that cannot get services even with documented disabilities since they have to go through specialists like her.  

OSD office at UCSD should have a better screening process when hiring specialists like her and higher-ups need to stop acting like you don't know/ see these. 

Feel free to provide feedback and if anyone has experienced similar situations at the OSD office share them. Let's fightback to end this!",1568341944,1,0

Be careful of Landlord Practices!!! Beware of this landlord!,"I am an UCSD alumni. After I graduated, my landlord (Joseph Gertz) sent me a long list of items that I destroyed!

Messed Up - Late Enrollment,"Hey! So the story goes the I (an incoming fall student) messed up big time with my TB req because somehow I mixed up the immunizations record deadline with the TB deadline, and I thought it was due September 15th (I'm off by a solid 2 months). However, luckily I was able to clear the hold on my account, and I can still enroll through WebReg.

Now comes my real issue. Since I'm about 7 days late, all the classes I need to take have been taken. For my comp sci major, it's ideal if I get to take either CSE 8B or CSE 11, Math 20C, SXTH 20A, and a couple of GEs, and the ones needed for my major have a fat waitlist.

I did manufacture my own demise, but does anyone have any advice for my problem? I couldn't find a thread that addressed it, so feel free to link me to that if it's easier.

   1. – Make to-do lists at the beginning of the week (Sunday) for each day of the week – and make sure to complete them
2. If there is reading material, read it before the lesson of that material
3. If professors lecture in a certain outline, take notes in the same way
4. After each class, clean up notes + identify things that were not understood
   1. – take these things to office hours / discussions
   2. – combine lecture notes with reading notes
5. Review notes before a discussion class
6. Keep all loose paper from a class in class folder
7. Turn off phone while studying or keep it away
8. Before a party, Netflix, or any distraction be completely done with school work for the day
9. Sleep at least 6h a night and maintain sleep schedule consistent
   1. iPhone clock app works well for this

Immunizations Issue.,"Hey everyone, looking for some help with an issue that just came up. After the first round of Immunization history back in July, I got some messages saying I had some issues with a few. No problem I thought, I'll just go in and get the doses I need. However, my doctor said that two were likely in error because of my time abroad as a child: My Varicella and MMR vaccines. They gave me the one dose they thought I needed and a letter saying that they could vouch for my immunity. The school did not accept the letter, and recommended that I go back and get a blood titer for MMR and Varicella. So I set up another appointment a week later, go in, get my blood drawn, and await results. I got what I was expecting for MMR, immune, but for Varicella, I was notified that I was not, in fact, immune like I was told. Once again I thought that I would just make another appointment and squeeze it in just before the due date. Except that you need two doses 20 days apart. Which means my second dose will be passed the deadline. So I guess my question is will they be ok if I upload proof I am undergoing inoculation? Or will I be penalized in some way?

Thanks for any help or advice, sorry for the long post

New tool to help UCSD students choose their classes!,"[TLDR](https://bettercape.com)

Hello! I know many of us are scrambling to pick out classes last minute to round out their course-load for the beginning of Fall quarter. To help with this process, I have built a tool to help us make more informed decisions about the courses and professors we choose, by taking advantage of the thousands of student-submitted CAPEs. This tool was developed to better organize the data provided on [cape.ucsd.edu](https://cape.ucsd.edu). The following is a few features to justify the project's name, [BetterCape.com](https://BetterCape.com):

&amp;#x200B;

* Aggregate data -- Combines all similar courses a professor has taught to give a more complete overview of their class.

[For example, our good friend Gary has taught CSE 15L twenty seven times and over those twenty seven courses students have received an average grade of 3.26. Enrolling in a Gary course might be worth it with those stats :O](https://i.redd.it/2f4jzznd0lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Expand the aggregate data to get a breakdown of all courses.

[Clicking on a row in the table will bring up a modal showing all the courses that make up the aggregate data. Here, by clicking on the Gary row, we can see all of the twenty seven CSE15L courses he has taught, and the stats for each.](https://i.redd.it/pust17zs0lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Course grouping -- Whereas the order in which UCSD displays the CAPE data is sorted by quarter and lexicographically (causing CSE 100 to come before CSE 11, for example), BetterCape groups courses together by their numeric course code ordering and orders by term within that. This makes searching through a whole department much more intuitive.

[Very readable, incredible.](https://i.redd.it/xarqc9c51lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Filters! A feature completely missing from traditional capes.

[Here we are searching for upper division courses in the CSE department, taught during the years 2017 up to and including 2019, with an average received GPA of at least 3.5.](https://i.redd.it/qt2tv7ii1lo31.png)

So yeah, if this looks like it would be useful to you, I would love to have you guys check it out. At the very least, I think it is a much cleaner version of UCSD's capes. I would love some feedback from you guys! If this is something I see people are actually using I would definitely like to expand it to do some more interesting analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if this is something you think would be interested in working in, especially for people who are more talented than I with UX / web design definitely lemme know! (Mobile in particular is garbage at the moment)

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck with your Fall quarter everyone, hope this helps!",1569348770,198,0

Minoring in CS as a Cog Sci: Neuroscience Major.,"Hey guys, so I am in my **junior year** and I really need some advice on whether or not I should pursue CSE minor.

Background:

**Cog sci, neuroscience majo**r, and I was pre-med until this year where I realize I want to do research more (so grad school, Ph.D. kinda direction).

So as for now, I should be able to graduate a year or at least 2 quarters early.

Motivation:

So since I decided on the change of my career direction it gave me a lot more free time to take classes that I am more interested in.

The reason why I want to have a cs minor is because I want to have a better understanding and grasp on programming overall with the hope that it will further my career and maybe merge my passion in neuroscience with AI/deep learning and stuff?? Because, I am not planning on staying in academia after grad school and I think programming is just a very useful skill to have.

Worries:

One of my biggest concerns is the tuition.

\- Since I am an international student, I have to pay roughly 16K quarterly. So it is quite a financial burden for my family and I. Because if I decide to just graduate early, I would apply for a lab technician job and start earning some income and then apply for grad school.

Another concern is:

\- are these classes actually useful? Or are they helpful for direct application? Because I know computer science does not equal software development and from the minor website, I saw we also need to learn about discrete math, some Computer engineering-related classes?? So is it really worth the effort and money? I mean I could always just take a boot camp class online to learn what I really need to know for my field. (e.g. Deep learning?)

Current situation:

I have taken cogs 18, cogs 108, and I am taking cogs 109 and CSE 8A rn.

So I would say I feel more comfortable (still have a lot to learn) with python and I had no experience with Java or C.

So what is your guys’ perspective on this?",1571440994,1,0

it also doesnt help that it takes me like over 6 hours to do one reading most of the time. even if i say i have a goal of reading them i feel i am just incapable of doing it.. :(

how do you manage to incorporate it into your life?",1571437791,7,0

(This is for CENG/NANO 15) I have two more midterms in this class that will be open PC and I will need MATLAB and if I can't connect for any I probably won't do well.

Clarification: I have a chromebook, so I am forced to use the online version, while most other people are able to install it on their computer. Also my service (T-mobile) doesn't have good data in Center so the hotspot isn't strong enough to load the online version.

Even if you're passionate about and enjoy reading law, avoid it as it will just demoralize you. It has the hardest curve of any course i've ever heard of because going by raw scores the average *and median* fails every exam. You won't fail (because of the curve it's almost impossible to) but your GPA will take a hit that just isn't worth it.

Of course, it's not impossible to do well in the course if you want to overachieve, go to office hours every week and develop a relationship with the profs/TAs to understand. In a class of 200 that simply isn't practical for everyone especially not for students who don't live on campus. It also shouldn't be compulsory to go to office hours to do well in a course.

What can/should I do?,"This is my first real quarter at UCSD, I was here over the summer and took two courses and passed both. However, before the fall quarter began I went through something devastating and got major depression and I barely got diagnosed about two weeks ago. I wasn't able to focus as much as I wanted to, so I ended up failing two classes, and dropping one and getting a W on my transcript because the class I dropped was a lab. The only class I passed was my writing class.

My major is neurobio and I failed chem 6a and math 10a (the final screwed me up). Im worried about multiple things, my GPA, having to repeat pretty much an entire quarter, having two F's and a W on my transcript, not being able to receive financial aid because I failed two classes and now my GPA is hella low, being put on academic probation.

The chem 6a classes all have a waitlist, and so do the 10a classes and the 10a classes conflict with my BILD 1 class (which I need for my major and college requirements, and atleast this way I'll be able to get back on track with my BILD courses), so I can't drop BILD 1 to put myself on the 10A of 6A waitlist.

For now I have, CAT 2, CGS 105, FILM 87 as my enrolled courses and COGS 3 (for my college requirements) waitlisted. 

 I can't change my major because it's something that I not only want to pursue, but need to pursue. Neurobio is a path I have to stick to.

Originally I didn’t believe the rumors I heard that UCSD wants students to be unsuccessful but...,"Tomorrow is Halloween and I have a friend who has a midterm tomorrow, one on Friday, AND one on Saturday. What kind of school plans midterms like that?! It’s pretty inevitable that college kids are gonna want to go out on halloweekend, so why schedule a midterm on those days rather than earlier in the week...? It sucks that you basically have to choose between academics and having a social life here- no, I don’t mean just prioritizing, because when you have THIS workload on a popular holiday it seems pretty impossible to balance. Students should be able to go out (or at least not have midterms) on weekends where literally everyone’s out partying or celebrating, and not have this type of stress, but maybe that’s just me.",1572490115,0,0

How would she even understand her lectures, let alone communicate with anyone of her professors/TAs or understand exam questions? Maybe she doesn't if she's a STEM major? How did she even get into this school? I know reading and writing is a separate skill than speaking and listening but her understanding of English and lack of knowing basic words really blew my mind.

Where does all the school's money go?,"Ok so it has been brought to my attention in the other thread that international students pay $70k.

Seventy Thousand American Dollars. This year broke the record for the most enrolled students at UCSD, and I think something along the lines of the most international students (don't quote me on this) or at least a very high percentage.

So why do we still lack basic shit like Wi-fi and parking?

When people complain about parking, there are always those who mention ""what's the big deal"", ""the walk isn't that bad"". And yeah, I agree that with walking for 30 mins and leaving early isn't too bad. It gives me a chance to exercise and listen to a podcast..if it were FREE. Paying $30,000 to be forced to park elsewhere, or pay even more to barely find spots is worth complaining about. I get some of you guys are looking this as a half glass full kinda situation, but I don't think some of you realize how much $30,000 is. If everyone becomes content with this, we'll soon pay $45,000 to walk and listen to a podcast.

Anyway, where are all our funds going? Is there no possible way to see how much of our budget is going towards A and B, etc?

This might be a dumb question but I really am curious: why can't we vote on things like this? I feel what we can vote on are pretty irrelevant for the most part. 

It's not like we're asking for valet parking for each student either. Just a paved lot with some paint on it. And whatever it takes to make wifi better? What are you supposed to do to fix the wifi problem? How much would it cost?

Free Photos at MCC on 11/27,"Hello Tritons!

TL;DR? Free photos for you, in exchange for posing for a photo on Wednesday, November 27th, from 10:00 AM until 2:30 PM. Held at Studio 140 inside the Media Center and Communication Building. First come, first served.

Friendly neighborhood /u/CruzedDude here with a fantastic offer. A free photo for you to do whatever you want. Yup. That's right: free.

Desperately need to update that aging tinder profile? Maybe the insta feed needs a different angle? Or just nothing better to do on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving break?

The catch is I'd like you to pose for a photo. The pose in question is incredibly simple in nature: give the camera the bird, while saying, ""~~Fuck you~~!"" or your favorite swear word.

You may be saying to yourself, ""This is quite the odd request. I wonder why in the world would this otherwise normal person, resort to taking photos containing such unpleasant language, and vulgar gestures?"" The answer to that is simple: a recent critique became just a little too heated. After talking to a grad student that I have better rapport with, we agreed that [this is how](https://youtu.be/kjS6bQ5OQ-o?t=40) most critiques in VisArts typically are conducted. We chuckled, but the conversation birthed this fun project.

So if you feel like you like to be apart of gallery, which I have no intention of reproducing beyond my own personal portfolio (treat this post as a form of promissory estoppel), stop by Studio 140 at the [Media Center and Communication Building](https://goo.gl/maps/E6ozwVyvBzVBfvqy7), on Wednesday, November 27th, from 10:00 AM to 2:30 PM. The format will be first come, first serve. 1 pose will equal a photo of your choice (more if there isn't much of a line). You'll get a RAW file via email. 

I want this to be clear: I will not be editing your photos for you. Every digital media lab computer already lets you do that for free with Photoshop, and I do have other classwork that demands my time.

There will be colored gels on hand to select from to give you photos a bit of unique identity. And the only dress code will be that you're wearing clothes, I may be an artist, but I'm not an *artist*.

Thanks for your consideration, and thank [the Space Pope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT7tac9h8Gw) that the quarter is almost over.",1574465478,1,0

Anyone Interested in a Poetry/Literature Club?,"I've always loved reading, but there doesn't seem to be a club for this at UCSD. Especially for those doing STEM (like me), it would be nice to be able to spend some time talking about the themes found in poetry/literature.  Would anyone be interested? The idea would be to have regular meetups, providing a friendly environment to discuss, analyze, and share works. The focus would be on reading, but perhaps sharing our own written works could be a component. If things go well, then eventually we could become an official org on campus. Personally, some of my favorite poets include E.E. Cummings, Emily Dickinson, and T.S. Elliot. If you're interested, msg me!",1574456678,1,0

Missed an appointment with a TA. What's a good way to make it up?,"So I made an appointment with a TA (9:30AM) but I overslept  and just woke up (11:30AM).

First thing, of course, I emailed apologizing profusely. I have never made an appointment and just not showed up without any kind of communication because that's just some things in life you just dont do.

I feel horrible. I wish there was a way to make it up to the TA, without seeming like I'm bribing or whatever. Just wanna do something nice because if I were in the TA's shoes, I would have been pretty pissed.

Can anyone suggest a good way to make it up? Obviously not by making another appointment. Any advice would be appreciated.

I had a quiz in that class too, not that it compares to no-showing on a TA but just makes it a little worse you know? God I hate myself...

Prejudice against Chinese international students at UCSD,"Hi, everyone! I'm writing this because I feel concerned about what I see as an unfair prejudice some of us American students harbor. Specifically, I think there are uninformed and unkind stereotypes about Chinese international students that as UCSD students, that we should challenge. One of the common stereotypes I see is that Chinese international students only associate with other international students, and don't adjust to U.S. culture. My response to that is, of course that's how some of them act! They are far away from home in an unfamiliar and difficult school, which (as is often mentioned in this subreddit) is not always the most welcoming place. If as English-primary-language people born and raised in the U.S., we were dropped feet-first into the University of Shanghai, we would probably act in a really similar way. I think Chinese international students deserve empathy and understanding for acting differently from the average U.S. student. After all, people are different from each other, and all have their own challenges. That doesn't mean they stop being people.

I think many of us would feel differently about the stereotypes we hear and repeat if we were to actually have a good conversation with our Chinese peers. I confess that I believed some of these stereotypes in the past. But after connecting as people and having conversations about grocery shopping, or the dorms, or shared experiences with classes, my opinion changed because I saw that Chinese international students are just students like us, but from a different place and set of challenges. If we find ourselves buying into this prejudice — and that's what it is, prejudice, because we are pre-judging people we often have not met or known personally — then maybe our first response should be to ask ourselves some questions. We can ask ourselves, have we really tried to understand? Do we even try to speak to Chinese international students? Or are we simply being afraid of something unfamiliar? I know that I didn't ask myself these questions for a long time, and believed mean and often inaccurate stereotypes because of it. As students and as growing, learning humans, we owe it to both ourselves and our peers to interrogate these stereotypes.",1574319612,1,0

A semi-solution to the parking issue that will probably never be taken into consideration - it would help so many students imo,"How about eliminating attendance points for lectures? Podcasting can still be up to the professors, yet certain discussions like Warren Writing where your participation is majority of your grade, can still remain mandatory. Say, if x% of the overall grade is based on participation alone, attendance can be chosen to be mandatory by the instructor.

There are plenty of classes that are podcasted, yet I-clicker points count for every lecture. That would also save you $70. Shouldn't knowledge of the material be far more valued than showing up and listening to the lecture live? I can't even stand my favorite sporting events live sometimes. Plus, many of them choose to sleep through lectures anyway. Why should reliability issues regarding transportation, rather lack of, be a factor in determining your grades? If the professor chooses to share important information before the podcast to reward those who make it to lecture or punish those who don't, such as relevant material on the final exam, then be it. The students' loss. (Of course location and other material should be posted somewhere in case of a student happening to miss class when crucial info like that is announced).

The whole ""legality of funds"" for parking argument doesn't matter imo, because it was the school's choice to get rid of S spots and designate more A and B spots. I'm sure the school can choose to open up more S spots without running into legal trouble.

How long until NR turns into an F? Anyone experience this?,"The professor has told me that my grade will be late. Probably because I had to make up work. So I didn't mind at all until I read about NR eventually turning into an F.... I don't wanna bug the professor just  yet, because he clearly told me that it will be late, and I told him that it's fine and to take his time.

I'm now concerned because I found out that after some time, the NR turns into a failing grade. Doesn't specify how long until it does tho. 

For those who aren't aware of what NR is:

&gt;""NR"" = An ""NR"" means ""no report."" An ""NR"" can only be assigned by the instructor. An ""NR"" is not calculated into the student's GPA, except for certain careers where it is converted to an ""ED"". An ""NR"" is subject to lapsing to a failing grade (""ED"") for certain careers.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; ""ED"" = An ""ED"" means ""unofficial drop."" An ""ED"" is calculated into the student's GPA as a failing grade. 

I will email the professor soon, don't wanna bug him when he's celebrating the holidays, especially because he clearly told me that he will report it late. I'm just concerned it's going to turn into an F.

Anyone else experience something like this? How long does it take for an NR turn into a failing grade?

* On academic history, it doesn't show anything. Grade is left blank.
* Only found out because I ran the degree audit and it says NR.
* Doesn't show up on late grades",1577362803,1,0

So I got a blank grade for CSE 12 with Gary, and I figured it was a mistake. Then I get an email from him stating “one or more of my PAs matched with those of past or current students’ PAs”. Funny thing is, I don’t know a single person  in the class, nor have I ever worked with anyone on a PA. I also don’t have any friends who took Gary that I talked to or asked for help. These PA’s are 100% done by me and done alone. 

I saw on the policies that I can request for documentation which led to the flagging, and I can’t wait to see it. But I still haven’t received an email from the AI office, and I assume I won’t until Jan 2. This is ruining my break, and I’m absolutely fuming. 

I didn’t do well in the class either. My PA average was like 75% and my final grade was a ~70%.

Any CAS CS majors frustrated with Wasserman's job-hunting resources?,"Given the school's reputation, the (high) quality of our classes, our location to the industry, and how much this shit costs... I'm really surprised and disappointed at how little Wasserman Manhattan does for CS students. Some points I noticed while focusing on getting myself hired in a new-grad position:

* On Campus Recruitment (OCR) has a negligible selection of tech firms. I signed on right at the start of recruitment season and the only big-name tech company I saw was Microsoft. MasterCard is also there but that's about it. The rest of the listings are all consulting firms or law offices. So now we need to deal with exploding offers, vague interviewing timelines, and all the other BS that goes on with recruiting when your school doesn't stand in your corner. 

* The career fair was just as bad. I could count the big name tech companies on one hand, and some of those felt like an afterthought. The Tandon career fair I've heard is much better, which is understandable. If they're not going to let us into that one, which is again understandable, at least don't schedule it for the *same exact date* so tech recruiters have a chance to visit both. 

* Handshake does nothing that public job boards don't already do. Its only purpose is to give desperate teaching nonprofits a platform to beg undergraduate students to consider them.

* The events are also lacklustre. Pretty much the same firms as OCR and the career fair, and not much is focused on tech. 

* I haven't met anybody at Wasserman Manhattan who actually knows something about the tech recruiting scene. Sure, it's nice to get my resume reviewed, but when they don't know what anything on there means it only goes so far. 

How do you all deal with this? I have very few friends graduated and working in tech that I can ask for advice/referrals from. I have no recruiters I'm communicating with because the career fair was a wash. I just feel blind and hopeless because the ""amazing job center"" we have here is utterly failing me during the critical recruitment season.",1569281694,31,0

"I am four years out of NYU and still doing service industry/manual labor jobs for near minimum wage, I don't know what to do with my life.","I regret how I approached employment outcomes and college. I was told to not really fixate on that and that at least a BA would give me an advantage over my high school degree. That ended up being totally wrong, to the point in which most of the jobs I have worked since don't even require a high school degree.

I had an okay GPA, decent internships, and have applied to thousands of jobs in the years since but I can't seem to find anything. I still volunteer regularly in the fields I am interested in to fluff my resume, but have never found work related to anything I studied. I am afraid to go back to grad school and repeat this same mistake with more debt but I am not sure what else I can do. 

Sorry for the rant, these past few years have been very emotionally taxing as I have experienced housing instability because of all this. Wasserman Center and all the ""alumni support"" has pretty much been a complete joke. I don't know what to do.",1568978013,10,0

"This Friday, 9/20, Midnight Confessions, and Sat, 9/21, Live at the Inn, BYOB, Variety shows","***Both shows*** are in the heart of Greenwich Village at New York’s oldest still-operating record store: **The Music Inn**. The store has been open since 1958 and has been used as a location in such shows as **“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Friday 9/20, Midnight Confessions** is a show where we ask the audience to anonymously write down a confession, true or false, and place it into a hat. The performers then take the confessions and act them out. Between confessions, we have sketches, some of the best up-and-coming musicians, and stand up comedians perform. 

I believe this is a great way for students to let off steam. I also believe this show provides a nice catharsis for students to anonymously share a secret, or their feelings about being new to the City, or the anxiety/stress they feel as a student and to have it externalized and acted out comically. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Saturday 9/21, “Live at the Inn”**: a variety showcase with comedy, music, and live sketches. “Live at the Inn” is a welcoming space for creatives, locals, and people new to New York City to gather and share an experience. Some of the best up-and-coming musicians, and stand up comedians perform here as well. 

This is a great day to share an experience with a creative community.

MS Computer Engineering with undergrad in CS.,"I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and I want to pursue my Master's in either ECE or CS (Tandon) with specialization in ML (Spring 2020). 

I am not interested in MS DS or MS CS (Courant) since I know I won't get in. So it is between Tandon's MS ECE and MS CS, I am leaning towards ECE as I believe it is relatively easier to get in. 

However, my coursework, projects as well as work experience are heavily ML oriented. 

So my question is how do I justify applying to ECE when:   
1. My field of interest is ML.  
2. My background is almost completely composed of programming and CS theory? I have taken a few hardware courses such as Computer Architecture, Wireless Technology and Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems as well as a couple projects but that's that. 

Won't the admissions committee think ""Why is he applying for Computer Engineering when his interest is in ML""? 

I have already checked out the program requirements as well as research and it seems like there are plenty of ECE courses (ECE-GY prefix) related to ML that an ECE student can take. Not to mention that the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering has a dedicated research area for Machine Learning while CS doesn't.  


Please note that apart from the 2 core courses, I have absolutely no intention whatsoever of taking hardware courses.",1568801401,3,0

MIDDLE EASTERN WOMEN 18 YEARS AND OLDER NEEDED FOR ONLINE STUDY

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Long Island University-Brooklyn and I am asking you to be a participant in my research.  This study is designed to help identify protective and risk factors that impact the psychological health of Middle Eastern/Arab American women. 

You will fill out a series of brief questionnaires.  This study will require about 45 minutes of your time.  Because the study focuses on Middle Eastern women, you are eligible to participate if you are a woman who is 18 years or older living in the United States and identify as Middle Eastern (including Arab or Arab-American from the following countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen).

If you participate, you can be entered into a raffle **to win one of twenty Amazon $20 gift cards**.  Additionally, you may find the study interesting!

You will also provide information that may help clinical psychologists learn about factors that impact the psychological health of Middle Eastern women.   Research data in this area would also provide information that would facilitate the administration of culturally informed psychotherapy in this population. 

To participate, go to:

Research Assistants at Economics Department,"Hi everyone,

I am currently in my junior year and am majoring in economics. My plan is to follow through with a PhD in said subject.

From what I have heard, one needs good research experience to make a good PhD application. I sort of have had no luck in this aspect. I have a good GPA, and from what I have seen, I can do the work most employers could ask for. The problem is in that I suspect that I haven’t networked much. 

Until now, my idea was that I would look for professors announcing vacancy through some medium in the department. However, I have found literally no such vacancy notices in the economics department. In fact, all other but professors from economics department post on NYU Job Search portal. 

Of course, there can be some very straightforward explanation to this, but I refuse to believe that NYU’s economics department doesn’t open its doors to undergrads for relevant research experience. 

If anyone has any relevant information that may help me out in landing a part time research assistant spot, I would be highly grateful.

Should I ED to NYU?,"Hi! I was wondering if y'all could help me decide if I should ED to NYU or my dream school--CMU. Before I start, I know my stats aren't super outstanding, but I am getting anxiety of being locked down to NYU in the very extreme case that I do get into CMU. I don't know if my situation is special or not but it is definitely complicated. The circumstance I'm under is that I studied and lived in Vietnam for 14 years (bc I'm Vietnamese), then I moved to Singapore and studied there for 2 years under their public education system. I got an O-Level grade of 10 which isn't spectacular but its good considering where I went to Singapore. I kind of lack extracurriculars in Singapore because all the students are to prioritize their focus into the O-Level Exam. I moved over to the US mid-year Junior year, so my Quarter 1 grades are missing from my GPA. Moreover, my school wouldn't add my grades from Singapore so my GPA isn't the actual GPA until the colleges I'm applying to do the calculations. I am doing the best I can right now at a competitive school and trying to use my senior year to boost my GPA. I hope y'all can help. Thank you! 

Here are my stats:

GPA (unweighted): 3.67 (not my actual GPA since I moved from Singapore to the USA and the school didn't consider my grades from my school in Singapore. 

SAT: 1420 

O-Level Grade: 10 (O-Level is like A-Level but for Sophomore Kids, it's much like a high school diploma over here. It is a national exam that over 80000 kids in Singapore take in order to continue their higher education)

Extracurriculars: 

\- Student council (Freshman and Sophomore Year in Singapore) (Kinda like class council)

\- Person-In-Charge of Robotics Club (Freshman and Sophomore Year)

\- Member of Executive Committee of Student Council (Sophomore Year) (So I was in charge of an aspect of the student council and oversaw the members in that group)

\- Participated in SASMO (Singapore Asian School Mathematics Olympiad) 

\- Participated in Research Competition at a Local Polytechnic (Singapore)

NYU Space Exploration Club,"Hello everybody!

For any of you that are interested in space exploration/astronomy/physics/space business/rocketry, I, along with a couple of other Tandon students have started a space exploration club. Though it is still in the incubation process, we hope to eventually have it become officialized and recognized by NYU. Below is the link to the Facebook group. We plan on hosting a couple events this fall as a trial run to see if there is enough interest.

Let me know what you guys think or if you have any suggestions. Thanks! :)

Leave of Absence Reversal,"Hi there. 

About a week ago, I was considering taking a leave of absence, and submitted a request on Albert. I did not turn in any of the paperwork that my school (Tisch) requires, and did not even offer a reason as to why I was requesting a leave. In that time, I decided that a leave wasn't truly what I wanted, and I quickly emailed my advisor asking how to proceed in reversing the leave. She responded saying she would correspond with someone else on the next move. This was last Thursday. 

My advisor nor the person she CC'd got back to me, I (regretfully) assumed that since I didn't turn in any actual paperwork the request would likely get denied or simply wouldn't process. Flash forward to today, and my request was approved. 

I'm kind of freaking the fuck out. I'm un-enrolled from all my classes and am not able to even view my past schedule. I emailed my advisor, as well as the Registrar office, and left a voicemail for someone at Tisch to respond to, but obviously it's past 5 and no one will respond until tomorrow. 

So my big question in all of this is - am I completely fucked? Has anyone been in a situation similar to this before? To complicate things further, I am currently in housing and the prospect of getting kicked out is giving me terrible anxiety.

Here are some of my questions:

\- How did the MBA/MSc prepare you for a job in the biotech field? Where were you before the program and where are you after? (or currently)

\- Was there much overlap between the two programs? Did any of your classes cover the intersection of science and business? (such as bioentrepreneurship)

\- What are the advantages/disadvantages of the dual degree program vs. a singular program such as Keck Graduate School's Masters in Business and Science degree?

\- Did the MSc Biology intefere with the MBA events/extracurriculars? (Job fairs, networking events, etc.)

**given this, i'd not assume and falsely imagine cultural  ideas of agency, freedom, choice, self-determination, or other made up ideas**

- since i dont believe in these made up ideas anymore, i cannot talk in a way that assumes these made up ideas to actually be scientific facts in life, since there is no evidence 

**ppl in many culture &amp; nations live their life without the assumptions of these ideas of agency, freedom, choice, self-determination, etc**

- so this indicates that living without these falsely imagined ideas is possible",1571434253,1,0

"[Meta] Mod updates: Banning of “Chance me” posts, sidebar refresh &amp; more","Hey r/nyu!

**Banning of chance me posts**
After a series of complaints, I asked for community input on what to do with chance me threads. Following almost unanimous opinions, posts by applicants asking what their chances of getting into NYU are now *banned*. A new mega thread will be created, and linked to on the side bar. /Note: other kinds of admissions posts, including tips, info and help are still allowed/

**Sidebar refresh**
A user suggested we refresh our sidebar. We want to include university resources and other links which are of frequent use, or will reduce posts with frequently asked questions. *Please leave your suggestions* for things to include in comments to this post!

**Post moderation**
In general, we want to avoid having to remove posts and doing blanket bans. In cases like spam, rule-breaking or chance me posts like now (lol) we will have to step in and remove posts, but we hope that in general all of you will use upvotes and downvotes to regulate what you want to see more and less of! *Use your vote*

TONIGHT! Midnight Confessions - Variety Show in Greenwich Village!,"Hey NYU peeps,

Some friends of mine are running a BYOB variety show this Friday and Saturday and would love for you to come!

Both shows are in the heart of Greenwich Village at New York’s oldest still-operating record store: The Music Inn. The store has been open since 1958 and has been used as a location in such shows as “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”.

TONIGHT! Friday 10/18, Midnight Confessions is a show where we ask the audience to anonymously write down a confession, true or false, and place it into a hat. The performers then take the confessions and act them out. Between confessions, we have sketches, some of the best up-and-coming musicians, and stand up comedians perform.

This is a great way for students to let off steam. I also believe this show provides a nice catharsis for students to anonymously share a secret, or their feelings about being new to the city, or the anxiety/stress they feel as a student and to have it externalized and acted out comically.

Saturday 10/19, “Live at the Inn”: a variety showcase with comedy, music, and live sketches. Tomorrow's show will be a classic Who-Dun-It Murder Mystery! 

For each show:

Tickets are only $10 and it's BYOB.

Address: 169 West 4th St, New York, NY

Doors open at 8:30pm Show starts at 9pm. Get there early for a good seat.

Trains: 1 to Christopher St.

A, C, D, F, M to West 4th St. NJ Transit is just a few blocks away.

Tisch vs Steinhardt Musical Theatre,"Hello, I know there are a lot of College Confidential posts on this topic, but those are from years ago, so I wanted to make this as an ""up-to-date"" version. I'm also making this because I am trying to decide whether to apply to Tisch or Steinhardt for musical theatre. I will compare them below. Based on what I've read online, I'd say that: 

***Steinhardt...***

* is singing-based, offering more vocal training and less acting/dancing training than Tisch
* also trains musical theatre majors in classical singing, allowing them to be experienced enough to audition for Broadway or opera companies 
* accepts less people than Tisch, but their applicant pool is much smaller than Tisch's
* usually has better quality productions than Tisch
* more camaraderie between students
* has less alumni on Broadway, but has less alumni in general due to consistently being a smaller program

&amp;#x200B;

***Tisch....***

* is acting-based, offering more acting and slightly more dance training and less vocal training
* has more industry-professionals teaching
* accepts more people than Steinhardt, but has a much larger applicant pool
* has worse productions than Steinhardt, grad students get priority in casting
* students develop a more independent attitude, which can be helpful for transitioning to NYC life and pursuing an acting career after graduation
* has more alumni working on Broadway, but has more alumni in general due to consistently being a larger program

This is essentially all I've been able to find on the topic. If the information I have stated is no longer true or never was true, please forgive and correct me. I want accurate info, obviously. If there is any more info that would be helpful, I'd appreciate it. Would you say one is definitively better over the other, or are they just different?",1571186280,3,0

Connecting an XBOX,"How the fuck are we supposed to connect an Xbox One to the wifi. 

I tried in August connecting mine wirelessly to the NYU network. It kept giving me a bunch of different error codes saying it couldn't connect even after I registered it online. I don't remember the exact codes but it said stuff about not being able to connect to the network and something about the DHCP server. I emailed IT and they told me Xboxes couldn't connect wirelessly because of something either with the device or with NYU wifi restrictions - I don't remember their exact wording. 

IT told me I needed an Ethernet cable, which I wasn't able to set up until today. I connected the Ethernet cable and when I go to Xbox network settings it says that I have a wired connection. But it won't let me use the network at all. If I try to login to my account it says ""you need Internet to do this."" When I go to ""test network connection"" it says that I need to authenticate my device or something to join this network (note that this is a different error code than the one I received when trying to connect wirelessly). When I click ""authenticate"" it takes me to the nyu-media device registration site. I go through the entire process of putting the information in and it will say it's registered, but still never connect. It just says at the bottom of the screen ""this page will close once you are connected."" However it never closes, no matter how long I wait. Restarting doesn't help even after I've registered the device and waited several minutes. I am able to connect my wifi to my phone's hotspot so I'm fairly confident the issue is not with my XBOX, and instead is something with the NYU network. Has anyone else had this issue and figured out how to fix it?",1571113163,5,0

[Meta] Community input on the banning of ‘chance me’ posts,"Hello r/nyu!

Recently I have received complaints about the frequency of ‘chance me’ posts and suggestions to ban them from this subreddit. I personally agree because

* An application is a wholistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the best
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's applications

For this reason I was seeking community input in regards to the following:

* Should 'chance me' posts be banned from the sub? Application questions, advice and help will still be **allowed**, but posts explicitly asking what someone's chances of getting into NYU are would not.
* If individual 'chance me' posts are banned, should I make a megathread? Should this megathread be stickied?",1571076358,56,0

NYU Tisch Creative portfolio for film,"Hello! I am a senior in high school applying as a film major and NYU is my top choice. I was hoping to get some feedback and tips on my portfolio! I have a 3.7 gpa weighted, 3.5 unweighted, and got a 30 on my act. I am still working on the short story, here is one of them if anyone has feedback:

The Search for Josephine
“Let’s keep looking,” the lieutenant urged. “This could be our biggest bust and you want to just give up?” Florence Valmonte was the only female detective in her department, and because of this she agreed to continue her search, even though she knew it meant risking everything. 
    Four years earlier, when Valmonte was exactly twenty-three years, seven months, and fourteen days old, she had the worst day of her life. It started out just like any other day, a cold shower to wake up, and a stroll to her internship at the local police station. Only on this day, she decided to stop at the coffee shop, lured by the scent of freshly baked chocolate croissants. She was not one to fall victim to the donut stereotype. As she walked through the door, she saw the most beautiful woman. Florence would describe her as captivating, worldy, uncomparable. As a reliable narrator, I will tell you she was average… a brunette, a couple inches taller than most with large grey eyes. Florence had never felt this way about another woman before, and she watched like a lion stalking its prey. The woman rose from her seat when the barista called out, “Josephine! I have your mocha.” Josephine. Florence locked eyes with her, and for a moment time was still. 
    Their first kiss was just hours later. Up until this moment, Florence had never felt nervous in her life. She was relentlessly brave. After her internship, they met in Washington Square Park. A pianist was playing a graceful tune underneath the arch, which lit their hearts simultaneously as they held hands. Josephine, having done this many times before, made the first move. She leaned in, only to be pushed away. 
“I’m sorry. This is just new to me.”
“It’s okay,” Josephine understood. “We can take it slow.”
Florence shook her head at the ground with disapproval, and turned back to Josephine, grabbing her by the face and kissing her in a sudden motion. It felt incredibly reckless to kiss someone she barely knew. Florence was also aware that some moments are worth any consequences they create. And this kiss would certainly create a whirlwind of troubles she could never escape. 
    That night, Florence woke up to the ringing of her work phone. Her boss at the station was requesting her after the news that the dealer they had been tracking, Brancos, was murdered. As an intern, Florence had filed a lot of the paperwork for the Brancos investigation and knew all the ins and outs of the case. As she stumbled into the office at 11:44pm, what she saw had her paralyzed in shock. Pinned to the board was the main suspect of the murder… Josephine. 
“Who is that?” The room turned to face Florence, surprised those were the first words she spoke.
“This is the girl we are after. Her name is Josephine Bauers, also known as Brancos’ wife,” The lieutenant revealed. “We think she killed him.”
Florence was shocked. Hurt. Speechless. None of this made any sense. 
“Why would she do that?” Another officer questioned, skeptical.
“Well, we found these. Two fake ID’s with their photos and the names Sara and Jonathon Cridell printed on them. Before we summoned you, Valmonte, we made a few phone calls to local banks, and surely enough, just fifteen minutes after his stabbing, this ‘Sara Cridell’ deposited ten grand from their savings in cash, and transferred another two million into a seperate account. We’re running the numbers now.”
    Florence felt her heart racing and was certain everyone else in the room could hear it. She excused herself, slammed the door behind her, and ran to grab the nearest trash bin, hurling out her shock and dismay. Even if the theory was false, she had been lied to. Maybe even used as an in to the investigation. How could she have trusted so easily. 
    Four years and three promotions later, Florence Valmonte agreed to return to the Brancos investigation with much hesitation. As she left the lieutenant’s office, she had a sinking feeling this was a terrible idea. But so much was on the line. 
    Her search began the next morning by the waterfront. The dense fog limited her vision to what was just in front of her. She knew if Josephine were in town it would be by boat, as it was the only way she could travel safely overseas. Everyone in the country was looking for this dangerous woman. Florence however, felt this woman was not a threat. In fact, in the four years it had been since they last met, her feelings had not faded. She tried to move on, meet other people, put the stint with the devil behind her. But it was as if Josephine never escaped her. She was always there; a lingering reminder of the sinner Florence truly was. She had lied. Told the lieutenant she had never seen her before, had no idea of her whereabouts. The truth would come out about their relationship, and it would ruin Florence’s life. But we aren’t there yet…
    We are here. 7:15am. Still waiting. As the time passed her hope dissipated. She had no other leads. Just instinct, an almost magnetic draw towards the docks. Naturally, Florence would see it as fate that just an hour and thirty-six minutes after her arrival, as the fog began to clear, she saw her.
    “Josephine!” She called out in desperation, rising from the bench. She sprinted in the direction of the figure, with no proof it was truly her. Just that feeling again. The same feeling from the past one-thousand, four-hundred and sixty-seven days before, every time she had thought of Josephine. As she approached the figure it turned to face her. Now, short black hair, skin pale from a life of hiding, but those same sparkling grey eyes. 
“I was on my way.” Josephine smiled softly.
Confused, Florence asked, “Where?” 
“To Washington Square arch.”
    With a sudden wave of compulsion, Florence dove into a kiss. She knew it was the very last thing she should be doing. But some moments are worth the consequences.
    As the weeks passed, Josephine explained everything. The marriage, the murder, the disappearance. Not all of her reasons were acceptable, in fact, most of us would say they were the opposite. But Florence understood every word. Her husband was abusive, trapped her in a marriage and threatened to take her down with him if she ever revealed his identity. She wanted freedom and saw only one way of achieving it.
      Florence made a promise she wasn’t sure she could keep. She would hide Josephine and find another lead to throw the case. She did exactly this—  bringing forth every associate, employee, and customer of Brancos— most of whom had already been questioned and cleared. To the best of her knowledge, the plan worked, and the search for Josephine was dropped. 
    Then came light. By summer, they were engaged to be married. They spent the month of June by the beach and fell into a deep love. Secrets were revealed. Florence began to take part in criminal activity led by Josephine, who had taken over her dead ex-lover’s business. As the days passed, Florence became numb to the sins of her lover. Distant from her surroundings. During her time with Josephine she had learned to let go and drift where the water carried her. It was true, sometimes the consequences are worth the moments they create. And sometimes they are not. For that night, out on the water, a gun went off. Distant sirens followed. Josephine Bauers was dead. 

There is also a “tell us about yourselfie” aspect now where you record a 1-2 minute video about yourself. There are no other parameters other than to be creative.

One of the many transfer threat questions - but with a catch,"Hello all, 

I've read the threads and I will not bore/annoy you with the common ""what it takes to transfer"" questions. Though I am looking for some insight on the open mindedness of admission faculty of NYU (NYU Stern specifically). I am a CC student, busting my butt to meet requirements and to create an exceptional resume (for being a 24 year old that is now finally invested in an education) for a chance at transferring to NYU Stern. My situation is a bit unique because I have had quite the... life. When it comes down to life experience and the discussion of such in the application and admissions process, how may the school feel about a potential student that has been working in an ""alternative"" field? Lets call it exotic dancing.

I am in state so I can save a few thousand dollars, but is ed2 still bad for financial aid?  Should I just apply regular and hope I get in?

What’s with the grading scale for theory economics class? Never knew it was that harsh!,"I’m taking Microeconomic analysis and we had our first midterm. The class average was higher 70 and lower 80, pretty high compared to the past year exams as I heard. But in most classes I’ve taken, if the class average is around 80 and I get a 90 I’m pretty much guaranteed a A- if not A. But you know what our scale is? To get A you need at least 98, which is pretty much asking for 100 because there is really no 2 points error to be made on the exam. And to get A- you need at least 92, even 91 means a B+! That’s crazy! In intro classes I remember there was at least 20 percent in class got an A but I doubt if there is even 10 percent A in this class.

IMPORTANT: We want to begin playing gigs and recording as soon as possible, and for that to happen, we need our drummer to **have his/her/their own set** that they can bring to rehearsals and performances.

I am an international applicant so my school doesn’t even offer AP classes obviously lol. But I do have plenty of impressive extracurriculars, awards, etc. and I am good at writing essays.

A transatlantic request,"Dear NYU Redditors,

I have a bit of an unusual request related to my own research and Master's thesis. First of all, allow me to quickly introduce myself. I study at Leiden University in the Netherlands and am currently writing my Master's thesis in Public Administration. I research the crowding in - crowding out framework of welfare states regarding civil society behaviour. Essential to my research is the so-called World Giving Index, which is a framework by the British Charity CAF that tries to measure philanthropic efforts all over the world. They utilize data provided by Gallup, stemming from their World Poll. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the issue. We do not have access to the Gallup World Poll and I am pretty much stuck without their microdata - also I was not able to get access via my previous jobs. I know that NYU has campus-wide access to the database (at least that's what it says on Gallup's website). I am looking for someone who could spare an hour to go over the data with me, extract them and send them to me - it should be fairly quick. Please feel free to PM me or answer in this thread. I would really appreciate the help. Why NYU? Well to be honest I have very fond memories of NYC and have always found the people to be very helpful in their own wholesome way when I lived there. I will make sure to show some form of German-Dutch-American appreciation!

"IYSSE meeting at the Global Center Tuesday night: ""Race, Class and the Fight for Socialism: Perspectives for the Coming Revolution in America""","This meeting is the socialist answer to the New York Times “1619 Project,” which has been accompanied by an unprecedented publicity blitz, including at schools and campuses throughout the country. The occasion they cite for the publication of this project is the 400th anniversary of the arrival of 20 African slaves at Port Comfort, Virginia.

The Times project raises the question: Is race the driving force of history, as the Times insists? Or, as Karl Marx analyzed, is it class? Is “anti-black racism … in the very DNA of this country” as the Times writes? Or is the history of the United States fundamentally the history of class struggle? As social inequality reaches record levels, is America heading toward race war or socialist revolution?

The promotion of the 1619 Project takes place under conditions of expanding class struggle internationally and a growing interest in socialism among workers and youth in the United States. Its aim is to block the development of a united movement of workers across all races by cultivating racial divisions.

This meeting will refute the historical falsifications advanced in the 1619 Project, explain their underlying political motivations and present the strategy for socialist revolution in America today.

Must the security guards wake students up when we stay overnight . . .,"Was hoping to get a few hours of sleep at Stern before my final later this morning. Took forever to fall asleep in an uncomfortable and cold seating area, only to be woken up an hour later at 3am by a security guard demanding to see my ID. I hear this is the standard practice at Bobst as well. 

Is this really necessary. If we're staying overnight in a non-residential NYU building, we're probably sleep-deprived already preparing for exams and shit, and waking us up in the middle of the night isn't helping. And it's not like we don't use our IDs to get into the damn buildings in the first place.

"Transfer accepted to Gallatin, is it worth it?","I just got my FA package back this morning and as expected, not looking so hot. I have received about 5k in non loan money. Looking at my credit evaluation, I'm projected to graduate in the spring of 2022. I would be doing 5 semesters at NYU if I were to take a normal courseload and not fuck it up somehow.

I studied a double major in English and art history at my current university, and took a semester off on medical leave. If I went to Gallatin, I would want to study more in STEM fields and integrate that into my major, something that I have wanted to do for a while but couldn't because the rigor of the classes at my current university kind of make it impossible. I have very little debt since I went to a state school. I have worked freelance a bit and gotten a journalism internship, but I wanted Gallatin because I want to explore more of what's out there for me.

The cost is giving me some anxiety about whether or not this would be worth it. I'm already flexible about the idea of working off most of the smaller loans as I go and even being an RA or commuting from my home in LI if needed for a few semesters, but I want to know if any current NYU students think this is feasible. I also want to know if it's possible to graduate from Gallatin a semester early or if I need a reality check and I'm not even graduating in 2022. 

I know this decision is pretty personal and no one can tell me ""yes, go"" or ""no don't"" and decide for me, but I want to be prepared for what comes if I choose to attend.

Question about ED2/ Campus life,"Hi, 

I'm an OOS senior looking to potentially ED2 (wanted to do ED2 to present a stronger application) to NYU (Stern), but I was a bit concerned about on-campus life. I heard the campus is essentially just NYC. Personally, I really like big city living, but I was wondering if its hard to throw parties (very committed to the grind, but also parties), make friends, or just have any dedicated studying areas throughout NYC. Also, does anyone know how much merit extenuating circumstances are given because I have a GPA on a bit of the lower side (dropped from top 10 to top 25) , but there is a clear correlation between lack of grades and my circumstances? Also, is it possible to consult anyone about finaid before applying, because my family walks the middle-class line of comfortable enough to not receive FAFSA, but also putting 2 other siblings through college?

Tandon Question,"Hello all,

I was recently admitted into NYU Tandon for the BS in STS. I have read all of the posts on Reddit/CC and others about life at Tandon but many are old and aren’t super relevant. I am super excited about the range of classes that are available for STS majors to take as well as the really cool research/general opportunities available on the engineering campus and at NYU. 

After reading a lot I have some worries about the social life/ability to be active on the WSP campus. I have heard that with the shuttle/subway it doesn’t take long ~15 minutes to get to WSP but I am just curious. How do you guys feel the social life is at Tandon and is it relatively easy to be active/social on both campuses, and how hard is it to make friends at Tandon? 

Thank you guys for the help I really appreciate it.",1576533782,1,0

Waitlist dilemma,"Hi,
I was waitlisted (yes, waitlisted, not deterred) from LS this past week and have been pondering whether or not to accept the offer.
Just gonna list some various thoughts
- While LS definitely had a bit of what I wanted, I won’t lie by saying part of the reason I applied there was because it was on the easier side of nyu schools (Again, I still liked LS enough to where I would have been fine going there)
- my 2nd choice school (GW) has an EDII option, and in all honesty they offer exactly what I want in terms of major (political communication). I also think I have a better shot of getting in there than with NYU
- I genuinely don’t know if I could stomach waiting 5 months at the minimum to hear back. I have some problems with anxiety and the mere deadline to decision wait this past fall was a lot for me
- I also don’t think I’d have a great shot at getting in off the waitlist, especially considering NYU historically isn’t the kindest with that
Essentially, I’m leaning towards not accepting the waitlist offer. I know anything can happen. I know there’s no real reason not to. But I don’t know if I wanna commit to this place further than I have cause I’m just sort of out of it right now. Is there any strong reason I should or shouldn’t go for it?

International applicant on the verge of collapse,"I am a high school senior from Azerbaijan that is applying to NYU EDII.

I first thought of applying to Tandon for Electrical Eng. program. However, after all the negative feedback regarding campus life, academics, campus conditions and Tandon as a whole, I am afraid I won’t really enjoy my stay in Tandon.

So, I thought it would be a better idea to apply for CAS Mathematics. It’s Stern, so, supposedly, campus experience and quality of education will be better, especially campus life, considering it is the main campus of NYU. 

Yet again, with my SAT(1490) and GPA 3.9 UW I would have a better shot at Tandon. Also, considering how competitive Stern is, I might even get straight up rejection for CAS.


Which major, do you think, would be a better shot for me?

If anyone here has had experience or has suggestions on which ones to apply to, please help me out! Also if anyone has any insights to the culture of each club please drop it below too because I hear some of them can be pretty cut throat? And I know there’s a few frats like AKPsi and PCT and BAP so are those worth joining too? Or what are the pros and cons of each frat?

NEED ADVICE!!,"Hey NYU!

Just got rejected from ED1, so I'm considering ED2 for NYU. Need some advice to help weigh my options.

My stats are probably below average for NYU admission (GPA 3.83 UW School sends our junior x senior gpas to college, but our transcript shows grades throughout all years. Upward trend--&gt; 3.5 --&gt; 2.8 (YIKES) --&gt; 3.75 --&gt; 3.9 ) SAT 1440. 

However, ECs are heavily geared towards business: started an incorporation with 16,000 sales six fig annual revenue -- 450k followers on ig -- interns @ media company with a snapchat story with over 2 million daily viewers -- production manager at a museum, creates 1,000 products for retail and museum showcase, manages 10+ employees -- intern at a science museum -- leader &amp; founded 2 clubs @ my school -- sports team 

Not sure if I should shoot my shot and apply to stern, although I know the pool for ED2 stern is probably gonna be all ivy rejects with killer stats. Or should I apply to ECON or LSP, work my ass off, then transfer to stern???? I'm aware the transfer process is crazy competitive. Has anyone had any success transferring from econ/LSP to stern? How was the process? 

My ultimate goal is to end up at stern since I want to work in IB or chain supply/logistics management. 

I'm extremely conflicted right now, and I don't know what to choose. Anyone have any advice?

Last year, a kid from our school applied RD to NYU stern. He had much lower stats but got a transfer option. Does anyone know how that works? Are you able to ask for a transfer option when applying?

Prospective LSP Student Questions,"Just got accepted into LSP through ED 1 and I'm ecstatic because NYU is my dream school! I have a few questions concerning the Liberal Studies Core Program:

1.  What are the differences between The Liberal Studies Core Program and Global Liberal Studies Program? How do I know which one I'm in?
2. How flexible is LSP when choosing classes, and is the program especially good for students who still don't know what to major in?
3. I will be spending my first year away at a global site. Is it true that it's harder to find and make friends at the global sites because classes are a lot smaller?
4. Where will I be staying (housing) once I return to NYC during my second year?
5. Does LSP award class credits for AP test exam scores of 4 or higher? 
6. Will all the courses I'm taking for the first two years be very similar to those in other NYU schools (mostly General Education courses)? I've heard people say LSP courses are easier; are the classes not as academically rewarding/rigorous/insightful? 
7. If I know what major I want early on, will I be able to take courses that fulfill the graduation requirements for that major? Will failing to do so prevent me from graduating in 4 years?
8. What's the process of declaring a major at CAS, Steinhardt, Stern, and Tisch after I finish the program? I know there's an application for the latter two schools, and I'm wondering if LSP students get priority acceptance to these schools? I'm undecided about my major and I'm concerned that I won't be able study the major I want once I've made my mind.
9. There seems to be a notion that LSP students are students who barely got in, and are therefore less intelligent/qualified to attend NYU. This statement is disheartening, and I just want to know how prevalent this perspective is held by other students? 
10. in your opinion, Best/worst part about LSP?

LSP =&gt; CAS CS + Econ - need some help,"So I'm pretty confident that NYU is now my top choice school and I would love to go here so I'm applying ED2; however, I don't think I can get into the program I want (CAS Econ + CS double major) with my current stats. I have a 32 ACT, but I have an pretty low GPA (3.4W, 3.2UW) as a result of taking on too many difficult classes and not being able to properly manage my time, had an upward trend though as I got used to it. I heard that I might have a chance at NYU if I answer yes to the Liberal Studies Core program. I did some research on the program, and it seems like a bunch of philosophical-based, but easy prereq classes that you fulfill in your first two years before transferring easily into CAS. Doesn't seem too bad, though..

1) Do these ""prereq classes"" need to be fulfilled by CAS students eventually as well? If so, is the only difference that they have the freedom to choose when they fulfill them?

2) How is the transition between LSP to CAS Econ + CS? Is the program worse off for STEM/Math related majors? Am I still able to do the double degree within CAS or do I have to choose just one?

3) Not specifically about the program, but how good is Econ + CS (or separately) at NYU? I've heard great things about CS and Econ, but just wanted someone to maybe elaborate on the program.",1576284689,1,0
Food Insecurity/extra meal swipes,"This is a little late, but for any freshmen looking to get rid of an excess of meal swipes, Jasper Kane allows students to add ""meal vouchers"" to a bin for students in need of a swipe (this is every semester) (you can also donate swipes to food drive). It alleviates the annoyance of having to coordinate a meet up time with a random person. I haven't seen anything similar at weinstein or the like, so I figured I'd give a heads up to all those Manhattan students looking to help out those in need. Especially with the stress of finals, programs like this are invaluable to lower-income students. (Route A is \~20 minutes from WSQ)

How long until financial aid info?,I was just accepted into the class of ‘24 and was wondering how long it would take for financial aid information to come through. I checked Albert and there was no information but they did receive my FAFSA and CSS. Did I just not get any aid? There is a chance of that since my EFC was very high but NYU is still expensive for me and my financial situation has changed since the timeframe for the FAFSA so I was going to ask for reconsideration.

This is an econometrics course. This isn't really my strong suit, and I regret the Economics major in general, but that aside, I am graduating next semester and I have no space for a failed class. I did a bit below average on the first midterm. Second midterm, I got a little bit above the same grade, but all my peers excelled, putting me in the lowest bracket possible. I don't really know the material and am completely lost in the course. With a final coming around, I am very worried about failing the course since I predict a similar trajectory on the final. I submitted all the assignments with a perfect grade. 

Although I know I didn't mention the breakdown, according to the syllabus, less than 5% get another grade besides A,B,C.

"Studying CompSci in the UK, what's the best route to end up with a NYC MSc?​","Hey guys,  


I'll be going to university in the **UK** (**I'm Bulgarian**) in September of next year. I've already applied and been accepted into 4 of the 5 unis I picked (accepted in **York, Surrey, Sheffield, Leeds,** waiting on response from **Southampton**, but I'm 99% sure I'll get an offer).  


I want to study **CompSci** and since my end goal is working in the US. I want to use a MSc to jumpstart that (Visa, getting 3 years to work in the US post graduation so I've more shots at winning the visa lottery + I imagine a US degree is more desirable to US employers).  


I'll most likely end up working through uni in a pathetic attempt to save up enough to get out without any financial aid (one of the reasons I'm going to the UK, is that while my parents are well off by Bulgarian standards - big house, luxury SUV, they can in no way afford the 9.25K GBP + cost of living in the UK, let alone the 77K + cost of living in NYC, so I'll most likely either work to pay for uni in the UK or get a loan, and they'll provide the accommodation, etc.), or at least a minimal amount of debt, maybe get accepted to NYU and get absolutely obliterated by the monstrosity the living cost + college cost are.

Really hope the UK BSc can land me a decently paying job (even 60K will be a godsend, I'll get 3 roommates and live in Alphabet city to save on rent lol) so I can at least cover cost of living and put away cash for the debt I'm about to pick up thanks to NYU, without being on the verge of homelessness.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck me the debt will be **crippling** even if I work while studying.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm wondering is, what's the best way to get accepted into NYU? I've got straight As, will do anything in my power to graduate from uni with a BSc w/ Hons, but I'm unsure which university to pick - which one of the five is more highly regarded in the US? From what I've looked up, Southampton, Leeds and Sheffield are the best out the 5 and all rank within the top 100, but I'm hoping to get some input from people who've actually gone/are in NYU - hopefully maybe an international student who took my route?  


Tl;dr: I'm Bulgarian, going to study CompSci in the UK. End goal is working in the US. Out of these 5, which is the most highly regarded in the US/will grant me the best chance of getting into NYU - Southampton, Leeds, Sheffield, Surrey, York?

Is NYU worth it for the money?,"So I got accepted into Stern ED and right now my issue is that I’m not sure I can attend because I wasn’t awarded any financial aid. I’m pretty lucky because my parents are giving me $125k for college, but with just undergrad being at least $320k before student loan interest it still leaves me at around $200k in debt. It’s my dream school and it’s just hard to have to think about letting it go for financial reasons because I’ve worked so hard for it. On the other hand though I’m not sure if possibly being in debt for a good amount of my adult life is worth it. I’m  pretty sure I can get some scholarships but I’m not sure if I can get close to the amount I need in them. So I’m at the point where I’m having to weigh what the benefits of going would be. I’m also considering Northeastern and Boston U but I’m not sure if I’ll even get in and if going there vs NYU will make a huge difference in opportunities. I’m also considering if I should go somewhere else for undergrad and then try for grad school at NYU. 

Sorry for the long post it’s just getting close to the time I have to make my decision and I’m still really unsure what to do. So if anyone has any advice for affording NYU or maybe how I should approach this that would be great!

Basically I would like to submit my AP scores instead of the SAT. I know people on here are encouraging applicants NOT to submit a 3, but considering the rigor of the class itself and its pass rate, do you think it might be better than the SAT?

The State of this Subreddit: A Discussion,"Now that finals are over, I believe now would be a great time to discuss the current status of this subreddit. 

I am no moderator but I have been pretty active on this subreddit for the last year and a half or so and believe I may be able to vocalize some concerns I have personally experienced and what I see other users complain about. We attend the largest private university in the United States as well as one of the most globally spread and it's quite discouraging that our subreddit is relatively inactive amongst our current students and bombarded by redundant and easily answerable questions by prospective students. Here are some changes I suggest:

1. **New Mods:** The change first needs to come from the people able to make the change – the moderators. Most of the moderators, however, seem to have gone inactive due to having graduated or other reasons. I have only seen u/mrmbuceta be active in recent months and I applaud them for doing what they can, especially during the stressful Tandon semester. With more mods, the sub may not have to always rely on u/mrmbuceta to see the post or other users reporting ChanceMe's and admissions questions for action to be taken.
2. **A new sidebar**: Whether a prospective student or a new redditor, it can always be helpful to have NYU-specific information regarding the rules and function of this subreddit. A new sidebar would hopefully prevent the need for more work to be done by the mods. A sidebar such as the one sported by r/uchicago or r/rutgers may be informative to new and old members, directing prospective students to more relevant subreddits to them, including r/ApplyingToCollege and r/ChanceMe, thus avoiding the need to remove questions that belong there.
3. **Post flairs**: Post flairs would work to organize and categorize posts as news, school-specific inquiries, memes, and more.

Language placement tests?,"I transferred to NYU CAS from another urban private school. I took a semester of Intermediate French II at my previous university, but I was told I would still have to take a placement test to determine what class to take at NYU. On the online exam I placed into the level after Intermediate II (can't remember the name), but when I took the placement exam I was told I would have to take Intermediate II again. I am currently registered for the class, and received an email from the professor with the class materials and I found that it is the SAME CHAPTERS of the SAME TEXTBOOK, with the SAME ONLINE LEARNING PROGRAM. You may guess, I am quite frustrated with this because I got an A in this class at a comparable university with the same class materials.

SO, my question is this: does anyone have a similar experience they can share? Were you able to petition the university to let a previous class count for the language requirement, or at least take the paper placement test again? Does anyone have any advice for where I could start to address this with administration?

What happens when you score the highest level in the foreign language placement test?,"Hello. I am a student in NYU Steinhardt. In NYU Steinhardt, 2 language courses are a requirement, so they cannot be waived by taking an exemption exam. I took the Korean (which I am fluent in) placement test over an year ago (prob around an year and 3-4 months... by the way placement tests only last 1.5 years), and it said "" Consult the department for appropriate course placement"". Right now in Albert, I am not able to take the Advanced classes. I wonder if I still can try taking the Korean courses (my academic adviser did not give me a clear answer), because I really cannot afford to take a beginner's course in a different language.  Many of them conflict with my schedule and most of them meet 3-4 times a week which will simply break down my system of how things should go.

Today is a sad day for me. I lost my wallet which had my student ID in it along with other important cards in it. It looks exactly like the one in the picture attached.

I lost it sometime today as I was walking from my dorm in the Rachel Carson AG building to the Thimann Lecture Hall 1. I'm not quite clear if I lost it on the walk there or in the hall itself. I've walked up and down my route twice now and I've rechecked the hall. I could really use a fresh pair of eyes to help me here.

**In the morning of Tuesday at 9am in 2015** Six UCSC students blocked the Highway 1 southbound right here Highway 17 merges at where what's known as the ""fishhook"" and thus completely disrupting traffic, commute to work,  local businesses/companies on both sides of the hill to bring awareness to Tuition Hikes and Black Lives Matter. It took police and firefighters five hours to break apart PVC pipes protesters had their chain-locked arms in, through a garbage can with 700lbs of cement.

I'm understanding of causes, but disagree with certain methods. In this case  I thought this trivialized the seriousness and movement which they said to have protested for. Focus on one cause, and stick with it. Tuition hikes, Police Brutality  and Black Lives Matter?.. Might as well throw rent control, our opioid problem, homelessness, white supremacy, or anything else that would further water down whatever issues they wanted to bring acknowledgement towards. Regardless, the outcome of this were some of the protesters having regrets, one with a felony and the other five misdemeanors. Locals here feel already feel a certain way towards UCSC students by the way.[https://www.ksbw.com/article/police-arrest-6-uc-santa-cruz-students-highway-1-reopens/1056102#](https://www.ksbw.com/article/police-arrest-6-uc-santa-cruz-students-highway-1-reopens/1056102#)

**Every year there are different protests/picket lines** that consists of both entrances to the campus being blocked by students whiles classes were still in session. My experience: I get off the bus with my bike from base of campus and ride up, protesters won't negotiate/budge. There seem to be a lot of tension in the air or some sort of preparedness for exchanges of words as if that's what has been going on all day.. It was hot and sweaty, quiet, and a lot of them looked tired and fatigue. I tell them to stay hydrated as I ride off and took the dirt road on my bike to get to class (more longer and tiring). I made it to class, out of breath and met with classmates who conveniently live on campus to get to class. As I ride off they a handful of them said thank you collectively in appreciation upon reminding them to stay hydrated. While I was there another guy insisted on getting through the linked-arm picket line.. they wouldn't budge. So he broke his way through and manage to disconnect the armed linkage between protesters and kept on his business while student protesters were shouting and berating him.

Guaranteed a protest will happen, how you handle or engage is up to you. Funny thing is I don't know if anything ever changed or if these protests had any influences in any decision makings regarding what they were protesting for. I had a friend share with me that some girl was running amok up and down the dorms barbarically knocking on everybody's door including her door, waking her up to have her join in on their protests during dead week (week before finals). I'll leave it up to your imagination on how that 'conversation' went as well as how interactions between ""join me in this protest"" girl and students on her floor were for the rest of the year.

Afraid and nervous about being a transfer.,"Hey everyone, I’ll be a prospective cognitive science transfer student next year and I’m super nervous about being a transfer student. I’m afraid of people looking down on me since I didn’t make it as a first year. I did a program called college advantage as a senior (class of 2019) in high school so technically I am a sophomore year transfer, however, I will be admitted as a junior student anyway; will being a year younger than all the new transfer make an impact on the social aspect? I’m wondering if the transfer students have any advice or insight on what it’s like being a transfer at UCSC. In addition, what’s the housing like? I’m not sure how the housing situation works. I really like college nine and ten but do they house transfers? Or just freshmen? And for those of you who were admitted as a four year student, do you notice the transfers? Are they left out? 

I’m sorry for the long ass post but I think my pride is getting the best of me.

Computer Science Transfer Questions,"Hi Everybody 

I am currently in my second year here at Canada College I will be applying this year to transfer next fall as a Computer Science major BA. My first question is will I be considered competitive since I am taking the new transfer requirements that consist of python, Computer assembly line and arch, and C++. I believe that the majority of the people applying for next fall will be taking intro to Java, data structures in Java and discrete math. The reason that I am asking this question is that If I were to take the old requirements, I will have to take the courses that I am currently taking at Canada once I transfer to UCSC. My only concern is the course articulation why you may ask is that here at Canada there is only one python course but it articulates to CSE 20 instead of CSE 30, CSE 30 is a new requirement to transfer here at UCSC. I have been informed that I can test out of it which I forgot if it is either CSE 20 or CSE 30. Another course that is in the new requirements is CSE12/12L, here at Canada there is only one Computer assembly line and arch but it has never been articulated to CSE12/12L. If this two courses were not to be articulated, will I still be admitted even though there is no courses that are articulated to CSE 30 and CSE 12/12L at any community college near me like CSM and not having the minimum GPA which is 2.8 in at least 3 courses that will be completed by the end of this semester.",1570251673,0,0

Gym Etiquette 101,"The new academic year brings many new people into the gym. Welcome! I suspect for many of these people it's their first time being in a gym before based on some things I see them do. I thought I would make a post for people who have never been to a gym before so we can strive towards a cleaner and more considerate gym environment for everyone.

1. **Wipe down your equipment!** If you use a machine or bench, it's crucial to wipe off your nasty sweat after. There are spray bottles of cleaner and rags as well as trash cans with gym wipes on top all around both floors of OPERS gym. The bottles and rags are usually attached to pillars and closer to walls than the middle of the gym. *Please* use them. Nobody wants to clean up somebody else's ass sweat!
2. **Re-rack your weights.** Remember where you picked up your dumbbell, barbell, kettlebell or plate? Perfect! Put it back when you're done. This ensures that others can easily find it and use it when you are done and that the floor is free of tripping hazards.
3. **Get off of a machine or put away equipment if you're not using it!** Everyone needs to take a short break between reps sometimes, but try to avoid sitting on a machine staring at your phone for several minutes straight. Other people want to use it too!

These are the the three most essential things to keep in mind at the gym in my opinion. Doing these three simple things helps the gym be a cleaner and more functional place for everyone including yourself. Now go get those gains (and wipe your equipment, rack your weights, and keep track of time)!",1570238179,37,0

Right now I'm taking hard upper division classes as well as need to wake up early. They know this, but keep having people over on the weeknights during the time I would like to study/go to bed.

Last night was especially bad, they invited what looked like 20-30 people who all hungout in the living next to my bedroom until I had to come out and ask them to go outdoors. 

I'm tired of asking my housemates to be more considerate of me and my roommate. I feel like an annoying parent who's just trying to get work done and its giving me a ton of anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

I took CE100/L, a GE, and another major class that had no lab.

I failed CE100 and it's lab because of super unforeseen personal circumstances.

But, I passed my other two classes( P and an A- ), so my term GPA was around a 1.2ish and I got academic my probation.  

My cumulative GPA however was still pretty health sitting around at a 3.2ish

But now that I'm checking my financial aid I'm missing two UCSC scholarships  :( 

The terms said that as long as I stayed in Good academic standing I would get my scholarships. But it also said that it was still valid if my GPA was above 3.0.

Organic Chemistry advice,"I'm planning to transfer fall 2020 as a MCD biology major. I heard this is best suited for someone that is pre med. Besides that, I finished all my prerequisites required except organic chemistry and physics. I have talked to my chemistry professors at my community college and they strongly advised that I complete the sequence here because it is a prerequisite for upper division classes ( one of them has graduated from UCSC).

 Everyone that I know who has transferred to a UC has also finished OCHEM beforehand. I have emailed the senior admissions advisor at UCSC and he also stated it was highly recommended to complete the series.

If I complete the series at my community college I'd be here for another year just taking that class and physics. However my chem prof. said I could apply for internships and do volunteer work in the meantime.

I have been here from fall 2016 to now.  I feel like I am ready to leave but everyone keeps advising against it without completing the series.

Am I just being impatient? Or should I listen to their advice?

I want to gauge interest on a couple of things,"CW: climate grief/anxiety 

I wanted to see if there would be any interest amongst the general student population in either or both of two types of clubs/gatherings.

The first would be a support group to address climate grief. As more and more news reports come out detailing ominous signs of an impending ecological collapse (ice cap loss breaking the big records, deadly wildfire seasons every year, widespread crop failures, Amazon deforestation, ocean acidification, permafrost melt releasing massive amounts of methane triggering further warming, a recent widespread public safety power shut off in our region)  it is becoming impossible to ignore the growing emotional toll of the climate crisis. There are so many feelings associated with this crisis: fear, anger, powerlessness, hopelessness. Many people my age I speak with candidly don’t see a future in which it’s safe to have children. Many fear we could see widespread famines, water shortages, and wars in just the coming decades. Many people are already being directly affected by climate change including those who experienced the devastation of hurricane Maria and more recently Dorian, those who’ve lost homes to wildfires and floods, and countless others. Climate change is a very real, very imminent threat and there are very real anxieties, fears, and feelings around it that need to be addressed. I’d like to start a group where people can talk about and work through their grief in a community. I would base the group around the Good Grief Networks ten step program for personal resilience and empowerment in a chaotic climate: https://www.goodgriefnetwork.org. Please let me know if a group like this is something you would be interested in. 

Secondly, I noticed there aren’t any groups centered around how to live sustainably, self-sufficiently, or even many skills based groups. I’d love to start a club where we got together and learned a myriad of skills needed for a self-sustainable life. Some topics could include: canning and preserving, sewing, basic first aid, basket weaving, plant identification, archery, backcountry medicine/cooking/fire making, basic maintenance of things like bikes, cars and appliances, HAM radio, etc. Please let me know if this is something you would be interested in.

FYI please just be a decent person,"This past week I finally sought counseling to try and help myself out with what’s being going on in my life, I sought help on campus and since then the trauma of some stuff I had to talk about has been really taking a toll on me and causing me to not think straight, my mind has been completely elsewhere and it’s caused me to do lots of dumb shit. Today I accidentally put my ID card into a load of laundry I was washing, when I came into the laundry room and noticed it there I laughed and admitted it was mine, but the group of assholes next to me (particularly this one dude) started making fun of me, laughing, and just piling on the jokes way too much then was cool. The one dude even called me an idiot and said he would never do something like that. It was a great cherry on top for how life has been. So to those people, who went out of their way to be horrible for no reason, screw you. And to everyone else on campus, please do your best to be kind, because you have no idea what someone could be going through. I know that’s a common, corny sentiment, but it’s true and so easy to do.

The IT guy promised me that he can restore my computer to the day when it was born. Instead he destroyed my computer and refuse to help take responsibility. 😥😥

Moving into an apartment?,"Back in Spring, when I was setting up my housing for this year I was set on going off-campus, and it almost worked but it fell through with the people and stuff.

Turkey Girth,"Has anyone noticed the alarming increase in turkey chonk? I passed by the standard Cowell field turkey flock and was startled when I processed the massive girth that were their bodies. These turkeys radiated a power that I never thought could exist, the absolute strength of True Chungus. Fearfully I backed up to give these kings the space they deserved, but everyday now I live in fear of the day our benevolent poultry overlords take over.",1573265190,1,0
Should I retake physics 6A before taking 6B?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a MCD Biology major and transferred from a CC having already taken the equivalent of physics 6A - however it was almost a year ago and the concepts are really rusty. It's also been a half a year on top of that since I took the calculus series. I have time to fit a physics 6A retake into my schedule, but was wondering if it would be necessary to take 6A again to do well in 6B? 

Do the concepts in 6B build upon 6A content or is it general concepts I could review without retaking the course? I don't really want to pay for it again, but I definitely don't want to fail 6B if I'm lacking foundational info. 


Thanks for any advice! Good luck finishing out fall term.",1573262993,1,0
Philosophy 24 questions,"Yo yo slugs, I'm thinking of taking phil 24 with Robbie Kubala to fulfill a requirement for my major. The thing is, I haven't taken any other philosophy classes before. Idk if any of the other philosophy classes are required so that would be cool to know. I also can't find anything on winter quarter's instructor, Robbie Kubala, so info on experience with him would be dope.

Upper Div SOE Electives for a dumb TIM major,"Howdy howdy y'all 

Anyone have any recommendations for what SOE elective to take next quarter for a TIM major? The courses I felt that would be interesting to me required CS 101 as a pre-req, and I'm not really interested in taking that one :( 

I really want to take some UX/UI type classes (I took TIM 158 spring quarter and we did some prototyping and low key I had fun with that stuff). I heard CMPM 131 would be a good one to take, but it's not listed on the class search even though it's on the course catalogue for winter 2020 :( 

Any other recommendations for SOE electives? I'm hoping to get one that isn't too difficult :)

Thanks!",1573253062,1,0

Think I'm going to fail CS major...,"It's just now fully soaking in with me that I'm not going to graduate. I'm 25 years old and I take so few classes each quarter/semester and fail so much that I only just recently got to upper division. I took 2 courses last spring and failed them both, Algorithms and Stats. I figured that I just need to dust myself off and try harder next quarter.  


Well, here I am taking another 2 courses, one of them I think I'm doing fine at, the other is CSE112, Comparative Programming Languages. The class has had me completely stumped since day 1. I've been getting 5/10 on all the quizzes which I'm pretty sure is a mercy grade because I pretty much guessed on most of the answers. There were 2 homework assignments that I turned nothing in because I couldn't even understand what was being asked.  


Now there's a 3rd homework assignment due in a few hours and I'm just sitting here staring at it, watching webcasts, reviewing resources, looking at piazza, nothing makes sense. I can't do this. I'm going to fail another course and they're going to kick me out. Now I just feel useless and my life is meaningless and the last 7 years of my life was a waste of time. I'm just going to end up moving in back to my mom's house jobless and do nothing with my life.

Incident this morning in the Cowell DH?,The Cowell dining hall was randomly closed this morning around 9-9:30.

I asked one of them what was going on and one of them said a medical emergency had happened but I wonder if something different happened and the staff are trying to cover it up. Like what if there was a serious food safety concern and the ‘medical emergency’ was a false excuse to hide the truth. Not that I don’t trust the staff or anything but hypothetically speaking the managers could have told all the employees not to say anything about what really happened.

a (hopefully) helpful mega guide for depressi spaghetti banana slugs,"Hello my slooty slugs!

I've been seeing a lot of especially bad struggling going on this quarter, so I'm writing this post in hopes that it can help someone. I know how scary it is to seek help, especially when you don't know what to expect, so here I'm going to write everything I've learned about the CAPS and DRC process in the two and a half years I've worked with them.

**Notes:** This is the information I can give as a UC Ship student, I don't know the details for non UC Ship students, but if you walk in they will 100% tell you what they can do for you. If the thing you're struggling with is ADHD, CAPS is very limited in the help they can provide. I believe they require a full examination to diagnose an attention disorder, and even then they don't have ADHD medicine readily available in the campus pharmacy. I'm not entirely sure, though.

*The CAPS center is across the street of 9/10, upstairs and the OPPOSITE side of where the stairs lead you (right above the pharmacy). The DRC building is located in the Hahn Student Services building, which is across a bridge from the McHenry library.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**CAPS Therapy:**

You can choose to either schedule an appointment over the phone or walk in and fill in a form for them to process you into an appointment. If you feel you're in need of immediate care, you should walk in and express this. You can be connected to a crisis therapist, who will make sure you're okay and not in danger of hurting yourself. 

When you walk in, you can take two different routes as you fill out the check in form. If you check off that you have been feeling suicidal, they will find a therapist for you immediately to make sure you're going to be okay and safe. I will strongly advise that **IF** you want to check off feeling suicidal that you check off that you do NOT have a plan on suicide if you don't want to risk getting a 5450\*\* form filed on you. It might take up to 15 minutes tops for them to find you an available therapist, depending on how busy they are. You'll almost be guaranteed a same day check in though. If you do not check off either of the two suicide boxes, they will feel you aren't in any immediate danger or in danger of hurting others and will probably schedule you for a different day appointment.

When you talk to the therapist, you just have to make sure they understand that you are not a danger to yourself. If you mention you feel depressed and unmotivated, that's enough for them to give you the help you deserve. You don't have to mention you are suicidal. If you mention you have vague suicidal ideation but that you would never follow through, it's very unlikely that they will involuntarily hospitalize you. If they think you need it, they'll give you a short term therapist to help you through the next one to threeish months probably. However they do not offer on campus long term therapy. If you want a long term therapist, they will give you a referral and you'll meet with a therapist off campus. I hear that there is a place near the Metro Center, so it'll just be a short bus ride and a small walk.

\*\***What is a 5450?** A 5450 form gets filled out by a doctor if they feel you are a danger to your own safety. It's what leads to involuntary hospitalization. Generally you don't want it to get to this. It takes away some of your legal rights for up to (but not always) three days, and you are put under the care of a hospital that will monitor your condition. If it comes to this, you'll be okay, and you'll be safe. Just stay calm, and remember that the people handling you want the best for you. They're on your side. I've been to the local psychiatric hospital, and the staff are so very supportive and sweet. Trust them, because they're there for the sole purpose of helping you. 

&amp;#x200B;

**CAPS Medication/Psychiatric Services:**

If you express you want medication, they will assign you to a long term psychiatrist. You'll talk about your needs and they'll start you off with a SMALL dose of a medication, where you can pick up downstairs at the pharmacy. They might tell you to get your blood drawn sometime soon downstairs to make sure you're good to take medication. They'll continue meeting with you every one to two weeks so they can monitor your side effects, health, and needs. Most likely you'll jump from prescription to prescription until you find one that suits you. They might raise or decrease the dosage. They might put you on more than one to find the perfect dose for you. **Keep in mind that all of these changes are 100% YOUR CHOICE**. They will NEVER force you or pressure you to take medication. They're only there to advise you on what they think is best. You will be in control. 

The process might be a struggle, but try not to lose hope. Medication isn't for everyone, but even when it is it takes a while to get it right. Try your best to be completely honest. Feeling 10% better? Don't tell them you're good, admit that things are better but that you aren't completely happy, and they'll talk with you about if they think you should keep trying to find a better dose. It's also normal for medications to lose effectiveness after a while. Don't be discouraged. It's all part of the process. After over two years of medications, I kept making little improvements, but I only found what I think is the perfect prescription 5ish months ago. It was a long journey getting to this point, but I'm the happiest I've been in actual years. If you're feeling good about your prescription, they'll change the appointments to every month, and if you feel great and ask them, they might make it every other month etc. If you ever develop side effects and your appointment isn't until next week or month or something, they'll always be available through the Health e-Messenger.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vacation Coverage:**

Your UC ship coverage lasts through the summer even if you aren't taking summer classes, so you don't have to worry about getting cut off for summer. They'll give you referrals to meet with people in your area over the summer, and give you the medication you need. If you can't find one close to you, they'll even go as far as to pull it up and help you find someone you can meet with. You'll also be able to access them through the e-Messenger.

&amp;#x200B;

**DRC Accommodations:**

You know those little blurbs at the bottom of every syllabus talking about disability resources? It's not exclusive to physical or severe mental disabilities. It applies to anything academically debilitating, including depression and anxiety. You can make an appointment and they'll go over what accommodations they offer. If you have a note from a therapist it'll be much easier to get approved, but I think they also give accommodations without it. I'm not entirely sure. If you get approved, a new menu option on your student portal will be added for Disability Services where you can check off boxes for the classes you need letters for. Go ham and check them all off, whether you think you'll need them or not. It's a safety net. The Accommodation Letters will be emailed to your ucsc email after a few days. 

Being a DRC student is a godsend. Seriously. They offer things like absence and tardiness excuses, deadline extensions, and laptop approval during lectures. The effectiveness of these letters is up to the professor, so don't abuse them. Still, they'll usually be VERY understanding and will work with you a lot more leniently to help you pass. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Emotional Support Animal (ESA) on campus:**

I'm hesitant to cover this, because I don't want people to glamorize the idea of having a pet on campus. It's not some fun cutesy college experience aesthetic bullshit- do NOT try and get an ESA unless you truly believe it will help you get you through your depression. Pets are not accessories, they are not feel-good tools either. They have needs, and if you're having trouble taking care of yourself, you need to think long and hard about whether you're prepared for the commitment of taking care of a whole other living being. 

**Questions you should ask yourself before deciding whether you should apply for an ESA:** Are you capable financially and physically of caring for this animal? You should have a solid few hundred dollars saved away AFTER buying all the basic care materials, in case of a veterinary emergency. You have to be capable of remembering to feed and groom and pick up after your animal every single day. Will you be available emotionally for your animal as they are for you? An ESA does not solely exist to comfort you. They are living being creatures too, and need love and affection and constant care. If you'll be gone all day sometimes and you live alone, consider the emotional well being of the animal, who will feel abandoned and alone. Will you be able to take care of this animal for potentially the next 10 years? This isn't a fish, they'll be alive for a while, and they'll bond with you. Have a solid plan for how you'll have your ESA with you after graduation.

**Still want an ESA?** The ESA application can be picked up at the DRC. If you have a note from a therapist, it'll be much easier to get approved. The approval process will take a few weeks, and then you'll schedule a meeting with your housing coordinator to go over the rules. When you get your ESA, you'll meet with them again to give them your pet's health records.

**Getting an ESA:** You can bring a pet you already own at home, or adopt one if you feel ready for the commitment. If you're struggling a lot with the common symptoms of depression (fatigue, lack of self care, inability to go outside) and you really want an ESA, please get a cat. A dog needs a lot of extra care, and for you to give them the best quality of life, you'll need to be able to walk them every single day for a good amount of time. For where to get the animal, the first main options I considered were Craigslist and the Santa Cruz Shelter. However, Craigslist results will mostly be in neighboring cities, so be ready for a drive to meet and pick them up. For the local shelter, you need to be over 21 to adopt. Soooo I personally had to fall back on Petsmart's in store shelter, where I met my best buddy Bailey. Also be aware when adopting, that you are responsible for any damage or disturbance your pet causes. A loud or destructive animal is definitely not a good candidate.

Be aware that there is usually a 100-150$ adoption fee, on top of needing to buy a brush, scratching post/litterbox for cats, toys for dogs, and pet food and potentially litter regularly.

*When you adopt this animal, you are adopting a new friend and family member, so don't fuck around and be a good owner for your good boye/gorle.*

**ESA Housing Rights:** An ESA is actually protected by California law in terms of housing. Any apartment, including ones that have a no pet policy, cannot turn you away or charge you more for having an ESA. If you provide proper documentation, they must allow you to keep your animal with you as long as they do not damage the property or cause a disturbance of any kind. However, this is in terms of housing only. ESA's are *not* Service Animals. Service Animals are trained and are allowed basically anywhere, but your ESA is basically just another pet in every other aspect. Hopefully though, this housing protection will help you stay with your animal after graduation.

*If you abandon your ESA after the school year ends, I will send PG&amp;E after you.*

Opinion: people shouldn’t be allowed to be RA’s more than twice,"I mean TBH my gut feeling is that you shouldn’t even be able to be an RA more than once but for the sake of my argument I’ll say “more than twice”. 

Basically, I think being an RA for 2-3 years is a little bit selfish and probably shouldn’t be allowed. I mean, maybe if the RA hiring process was more anonymous my feelings would be different, but the way it’s set up now, it’s super easy to just hire your friends and re-hire each other. Year after year of this means that less and less people have a legitimate chance at being recognized for having good RA’ing skills. Like, okay, maybe it’s reasonable for people to RA for two years, maybe they’re really passionate about that themed hall or maybe they’re crazy fucking good at it. I get that. But don’t you think three years is kinda pushing it? Like you get three years of free housing just because your friend lowkey tag-teamed you in? 

I’m not trying to say that being an RA is easy, I’m sure it’s really stressful and taxing and justifiably worth the free housing compensation. But three years just seems to be pushing it a little....especially in a city with this bad of a housing crisis. Like help a comrade out you know? “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs” or whateva. And yes I am also just salty about being denied twice and watching a bunch of the same RAs get rehired ☹️",1574406422,1,0

One major takes five minutes to declare and the minor takes two weeks?,"I’m declaring as a Sociology major with a minor in Education. I met with the Sociology advisor today and brought my Petition and Academic Plan paperwork. The whole meeting took 5 minutes, and she had me officially declared for Sociology on the spot. She then sent me to the Education office, saying I had to meet with them to declare my minor.

I met with a peer advisor, who was lovely, but couldn’t sign-off on it and could only forward it for processing to the actual advisor. She said my Education declaration could take up to two weeks.

Now I don’t want to go all entitled customer here. I understand that people are busy, departments get backlogged, welcome to college. But I can’t wrap my head around the discrepancy. The declaration paperwork only requires a look-over for correctness, a signature, and what seems to be a few strokes of the keyboard, at least from the looks of it. Why can I meet with the advisor in charge in one department and they can instantly declare me, but I can only meet with a student in the other department, and won’t be declared for up to two weeks? Is Education just a much larger major with more students? Is the declaration processing more complicated for Education on MyUCSC? Is their department advisor just super busy compared to the Sociology advisor?

Why I'm glad I took distributed systems with peter alvaro in college.,"I graduated spring 2019 and I'm a data engineer now, meaning it's important to know how distributed systems work in the back of my mind because of all the distributed whatever tools I use from a day to day basis. The class itself teaches a lot about API fundamentals and a lot of interviews ask you to use an API and do something with requests you make to it. I for one had never worked with APIs because I've had no technical background prior to college and I never had a personal project, so it took me the longest time to understand what it is in the first place. This class teaches you a lot of practical skills beyond just the concepts. If you are scared of whether or not you should take this class, don't think twice. It's hard but it's VERY rewarding. It's one of the best classes to take to help you get a job imo (I'm not being a teacher's pet for peter alvaro. I barely spoke to the guy when I took it). I just wanted to say how valuable the things you learn in this class are and I gotta say, I would be a lot more clueless at my entry level job if I didn't take this course.

If he curves my 64 up to a C obviously I’m set and I passed but if he didn’t curve the midterm or final then that means I got a 72.3% in the class which would be fucking enraging.",1576383228,1,0

More demands to the University,"Some personal demands to the University:

Provide a Cost of Living Adjustment for all. The largest employer in Santa Cruz county and the greatest contributor to the city’s population, UCSC is substantially responsible for driving up local housing costs. Recognizing this negative impact, UCSC must provide a monthly COLA in order to bring all full-time employees and half-time student employees out of rent burden. No worker may earn poverty wages. No hours may be cut to meet this demand.

Cops off campus. No arrests for civil disobedience or non-violent offenses. Funds released in this manner can go towards the above demand.

Suspend tuition. Return to pre-1975 cost of attendance. 1/2 of the federal government’s assets are comprised of student debt.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 4c2ih7n0nm441...*

Guarantee free room and board for all incoming students. This will help ensure a campus growth rate based on sustainability rather than profit.

Abide by a binding and transparent democratic procedure for community decision-making and campus resource management.

Provide free parking to all students and workers.

Appeal to the state overlords to fund the above demands. If education is a public good, demand higher taxes on the wealthy.

Divest from the Thirty Meter Telescope to meet the above demands.

Liquidate financial assets to meet the above demands.

Starting from the highest paid employee, redistribute campus salaries as necessary to meet the above demands.

Undergrads need a raise too...," 

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: I got the following information from the internet, so... yeah.

Here's the current TA salary breakdown from the SOE website:

&amp;#x200B;

|Position |Workload|Monthly Salary|Hourly Wage  |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TA, 25%|10 hours per week|$1181.83|$29.55 |
|TA, 50%|20 hours per week |$2363.66|$29.55|

&amp;#x200B;

(Additionally, TAs receive ""remission for in-state fees"". I will ignore this in the calculations.)

The proposed cost of living adjustment of $1,412 would increase graduate student wages (for 50% TAs) to (2363.66+1412.00)/(4\*20)=$47.20/hr. (it's a lot higher for 25% TAs)

For reference, Undergraduates working at the dining hall have a starting wage of $12/hr.

Tuition costs are roughly equivalent for graduate students and undergraduate students, as are the costs of housing.

I support the right of the grad students to share their discontent with their situation, and completely disagree with the university's categorization of the strike as ""illegal"". However, it seems like if anyone needs a pay bump, it's the undergrads. Why should students working for $12-15/hr with the same housing and tuition costs as their TAs be subsidizing a further pay increase to over triple what they are making. 

Degree programs, especially those of graduate students, shouldn't be thought of as cheap or break-even endeavors. The promise of a degree (or at least the hope these days) is to increase future earnings by foregoing current earnings. In a perfect world, both sets of students get raises, but I just don't understand the humanitarian need for TAs to get a $47/hr wage before undergraduates come even close to $20/hr. 

Please help me understand what I'm missing.",1576309334,1,0

Vending Machine at Jack Baskin 3rd Floor is Cursed,"Here I am, at Jack Baskin, studying for a test my ass ain't ready for, when suddenly I get a rumbly in my tumbly. No problem, this building is equipped with the finest cuisines available in vending machine form. I exit my study nest and head towards the nearest snack dispensary. I arrive at my destination and see a plethora of nourishment. Being a degenerate I swipe my credit card and enter A6 for a bag of dusty cheezy Doritos. If only I had Mountain Dew to complete this ensemble. But to my astonishment, the bag gets stuck on the spiral mechanism. How could this be? I did not account for this error. Will my hunger go unsatisfied? I try to shake the machine but to no avail. So, as a bonafide Comp Sci major, I muster all my strength to problem solve. Yes, I can feel it. All three of my brain cells are working strenuously, I'm at 100 percent brain capacity just like Bradley Cooper in the movie, *Limitless*. Eureka!!! I'll just pay for the same item again. This way I can dislodge the first bag while getting a second bag of chips in the process. More chips equal less hungry. I swipe my card again and enter A6. I see the spiral mechanism turning and my anticipation grows. The first bag gets dislodged and falls to its inevitable consumption. My eyes glow with excitement, my mouth watering at the thought of tasting them perfectly nacho blasted tortilla chips. Sadly, it gets stuck on top of the tray, with the second bag ending up in the same predicament as the first, stuck on the spiral mechanism. My mind is unable to process these series of unfortunate events and I end up dying from starvation.",1575490365,1,0

Lastly, how much do you pay for a form at the UCSC campus? We’re advised to apply for a dorm at the international house or smt, but I’ve heard that it’s pretty expensive to live there.

* How do you get housing if you're missing a full quarter? Do you sublease or wait until the next year to get housing?
* Application process and scholarships
* How was figuring out course articulation/ if your courses will count for credits?

Digital notetaking,"Hey, do any of you write notes by hand on a tablet? I've been looking and so far I haven't had much luck. I've always written notes in a binder, but since the lecture hall seats and desks are way too small it's been pretty difficult and I don't want to waste paper/space with spiral-bound notebooks. I'd type my class notes, but my typing is super loud and I don't feel like I retain the information the same that way. Does anyone have any experience with digital handwritten notes? I tried my father's windows tablet with a passive stylus and it was kinda awful. Kept cutting out mid-stroke, impossible to keep my hand/arm from touching the screen while writing, and just generally unpleasant. 

I've got an old huion drawing tablet that I love, but it needs to be plugged into my computer and doesn't have a display so it'd be pretty difficult to use especially with the tiny desks. Anyone have a system they really like and would recommend? Preferably something less than $300 and with a stylus-only function? It doesn't need any apps or anything, just the ability to write notes and export them. Maybe open word/pdf files, and multiple colors would be nice.

Confused and worried. Could use some reassurance and advice.,"Hey all. Undergrad freshman here. I had recently noticed a comment on Canvas from my TA saying that he couldn’t find a file I turned in for one of my assignments. Said comment was a week old by the time I saw it. I didn’t think to check because I thought I turned everything in and therefore shouldn’t have anything to worry about.

It might be important to note that this assignment consists of multiple components to be turned in, specifically a YouTube video and a document containing my reflection of the process of creating the video. I turned them in separately. The video seemed to have overrode the document, but checking the comment section on the Canvas app on my phone suggests otherwise.

I have also tried to contact my TA via email regarding this matter after posting a comment of my own on that assignment with the supposedly missing file attached to it. I have yet to hear back from him.

I find this worrisome on multiple levels. Was I too late in attempting to take corrective action? Would my TA believe me when I say I turned it in when I was supposed to? What else can I do about this?

The result of this so far is me fretting over whether or not I’m going to pass this class instead of enjoying my break as this assignment counts for 25% of the grade for this class. 

Also, to avoid hiccups of similar nature in the future, I would like to ask those of you who have more experience with Canvas about how you turn in multiple submissions of multiple formats for one assignment. Thank you in advance.

TL;DR: did not know how to turn in multiple submissions of different formats for one assignment. TA couldn’t find word document that I thought I turned in. Attached said document with a comment on the assignment, no response from TA so far. Losing my mind due to possibility of failing the class.

Sorry if this isn’t the time or place to post something like this.",1577032697,1,0

and showed science/mathematics ends in meaninglessness

1)Mathematics/science ends in contradiction:an integer=a non-integer

Mathematics ends in contradiction:6 examples

3) biology is not a science

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/Bbiology-is-not-a-science.pdf

3) biologists dont know what a species is-thus theory of evolution is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense",1569912634,0,0

PSA: Stanford Football - Do Not Cheer When The Offense is on the Field,"Please don't cheer when our football team is on offense. It distracts the offense and prevents them from functioning.

Instead cheer when our defense is on the field and distract the opposing team's offense. 

It doesn't seem like much but it adds up. It's like writing letters to your senator or voting. It's a football faux pas to cheer when your team is on offense.",1568942917,55,0

"Questions about CS? I'm a Stanford transfer, coterm, and CS 106AX head TA. Ask me anything","Hey reddit! My name is Ryan. I transfered to Stanford from community college in 2016, graduated from undergrad in 2019, and am now working on my coterm (which is a master's degree started concurrently with undergrad, for those new to Stanford).

I'm pretty involved in CS at Stanford, and I wanted to see if I could help answer people's questions. Some things I can speak to:

* Course selection: I'm familiar with most common CS classes here and am happy to give advice on classes to take. I am head TA for a new intro CS class this quarter (CS 106AX), so I'm especially interested in helping people new to CS start off in the best class for their background.
* Teaching: I have TA'ed several different classes, both as an undergrad and a grad student. I also lectured (as the primary instructor) for CS 110 (our Unix systems class) last summer.
* Internships and software engineering: I've worked in a national lab (Sandia), at a startup (Expanse), at a big company (Facebook), at a nonprofit (Khan Academy), and started my own startup in a past life.

Advice for a senior/coterm applying for internships/jobs for the first time? (Specifically CS/data science),"I'm going to graduate either spring 2020 or fall 2020, so I'm looking for summer 2020 internships, and to be honest I have no idea how people get jobs. Specifically I'm looking for data science/analytics positions, and all but one of my previous internships have been via connections. My background is: random quantitative undergrad + CS coterm and previous intern experience is:

* freshman summer: big tech company/software engineer (via Handshake);
* sophomore year: financial services firm/data scientist (Stanford-funded program)
* sophomore summer: research institute/quantitative analyst (via connections);
* junior year: large retail company/data scientist (via connections);
* junior summer: random startup/data scientist (via connections);
* senior year (I have not yet decided if I will accept the offer): large media corporation/data scientist (via connections), but they have no plans to hire another data scientist full-time;

I also don't really want to return to any of the companies I previously worked at, so that is an issue. I guess I can think of a few possible ways to get jobs, but I am not sure if any of them are effective.

Career fairs: I went to all the career fairs (fall general fair, engineering fair, spring fair, random BEAM center fairs, social impact fair, etc) every year and gave out my resumes, but I didn't really get anywhere, so I'm not sure if I was doing the process wrong, or if now that I'm a senior, companies will take me seriously. Do people actually get anything from these routes? Also, a lot of companies just say to apply online.

Handshake: I did get a small handful of interviews and 2 software engineering internship offers freshman year after applying for 300+ software positions on Handshake (it was awful). But I tried to apply for positions during sophomore year and junior year (although they were more stats/data science focused) and never got invited to interview anywhere. Also, a lot of companies just redirect you to apply on their official website, which never leads anywhere.

Company talks: tech companies come give a presentation on campus and hundreds of people pack the room and drop their resumes. The recruiters/company engineers just get swarmed with a bunch of people. Are these ever effective?

Referrals/connections: Most of my friends are not working in tech (yes, surprising), or I have already gotten referred by them. I am only close with a few professors, so that is another option.

Stanford worth it,"Hi,

Please be patient and open-minded as I spill the details of this story. I am extremely grateful that I’m an incoming fresh at Stanford. It was just the perfect fit for me. The resources seem boundless. I’m from an upper-middle class single home. My mother came from a low-income family(she’s first gen—first to go to college), immigrated to the U.S, worked her butt off to become the physician she is today. We essentially started off as working-middle class(when my twin and I were born), by 10 years of age we were middle class, and by 15 years of age we were upper-middle class—she essentially broke the cycle for the family. I have a twin(going to a top school on the east cost—same name brand) also, so that’s two people going to college at the same time. She’s a single parent, so she’s the only person paying for both our fees. She’s extremely proud about us the colleges that we’re attending. The caveat is that she’s paying almost full cost for each person. I feel guilty sometimes because a good chunk of her salary is going into paying for 2 people at the same time while taking care(financially) of family members back in her home country. Sometimes we hear the complaint about fees—jokingly and un jokingly, which is perfectly understandable. 

Both my sibling and I want to go into medicine as well. I understand that there are quicker and more lucrative option to wealth than going into medicine. At an event today, my mom’s colleagues essentially hinted at me not to go into medicine when I’m paying such high cost to go to Stanford. They were suggesting I explore other routes out there that will make me a higher income in a shorter amount of time. They basically said keep an open-mind—you’re around Silicon Valley make all that fees worth it. They suggested that one going into medicine didn’t need such an expensive school, so if I’m going there I might as well take advantage of all the other non-med related resources.

Now, my mom has been supportive of whatever decision I make. She essentially told me to do whatever makes me happy.

So, I ask this question (please consider the circumstances) to those who are upper classmen and alum—has the Stanford name tag been worth it to you?",1567823410,10,0

Am I really First-gen/Low Income?,"Incoming Frosh here. I'm in a dilemma right now. I'm first-gen/low-income on paper, and so I've been getting emails about all sorts of events planned for first-gen/low income students. However, I'm currently on a full scholarship with a very generous stipend. On top of that, my scholarship also allowed me to go to a private boarding school, and offers me very generous allowances for things like a laptop, phone, clothing annually. I'm just not sure that if I do attend those events and try join the community at Stanford, will people judge me for the privileges that I've had and be skeptical about me really being part of that community. Keep in my mind my parents never went to college and I've lived below the poverty line before I received my scholarship two years ago. So, should I attend those events and try to integrate into the community?

Tl;dr my parents didn't go to college, and my family and I lived below the poverty line until I received a scholarship which allowed me to go to a private boarding school and offered me generous stipends and allowances. Do I fit into the first-gen/low-income community?",1567800876,27,0

Blind Advice,"I’m hoping to receive some advice given minimal information.

I think I may have fell into a creative arrogant trap. I’m currently in Canada at a University that seemed to have been a good option for someone who is creative and intellectual. For anyone who knows Elon Musk and his story, I quite literally thought I was clever enough to go to a harder school than Musk did in Canada but still try to transfer to a school in the US. That was a bad plan. It was appealing, who wouldn’t want to transfer from one impossible school to another and have that as their history? I then realized that this University is trying so hard to have a good reputation that it cares less about what the students actually learn than having the hardest courses. Turns out, everyone is failing their courses and everything is curved all the time. Thus, it is quite impossible to transfer as it seems that averages are nearing 60 at this school. Overall, it is a massive trap and a hellhole for someone who is creative and wants to build things. I have no time to do anything because of the massive course load and being in one of the hardest programs. Not only that but the professors at the school can barely speak English. I’m not sure what to do being someone who was chasing the reputation of the school and hoping it would be easy to transfer to a US school so I could actually enjoy world renowned professors, creative students, and time to learn. The US is rather more creative than Canada and I think I have made a bad decision. As before, I could see the path to success, now all I see is me finishing this degree then being trapped in Canada and never starting a business in the US.

Using SCPD's Foundations in Computer Science certificate to get into a MSCS (non-CS background),"Hi there,

I was wondering whether anyone here has been successful in using SCPD courses (taken online) to meet the CS prerequisite that most MSCS programs have?

My own situation is that I live in the UK and have a BS and MS in Economics (from top universities here with 3.7-4.0 GPA equivalents I think). I want to apply to the US for MSCS programs next year (for Fall 2021 entry) and as most of them require some CS background I'm looking around for ways I can acquire the credits in the next 1-2 years. SCPD's certificate looks like one solid option. Another is Oregon State University's online post-bacc in CS, which confers a complete BS and is cheaper per credit hour but I'm thinking that the brand name recognition of Stanford might help - maybe the courses will be perceived as more rigorous.

Another thing I'd be after is getting letters of recommendation from professors - anyone know if this is possible if you take an active student role in a SCPD course?

Internal MS in Stats,"This is probably a weirder one of the annoying ""chance me"" thread variety, but I'm wondering if anyone has any insight into how difficult it is to get accepted into the MS stats internally as a PhD student in a tangentially related field.

I know some MA/MS programs are free to enter for anyone who can get the grades (like Econ's MA) but I know the application process is a lot more involved for statistics. I've seen someone say the coterm isn't too hard to get into assuming the above stuff is adequate, so I have a hunch that they'd act similarly for PhD students, but I'd love to know if anyone has some additional insight beyond my own guesswork.

How hard/math intensive is a Econ+stats double major?,"Hi all,

I am planning on applying to Stanford, UPenn, and UChicago next year and doing econ and stats as a double major, but I had a few questions. 

1) Is econ and stats in Liberal Arts and Sciences or is it in the business school? Are there even specific business undergrad majors? If there are, is taking a specific business major like finance or marketing just as good as econ and stats if I want to get an MBA and eventually a management role, or is it too limiting?

2) How hard is an econ and stats double major? I know that prestigious schools are really hard, and I wanted to know if stanford is the same or if it is relatively easy to the other prestigious schools.

3) Is econ and stats going to help me find a consulting internship out of college and eventually help me get an MBA?

4) How much calculus would be needed for this double degree? I stopped after Calc BC and I am only taking Comp Sci as my math in senior year because I don't want to do Calc 3.

Rescinding Admissions,"I am incredibly honored to say that I was accepted to Stanford through the REA program.

If I have a 3.96 unweighted GPA by the end of the year (I can reliably expect As in most of my other classes), will my admission to Stanford be rescinded?

(I should also mention that my classes are mostly IB and I think I’ll get my diploma, but probably not with high marks. It might help that I’m actively participating in all of my extracurricular clubs/organizations/research projects, even after admission and I probably will until the end of the school year.)",1576049319,1,0

FLI Early Admits,"First off, if you're a class of 2024 early admit, congratulations! Stanford has a lot of resources and is overall a great place to study many things. I want to bring attention specifically the resources that Stanford has for First Gen/Low Income students.  First off, check out the website https://diversityandfirstgen.stanford.edu/resources to see the resources provided by the Diversity and First-Gen office. I'd specifically like to point towards the Opportunity Fund and the FLI Mentorship program.  

Also, I'd like to stress that there is no shame in tutoring/taking more time at Stanford. If your High School did not adequately prepare you for some of the courses at Stanford, do not overdo it to try to match your peers. Stanford offers subject tutoring for many subjects and tons of other resources that you're likely not used to coming from underserved high schools.  

Overall, many people are going to come in with more academic prep than you and that can feel hard at times. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.",1575949194,1,0

I have a few options: what do you think I should do?

A: Cancel the scores and not receive them
B: Wait for the scores to come out - if good, send them
C: Wait for the scores to come out - if bad, don't send them (is this possible after already getting accepted?)

There's nothing special about me- I've not a genius, I only speak one language, and I'm not particularly athletic. I feel like I'm the only 'mediocre' kid Stanford accepted and I have this horrible feeling that my acceptance was a mistake.

How is public transport at Stanford?,"Hi, everyone!

I’m in the Stanford CO 2024 and I’ve never visited campus, my only idea of what the campus is like comes from gilded youtube videos and google maps. Maybe accepting my admittance without knowing the campus was a bad idea, but it’s Stanford and I grew up in California so I’m not expecting much different. 

However, I’m incredibly poor. Like, will need a work-study job as soon as I step foot onto campus poor. My parents have absolutely no money to give me for college, and so I won’t really have access to certain things (like a bike/skateboard to get around) for awhile unless I’m able to secure a scholarship (not banking on it but I’m hopeful?) 

So, my questions for you all are: for the period that I don’t have a bike/skateboard/whatever, is walking around campus difficult/doable? secondly, is public transportation an option? I’ve seen stuff about public transport on Stanford’s website, but I’m not sure how viable it is since whenever I see YouTube videos, people just Über to go to Walmart/Whole Foods or Palo Alto or whatever (their privilege or just the most convenient way? both?)

Taking CS229 through SCPD: application and prereq tips,"Hi all - I'm applying to take CS229 through SCPD in the Spring term as a non-degree seeking distance learning student. I was hoping to get some tips, grateful in advance for any help you can give :)

First on the application itself: I'm under the impression that being accepted to take SCPD courses as a non-degree student isn't really that competitive a process and so my statement of purpose doesn't really have to be edited to perfection. I have a BS and MS degree in Economics where we did a lot of calculus/linear algebra in minimising different loss functions so I'm hoping I tick the main boxes. Am I right, or is SCPD a lot more competitive to be accepted into than I think? It'd be good to know if so :)

Second on prerequisites: it's been a while since my MS degree and I'm looking to brush up on my math in the few months before the course starts. I recently went through basic calculus, and I gather the most important thing to do next is some linear algebra. I was considering working through either 'introduction to linear algebra' by Strang, or 'linear algebra done right' by Axler. I know they are two different levels of rigour/proof-based-ness, so I was wondering if anyone could say which one is more appropriate as a prerequisite for the CS229 course?

Or maybe I'm way off the mark and there's something better I should do as preparation :)

Tough freshman fall quarter,"Hi, 

I recently finished my fall quarter at Stanford and it really, really sucked. Not only did I have a hard time adjusting, but I got a B+/- on almost all my classes this quarter and felt subpar 100% of the time; I also struggled a lot with my mental health and ended up skipping lecture because I didn't feel like leaving my room. Not only do I feel absolutely pathetic about my academic performance this quarter, but I'm also reevaluating my abilities and I'm really scared that the following quarters are going to get worse. I'm scared that I'm not going to be able to land an internship because of my GPA (I want to major in CS and I fucked up my CS class along with other classes because oh well) and I just feel inferior compared to everyone else. Is it normal to not perform well in the first quarter? Everyone around me seems to be doing great and I just feel like a failure right now :(

Bit of an unusual request for any stanford student,"So this is a bit of an unusual request but you can go through my account history to verify my background. 

I'm a psychiatry resident interested in applying to a fellowship at Stanford. The issue is that I've emailed the fellowship coordinator who's email is listed on the program's page and have not gotten a response. I've tried twice now and nothing, not even an acknowledgement. I looked her up on linkedin and her LinkedIn profile has her listed in another job. So I'm guessing she's moved on but the email hasn't been updated. 

So, natural next step would be to email the program director. Well.....her university email is not publicly listed (not uncommon for psychiatrists for obvious reasons). I was hoping someone could help me out by looking up her email address for me? I can PM you the specific fellowship website.",1576730952,1,0

International Policy Coterm Questions,"I am very ignorant on this subject, so apologies if this is a stupid question.

I am hoping to graduate in 4 years, in order not to have to pay for an extra year, and so as a junior, I was hoping to have finished the program by the end of next year. However, the program seems to be spread out across 2 years. Do any of you guys know if it would be possible to complete the coterm by the end of next year, if I have not even applied to the program yet? 

Additionally, I was wondering how competitive the coterm is, compared to other coterms. Would it be possible for someone majoring in a field other than IR, to be able to get into the program, or do they tend to accept exclusively, or nearly exclusively all people from a related field?

LATE stanford rea (with art portfolio) question.,"okay so I’m a prospective student who submitted a portfolio and application to Stanford REA (due the fifteenth) late.  I have never used common app and when I paid for the application fee, I clicked submit and left the rest alone. So...I forgot to confirm all of the legal things towards the end of the common app (I didn’t think twice and left it alone...but that’s only because I had to go to the hospital.) We had a major family accident and I’ve been in the ER since Tuesday afternoon. Things are not well atm. 


 Yesterday night I realized that Slideroom gave me a 24 hour grace period——so I proceeded to submit my entire application LATE (around 9pm yesterday night.)


Now I don’t know what to do.

Is Stanford going to read my application? Or throw me in the pool with RD applicants? I’m not sure if anyone knows:(

REA means a lot to me because I’d like to know if I was denied/accepted early. this is really upsetting to me and i take full responsibility for the late application. stanford is my dream school and i believe I ruined all of my chances for admission.  I feel so incredibly stupid. I worked so hard on this. 

I know this isn’t admissions or anything but does anyone know who I should call?

Masters Degree in Computer Science (MSCS) Application Question - Financial Aid question,"Hey everyone! I'm currently applying to Stanford's Masters in CS program. On the official Stanford webpage, they state: ""The Computer Science Department does not offer financial support for MS students"". However, on the same webpage, they also state that limited CA/RA resources (tuition + stipend funding) are sometimes available to Master's students once matriculated.

On the application website, it asks the following required question:

""Are you applying for financial aid such as fellowships or assistantships from Stanford University (e.g., Departmental funding)? - Yes/No""

I'm not sure which one to pick right now. The reason being that I think picking ""Yes"" will significantly hurt my chances in admissions, since Stanford clearly states not to expect funding for MS students. However, I'm planning on working hard if I get in and secure CA/RA funding. If I check ""No"" on the app, I'm worried that I will be barred from ever applying for CA/RA funding, since the department can point to my application and say ""look here, you clearly said you're not applying for financial aid"".

What do you think? Am I overthinking this? Will checking Yes have a detrimental impact on my application? Thanks in advance!

"Stanford's dining halls, ranked","I want to preface this post by saying that I know my opinions are **widely held** throughout the Stanford community, I just wanted to create a post that would help visitors and ProFros know what the best options are for food on campus!

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Arrillaga**: the food here is sooo good! The chicken is nice and juicy, the building is so large, and the staff are so friendly. The attribute that puts Arrillaga over the top is their garden, which grows all the food served in the dining hall. It is huge and you won't have any trouble finding a seat. 10/10
2. **FloMo**: I love the view in this dining hall and the fact that the name is an abbreviation is so cool! I haven't tried the food yet, but the ice cream is really good (doesn't compare to Arrillaga though). Also, say hi to John on the cooking staff while you're there. 10/10
3. **Lakeside**: I have some friends in Roble (best dorm!) and stopped by to check out the dining hall nearby. The dining room feels like a conference hall, the tables are pentagons and the chairs are nice and sturdy. I will say that the drink serving section allows people to walk up and steal, which is a terrible design choice. Still check it out! 9/10
4. **Ricker**: The food was stupendous but it's lower on this list because it's kind of far away from all my classes and it's inconvenient for my schedule. 6/10
5. **Wilbur:** It's literally a 2 minute walk from my dorm, the food is pretty great, and the staff is pretty friendly. However, the smoothies are not a regular occurrence and the soft-serve machine seems to be broken all the time. 5/10
6. **Casper**: Very close to Wilbur, and the quad is pretty nice. I will say one thing though, it's full of athletes, and as a 5'3 115 pound man, they make me feel inferior. Stay far away from this dining hall if you're an average sized human and want to feel that way at Stanford. 4/10
7. **Stern**: This dining hall deserves a special place in hell. Coming from a place with very authentic Mexican food and a large Mexican-American population (New Hampshire), the burrito bowl experience was terrible. They didn't speak to me in Spanish and it doesn't taste as good as the family-owned Taco Bell in my hometown. Eat here at your own risk. 2/10",1570505388,0,0
When to study abroad?,"Freshman here. I was wondering what year and what quarter people study abroad most often and what factors to consider when choosing a specific quarter.

Stanford Debt Worth?,"Hi,

I am a prospective senior applicant for Stanford undergrad 2024(my dream school). I was wondering if Stanford full price is worth it as my parents did not qualify for much financial aid(income \~ 240k) through FAFSA and they have just bought a new house, which meant taking a pretty hefty loan while paying for our last home(trying to sell). If I attend Stanford, I hope to chase and squeeze every opportunity, internship, connections to VCs in Bay Area/amazing funding opportunities/networking connections, and immerse myself within the start-up culture and create 2-3 companies(have ideas already in mind), which is why it is my dream school.  My plan is to double major in bioengineering and MSE and I believe I have the caliber to achieve these things based on my unique track record in high school and work ethic(all by myself and through persistence: started profitable company in high school, won international competitions, was top 2% in competitive high school in Texas, did 5 internships etc.). My question is: Stanford is going to be around 250k-300k in loans which I believe I will have to mostly pay(along with some parent contribution) but based on my description, goals, and ambitious nature can it be a good idea to go if I get in. While there are other options/schools out there without the need for such a big loan,  I know that by going to Stanford I will be able to fast-track the ability to achieve my dreams and have the connections to the bay area/funding/ and world-class professors in front of me. Has anyone else been through the same situation(taking large loans) and attended Stanford?

HELP - Failed 1st Year Don’t Know What To Do,"Hi, so I don’t want to make a super long story and I really need good feedback on what to do. So I pretty much failed my first 3 quarters because of built up depression etc and wasn’t able to reach my academic potential I had when I was in high school. My parents are both immigrants who came alone and both passed away and I ended up making it to UCLA. I managed to get fully covered besides a small loan but because of the depression and feeling of being alone etc I couldn’t make it. I’ve taken about 5 months to recollect myself and I feel as though I can do it right this time. 

The problem is I got sent a letter in the mail that I owe 4 grand since I got a loan and failed my first year. I have no financial support since I have no biological family alive in the US and my hometown is 4 hours away from UCLA so commuting is not an option.

Is it possible to enroll in the lecture I want and then drop the original's lecture so I'm safe, because if I drop my original lecture and can't get the other time I want I might not get the class at all. 

TLDR: When enrolling for a second time is it better to enroll in the class you want than drop the original class you had. Or do you have to drop the class you first signed up for and then enroll in your other desired class/lecture.

LOST Anthropology Major Looking for Advice and Constructive Criticism LOL,"Hi guys. So I am currently a community college student looking to transfer next fall...UCLA being the top choice \*wish me luck for admissions ripppp\*\*. However, I am pretty torn about my major.... I have changed it multiple times from majors such as political science, criminal justice, etc... all within the social sciences. I've never really found a major that I am genuinely passionate about and the uncertainty that comes with that is so stressful. I definitely am not suited for a STEM major. Not going to lie, I somewhat cherry-picked anthropology just because I was running out of time and needed to choose a field with a reasonable amount of major prep courses so that I can transfer in time (because I need to submit apps soon). Not to say that I do not enjoy the anthropology classes that I am taking, but I have a difficult time believing that it will really get me anywhere in life as it is not a traditionally respected major such as CS or Bio. Ultimately, my end goal is to go pursue law school after my undergrad, in which they do accept students of all majors. BUT will the skills acquired from an anthro degree even be beneficial or worthwhile? Part of the reason I chose this major was due to how fascinated I was with an anthropologist's perspective... being able to objectively analyze situations/people/etc. and effectively communicate their thoughts. But I can't help feeling a level of embarrassment when people ask me what my major is because they are quick to make negative assumptions. That sounds extremely ridiculous because I know that I am a hardworking student who is dedicated...but society has gotten to me sadly and I try to fit into other's mold when the only person I should work to impress is myself (and my future employer of course LOL). When i do transfer, regardless if that is at UCLA or at another UC campus, I am afraid I will be unhappy and that I have wasted all this time and money... i guess the main purpose of this post is the question: **Is an anthropology degree a waste of time if I am trying to pursue law?** \- sincerely, a confused 19 yr old gal :(",1568106213,0,0

Office hours?,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the second post in a few hours, I was just wondering if there is a way to find a Professor's current office hours? I am in desperate need for a letter of recommendation due in 15 days, and I have been left in an unfortunate situation where a Professor who promised a LOR has ghosted on me. In my search for a new Professor, I still have my syllabus which lists their office hours, but they change every quarter right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way to find their new office hours besides camping outside of their office? I am now convinced that the only way I will get a LOR is to ask in person first. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if things become even more desperate, is it poor etiquette to ask for a LOR for a Professor who I'm only taking for the first time this quarter?

An open letter to /r/UCLA,"If your correctness score is below 50, it may not be because of your lack of understanding of C++, but something more fundamental: You ignored repeated admonitions in the spec and in class to avoid specific foolish mistakes, yet you made them anyway. Whatever your field of study is, you must fix this characteristic about yourself. No employer would dare hire someone who ignores repeated spoken and written directives: You'd pose a risk to the safety of yourself and others if you ignore safety rules, a risk to the financial health of the company if you ignore legal regulations, and a drain on productivity if your ignoring specifications causes you or others to devote more time later on to correct your mistakes.


What’s exasperating is that despite all that was said above, there will be people who will ask for a re-examination of their correctness score without saying which test case numbers to look at or without having tried those cases under multiple compliers or without running the Project 2 tester mentioned in FAQ #7. Those people are exhibiting the exact characteristic that may have caused them to make the mistake that cost them so many points: They don’t pay attention to what they read.",1572416271,17,0

Possible food poisoning from participating in a study ???,"I recently tested positive for a bacterial infection and according to my doctor, I was exposed to it by eating contaminated food.

I had to sit and watch a video while snacking on some candy. Then, Wednesday morning I had nothing for breakfast but the serious symptoms had already begun. I’m wondering if I should email the researchers and warn them. Then again, I don’t know their actual methods, or whether or not they actually emptied out the bowl from which I was snacking from. It’s just unsettling to me to wonder whether or not I was eating from the same bowl that other people were dipping their hands into. According to the CDC, the strain of bacteria I was exposed to can be spread from eating something that has been in contact with the stool of someone else who is sick with that strain.

Thinking of applying to be a New Student Advisor (NSA)? DON’T.,"I’m only writing this because I just started seeing postings about the recent opening of the NSA application. Trust me, as someone who has been a part of the program before (and would never willingly be a part of it again) there are much better ways to make a difference on campus. Firstly, your experience in the program really just depends on whether you’re liked by the “professional” staff which is why you may hear some people say such positive things about their experience and hear others complain about theirs. The staff has no morale. The staff works insane hours (many of which aren’t paid but are rather “compensated” through housing which is technically illegal in California but they’ve found some special wording that makes it legal in their work contract) and despite constantly working your butt off, you will hardly receive positive encouragement and only constantly be told what you (the staff collectively) are doing wrong. Although constructive criticism is great, this professional staff literally doesn’t know how to thank you for your hard work. If you suffer from mental health I am warning you, DO NOT JOIN THIS PROGRAM. They don’t care about your mental health and everything they preach all summer applies to everyone but their own staff. For example, they constantly tell the new students about how even though they’re in college it’s important to, “get 7-8 hours of sleep,” meanwhile the staff is constantly running on very little sleep. Every year they get complaints about mistreatment by the professional staff and simply just brush it off with a mediocre apology. Seriously, you’re better off working at a coffee shop over the summer (you’ll be a lot happier). 

TL;DR don’t join this program unless you want to be mentally abused and mistreated",1576570219,1,0

Looking for more opinions, thanks in advance! I want to take those useful classes on personal finance but am the type to feel like every class I take should go to some sort of objective. I know I'll get something out of those classes so I should rid myself of that mentality, but is it worth it for me to take the dive and double major?

Am i missing something? I feel like im getting killed in 107 but how can the A% be so high if its a “harder” major? I want to switch to an easier major like bio cus all i really care about is my gpa cus im not pre med but the bruinwalks dont make it look like biology is an easier major.

Question about Econ 101 and mgmt 1B,"Looks like the only thing I can do this quarter is take 101 and 1B because it’s all I have left for biz Econ premajor. I also have an internship lined up that’s 15-20 hours per week, so I need my classes on 2-3 days. I’m also a commuter. Is Econ 101, mgmt 1B, and a GE too hard on top of an internship? I’m kinda out of options because I only need 1 more GE. I also need 1 quarter of French, but it’s MWF so right now that’s not an option. 

The only thing that concerns me is I got a B in Econ 11, but i did get an A in mgmt 1A. So basically I suck at calculus. My only other B is in 31B, rest of my classes all A’s (no A- either). I’m a little borderline, and probably need a B+ (maybe B in 1B) in both classes to get into business Econ. Also, I took Woo for 1A and I know ravetch is impossible and way too much work. 

I think I can go to whatever discussion I want for 101, and since it’s a new prof I assume it won’t fill up. So I think I’ll use my second pass on that. 

What are the discussions like for 1B? Mandatory? If so I’ll use my first pass to get a good discussion and then whatever GE I want. 

Also another unrelated question: is 3 Econ/ mgmt upper divisions considered too hard? Since I’ll be done with GEs this is what my schedule will end up looking like later lol.",1573490115,1,0

As UCLA students you might think, if thinking is something you include as part of your daily reflection time fo the day, what's the purpose, or goal if that word suits you better, of going to a good (even though everything is relative and other ways of self education are decent) college and myself, as a Bruin, ask that question several times, at least five or six, maybe seven some days when I'm nostalgic, sometimes more than once per hour even. It's interesting the role of college in our lives and we can't deny it takes a toll on our mind or brain, with the passing of the years. It's totally worth it but sometimes it's not and even if it's not worth it, going to college is one of the things every person in their young life should at least consider and if they don't, well that's up to them, who am I to judge, right.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I wanted to tell you guys, now that you are studying for your midterms, is that an exam is exactly that, an exam, and if you are looking for some sort of strategy, well, in college there are a lot of them but I don't want to spend more of your time when you clearly should be studying, but I do want to say that it's important to at least consider everything we just discussed and even though I did them most of the talking, you as a reader are also an active mind and I am sure your take on this is as important and relevant as mine.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this and I wish you the best, or not if that's not what you are aiming for in this life.",1571429616,1,0

Good programming (or general) classes for an econ major?,"Hey everyone, I’m graduating this school year with a degree in econ and minor in environmental systems and realized I have 2 empty class slots for the next 2 quarters. 

So I’ve been wondering, what would be the best classes for me to take to help me stand out in the job hunt? I’ve taken pic10a and a class that had me use R, so I’m thinking of possibly taking pic10b and pic10c but have heard C++ isn’t widely used and there are better programming languages to learn.

I haven’t taken a mgmt class before, and although i’ve heard they’re very useful, I’m not very interested in accounting and have heard they can be pretty brutal for gpa.

How does anyone manage to not kill the environment,"Last year I had a basic dorm with 2 frat boy roommates and we threw everything in the same trash bag because doing anything else with the state of the room and the people inside it was a massive impossible pain in the ass. I have a single this year, so I figured I would be a good person and save the planet, except...it's really hard to figure out what goes where, my lord. I tried making 3 bags for compost/recycle/trash, but what goes in which bag? In particular, the following items confuse me:

* Rendevous ""papery"" boxes, are these compostable or recyclable??
* Study boxes for things like waffles, they look even paperier? I assume the plastic top goes in recycle?
* Bags for chips/popcorn have to be thrown out, right? (Does this mean UCLA will get rid of them within a year to be ""100% eco-friendly by 2020"")
* Cardboard pizza boxes...I figured these were compostable but apparently you're supposed to take them apart and recycle them? According to a sign on the trash chute
* If there's a significant amount of food in any of the above doesn't that make them non-recyclable? 
* Receipts/classwork is paper so it definitely gets recycled??? Right??
* Technically the big black trash bags aren't compostable so can I really drop a bag full of compostable items down the compost chute??? Doesn't this defeat the entire point

I Always Feel Like the Smartest One at USC,"I decided to become a USC student after I realized how bored I was in my UCLA classes even though I suck at writing and reading and taking the SAT unassisted, and because I usually preferred to study for my USC classes instead because the material was always more interesting to me.

But it doesn’t matter how few hours I study, I am always way ahead in the class and when new material comes I’m still too busy laughing at how easy the previous week’s material was. And with some classes I comprehend the material so much that I feel like I can’t go to office hours because I don’t even know WHAT to ask. I know it’s because there’s no need to study - I never seem to need much time to do actual practice problems, because I waste too much time playing games on my phone during class that it doesn’t seem necessary to do homework if I’m going to ace it anyway (right?)

Then shit is hitting the fan now that midterms are here. I hate overhearing conversations of “oh yeah that wasn’t too bad” from people I KNOW know what they’re doing in the class when I’m over here flying through exams getting As like nothing.

I just hate always being so ahead even though I love the material. It’s almost self-sabotage choosing to do something that I am so “gifted” at because I like doing it, but I can’t go back to acing everything and being bored. I feel like I should have gone to USC to be a communications major instead, because based on the  classes I’ve taken there over the summer I could actually skip every class and still get an A.

psych 100b vibes...,"I've seen a lot of posts here asking how Psych 100b is like. I was one of those students before and I took this class so I thought i'd tell you guys how it went for me. 

First off, I got a perfect score on the final (over the summer there is only a final and no midterm, and this one exam is worth 40% of your entire grade) and yet I ended w/ a B. everyone said to take it during the summer cuz it's supposedly easier, but I'd only suggest doing that if you are an excellent writer. I actually always thought I was pretty good at writing, I've never gotten anything below an A in any of my papers throughout several years in college thus far. But my self-confidence in my writing skills is completely shattered now cuz of psych 100b. 

During the summer, the lab is worth way more points than usual, it goes 60/40 in favor of lab, while during the school years it's vice versa. I wish I took it during the school year cuz the test was not nearly as bad as everyone on Bruinwalk said, and those extra points would've helped me a lot, cuz again I essentially got a 100% in lecture. Also, during the summer, keep in mind that the pace is accelerated like crazy. The thing was, we would be assigned a big project on a thursday, and it would be due on tuesday- problem was there wasn't a single OH available in b/w those days and my TA was very bad at responding to emails. This was a very annoying problem to have for a class like this cuz everything is so arbitrary and the instructions to assignments are not clear. I swear they keep things vague and confusing on purpose or something. You'll know what I mean once you take the class- but basically almost every element to whatever instructions you get, or the ""guidelines"" to the first and second submissions are really up to interpretation. So thus due to my TA's lack of ability to respond to emails and lack of OH in b/w having something assigned and due, I would essentially be shooting from the hip on a lot of things. There's no minimum page or maximum page limit either, at least having that would've been nice so you have some gauge in how much details need to be written. There'd be instances where I'd write things the T.A. said to do, and she would still mark me off. She would even mark me off for something that would literally be addressed the next sentence, it's like she barely read my paper or something. 

The grading of these papers is very, very arbitrary. Sometimes your T.A. will mark off minute details while forgetting to mark off other parts of your paper w/ similar mistakes. Also, the first and second submissions are the biggest component to your lab grade, and they build off each other. I did not even get my first submission back until a day or two before the second and final submission was due, so I pretty much had no idea if a lot of the ideas I was writing were even accurate. From what I understand, this is usually not an issue during the regular quarter cuz everything is spaced out, and you have weeks to do assignments we have days to complete.

Oh and a big part of your lab grade is going to be your group. I had a pretty shitty group so that sucked- one person seemed to not care about anything while the other pretended to care while writing BS. So there's going to be a lot of luck involved in this class. 

Bottom line is, the material to the class is not difficult but it is poorly structured imo. I feel like they should be giving more clear instructions to the assignments, and either eliminate the group element or change the structure of it. I understand that obviously in the future many of our careers are going to involve the ability to work in groups, but I feel like for a 6 unit class like this where your grade is so important, they should allow grades to be decided by the individual. But hey, that's just my 2-cents. I also wanted to write this post so that others may be more mindful of taking this class over the summer. It seems like the general consensus among psych majors is ""take 100b over the summer, it's going to be easier!"" but it is entirely subjective and depends on your strengths and weaknesses as a student. If any of you out there have some questions or want to know more details (like the T.A. I had or grades to specific assignments) pm me, I didn't wanna write out too many details to maintain anonymity.",1571208637,4,0

"Grad student transferring to UCLA, need advice on finding an apartment/roommate","Hello, I'm going to be moving to los angeles soon to start at UCLA as a graduate student this coming winter quarter. I'm looking to get a move-in date for an apartment in early december (at least a few days before the 18th - I already booked christmas flights back to family, and am looking to get moved in before I fly back for that). My advisor can fly me out for a week to find an apartment and help set up the new lab in early november, which to my understanding is about how far in advance you want to apartment hunt in LA. I have a lot of questions to this end:

Do you guys think it would be better to hunt during the week of Nov. 3rd, or Nov. 10th?

Where's the best place to find a roommate? I'm in a bit of a tricky situation with this one. For the first 6ish months, I would be a non-full time trans woman still going by my old name, and sometime during the first year I would be looking to go full time. Maybe I'm being overly cautious (I grew up in north carolina, did my undergrad in virginia), but I need to make sure whoever I'm rooming with is going to be alright with that. It's tricky to use social media (like the facebook page) for this purpose as I can't be direct in posts without outing myself to extended family

Any tips for apartment complexes? I'm looking for a place that has a rent &lt;1300/person (preferably closer to 1100) that has a good amount of available bussing to UCLA campus, as I won't have a car. Grocery stores and such located nearby would also be a huge plus. So far what I've been looking at is the area that the University Apartments South complexes are located - I applied too late to have any chance in the housing lottery, but even without going through the university there seem to be a good number of two bedroom apartments in that area that are within my price range.

Other nice things would be if washer/dryer were located as nearby as possible (I think that in LA in-unit ones are pretty much impossible at my price point, but on the same floor would be great. Per building would also be fine, but I would really prefer to avoid needing a separate location for laundry), and if the lease/sublet was monthly as that would make it a lot easier to potentially switch into cheaper university-affiliated housing in the future.

I don't really care about roommate gender. Past experience with my current, male roommate suggests that the whole bras and boobs thing can be awkward for guys to live with. I'm pretty quiet most of the time (headphones not speakers, etc), my room is often messy, but I keep common spaces relatively clean. I tend to clean in bursts. I'm fine with alcohol / marijuana as long as it's non-smoking. I myself don't drink very often (around once per 1/2 months in the past) but have been known to get fairly drunk at times, and would probably want to try (legal) marijuana at one point or another. I'm not a fan of parties, but would be fine as long as I had a bit of notice.

If you have any tips at all for getting a good apartment for not too much money, or know someone that's subletting a space or looking to move into a new one this december, please let me know!",1571164186,3,0

Meeting Friends Around Campus,"I have seen quite a few posts about new students feeling lonely and decided to post about it. I hope you guys will find it useful. The main advice given for such posts is to join a club or go out there and start talking to people around you. It's easier said than done. It may work with some people, but not always.

I used to be an international student and I know all the struggles they go through (far away from families, friends, new culture, new language, the list goes on). After I graduated not so long ago, I decided to create a platform to help international students make friends at their new colleges and help them feel more comfortable.

I published my mobile app about 2-3 ago, and what I found out was quite interesting. So many local students from different universities signed up (even more than internationals), and I realized that this can be a great way for students to meet new people, make friends, go to college events together, overcome social anxiety.

I would be very happy, even if I could help one person. If anyone is interested, just comment below or send me a DM.",1570376873,6,0

Some of the ways this is happening are explained in the update section near the end of the document. Media is currently ignoring this story. This is an effort to create public awareness, so that bribes, blackmail, censorship, and secret deals cannot allow these vile criminals to maintain the status quo, and remain in office.

Billions in bribes were paid to Trump, Pelosi, Schumer, Harris and others to enable a Soros, Koch, and Porter funded child raping ring to operate in the USA.

\\\\Please post this anywhere you can! Create your own posts with this or other excerpt from the PDF. This information keeps getting blocked, censored, 'down/voted' etc. These people are extremely wealthy and throw money to anyone who will help them cover up their child rapes , child murders, and corruption. This is usually done through a receivership transfer where you receive the funds after for or more day, and it can be pulled at the last second, which is usually the case after you've done them the ""service"" as they call it. Please help get the word out. Soon it will no longer be able to be ignored.

A word about the ""faggot"" usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control of the situation, if they were the usage would have been stopped. Everyone out there needed to see this, as it was contrary to the picture they were painting. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the telepathic headspace \[see reference item G in the PDF\], which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of B.S. in the headspace, because they would not call each other “faggot”, and in turn giving themselves away thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for those unintentionally offended. On that note, I give you former President Barack Obama in a foursome with Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and Matthew Porter.

2019 did not go as planned. Hope you Bruins have had better luck than I had :),"Been single for 20 years. Decided 2019 was the year I changed that status before the new decade came around. 

Became friends with a very beautiful lady along with a group of other Bruins. Struggled through the same classes and also partied through the highs and cried through the lows. Summer school together was only bearable because she was there taking the same classes as I was. 

Decided it was time I make a move and reveal that my feelings have ignited, starting from a small spark into a huge fire. But what could I say or do? Blurting it out is no fun. I can't sing for my life nor do I have the money to hire a singing coach. Can't really play guitar as I can only play the basic chords. Hmm...

I remember vividly the day she shared her life story. I could hear the sadness in her voice, but it was the silent emotionless expression of sorrow on her face that screamed the loudest. I could rarely see the smile on her face throughout the days, yet when she did, it was the prettiest thing she wore. 

And thus, I embarked on a ruthless journey, to re-ignite my childhood passions of drawing and coloring, and draw a portrait of her, smiling. Not that I was good at drawing, but I was determined. I saved up whatever amount of money I could gather through my summer job to purchase a Strathmore 400 Series Drawing Paper Pad, some colored pencils, and art pencils for shading. Contacted my art major friend to teach me the basics and help me correct the imperfections of my lines and shapes. Fall quarter goes by, she doesn't suspect a thing. 

Through many trial and errors, many hours of preparation, I finally completed a fairly accurate portrait of her, smiling, and nice sunny UCLA background. 

I didn't want to distract her from her studies as it was the peak of the latter weeks of Fall Quarter. We got through finals and it was finally time. I tell her that I have a gift for her as a congratulations to getting through another quarter. Knees weak, arms heavy, heart pounding, I lead her to my place where I unveiled the product of my labor. 

She looks stunned and laughs, laughing with the same smile as the one I had produced with pencil and paper.  I tell her it was for her, that her smile was beautiful and it makes me happy. Was it a success?

She turns to me, laughing, and says ""Thanks bro, you can keep it though since it makes you happy and I don't have much space in my room!"" At this point I revealed my true intentions and it turns out she actually has been talking/dating someone else from a different school (a school close to UCLA, but not as good as UCLA if you know what I mean ;) ). She said that perhaps if I told her a couple weeks earlier, things would've been different but now it's too late. At least for now because she's fully committed with her current relationship.

We're still friends (rip), I have no hate towards her at all, it's her decision and I respect it. We hung out over break a couple times. I will probably smack myself for the rest of the year for trying to be a romantic fool but you live and you learn. I let her tell her friends the whole story and she let me tell the story to all of my friends. It's been weeks since it happened so we all laugh about it now and nothing is weird between any of us so it's chill.

Anyways, Bruins, don't be like me and waste your quarter learning how to draw for a girl. Just let her know asap. I will retire on my artistic endeavors and never draw again :). Press F in the chat.

Determine whether a leave of absence is warranted or not,"Hi everyone, 

Some of you may have already seen my previous post on wanting to switch into math and all that but let me expand. 

I just transferred from CC after two years and after this quarter I realized that I am not as interested in my current major as I thought I would be. Math has been something Ive really enjoyed in the last year or so and Ive realized that it is likely too late to do anything abut it here. 

The only thing I could potentially see myself doing is submitting a leave of absence and returning to CC (For about a year) and finishing the few math classes I need to take. Would this route even be possible? If someone returns after x amount of time are they allowed to switch majors? Any sort of advice would help!

When I emailed the prof (this is for a stats class with coding), he said that there was evidence saying that I had copied code off of another student or off the internet. I went through the 9 assignments we did and realized I had used Chegg on one out of the like 80 problems I did. I did not even use it on the code, I used it in my explanation like a dumbfuck. In addition, I honestly put in so much work - hours of work - into this class and cannot believe I was referred over one question. I also got an A on the exams and final project.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much the last few days I have been tripping balls, believing that I will fail (which means it is unlikely I will get an internship) or it will be on my transcript forever (AHHH).

Confessing to Smallberg/Using Github,"Hey guys, I have some serious inquiry about the cheating in the CS department, so please do not swamp me with negative comments. This is also not a copypasta. I am just a CS freshman freaking out right now. It would honestly be great if a TA or anyone with prior experience share their advice or pm me. 

So a couple of days ago, all CS31 students received an email from Smallberg regarding CS31 asking us to confess if we violated the academic integrity. I did end up using Github for one function for a project since I was right on the deadline and I couldn't figure it out.  Looking back, I probably should have just taken the L. It was one of the earlier projects and I made it a point not to do it again in for future projects. I have read some past Reddit posts about CS Smallberg emails and that it is a hoax. Most of them are saying its a fluke or how just deny confession all the way. 

However, I have some reasons to believe they know for certain. I am wondering if I should just confess before they even told me they caught me and hope they will give me a light sentence or I should wait until they notify me and confess then. I really don't want to risk it by continuing denying it and be sent to the student committee. Regardless, the email said I will be sent to the dean of students. 

If anyone can tell me more about the process, especially for Smallberg, and the possible punishments and punishments handed out in the past. I read online that no matter what I do it is at least a two-quarters suspension and even expulsion. It will be great if someone can shed some light on this situation. If you don't want to disclose or remain anonymous, please just send me a PM and I will definitely keep everything private.",1577437211,1,0

Accused of Soliciting Donations in Final. What's the process now?,"Hey bruins, I've been accused of soliciting donations during my final exam (using a clipboard) by another student. I had a clipboard in my seat faced down but didn't even look at it or touch it once throughout the exam. The bossman (professor) himself said that he did not witness anything but since I've been reported by another student, then he will be referring me to the Dean of Charitable Acts for resolution. I did ask ""Scuse me boss, can I ask you a question"" to my TA, but it was about the exam, not donations. I did not solicit donations, as I would rather go broke than to do so as my integrity is priceless, but what's the process now? Naturally, I will deny any wrongdoing, but I have a few questions regarding the process now:

1. What happens when you meet with the Dean of Charitable Acts? What does s/he say to you?

2. Are you assumed to be innocent until proven guilty?

3. Is the burden of proof on the accuser/professor?

4. I know that if the Dean of C.A. determines that there is not enough evidence, then they can dismiss the case. How likely is this, especially if it's just hearsay from another student and the professor or TA didn't see anything. (https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/flowchart.pdf)

5. Would it be possible to show my donation logs or my (legally obtained) solicitation license? Would this help my case to prove my innocence?

6. What is the best way to prove my innocence, especially since it's just hearsay from everybody?

7. Am I able to ask bossmen questions or even know who the bossman is that accused me?

If you have any experience with the Donation Integrity process or have been through it yourself, please share! Thanks y'all!

EDIT: I didn’t bring a backpack to any of my finals that day. I only had my bulletproof vest, my champagne glass, and my clipboard. The clipboard kept falling out of my vest (I got a pretty huge clipboard) so I just picked it up as the exam started and put it down on my seat without a second thought and continued with my exam. At no point did I touch the clipboard or even look at it.

EDIT: I just went into my donation logs. I went back to the day of my exam and during the exam time, it showed that there was 0 activity for any donations or ATM withdrawals or any suspicious questions asked of bossmen at all. It also showed that I received zero dollars during the exam. My clipboard has every donation that I have ever received and records of every student stopped, so this is irrefutable evidence that I did not solicit donations.",1577389161,1,0

I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago because the stress from our responsibilities (classes, extracurriculars, work) were starting to take a toll on our relationship.

Talked to a couple girls to take my mind off her but over the past month I've been realizing she's the only one I want.

I've been wanting to talk to her to try to work things out but I don't think I'm worthy of a second chance. I'm pretty sure she hates me now too. It really sucks because we have classes together next quarter (we're the same major) so I have to see her 3x a week and not seeing her at all this break has already been shitty coz we're from the same hometown and everything reminds me of her.

Worried about being on Academic Probation again,After feeling like I bombed some of my finals and papers I feel like I will be placed on academic probation or subject to dismissal. I was on subject to dismissal previously but cleared it up at the end of spring 2018. I remember being told that before you go on it again it has to be after 3 quarters. If I been on good standing since fall 2018 where does that place me. Does it start from the quarter that place you in good standing (spring) or after (fall)? I’m going to go an advisor later today but I thought I would get some answers from here in the meantime.,1575650950,1,0

Readmission after dismissal help!!!,"My education after high school has been a wild ride. I attended UCLA for a year, and decided to withdraw as a sophomore. I had already received a Subject to Dismissal notice because I failed two classes during Spring Quarter. My mental health took a complete nosedive, which is why I withdrew. Then I received the letter that I was dismissed. Now I'm taking classes at a communty college. It started out fine, but I changed majors and felt so completely lost. Also, I still wasn't getting help for my mental health. So I finished the semester having failed two classes. It really was not looking good for me. I've been thinking long and hard about what direction I want to take in my life. I know I can succeed at UCLA because my first two quarters were okay, I even got two perfect A's in my second quarter. I was just in a horrible state of mind. I've decided that I want to go back and will do literally whatever it takes to get readmitted. I am already getting help for my mental health, and my therapist advised that I set goals and this is one I have set. I am going to quit my bullshit and buckle down and try to fall in love with education again. How can I go about getting readmitted, because I had heard so many different things on this subreddit. Some say its noncompetitive and easy, others say it is difficult and you have to take classes at the expensive UCLA extension, etc. Is it possible for me to get readmitted? I'm aware I will probably have to take courses at a cc to prove I can succeed academically. Thanks in advance for any advice!!!",1575448212,1,0

So if you’d like to come, please [RSVP here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciuqoHsq4B5qKrSdlL0DXO3zIEPx8nMRv5ngf-Lamv3HfYKQ/viewform) and we’ll see you then!",1574474697,1,0

Moreover, she blocked me on Facebook not to make farther contact and didn't give me any response also with email.

Please be careful with people like this, if you try to get tickets from someone on Facebook.

Mental Health screening?,"Throwaway account.

I just need to know if there's any info about mental health screening in UCLA.

I recently talked to some people and when I told them about being ""lazy"" almost everyday for months they clearly told me that it's probably not me being lazy, it might be depression. So, it hit upon me very well and I really need to talk and sort this issue out.

EEB 116: Conservation Bio,"Has anyone taken this class?

I felt really good about the exam walking out but when I got my exam back I'd been docked heavily on practically every section of the exam? I think I could've achieved the same score leaving practically 1/2 the exam blank?

I haven't gotten the opportunity to look over the exam in detail but we're supposedly going to have viewing periods starting next week. If anyone has some advice or or some knowledge regarding the course and exams it'd be greatly appreciated.

I'm wishing I didn't have to spend so much on mandatory food at this point, as it's just money down the drain.   
Worst of all, if I want to get rid of all my meals I have to wait every four hours for the fucking dining period to switch so I can use another swipe (as 11R only lets you use a single swipe every time). It's just another thing to worry about.

In about three hours i’m going to be in the shower alternately crying and coming up with snappy comebacks i’m not going to have the courage to use.

She ended the conversations stating that she was planning on putting up flyers at UCF to “recruit new associates”

I am a UCF student, in the Texts &amp; Technology PhD program, performing a study regarding the usability of telemedicine communications. 

I am looking for UCF undergraduates to participate in an one-time, one-hour study where you will interact with a website on a computer and your smartphone and talk out loud your thoughts during this interaction. The purpose of the study is to find out how easy it is for people to find information on a website. 

In order to participate, you must be 18 years of age or older and required to bring a smartphone and be willing to use it to access the internet for one activity. You will also need to agree to be video recorded. All data transport, analysis, and storage, will be done by the PI and using a password-protected USB, computer, and data analysis software. All data will remain confidential, and all video recordings with identifiable data will be destroyed after data analysis is complete. The results of the data, which are de-identified, may be published in future publications or presented at conferences. The study will take place at UCF, in a classroom or computer lab. You will get a $15 Amazon gift card for participating. 

To schedule your one-time usability session, contact Jessica Lynn Campbell. My contact information is below.

"Took the Fall 2019 Semester off, looking forward to Spring 2020. What should I do?","As the title says, I took the Fall 2019 semester off because of financial issues plaguing my life and my mental well-being. I am now in a more comfortable place that makes it seem like I will be able to attend classes again in 2020, which I'm incredibly hopeful for.

&amp;#x200B;

I took the semester off without talking to an advisor or anything (a mistake on my part, I know) and had to drop a class I was about to fail in Fall 2018, so my first plan is to talk to an advisor and see what my future class road map can look like. I will also be talking to financial aid, as dropping that class put me below the required hours mark for Bright Futures, and I certainly need that financial assistance if I'm going to attend classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a few semesters into a Journalism degree that I really don't want to complete (something that I've realized contributed to my anxiety and depression) so I will also be talking to my advisor about switching majors to something that will actually make me feel excited for college again.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this is background information, but what I'm really trying to ask here if there is anything I forgot or anything I'm not thinking of while I start my transition back to college. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated, and for those who are currently going through Fall 2019 right now, you're doing awesome.",1570200472,9,0

"Ladies, have you been approached by a Johnathan?","While we were studying, a female friend casually mentioned that some guy approached her randomly and said ""Hey, I think you're cute, can I have your number?"" and I was like ""Was his name Jonathan?"". Turns out, it was the same guy. 

A couple months ago, he approached me and we started texting. He asked when I was free and after I replied, he took 4 days to respond. He then told me when and where to meet him (he didn't ask if that time worked for me or if I was okay with meeting there, he just sent me the address). At this point red flags are going off, but I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and meet him anyways (it was a public place and I took other safety precautions like telling friends and family where I'd be). Half an hour before we were supposed to meet, he texted saying ""lets meet 90 minutes later than we agreed"". Again, not apologizing or asking if I was okay, just telling me. I nope'd out of the situation and haven't seen or heard from him since.

Changing major before orientation,"Hello - 

I've been accepted to UCF and I've accepted and made my deposit. Now I realize that I would like to switch my declared major (to something very similar, I just didn't understand the differences when I chose it). Is there a way I can do this before I go to orientation and get split up with people from that major? MyUCF doesn't seem to let me do anything so I'm not sure what to do. 

Thanks!",1575587770,1,0

Here are the classes I need to get out the way in the next semester or two so I can progress to even more advanced engineering-specific courses:

1) Statics (or physics 1, since last time I took physics 1 was 5 years ago, and I remember nothing) 

2) Calc 3

3) Materials 

4) Diff eq 

5) Intro to C 

What classes do you suggest that I take? I'm back in college for my second bachelor's degree, so I have an idea of what college is like, but I'm not very smart. What's a good combination of the above courses?",1575584791,1,0

I need support from the UCF community,"I'm an sophomore and taking a cinema survey class and we clicked about Disney and Pixar movies in class. I've been talking to this girl since August and we soon exchanged numbers. She would always message first about her day and I would do the same. We would meet up just to study even though we did not have the same major. She's a pre-law and I am an anthropology major. I thought things were going smoothly. We are talking for the whole semester and I thought we clicked and connected so well, so this past weekend, I just decided to ask her out on a date to watch Frozen 2 because she really loves Frozen. 

Then I get ghosted. No response on Friday, or Saturday, or Sunday. Class ended on that Friday, so I didn't get to see her this week.

I just feel so low about myself like where did I go wrong. I sent her another message this morning, but still no reply. I just feel hurt. It sucks cause I got out a long term relationship two years ago, and I did not feel any connection with anyone else since then like I did with this girl.

I just want support from you guys or any pep talk or advice.",1575583325,1,0

Reply from the Property Manager of Tivoli regarding Internet/package lockers,"&gt;I meet with Summit on a monthly basis to discuss resident issues.  We are keeping a log here in the office and only can make them aware when I am aware there are outages on the property. We are under a contract with them in which we have for two more years.  I am working closely with my supervisors to note all issues to ensure Summit is meeting their obligations of the contract.   Unfortunately, I cannot account for outages that are beyond our property limits.  I forwarded Summit’s notice of planned maintenance as it was provided to me from Summit.  You are correct as it only stated “Video Services” and not internet.  I also voiced my concern with the company that the majority of my residents are students and they are in finals.  As of this morning, you have been the only person to report an outage with the internet.  This could be due to us just opening and residents haven’t made their way into the office yet.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our package lockers are a new system that we just incorporated this past August.  We purchased the amount of lockers that the company stated we needed for the size of the community and number of residents we have. We are closely monitoring the system to determine if in the future, we do need to purchase more.  The emails that we send out is to promote quick turnaround of package pickup to help make room for others to be delivered in a timely manner.  The leasing office staff has been accepting packages for overages and we put them in the lockers as soon as there is availability.  This is also the most busiest time of the year for package delivery. Unfortunately, the system does run off of the internet, so if there are any outages, the lockers cannot be loaded; you are only able to pick- up packages.  This is another reason why we are keeping track of the Summit outages.

The cute chick from McDonald’s,"The story goes like this (skip to the bottom if you don’t wanna hear my story):

There I was, a 19 year old kid walking into Mcdonald’s. Life was good. I was preparwd to devour a not-so-nutritional meal and absorb it i to my 19 year old human flesh. I was with my friends. For the sake of keeping their identities secret, their names were d*ckface McF*ckington, *sscheek Mcgee, and Female Companion. 

The time was 10pm flat. I say flat because the only thing that is sharp was my keen eye. So there I was, ordering my not-so-nutrtional chicken wraps and a Mcdonald’s Sprite (We all know it isn’t just regular sprite). I waited for my food and laughed with my indentured friends over something politically incorrect. I hear my name: Order ###. I shot up and walked over to the counter to see a fair skinned, redheaded, glasses wearing goddess hand me my food. I said my signature “thank you thank you.” She then looked at me from the shoes up saying “you are welcome.” and turned around sassy and stylish. I knew right then and there that I wanted to get to know the woman I dubbed as “The Mickey D’s E-Girl.” I didn’t know if she was flirting with or not until my two female friends, Female Companion and *sscheek mcgee started to go “OOOOOOOH.”

We spent minutes conversing over the matter. I knew that one day I would have to see the Mickey D’s E-girl again.

HOWEVER, SHE DOESN’T WORK THERE ANYMORE AND I NEED HELP FINDING HER FOR HER NUMBER!

"Fuck the UCFPD, they ruined me and I committed no crime.","I posted on reddit that I was depressed and felt like dying because I had no friends. I was desperate for some companionship, even if it was virtual. I really, sincerely, was desperate. What happened? Why the UCFPD came looking for me in class! Thankfully, I was late that day, so what did they do? Why they called me and demanded I present myself immediately. I asked if I could just meet them after class, thinking that A) talking to the police in view of the class wouldn't exactly do wonders for my social life, and B) I was rather nervous about why the fuck they were looking for me. They told me to go to the station as soon as I was free. I, again, being scared, went. They took my ID and locked me in an interrogation room. They had my reddit post. They demanded to know if I was depressed. I said yes. They asked if I felt bad often. I said yes. Then, the detective or whatever the bitch's rank was left the room. She came back with two officers and announced I would be Baker Acted. I am not from Florida (or even from America), and I had never heard the term before. They said ""we are gonna take you to somewhere that will help you"". Still not seeing what was happening, I said that I had class in two hours (which I did), and asked if I would make it. They said sure. I was taken to the University Behavioral Center, in handcuffs.

&amp;#x200B;

""But what's so wrong with that?"" I hear you ask. ""You said you were depressed!"". Well, to begin with I was already heavily medicated AND I had my own doctor AND my own therapist that I saw every week. And if you think the UBC is good for anyone, I invite you to commit yourself there. They drugged me by force. They did so many medical tests. They told me I'd be gone in under an hour until they locked me up and said ""Oh, doctor is gone, you will see him tomorrow."" and then they dropped the act and said ""Actually, by law we keep you here for 3 days."" Great time. They didn't even let me eat with the rest of the prisoners there for a day, and yes, I will call them prisoners because we weren't allowed to be free. What else? Oh they therapy of course. They told me UCF had been alerted of my being committed and that I would have to speak to them or I wouldn't graduate. Did I mention I asked for support online because I didn't want what I felt to be commonly known? When I started crying out of despair for the situation, they had security drag me away. Great place. I hope it burns down. After 2 days, the doctor finally ""arrived"", and, after talking to me for 5 min and hearing my situation, he let me go. Wow, its almost as if, if you aren't a lying piece of shit, you might be more efficient than doing something akin to a kidnapping!

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, fuck UCFPD. They started this hell. Fuck UBC. They continued the hell. This was a little over a year ago. To this day, I can't see a police officer without fearing for my safety, UCFPD or otherwise. To this day, I cannot see a therapist without being afraid to my very core, and feeling the same dread I felt while locked up. I am in constant fear that one day, they might decide to take me away again. And hey, it did something! Now I feel even more alone and unable to trust anyone! Thanks, UCFPD! Oh, and if anyone reading this IS from UCFPD, fuck you. Fuck you. I hope you live the worst life possible. FUCK YOU.",1569362676,3,0

Game Knight Research Fundraiser for International Medical Outreach,"Just wanted to let everyone know that International Medical Outreach is hosting a game night to fundraise for our research trip to Haiti! The games consist of a Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Tournament (link below), and a general game night with board and card games. The Smash tournament has first and second place prizes, while the other games have eight baskets which you earn tickets for and are raffled off a the end of the night. 

There is no required entrance fee, however any donation is appreciated as it goes directly to the research since we are a non-profit. The tournament has a paypal link if you want to pay beforehand, otherwise we accept cash and card at the venue. 

We are hosting in BA2 rooms 207 and 208 starting at 6:00 pm Friday (9/27). Feel free to bring anyone interested, and if you are participating in the Smash tournament, bring full setups (console, controllers, gamecube controller adaptor, dock, and TV/monitor) if possible.

550+ supporters and News Channel 2 team. This may do nothing but we are doing everything we can to get our Orgo 2 teacher back.,"Back again to say that word of this situation has spread and has made the Channel 2 team come to the chemistry department today. Thank you for those that made this happen. People have said we have nothing to gain from this because we are not yet orgo 2 experts but that itself is not fair and we have the right to voice our concerns and feelings. Kollbe is an intelligent, enthusiastic, passionate teacher that has no fear of admitting he doesn’t know something. UCF needs humble teachers like him. That part of him stuck with me because so many of us pretend we know what we are doing in class but are afraid to speak up and get left behind. Kollbe was able to connect with us and changed our lives by thinking of his class as an image of our passions and future ambitions. UCF removed him very quickly and deserves a thorough investigation. From this I learned more about other teachers in the chemistry department that would lift eyes, but nothing is done. We need more voices.

2. How difficult or time consuming would this minor be for someone with no programming background?

Question for a friend,"My friend doesn't use reddit so I'm asking on his behalf. I've already been admitted and I have no issues whatsoever.

So basically he decided a few days ago that he wanted to apply for summer term so he could start early with me and a few others. Unfortunately as he grinded to finish the application he forgot to change his term to summer since he was originally going to do fall. Now he's extremely pissed off and wants to see if he can change the term on the application before he gets accepted. It's on common app.

Is there any way to do this or does he have to get accepted and then do the reactivate thing?

I hate it here,"So I’m living in Libra with my roommate and if she’s not in classes, she’s on her bed tippity tapping away at her computer till about 2am. Other than that, she’s a wonderful person, very neat, respectful, and an inspirational scholar. I just need my space and sleep :( I brought it up early on and she offered to start going to the library which worked out for a bit but then she just kinda gave up on going. I usually end up leaving the room to cry in my car for hours. The thing is, she’s not technically doing anything wrong but it’s driving me insane to the point where I had an attempted suicide and was sent to the hospital for 3 days. I tried talking to my RA and a Coordinator after deciding to go through with the mediation thing so I can just get a new roommate that maybe I can be friends with or something but I’m worried housing is going to tell me to suck it up. I can’t afford to cancel the agreement and just move to an apartment (it’s $1000 at this point and turns to $1250 after December 12th) and one of my classes is only available on campus so I’m hesitant to just move back home (4 hours away) and be an online student. I feel trapped in Orlando with this girl who I just can’t stand and it’s honestly ruining the college experience I worked so hard for. 

If anyone has any advice or knowledge I’m absolutely down to take it whether it’s about communication with my roommate or asking for a new one.

• The local news station has been notified
• Currently in the process of hiring a PI
• The developers of UW offered $150 in compensation in response to a petition that made rounds about 2 months ago, presumed to actually be in response to the suit since the compensation was dispersed shortly after the GroupMe chats for most floors were notified
• UCF/Valencia and the developers of UW have otherwise not commented on the case
• A list of grievances is in the process of being created
• Representatives from floors 8 and 15 are confirmed for collecting specific grievances, possible reps from floors 7, 9, 11, 14
• No representatives as of yet from floors 6, 10, 12, 13

Route 6 shuttle,"This has got to be the shittiest route for no reason. It's got to be one of the shortest and easiest routes for the drivers. So why is it inconsistent as it is? The shuttles regularly stack up back to back, and take breaks or get gas at the same time. I'm pretty sure both shuttles on the route have had their trackers off for the last couple days. Late at night one of the drivers stops in the back of Tivoli for 10 minutes for a smoke, blocking the road. Whenever there's a crowd at the shuttle stop on campus, it's always for route 6. It's not always been this way. I've been riding route 6 for 4 years and this semester has been the worst. Fuck this route.

"Second Bachelor's Degree, First Time UCF --- Registration Time &amp; Excess Hours?","Hello Knights!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm entering this Spring semester for a second bachelor's in computer science, my first being in mechanical engineering. My first degree was in UF (Gainesville) and after a few years in industry, I decided to make a career switch to computer science.

A master's degree seems to require a 4-semester chain of courses to even apply, and I didn't much like the idea of CS boot camp, thus my choice to go for a second bachelor's (for now atleast).

&amp;#x200B;

I know 2nd bachelor's like me are rare, but I have two questions if anyone out there is like me:

&amp;#x200B;

1) How are 2nd bachelor's students treated in terms of class registration date &amp; time priority? Are we like ""normal"" undergraduate seniors, or are we like low-priority non-degree-seeking students?

&amp;#x200B;

2) Does anyone know if I will be treated with excess hours surcharges due to my large amount of credit hours from my 1st degree, or does a 2nd bachelor's have a ""clean slate"" in terms of credit hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks! Charge on!",1573492293,1,0

I guess I thought before coming here that I’d have a fresh start and be able to make friends with people who I vibe with, but now I feel like I’ve changed and don’t even know who I am anymore so I can’t be myself. most people I meet are nice at first but then doesn’t show any interest in being friends after that. I have a couple of friends I hang out with sometimes but no deep connections. and yes, I’ve tried going to some clubs, events, and talking to people in my classes.

Struggling with superior intellect,"Hello everyone. I have an issue and would like some advice. As the title suggests, I am extremely intelligent. I have struggled all my life with being significantly more intelligent than my peers. At first, you might assume that this is a blessing rather than a curse. However, some issues that my superior intellect have caused include the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1. It is difficult for me to work in groups. I often get stuck working with simpletons. Their inferior minds are to mine like a mouse is to a lion.
2. I cannot relate to most people because I'm significantly more intelligent and they don't understand me when I speak of quantum physics and why E=mc^(2) is wrong.
3. Everyone else wishes to get intoxicated and engage in coitus. Meanwhile, I'd rather watch Rick and Morty and read studies in the field of quantum physics.
4. I often feel the need to speak less intelligently to appeal to the less intelligent peers of mine. Otherwise, they don't understand me.

It's been damaging to my health and my doctor said it's would be most beneficial to move out. I don't think talking will fix the situation as I already attempted that. Will they force us to talk or can I just change rooms?",1577738844,1,0

"5000 classes, enrollment minimums","So I feel like I've seen multiple answers to this but it might be different for 5000 and 6000 level, you need a minimum of 5 or 8 people enrolled. I've been watching the enrollment for the class I am currently in and there are 3 different sections for the same class. There's 3 people enrolled in the section that has a room number, 2 people enrolled in the section that seems to be video only, and none in the 3rd section. 
 
So my questions are... does anyone know if there is a hard limit of 5 or 8 enrolled or up to the professor(like maybe one of their own PHD students needs the class)? 
 
should I be adding up the students enrolled in all the sections? 
 
when is the latest they would cancel or confirm the class?

Instate residency question,"So, I am moving back to Florida, and I will be looking to re-enroll at UCF. I was a previous student at UCF (currently a student at Ohio State), and I had to move up north for family reasons. I graduated with an AA from a Florida state college, and I was previously an established Florida resident for tuition purposes. 

From what I am reading on UCF's website, Florida Statute 1009.21 permits me to immediately reclaim instate residency upon my return.

Per UCF's website:

""In certain circumstances, Florida Statute 1009.21 permits certain students to be classified as Florida residency for tuition purposes. Verification through supporting documentation is required that a student meets by qualification or exception.

A student should only request residency classification using one of these categories if they do not qualify as either an independent or a dependent student.

...

•Persons previously enrolled at a Florida state postsecondary institution and classified as a Florida residents for tuition purposes at a Florida public institution of higher education, but who abandoned Florida domicile and has re-established Florida legal residence.""

Under this exemption, does anyone here know if I would be able to reclaim my instate residency?",1577219775,1,0

Unlabeled Male support group,"Hey, I know this is a sensitive topic; there's currently no proper phrasing for this concept.

There are masculine guys I know at UCF who don't have the desire for a girlfriend or wife, guys who actually don't have crushes on women.
And no, this doesn't always mean they are homosexual either.

Instead of wanting a wife, these guys have a natural desire to focus more on strengthening other men long term.

I wanted to create a safe space of intellectual discussion and emotional support, specifically for guys at our college who go through this, so they don't have to be alone.

Men like this often feel isolated cause they typically don't have a healthy outlet of other male friends to talk to who understand what they go through (since most men have only experienced strong feelings of longing &amp; care toward women)

sometimes I feel it's better to speak for yourself instead of having a label speak for you.

We want to let you guys know you are not alone.

You deserve better than a church that shuns instead of understands.

You deserve a healthier outlet than apps &amp; hookups that can leave you emotionally empty.

Both the secular world and modern church have over-sexualized this issue, with one side falsely claiming free sex will make them happy, and the other side often judgmentally shunning them without understanding.

What I’ve found out about Jobs4knights aka Vector Marketing,"So I’m sure many of you have seen the jobs4knights.com written on whiteboards across campus. The gist of it is that they tell you they have this great opportunity to work at $15/hr and have an opportunity for $140’000 in scholarships or something like that if you work for them. Needless to say it’s too good to be true. 

The first time I came into contact with jobs4knights was actually through the messaging portion of Webcourses (canvas) where a student from UCF messaged me about this great job opportunity. 

I filled out the application which is actually just a google form to get your personal information and then decided that was kinda sus maybe I should do some research. Turns out it’s for this company called Vector which has a shady list of not paying employees and doing other illegal things, just check out the wiki and you’ll see what I mean. 

I got a phone call from Vector and decided to pick it up to see what other information I could find about the job because they didn’t really give any info about it anywhere really. 

Initially everything sounded very professional like you would expect from a real job offer and they very quickly asked if I could come in for an interview. Again not describing what the job was. Also they said that they work with the UCF career center which I don’t think is true at all. 

So I pressed the person on the phone about the details of employment there, knowing full well that this company works in loopholes so they don’t have to pay their employees and sure enough the more questions I asked the worse it got. 

As an entry level employee, you do get paid $15 an hour, but you can only work so many hours based on how many “appointments” are made available to you. These appointments are for a set amount of time, for example one hour and the way it works is that you set up a meeting with a family member or friend and at the end of the hour they sign your appointment form so you can get your money.

First of all this means that you could speak to someone for more than an hour but only get paid for one hour because of the fixed length of the “appointment.”

Second of all, they determine how many appointments you can get and they will give you more only if you meet commission quotas. 

Third of all, you can imagine that they don’t want you to sit down and talk to the same person again and again without them buying anything, so it’s on you to find more people in order to get more appointments. 

On paper they pay their employees $15/hr and they don’t have a door to door employee selling stuff. In reality you don’t get paid for any of the time it takes to find a customer and at the end of the day there are only so many uncles and aunts you have. So a lot of the customers fall into the “friends” category and friends of friends and friends of friends of friends etc. 

When you get to talking to people you don’t know very well, it’s hard to get them to sign your appointment paper and a lot of people probably don’t want to buy the product so what might happen is you talk to someone for 20 mins but they say no and don’t sign your paper and you try this for 3 people and now you’ve worked an hour for free. 

They did say that they have done away with the deposit required for the product before you can sell it but I have a feeling there’s still some sort of training book you have to pay for. 

I ended my conversation with saying that I know that this company has made its money from robbing young high school and college students of their money and I want nothing to do with a company like that even at 15/hr plus commission and scholarships and the person on the phone simply said okay have a nice day and hung up. 

The employees are very obviously given commission for recruiting new employees because I must’ve gotten 100 phone calls before and after I had my conversation which shows that they really don’t care and just want to add a number to their spreadsheet. 



TL;DR

Don’t go anywhere near jobs4knights/vector marketing. They don’t pay you properly through a loophole and you have to make sales in order to get hours. You’ll end up working for free a lot. The people who actually make money get it from recruiting new employees.",1569558833,118,0

I Can’t Handle It Anymore,"School, going to class, studying, doing homework, trying to make friends, having a social life, working a job, trying to eat healthy, getting exercise, staying involved in clubs on campus. There’s too much going on in my life for me to be able to handle successfully, and it’s so overwhelming and insanely stressful. Don’t really know how much longer I can be like this before I lose my sanity, become crazy, and drop out of college completely. My quality of life has been absolute dog shit. I am a constant ball of stress, anxiety, and exhaustion (physically and mentally). I have a mental breakdown and/or an anxiety attack at least once a week. I cry myself to sleep almost every night. I feel like I’m fucking dying in every way possible, emotionally and physically. Can someone please give me some advice on how to survive college and better manage the enormous amount of stress I experience? 

TL;DR - Life is kicking my ass and stomping my balls into the ground; I don’t know how to succeed and cope/manage with the stress.",1569526396,1,0

Can anyone offer advice for what I should do to work out for my goals?,"Anyone know a lot of about fitness and can help me tailor a workout routine? We wouldn’t have to meet in person, just talk over DM. I just need some help with what workouts to do for my goals and how long to do them because I’ve kind of been free balling it at the gym lately. I don’t know what I’m doing lol.

I know how to use the equipment and machines, I’m just not sure which ones I should use and for how long. I’m trying to lose weight and tone up. I’ve found a routine for what I like to do, but I don’t know if it’s benefitting me or not. Help would be appreciated :)",1569515393,6,0
