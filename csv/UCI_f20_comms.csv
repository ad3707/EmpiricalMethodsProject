"1. If your UCI tuition is covered by financial aid(Cal Grant, Pell Grant etc.), you won't me eligible for it anymore as soon as you finish a degree. You can still apply for some merit-based scholarships, but those are not guaranteed. California resident tuition is not considered financial aid.

If they‚Äôre impacted or somehow messed up/hard to extract you‚Äôll probably have to go to an oral surgeon and get twilight sedation and it will cost significantly more, like at least $1500 depending on the number of teeth.

I just stated someone being in NY back home as an example. The two ways UCI is getting numbers is either someone uses school insurance to get a Covid test and tests positive (which is the only way they were finding out cases in the UCI community before mass testing) and now school mass testing adds onto numbers. When the pandemic hit lots of students went back home and some got sick. Those who used school insurance back home (which can be used nationwide) attributed to case counts. So students who were in other states and are in other states count towards our numbers. I‚Äôm just saying I wish they would separate the numbers by students who are on campus and those who aren‚Äôt.,1604116683,1,0

"Ok here‚Äôs some advice and it might seem strange, but it worked for me. If you are only doing school at home, it‚Äôs really hard to motivate yourself and thus easy tasks become hard because you are burnt out. Try finding something that will force you to discipline yourself and find a routine, then although you will have more to do, you will be more productive in the time you have and you will feel more motivated and rewarded. Try getting a part time job, working out and having fitness goals, or finding a hobby that is constructive over time. From my experience when you are forced to manage your time everything falls into place, and I found that I have even more free time, which feels even better cause there‚Äôs nothing sitting in my mind telling me I have to finish something. It‚Äôs tough to get into this routine at first and you will have to sacrifice some things, but from my experience it‚Äôs so beneficial. You‚Äôll go to bed every night knowing you had a productive day, and doing hard tasks seems easier the more you challenge yourself. I don‚Äôt know your situation, so maybe this advice is useless, and I‚Äôm only a first year anyway, but for me finding other tasks to accomplish every day other than school really helped my mental health and I feel like I‚Äôm living a more balanced life.

"It's funny because some of the students who are now getting caught attending house parties only to dish out excuses really don't get the point. COVID has been around for how long now? There is a ZERO percent chance for there to be college students in America during September to not have heard of COVID. They know about it. Heard about it. Talked about it. They must either have the mental capacity of a nematode or a tree stump to think partying would be a remotely good idea. Everyone gets the flu whether you like it or not. How exactly do they think COVID spreads? Other people's health is the least of these students' concerns. They're either worrying about making a good social impression on others, or worrying about racking in those days of being drunk, FAR before thinking that their stupid action might cause their grandmother to have a visitor-less hospital bed attached to countless tubes as her deathbed.

"If anyone knew UCI would‚Äôve made a statement about it, I think it‚Äôs a positive sign that UCI is mass testing on campus students. Why start testing students if they have no plans to resume in person instruction? At least for grad students this year and undergrads next year. Switching 1/4 years to online for undergrads isn‚Äôt as big of a deal as switching the entire program or half of a master‚Äôs program to online. Like UCI will be done testing 3,600 students midweek this coming week, all within the span of one week. There‚Äôs only 6,000 grad students, I think that‚Äôs very scaleable to do weekly starting winter quarter and then implement classes being in large lecture halls etc. 

Then next year I‚Äôd bet that a Covid vaccine would be required to resume in person classes for everyone and then they‚Äôd stop weekly testing and bring back undergrads. I noticed how for the first time ever everyone was required to get a flu vaccine this year so I don‚Äôt see this as being a far fetched idea.

CSUs and CCs have nowhere near the resources UCI has to do such a thing as weekly testing etc.

Regardless undergrads have the option to remain remote even if classes do return for them in person, but I don‚Äôt see it as such a big deal for undergrads to remain online as for master‚Äôs students who get half or even a quarter of the time at UCI.",1599954432,11,0

"Hi, you can visit the [catalogue](http://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/) and look at the different course requirements for each major by clicking ""majors, minors, and graduate programs"" -&gt;  Computer Science or Software Eng -&gt; Requirements.   


Basically in SE you you have to take more [informatics](http://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofinformatics/#courseinventory) classes and you don't have quite as many options to choose from in terms of electives. Personally, I really enjoy informatics classes, but other people don't. It's up to preference; same goes for having more rigid course requirements. SE also requires students to create a senior design project which spans two courses. Both majors have ""project"" courses, but the SE senior design project is notable because it's a core requirement.   


In CS you can pick from a few different ""tracks"" or specializations like visual computing, algorithms, or bioinformatics. You'd also have more room to pick from a lot of different electives in informatics, ICS, and CS. Or if you choose the general specialization, you can pick only from the CS upperdivs (which there are a bunch of).

"In my opinion. If you feel you want to take another quarter to prepare go for it. 33,45c are the tougher classes major requirements to weed out a lot of peeps. Lots of peeps going to ics major tend to drop and switch to a different department during these classes. U also learn that with a lot of coding languages, if u know coding logic(for loops, arrays, etc) then u can pick up the small syntax and grammar different rules of different languages and use them proficiently enough fast. For c++ it‚Äôs like python but everything needs to be set with more parameters, and it is less similar to using English.  So mainly just more syntax strict and such, but u will be learning new data structures and some algorithm logic, which may be rough if u are having trouble with 33. 33 and 45c were hard for me, and even though we are doing online classes so arguably more time, it can be hard to self motivate and do the classes without labs, physical interaction with ta.  My advice, either take it but be prepared to dedicate not only time, but get help from others(ta,professor, tutor, peers,coding websites) or just take a quarter to get better at the building blocks. But hey everyone experiences this stuff in their own ways, so it will be wat it will be for you.  And for passing ics 33, just gotta dedicate time and effort of course, but also try to remember work smart not necessarily hard , that‚Äôs the advice of a peroson who does like 3 hours of code only to realize the professor wanted B not A....or that doing it this simple way taught here or this function  is better than brute force multiple calculations.

"Just saying, data collection for submission to the federal government is not the same as classification for affirmative action. It's important to remember...

Affirmative action hasn't been practiced within the UC for admissions for 22 years. The UC doesn't really have a document lying around about what it will look like. 

But what we do know is that affirmative action in admissions cannot be automatic nor mechanical. That's been determined by the Supreme Court. It has to be done as a part of an individual and comprehensive review that evaluates merit and other factors. In this sense, many members of subgroups can benefit from affirmative action including many AAPIs and ""whites"" on this list. 

Like in a clear example, a Syrian refugee would likely not be seen as ""white"" in admissions processes.

"Hey OP,
You can still accept your subsidized loan! You simply go into your fin aid portal and go into your aid award, change the option for the subsidized loan from offered to accepted, and it should take a few days for it to process. If this is your first time accepting loans you‚Äôll have to go through a loan counseling seminar thing on the fafsa website, which is super easy, just a short guidance course of what accepting loans means for you etc. After completing the loan exit counseling your loans should process and be in your account within a few days. You‚Äôll probably receive an email a day or two before from ACH conforming the amount being deposited into your account. It is also important to note that what is on your fin aid award is divided into three, for each quarter. So if you have a 6000 loan, you would receive 2000 for fall/each quarter. It is also important to know that you cannot ‚Äúsave up‚Äù your loans, as in, you can‚Äôt rollover your fall loan to your winter loan and receive 4000 for winter and 2000 for spring. Once the period for that portion of your loan/aid is over, it‚Äôs gone. Good luck OP! If you have any more questions, feel free to PM and I can try my best to be of assistance! :)",1603055136,3,0

If nothing else, hopefully that eases up your anxiety about it a bit.

They aren't usually snide to students though; most of them are just more invested in their research, and them teaching a class is just something they do on the side because it's a condition for their research funding or something.

The structures curriculum is something like: statics and dynamics‚Äî&gt; solid mechanics ‚Äî&gt; light weight structures as the core classes. As electives I would recommend taking vibrations, the CAD class, smart structures and maybe a materials class like fracture mechanics.  The last two are niche electives being offered more frequently that I really enjoyed.

The Regent's scholarship includes priority registration, guaranteed housing for all the years you hold it, graduate-level library privileges, and a yearly award that varies. For award year 2018, my year, the award is 2.5k a year. The year after was double, 5k. :( To renew your scholarship another year, you have to take 12 graded units each quarter and maintain a 3.25 (B+ average) GPA by the end of the year. If you fall below 3.25 your first year, you can appeal it at the end of summer after they give you your notice of scholarship termination.

I don't know how many they award. As to stats, they can vary widely. My stats: 1580 SAT/35 ACT. I don't remember my GPA.

"&amp;#x200B;

|**TL; WR:** ~~Way too many~~ additional summer session details.|
|:-|


1. There is financial aid but I believe it's less than during the year if anything. Not sure about those specific grants.
2. The phrase ""summer sessions"" merely refers to the different time periods during which a class may be offered over the summer.
3. Most classes are only offered in one session per summer, so there's not much of a choice usually.

Classes happen over the span of a ""session,"" and you may enroll in any classes that don't have a direct time conflict. Exact dates for this coming summer may be found on this year's [quarterly academic calendar](https://www.reg.uci.edu/calendars/quarterly/2020-2021/quarterly20-21.html), but here's the gist of it:

* Classes slotted during **10-Week** summer session are 10 weeks of instruction followed by a week of finals just like a normal quarter, starting after the buffer week following finals for the preceding spring quarter.
* Classes slotted during **Summer Session I** are 5 weeks of accelerated instruction followed by a week of finals, starting at the same time as the 10-Week summer session.
* Classes slotted during **Summer Session II** are 5 weeks of accelerated instruction followed by a week of finals, starting on Week 7 of the 10-Week summer session, which is the week after the finals week for Summer Session I.

Whether it'd be best to go with classes during the 10-Week session, the shorter sessions, or a combination of those is dependent on things like financial situation, the workload of the classes, and how much of a ""summer vacation"" you want to save for yourself.

Because you're pretty much covering the same amount of material in half the time for classes slotted during Summer Session I and Summer Session II, lectures are typically 3 hours long, which is partly why most people enroll in only one or two classes for each of those sessions in addition to the unit cap restrictions:

* Max 10 units for Summer Session I classes and 10 units for Summer Session II classes
   * Units for 10-Week classes are divided between the two shorter summer sessions
* Max 20 units total for the whole summer

Therefore, if the [""pay for 8"" policy](https://summer.uci.edu/services/pay8.aspx) is in effect again like with past years, one way you can get the most out of your money is if you take two 4-unit courses during both Summer Session I and Summer Session II. That only brings you to 8 units per session. 2-unit courses during the shorter summer sessions are sparse, but you're able to take another 4-unit course during the 10-Week session, which gets divided into 2 units for Summer Session I and Summer Session II.

I will note that doing the above pretty much gives you a midterm every other week. From my experience, the worst of it was during finals week of Summer Session I since it coincided with midterms for the 10-Week session. However, it cooled off towards the end since the 10-Week session ends before Summer Session II, and I had one less final than I might've had if I'd somehow gone with two 2-unit courses instead.

Basically, the biggest difference between regular quarters and summer is that the timing's different, so you have to be on top of that. However, some professors choose to truncate some of the workload for the shorter sessions, which could make things easier. Just be wary that those who don't do so end up having to cram a ton of stuff into half the time.",1606231857,1,0

D103- all about cells. If you dont care about cells or how they function, dont take this class. You have to understand and know the pathways and how it affects the cells function. A lot of information is covered and you really need to spend time memorizing and understanding the concept.

D104- kinda away from cells, but you get to learn how organisms develop. You also have to put a lot of time into this class to understand the concept and memorize the terminology.

"Hi there,

I am a mechanical engineering major with a specialization in the Design of Mechanical Systems. To specialize in any of the four specializations, you just have to email a counselor and they can update your degreeworks. Here is a list of specializations to choose from: 

 [http://catalogue.uci.edu/thehenrysamuelischoolofengineering/departmentofmechanicalandaerospaceengineering/mechanicalengineering\_bs/#requirementstext](http://catalogue.uci.edu/thehenrysamuelischoolofengineering/departmentofmechanicalandaerospaceengineering/mechanicalengineering_bs/#requirementstext) 

I don't know your background or your year, but if you want to get into the automotive industry, I would first recommend that you prioritize experience in areas such as internships or FSAE (IC/EV/Baja) at UCI to learn more about cars. A specialization in the Design of Mechanical Systems, solid knowledge of introductory/applied thermodynamics (91/115) will help, and learning CATIA (3D CAD software) will help. 

  
In terms of the aerospace industry, it depends. For example, I worked for a fastener manufacturer this summer that supplied fasteners to the aerospace industry. You can say I ""worked"" for the aerospace industry in layman's terms, but in reality I worked in the manufacturing industry. To ""get in"" to the aerospace industry is a very broad question. It ultimately depends on what you want to do, propulsion systems, aerodynamics, controls (for spacecraft), etc. If you want to do propulsion, we have a specialization called  **Flow Physics and Propulsion Systems.** If you want to do aerospace engineering (in general), you can specialize in **Aerospace Engineering**. 

Ultimately, it's up to you and what you want to achieve over the next period of your life here at UCI. Let me know if you have any further questions or need any more advice.",1602050612,4,0

"I guess it really depends on the length of the letter you want and why you want it. Other people might have different experiences from mine but here‚Äôs mine. Keep in mind I went to several grad program event days and such so I was told if you want a good letter of rec you have to either get to know the professor or make an impression on them. Although you enjoyed the class did you participate and stand out? When you apply for grad school the professor submits the letter and you don‚Äôt get to see it. One of the professors during one of the grad school event‚Äôs told us about a student who took a course with a renowned faculty and then emailed him for a letter of rec. thinking this would ensure he‚Äôd get into the program. The professor honestly wrote that although the student took his course and received an A he didn‚Äôt know anything about the student and couldn‚Äôt recommend him, he said that the student had also not engaged in class. So of course the student didn‚Äôt get in. Therefore unless you get to submit the letter I would be wary. If you do get to be the one to submit however and this isn‚Äôt for grad school def email the professor, no harm no foul then.

On the other hand, I never went to office hours and I still got a letter of rec despite taking a class with the professor once.

"i am on the same track to change my major to Inf or Swe. Inf requires Ics 31-32, Ics 6b and/or Stats 7 in order to change/add the major, which means Ics 6B would be a good idea for the next quarter.

Almost all upper div classes will be available after at least 31-32 series which means you wouldn't be able to rlly take classes ahead (before changing your major), but if you're thinking in OIT specialization, you will be able to take some UD electives that are not Compsci related and require no pre-reqs.

(Or, if you don't mind going into Swe, they have pretty much the same reqs: Ics 31-32, Ics 6b and/or Math 2a-2b)

"That's partially true. Meaning tracking hours is difficult there could be people doing more work then 10 hours a week and some a lot less it's varried. For senators they are mandates at least 5 2 two hour meetings and one hour of office hours so a minimum of 5 hours. There is a lot more work that goes in the background. I do about 5  one hour meetings a week. Making my hours 10 and working outside of that like research working on letters presentations and such and just straight up planning for said meetings can't meet with deans and such without doing research and preparations. Essentially advocacy only works if you put the time to do research and such. This probably puts me at about 16 hours a week. But like I said, it varies. This past week I put in about 22  hours and next week, since it's week ten and I have finals, I will probably only put in about 10. The main point it's hard to make arguments for higher or lower stipends; it's just a matter of perspective. There is a lot of mental and emotional drain that can also be factored in.

Really what it comes down to. Is that elections doesn't do anything until an election actually  happens. They mostly do trainings through out the year and then actually work when an election starts.  They do a lot of work for those weeks though. Elections last 3 weeks 2 weeks to make graphics promoting elections. We do need someone on standby though in case a special election is needed. As the special election that was triggered to recall the corrupt justice. The election commissioner  by the way is currently the last place were recalled senator's and fund the clubs are still located in asuci.

We also had diagnosis activities which were interactive scenarios where we diagnose fictional patients based on the symptoms and scenarios presented. Then we would write a short reflection.

"This is a tough question, not gonna lie. I have taken both of these professors and they are both really good in many aspects but each has their cons as well. Youssefpour lectures really really well, even prepping his own lectures notes that he posts for students (he did that when I took him and I hope he still does) but he does make his exams tricky and really requires understanding the concepts so you might need to put in extra study time. Dellaca is also a great lecturer, he does not necessarily have pre-made notes or anything, but he is still easy to follow. He makes it very clear what you need to know for exams and if you have any concerns, just go to his office hours. He is super approachable and wants students to succeed - I literally did not take the first midterm in his class and still pulled off an A in the class. In simplest terms - the biggest difference between them is resources and exams as both have helpful lectures. Do you want a ton of resources on Canvas but exams that will push you (helping you learn) or less resources but exams are a bit more straightforward. As for the final exam, this does not apply since Math 2A and 2B have a common final meaning the math department creates it for every single class, the professors teaching get no say on whats on it.

"That is incorrect. Here are the criteria, straight from the federal aid site:

**https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency#dependent-or-independent.**

This page spells out exactly which categories may qualify for independent status but here is the concept in a nutshell: 

‚ÄúThe federal student aid programs are based on the concept that it is primarily your and your family‚Äôs responsibility to pay for your education. A dependent student is assumed to have the support of parents, so the parents‚Äô information has to be assessed along with the student‚Äôs, in order to get a full picture of the family‚Äôs financial strength. If you‚Äôre a dependent student, it doesn‚Äôt mean your parents are required to pay anything toward your education; this is just a way of looking at everyone in a consistent manner.‚Äù

Again, not speaking to your overall situation, just pointing out there are few opportunies for students under 24 to be identified as independent. This is frustrating for many students whose parents don‚Äôt help with school costs but it is the rule. When a family is low income, their kids will qualify for more/more grant aid; as incomes increase, so does a family‚Äôs costs.*

Sociology is a very ""common sense"" kind of class, so if you have a strong foundation for logic and a good understanding of people already, you'll be fine even if there are essays.

"Don't worry about it too much kid. Last fall was my first quarter at uci (freshman) and I ended it with a 1.1 gpa after failing two classes and lucking out with a C- in another. I promise you'll work things out after getting more into the groove of classes and maybe thinking about what you want out of college. An academic advisor will most likely email you so you can talk to them about how to move forward. When I was put on academic probation I had to meet with a counselor to talk about what happened and how to fix things. Counselors are doing video calls right now, so you might need to do that. The good thing is you can re-take your classes and the grades you get in your first four re-takes completely replace your previous F's. You and your gpa will be fine as long as you try to turn things around. Ik things are shitty now being online and all, but joining clubs or getting to know peers in classes can be great to make friends as well as get advice or find study/rant buddies.

"Hi, I took CS 21A at Foothill two summers ago, which counted for ICS 32. I had taken ICS 31 the quarter before. In terms of content, the Foothill course wasn't that great, and felt like a slightly harder ICS 31. The only new material I learned was classes. Foothill doesn't have an ICS 33 equivalent course. The quarter after, I took ICS 33, and the first two weeks was definitely a challenge. I had to play a lot of catch up to get to the level I was expected to be at if I had taken ICS 32.
