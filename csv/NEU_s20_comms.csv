"As mentioned, pair programming is relatively rare in industry, but the skills it teaches are certainly ubiquitous when it comes to communicating about code.

&gt;  
&gt;Additionally, I then am not contributing to designing the code in any capacity and I'm not really learning the concepts that the homework was supposed to teach us.

This is a case of bad pair programming the concept of the code should be shared/agreed upon by both people. It's good you're identifying that you can improve your communication skills, so use this as an opportunity to practice, not to hide behind being the ""typer"". As mentioned, ask lots of questions. In a way that may also help your communication and help give you vocabulary and practice to be able to get your ideas through to others. A great question can often be ""why are you doing X?

"I was suspended a semester for weed 2 years ago. Wild story. My friend smoked one night and started seizing, I called 911 and got him to the hospital. That was one of the scariest moments of my life (the next morning he was totally fine, he just had a horrible reaction). An NUPD officer came to talk to me about the weed the next day cuz he thought it was laced. I, making the wrong move, said I didn‚Äôt have any more so he could take it and test it. He said ok and left. 

Turns out NUPD started tracking my every move, and 2 weeks later when I went to cop from one of my boys, they stopped me when I got back on campus at the Veterans memorial near ruggles and caught me with an ounce. 

I had an OSCCR trial, 1 vs 6, and was charged with possession, endangering behavior, and distribution because ‚Äúit was an ounce‚Äù. Basically I got double fucked for both the hospital and deal incidents, since the cop didn‚Äôt want me to have medical amnesty for doing the right thing. It was bad, I was crying during my trial, thought my life was over, and my friend was going to court for dealing (he was suspended for a year, nothing else to that thank god). I ended up getting suspended 1 DAY before the fall semester started. 

If I got suspended all because of an unlucky reaction when my friend smoked, ur gonna have a tough time not being suspended at least a semester. What I will tell you, is if you admit your wrongdoings to try and get an easier punishment, they don‚Äôt care and will absolutely fuck you for anything you admit to being guilty of. Thank you for coming to my TedTalk and don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm totally fine, all is good!",1582216149,1,0
"Not actual AA. Just some form of alcohol/addiction training. The way the board decides how to sanction you (aka charge you) is based on the new offense PLUS the amount of previous offenses. The way it works is they do NOT know about your previous offenses ahead of time. They only find out about them AFTER they've decided you're ""guilty"". When they hear about them, they will want to give a heavier punishment to try and drill into you the lesson here. So if the board feels a semester of suspension and addiction training might be the way, they will go with that. Maybe they'll just decide community service and training. Or maybe you'll have to write a letter to the building manager for making a hole in the wall. But because it's not a first time offense they will not make it just a slap on the wrist.

I'm honestly not sure what you can say to help your case. Just do not be disrespectful or arrogant. If it's super obvious you did it, you could not contest it and they might be more lenient. If they see you're learning, then they will go lighter on you.",1582215289,1,0

"Capstone 1 is only offered in the summer. You can only take capstone on one of these sequences:

* Summer 1 [Year X] Capstone 1 + Spring [Year X + 1] Capstone 2
* Summer 2 [Year X] Capstone 1 + Fall [Year X] Capstone 2

Here is the email I got from my academic advisor when I asked about this:

For all remote Capstone 1 requests, the Electrical and Computer Engineering department has asked that students please reach out to Professor Bahram Shafai (shafai@ece.neu.edu) for approval to take Capstone 1 remotely.  Please be sure to include why you will not be available to take Capstone 1 on campus.  If Professor Shafai approves your request to take Capstone 1 remotely, please then submit your request through the form below and attach Professor Shafai‚Äôs approval e-mail:

[link removed because it's no longer active]

Please also be sure to review the remote Capstone 1 policies:

It is expected that students are on campus for the capstone courses. However, there may be exceptions granted for students requesting to take Capstone 1 remotely during the summer term.  If you would like the department to review your request, you will need to do the following:

    If approved, the student will be responsible to find a capstone team and have full agreement from the team that this arrangement is acceptable.
    The student should identify his/her responsibilities for the capstone team.
    The student should arrange to be available via skype during the weekly meeting with the capstone advisor.
    The student must attend the final presentation.
    The capstone design team should submit a letter to the capstone advisor stating that the remote student properly completed his/her task.

Please allow 1-2 weeks for the department to review your request and to make a final decision.  You will be notified once a final decision has been made.  Should you be approved to take Capstone 1 remotely, please be sure to touch base with Professor Shafai closer to the start of the first Capstone 1 class meeting time.  Should you have any questions or concerns with the department‚Äôs final decision regarding your request to take Capstone 1 remotely, please reach out to Professor Emad Aboelela (e.aboelela@northeastern.edu).",1581107109,2,0

"I spent a lot of time last year (my freshman year including summer I) feeling like our curriculum was unfair, designed for us to fail, no one wanted me to succeed, etc. And I think it definitely could use a lot of work, because at the end of the day students shouldn't have to be miserable while learning.

That being said, I think the most important thing I've learned here is a comfort with ambiguity, i.e. figuring out on my own what to do when I have no idea what's being asked of me or it feels like the work is too insane. Learning how to slowly chip away at a problem, sleeping on it if necessary, and learning how to ask the right person for the right kind of help, has been by far the most useful skill I've picked up as a result of being here, and I wouldn't have this skill if it weren't for the relative difficulty/vagueness/intensity of our assignments.

I also have a 3.0 GPA and lots of C's on my transcript, and if I really cared about my grades or needed a higher GPA for my scholarship or whatever, I would not be so at peace with what I've learned at the cost of how difficult it was to learn it. But since I landed an amazing front-end co-op position with that GPA, I really don't mind it.

I guess my overall point is just, keep at it. Put your whole heart into it, cause at the end of the day the amount you learn from these courses is up to you. You shouldn't get through this to impress your professors or your friends or have a perfect college experience, you should get through it because later on when you continue to face challenges in your field, you'll remember how you faced down what you're going through now, and you'll have the confidence to keep going.

I really resent our CS program sometimes. Programs like this are much better suited for those people with innate confidence in their own ability &amp; their right to exist in this space, which can marginalize or cause impostor syndrome for people who are not as certain they belong (oftentimes women and racial minorities, but also just programming beginners or those with less experience in the field). I wish I felt like my professors truly wanted me to succeed. I wish I didn't get a Systems assignment on Thanksgiving last semester. I hope things change for the better at some point soon. But as much as the program can be unpleasant, I was a lot happier once I resigned myself to busting my ass, getting as much help as I possibly could, and just trying to get as much out of it as possible. And now, a couple years in, despite the difficulty, I feel like I'm gonna be pretty damn good at this if I keep it up.

So just keep going. I promise that if you make it through, you'll be really glad you did!",1581101552,1,0

I ended up going on for my MA in classics elsewhere but graduated from Northeastern with my BA a few years ago.

"redacted some of it bc it was situation-specific, you may want to revise heavily if you're facing personal difficulties:

Dear Provost Bean and members of the Northeastern University administration,

I am writing to express my concern about the University's pass/fail policy for this semester. While I believe allowing students to elect pass/fail grading for some of their classes is a wise decision, I remain concerned about the timing of the deadline to do so.

\[description my sense of personal privilege around having good internet/a stable home/no major household/childcare/family responsibilities\]

But this privilege does not extend to many of my classmates. Many do not live in areas with a good Internet connection - \[example of impact to a friend caused by bad Internet\]. Many are facing financial insecurity due to lost jobs - whether their own or those of their parents. \[example of a friend living in a tough situation\]

It is impossible for any of us to say what the next two weeks will bring, and for those over whom the threat of food or housing insecurity looms, it is impossible to guarantee that they will have time to adequately prepare for their finals and a quiet, Internet-connected place in which to take them. The University's early pass/fail deadline forces these students to make important decisions on the basis of inadequate information. It is not fair to those students living with uncertain circumstances to ask for a decision without giving them the opportunity to make that decision based on complete and reliable information.

With these considerations in mind, I am writing to respectfully ask you to consider moving the University's pass/fail petition deadline for the Spring 2020 semester to no earlier than April 28th, 2020 (or the day on which Spring 2020 grades become available on myNortheastern, whichever is later).

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,\[rayleighplesset\]",1586548137,5,0

"If Banner is telling you that you need a Department Signature, then the department has turned on signature approval for the section. 

Usually this is used for special cases (e.g., a research or thesis course where you need the instructor to approve before you can take the course; or the 0-credit course you get registered for when you're on co-op that requires your co-op coordinator to put you in the course).

I've also seen the signature thing used when a section was being cancelled to prevent more students from signing up while they move the students to other sections.

The course description should tell you who to contact for registration assistance.

"I don't know a ton about environmental engineering, but from having visited GT it seems not the most different from Northeastern, though I think a little more difficult to get into if you're out of state. Some definite differences though are:

1. Boston vs Atlanta. Weather is an obvious difference, but just in general the cities have different vibes. I've only been to Atlanta twice, but in my experience it was a very car-centric city and was not as noticibly filled with colleges / college students as Boston. Boston is very easily traversable with public transit, and colleges are a huge part of Boston in terms of the demographic makeup being heavily students. There are also a ton of companies located in the area to be close to Harvard/MIT/BU/Northeastern/etc., which makes finding co-ops locally a lot easier. (I don't really know Atlanta's business makeup, I'm sure there are plenty of job opportunities as well). 
2. Tech school vs Non exclusively tech school: Northeastern definitely has a strong focus on CS and Engineering, but we also have lots of business majors, humanities majors, art majors, etc. You'll likely find more diversity in terms of what people are studying at northeastern than you would at GT, which might be a nice thing!  
3. State school vs Private: I think like 60% of GT's population has to come from Georgia? That's a lot. Northeastern will definitely give you more regional diversity in terms of where people are from, which is also kind of a cool thing 
4. Co-op? I think GT has a co-op program? But honestly I don't know much about it. All I can say is northeastern's co-op program is a definite plus for the school",1586534151,1,0

"lol don‚Äôt listen to these people saying UIUC has a lower prestige in CS than Northeastern. It‚Äôs very highly ranked, as it should be. I‚Äôm from Illinois and have quite a few friends in the program (yes, that probably does make me a bit biased lol). It‚Äôs very rigorous, but they all really enjoyed it and have had great success finding summer internships. I know there‚Äôs also quite a few opportunities to get scholarships as you progress as a student there, which northeastern definitely lacks in. 

Co-op is definitely a huge benefit at Northeastern in terms of both job experience and cost of attendance and our CS program is great at preparing students for their careers. It‚Äôs also important to note that you can get co-ops all across the country/world at northeastern and Boston is more of a global hub, especially in comparison to Urbana-Champaign. 

Basically, I‚Äôm just saying that both are incredible schools! Be very proud of yourself for what you‚Äôve accomplished.

"I did my first co-op abroad! I worked in a pretty popular university city (Melbourne) so having similar-aged people around was really nice. My roommates were also similar in age. I worked for a university as well and became really close with my coworkers (most of them were just slightly older than myself, and we all had studied similar fields and of course were doing similar work). 

Loneliness can definitely be real sometimes, but I would text/call/video chat my friends and family often. Like I mentioned, I also became close with my coworkers and we would go out together a couple times a month. 

If you‚Äôre really worried about needing lots of social interaction, there are always adult social clubs/classes to take. I liked going to open lectures at some of the universities and would meet some other undergrad students. Also link up with study abroad people from NU if you‚Äôd like! Overall I‚Äôd say go for it! it‚Äôs a great experience and a way to escape Boston for a bit.

Edit to address your last couple questions that I forgot: the org used to be called co-op connections but now is part of off-campus housing or something. They can contact people currently working in your co-op city to ask questions. They‚Äôd probably also be able to help you find other students going at the same time you are. Definitely ask you co-op adviser. The transition wasn‚Äôt the worst, it was mainly the jet-lag that got me.

"1. you can coop basically anywhere and there are no limitations AFAIK as to where you can live! the greatest number of coops are probably in the greater boston area but NYC will def have plenty... and if not you can create your own! the only thing to consider is whether you‚Äôd be okay with commuting from LI to NYC back and forth, esp after a full day of work.

3. freshmen are required to live on campus and sophomores generally are as well (i believe you can petition to be placed off campus). meal plan is required if you live in a room/apartment without a kitchen. TRY TO SWITCH FROM 17 MEALS/WEEK TO 12. I was on the 12-meal one and still had on average 3 meal swipes left at the end of the week. usually off campus housing is for middlers/juniors/seniors and the nice ones (ex: lightview) near campus are quite expensive but the further you get away from campus the more affordable it should be (a lot of students live on mission hill: more affordable but still accessible by T/bus/bike/walking.

6. TAing is definitely a lot of work, but RAing may be easier? i personally am not either but my friend is a ta and she always seems to be drowning in work but my first RA didn‚Äôt do too much and we were fine! idk figure out what works best for your schedule but some reqs for ras include (and someone correct me if i‚Äôm wrong) proctoring (but you can do work/relax if you‚Äôre not signing someone in), being on call for half the week (?) i think and a recurring meeting either monthly or weekly ? but i do know that you get paid extra for being there during winter break as well!

8. ap and transfer credits do work at neu! the way advisors tell you to do coops is you have to be enrolled in classes for at least full semester (no summer semesters) after you finish your last coop before you can graduate (that‚Äôs how it is in COS, idk about others) so if you‚Äôre spring cycle w/ 2 coops, u can graduate as early as 3.5 years withur summers free. i‚Äôm currently on the spring cycle w/ 2 coops but i‚Äôm also fitting in two minors with no summer classes bc of the ap credit that neu accepted (they take 4/5)",1587619294,1,0

I face timed my friends all the time, and you would be surprised about how many people reached out to stay in touch. Staying busy and traveling definitely helped relieve that feeling.

Every co-op is different, but mine had other NEU student in the same position which was nice. And even if there's not, there's likely going to be other young people in your office. I also know that co-ops in bigger cities will meet up even if they aren't at your company.

This fall semester, you will likely be taking gen bio unless you got AP/IB credit in which case you will take bio inquiries, gen chem unless you got AP/IB credit in which case you will take orgo; calc I or II unless you got credit and then as a premed they recommend Calc III, and lastly an elective that is really up to you!",1587612258,1,0
"1. Definitely allowed-especially if you feel like this commute is feasible for you and you are comfortable with this option
2. Don't know sorry!
3. You can live off-campus as soon as your third year and you can absolutely save some a fair amount of money this way if you carefully choose your housing! Get off the meal plan after your first year and you will save at least a $1000 and moving off-campus will prob save you another 2-3 grand more depending. Northeastern off-campus housing isn't specific housing-it's a department that helps students who live off-campus and who you can go to with questions about living off-campus
4. Don't know about this either!
5. There are A LOT of ambulance companies in the area that would be willing to hire part-time students; just keep in mind that being an EMT is exhausting and taking on even 2 12 hour shifts weekly on top of a semester of classes may be difficult. I recommend Armstrong and Cathaldo as two good ambulance companies in the area to work with! Keep in mind you will also have to pay to get an MA license!
6. Becoming a TA depends on your major: CS needs a lot of TAs and they make I believe $15 an hour and are usually working at least 6 hours a week; I think becoming an RA is definitely worth it if you want to save on money as you get free housing and free meal plan. If you did this, you could stay in Boston during co-op as you wouldn't even be paying to live in Boston. It is a job, but you do bond with the other RAs so that doing rounds and such is a lot more fun! I'm not an RA myself but I have several friends who are!
7. It's worth a shot! You can appeal every year, but I wouldn't expect much from it unless your financial situation drastically changes
8. It absolutely is but depends on your major and requires you to make a detailed plan and you won't have much flexibility and may not be able to do a minor. Nevertheless, I have a friend who is graduating with only 6 academic semesters this way, and another with only 7 academic semesters so it is definitely doable!
9. Don't know much about this either

If money is a real concern, definitely do keep in mind that you will be making a significant amount of money on co-op; especially if you are in STEM or business-each co-op could pay up to a semester of tuition. In addition, there are other scholarships you can apply to once you matriculate and a fair amount of my friends and I get paid to do research which is another job you could have! A lot of students do work part-time in some capacity so if you are looking for a part-time job on or around campus, there are options!",1587611515,1,0
"I withdrew late enough in the semester that I did not have to pay the government back for loans I took out. I essentially wasted $10k in loans, it's DEFINITELY not taking a class for free. It was that or I tanked in two classes, as I had to spend all of my time when i wasn't at work on a class that I struggled with, and had no time for the class I was doing well in. Grad students only take two classes a semester max.

This is definitely not something I recommend others do, unless they have personal stuff come up like I did. If you do that you're essentially paying for a wasted semester (not necessarily wasted, I learned a lot of material but I need to retake the courses). If I had been forced to withdraw say, right after the add/drop period, I would have potentially owed up to $10k to the government immediately.",1587611400,2,0

"1.You can co-op anywhere you want; there are a lot of students who do co-ops close to their homes. The NuCareers portal definitely has more jobs in the Greater Boston area, but there are some around NYC. Just know that you might have to find your co-op independently if you're going outside the Boston area.

3.Students generally have to live on-campus for the first two years, and then they can move off-campus. The meal plan is only required for the first year, though. Most students have a kitchen starting their second year. Off-campus housing in Mission Hill is cheaper than on-campus, but you usually have to sign a 1-year lease. I would say not to worry too much about finding off-campus housing until you've actually lived in the area for a while.

7.Financial aid isn't based on your major, unless you received a specific scholarship that is tied to a college or major. AFAIK, need-based financial aid increases proportionately with any increase in tuition. There are students who appeal every year, mostly due to a significant change in their family's finances.

8.Northeastern takes AP credits if you got a 4 or 5, there's a page on their website that shows the conversions. If the class is outside your major, you can get elective credit. Elective credit doesn't help you that much, but it adds to your total credits so you can register for classes earlier.",1587610673,1,0

"hi! i‚Äôm trying to significantly decrease my cost of attendance during the 4 yrs i‚Äôd b at neu; these r the ways i‚Äôve come up w and my thoughts ab each. please offer any additional suggestions :))

4. copy editor: idk i saw at another school‚Äôs newspaper this was a paid position and i was an editor for my school paper and journalism major so i figured i‚Äôd give it a shot... can anyone verify if there r paid positions at the hunt news lol
5. emt: i was on track to certify in june before corona, now idk if it‚Äôs possible but are there any paid emt or firefighter opportunities in boston? ik nuems is unpaid (still seems like an awesome opportunity tho from what i‚Äôve seen)
6. ta or ra: not really my first choice bc idk if it‚Äôs worth it for the $ and stress... how much do these positions get paid?
7. appealing financial aid: i received a $24k/yr grant and am appealing it bc of a change in circumstances. is there any chance that requesting a major change will have an effect on the financial aid office‚Äôs decision (also corona, idk if this will make them more or less likely to give me more $)? also, by how much is this amt expected to decrease by per yr, and do ppl have success appealing each yr even after they‚Äôre enrolled? ik it‚Äôs common to appeal before committing, but i wasn‚Äôt sure if it was possible to do it on a yearly basis
8. using ap credits to graduate early: is this even feasible w how co-ops r scheduled, and do the ap credits have to b in the same field as my major
9. rotc w liberty battalion: this is really a last resort. i‚Äôm considering applying for a 3-yr scholarship in the fall but i‚Äôm unsure if a years-long commitment to the military is worse than years of student loans and idk if my parents will let me bc of the potential negative impact on my career

I've went to a small high school of 50 kids per grade and a few years at a 500 per grade. NU.IN classes give you that small time feel as you see most of the same kids in all your classes. When you are on campus you aren't going to know everyone, but it doesn't feel that big. If you are a business major you will end up seeing a lot of kids from NU.IN in your first semester on campus classes and it should be a pretty smooth transition.

When it comes to being unsure about business, NU.IN will get some general NU Path core classes. There are about 8 general electives open depending on any APs you bring. If you are going to move out and don't want to pay more for extra classes, you have some room to play with but you'd probably have to decide pretty quick.

I was in the fourth floor so I‚Äôll speak about how that was laid out. There was 3 total bathrooms for the entire floor. One was a large bathroom (about 6 showers, 6 stalls, and 8 sinks), one smaller bathroom (like 3 showers, a few stalls and sinks) and then one handicapped bathroom (had two showers, one was big one with a seat for handicapped people). You can use any bathroom you want, they‚Äôre isn‚Äôt like a set bathroom for certain rooms. I never had an issue getting a shower when I needed one, even when the cleaning ladies were there in the mornings. The bathrooms are just kinda your classic dorm communal bathroom, nothing special. 

As far as the lounges go: there‚Äôs study rooms on the first and third floors and then lounges with TVs on the second and fourth floors. It‚Äôs just like a room in the middle of the floor and there‚Äôs a couch and a couple chairs and a pretty big tv.

"They did all take out only prepackaged food from the dining halls in April, it wasn't great food (it was pretty bad) but it worked and they had a very effective system for it so I'm sure they could easily bring that back if necessary. 

Red eye shuttles add nothing really, a green line single train standard capacity is 110 people, they run in doubles so 220 people. If you social distance that you're maybe at 40-50 people per vehicle, or 100 or so per two car train. A red eye shuttles traditionally seats 12 including the driver, social distance that and you're at maybe 6 including the driver. Even running every 10 minutes that's not even a dent in the massive numbers of people the green line is moving. Not to mention that drivers on GL vehicles can stay safer by remaining isolated from passengers in a way you simply can't in a van. What we should look for moving people is making sure classes start and end outside of peak commuting hours so students can commute off peak, and push the state to run more off peak service to match.

- Have Office 365 forward your emails to a _good_ email service (I like Fastmail)
- Use said good email service for IMAP
- Write an SMTP proxy that authenticates with Office 365 via OAuth, and rewrites any incoming SMTP connections' authentication commands with the correct OAuth commands before forwarding them to Outlook.com (I may or may not be working on one right now)

"The thing is that it might not just be a financial matter. There is a decent probability that COVID simmers down over the summer and makes a huge resurgence in the fall. I work as a data analyst at a healthcare startup in Boston so the local colleges are definitely on our radar.

I agree and that's the scary part. We have a lot of older professors that have a chance of dying if we reopen the school in the fall.

On top of this, the idea that everyone is going to be back to overfilling the green and orange line everyday leads to a second wave being a possibility. Since students are more likely to show no symptoms, Covid-19 can easily spread throughout the student community. Then professors start getting sick and bam... Worse place than we started.

The petition is asking that they let students who have already left the premises and cannot come back out of the lease, not let everyone out of the lease.

3. via CS college website:

&gt;Placement rate: 98%  
&gt;  
&gt;67% of undergrads offered at least one full time job from a previous co-op

4. Either do the cybersecurity degree or just take more cybersecurity electives in the plain CS degree, the actual designation won't mean anything postgrad really. If you have the skills and/or take the classes, that's all that matters.

5. The CS workload is more than other majors but not insane. Usually the first 3 semesters people find to be more packed and then it gets easier, but those first 3 semesters build a huge base and basically make you ready to work from there. Plenty of time outside to have fun, you'll just need to be good at time management and avoid procrastinating assignments.

6. You don't pick your dorm (they're all pretty similar), you pick your LLC (basically interest groups, both academic and not) and it's put in a dorm based on size constraints. Usually people either pick one for their major to be fully immersed in their field or pick something entirely outside of it to get different social options. I personally recommend the latter but it's up to you.

7. The 12 meals a week plan is plenty, the food is fine but there's way too much good food in Boston.

You may very be the type of person that hits the ground running in that scene, I know a few people who come from ostensibly similar backgrounds to you who have. That just wasn't me.

A lot of summer internships are only 10/12 weeks, and by the time you get through learning everything you need to be able to work, you might well not be able get much done. The goal for the company is more or less just to line you up to want to come back for a job after you graduate. That's also the general goal of co-ops from a company's perspective, but since it's a much longer 6 month period there's a lot more you can learn how to do and a lot more practical work you can do for the company. This means you're less likely to doing trivial ""intern work,"" and more likely to be treated like a regular employee and doing really meaningful work. It's also more time for you to get an idea of what you like about certain jobs, certain types of companies, certain industries, etc., while experiencing the company for half the year, rather than just over the summer in potentially a very currated internship program. It's also helpful cause that's 6 months you don't have to be paying tuition, and you can make some decent money. 
And yes NEU helps a lot with finding co-ops. They have a database that companies that have an established relationship with the school list positions on, and unless you're looking at a specific location outside of LA/SF/Boston/NYC you can generally find something just searching there. It's super easy to apply via northeastern's system. Co-op advisors are also generally pretty helpful in refining your resume, giving advice. Ultimately it is up to you to interview and convince a company to hire you! It will not be given to you. But co-op placement in CS has been like 99% in past semesters, so if you're putting in a good effort you'll most likely get one. This semester is kinda fucked for people searching and having a hard time finding companies that are currently willing to hire, but that's tbd on how it will play out and a problem that's far greater than northeastern",1585460387,1,0

"My Lightview room is also sitting empty right now so I‚Äôm in the same boat. And as it looks more and more likely that I won‚Äôt have my full time job that I planned on this summer the rent is going to be a financial hardship for me. 

But I don‚Äôt see why they should let us out of our leases. They‚Äôre still providing us a place to live and we didn‚Äôt have to leave. And they use this business model around the country, so if they did it for us they‚Äôd have to do it for everyone and suddenly they‚Äôd have no income.  I agree that it totally sucks and I really wish I just lived on campus again but we signed up to pay for a year. Only way it‚Äôd work is if northeastern essentially bought us out but highly doubt that would happen.",1585457052,1,0

"Northeastern has a portal nucareers where co-op employers post their openings, and you just send in your resume. Sort of like a common app for co-ops. Some jobs have an outside website or cover letter but mostly not. You can also get a co-op on your own but that's more effort and there are tons of options for cs through nucareers. 

There are also career fairs where you can talk to recruiters in person and hand your resume to them. 

On the job I do a lot of python. Writing scripts, functions in existing scripts, or debugging existing code. I do bioinformatics so theres a lot of specific bio software and knowledge which I knew literally none of going in but that's ok. Employers wanna see you're motivated and passionate and able to learn. 

I have a variety of reviews from friends about their co-ops. Some dont get much meaningful work to do, which is unfortunate, but we are first co-ops and they ideally get more advanced as you go on.",1585446097,1,0

I couldn't tell you about actually getting involved in the music scene since my musical talent is laughable, but I'm sure you won't have any trouble. Plenty of music nerds at Northeastern itself and there are a ton of other colleges (including Berklee) right next door as well.",1585445271,1,0

"Can't comment much on NEU in relation to UCSB as I don't know anything about the latter really, but I am a CS major here and have had a very positive experience! 
In terms of your internship question, since the co-op program is huge here internships are only really common for some people the summer after freshman year, in which case most people do them at home anyway rather than in Boston. And then with the co-op program, that's not really a thing at MIT or Harvard, so don't have to worry much about being overshadowed or anything like that. I would say Northeastern is the most well respected school that does a lot of co-ops in the New England area. 
Also in terms of winter, it hasn't been too severe the past couple years (this year we pretty much got no snow and only had a few days max in the 10s¬∞). It is however a pretty long period without particularly warm weather (expect to be wearing a jacket all through April).
