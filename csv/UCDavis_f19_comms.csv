"Believe it! When I look back, it's crazy to think that I'm about to start my third year here at UCD. While I make fun of it all the time, it's really given me the best life experience I could have ever asked for. I've met the best of friends, taken amazing classes, and had the best time of my life (breakdowns, stress, and all haha)

Here's some wisdom I'd impart:

\- If you don't know where your classes are, *please* go on campus the day *before* and *look for them.* It'll make your life ten times easier (plus, you'll get a feel for the campus and how long it would take you to get there!)

**Biking Wisdom (Feel free to skip if you're not biking on campus)**

\- If you're biking, make sure that your tires are full and have enough pressure--don't want to be slugging it to class and getting tired 2 minutes into your bike ride because your wheels don't have enough air in them.

\- PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, KNOW THE RULES OF THE ROUNDABOUT. It works the same way as regular traffic, enter counterclockwise (or from the right) and follow-through. Break accordingly but don't just stop or zoom past everyone else. You wouldn't believe the number of accidents that happen on the first day/week. (I think people actually put a camera on one of the roundabouts just to see the chaos that it is the First Day of Classes but who knows lol)

\- B I K E. L I G H T S. (And also a decent U-Lock) UCD Police Dept may have some bike lights but ngl, I went there today to run an errand and they had a sign saying they didn't have any. Please buy bike lights. Especially that we are now approaching fall and the days will start to get shorter. A nice U-Lock too, I personally haven't been faced with bike theft but it does happen on campus. 

**Other Notes**

\- Take some time for yourself! Explore the area! Downtown, the Arboretum, you name it! Davis is small but I still think one of the best things is discovering new places in an area you think you're already familiar with. 

\- If you're up to it, meet up and make friends with your floormates! On a case by case basis of course but my friends are still pretty much most of the people that I lived with my first year! Even if you don't get to be friends with them, who knows if you'll have them in a class later down the road! \[Happened to me a few times, that's why it's important to always be friendly :) \]

\- Oh my god, I can't stress this enough, time management. Learn your own specific style of studying. Where you do your best studying. For me, that includes listening to adventurous video game OST's and in a not so public place (CoHo vs the C CLASS) to get me in that 'study grind.' The quarter system is ROUGH. First day will be a breeze and then two weeks later you're questioning everything you know about the given subject. Try to stay on top of your schoolwork! I use Google Calendar and a planner to help me out (otherwise... ya girl would be so lost and leave everything to the last minute/not do things/meet up with group members) 

\- Take advantage of all the resources on campus (we all pay for them anyways...) The ARC, Study Resources/Workshops at Dutton and other places, Tutoring, it'll make your life so much easier. 

\- Try to sit in the middle/front of the class. It helps to lessen distractions and personally, it helps me not be on my phone as often since I'm closer to the professor. 

\- Go to office hours. I can't stress this enough, it's sooooo helpful. I recommend going as often as you can but if you can only go once or twice, that's cool. Office hours are a nice way to not only get help but also realize that your prof is human too and they're much more than just your 'prof'

\- Other than that, sleep well, eat good, and drink lots of water. I'm big dummy and forget to do 2/3 or all 3 sometimes. In general, take care of your health and well-being. :)

&amp;#x200B;

That's all I can really think off, of the top of my head. I've got to keep studying for my final (that SS2 work grind lol) but welcome to Davis! I hope you love it here as much as I've loved it here. :)",1568348241,1,0

"Definitely get a helmet! And um, wear it too. (You're an adult now; you don't want to be making the same bad decisions your ten year old self probably would have made.)

Definitely get lights too. A front light is required by law (although bike laws are never enforced anyway, as far as I can tell); a blinking red light for the back is at least as good of an idea if you're going to be around any traffic (getting run over is bad), although it's not required by law as far as I know. Good idea to use these lights if it's raining with any significance, even during the day.

U-lock around the front tire, frame, and bike rack; cable through the back tire and secured in the U-lock. Your seat is still vulnerable if you have a quick release, but I'm not sure what to do about that to be honest.

Stay to the right unless you're passing; as soon as you pass get back on the right. Never pass on someone's right. Use hand signals before you turn. Don't ride side by side. Don't buy a cruiser.

I would get a cheap waterproof bike seat cover for starters. It’s really easy to wipe off the water with your hand if you forget to bring a towel when it rains.

MAT 21b will probably just be homework and tests so just stay on top of it and make sure you understand all the topics. That 3.0 (if not more!) is certainly obtainable with this schedule in my opinion.

Landlords open themselves up to a lot of liability illegally holding from the deposit, tenants just don't know the law very well and rarely right for their rights (or provide the right kind of documentation to make a case). If you want it back though, it will be a fight, and to win you have to be prepared (which starts BEFORE you actually move-in with photos or videos). A student that is pre-law for example, or thinking of owning rental properties in the future might learn a lot going through the process. Most (like pretty much all) people just give up the $100-200 bogus charges as not worth it, or the cost of renting, and that is why the practice continues. If more landlords got hit with the 3x punitive damages charges in our courts, the practice would be a lot less common.",1568318788,1,0

Maybe after you’ve taken some recommended classes you’ll basically be guaranteed a spot?

The Laundry Lounge costs $3.75 to $4.00 for a double-load wash/dry. Just because you were getting an amazing deal before doesn't mean you are getting price-gouged now.

It's pretty normal to unclog your own toilet. Unless there's severe blockage, you should be able to do it yourself. My apartment complex doesn't count a simple clogged toilet as an emergency.

"&gt; yeah, you argue this with straw man by saying ""\[mainlanders are against  HK movement\] because HK people did not give them directions to the  closest bubble tea shop when asked/were mean? (Also jealousy)"" 

I did not argue that, it was caricature of the point you made. I think we both know that you have a reasonable reading comprehension, so it is quite disappointing that you would knowingly engage in such misrepresentation. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The problem is you claiming giving my neutral opinion means I don't care  about the issue even though I explicitly said that my opinion that "" I  believe false imprisonment is a violation of human rights, and I have no  biased opinion against Muslims"" is made because I do not have enough  knowledge and have not yet done enough research over this issue to make  further position. 

You are a Chinese citizen and your state has been engaging in this for years. You still do not have enough knowledge and therefore do not take any action. If you don't have enough knowledge know, when will you have sufficient knowledge?  
It is comparable to saying: "" Ya, I heard that Nazis are en mass are murdering Jews and if that's true, I think that's bad. But I need more information, so I will not do anything."" Not doing anything in this case enables Nazis to further murder Jews. Similarly, your position of inaction and indifference enables Chinese government to further torture, abuse and murder Uyghur people. Let's call a spade a spade.  


&gt; ...with straw man, hasty generalization, bandwagon... 

I don't think you really understand what a strawman argument is. You keep saying my reasoning is fallacious, but you have not once explicitly demonstrated why holding such views are not unethical. Saying that someone is wrong is not argument. Again, I would expect aggies to know such things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Agree. Although it might be uncomfortable for you, you shouldn't avoid confronting me pointing out your use of fallacy 

Again not once did you explicitly explained how something I said is a fallacy, besides stating that it is a fallacy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In the end, just want to reemphasize that I am actually glad to see and will respond to **well constructed** arguments against my opinion; however, arguments with logical fallacies are just tasteless and boring. 

Thank you for taking the time to talk about this.  


I also understand that my initial posts were not very well written, I apologize for that. I will restate my arguments. 

1. Given that China engages in grotesque human rights violations. Incarcerating  over a million people in ""reeducation"" camps, where it is normal to be tortured, raped, sterilized, be humiliated, indoctrinated  and be murdered or die from illness. And also engages in complete destruction of ethnic group's identity,working to erase their culture, religion, traditions among other things. [https://www.hrw.org/tag/uyghurs](https://www.hrw.org/tag/uyghurs)

I argue it is unethical to not condemn and oppose such Chinese government actions. As not doing so partially enables Chinese government's actions.

2. Now 1. is a bit to the side because initially this was about why Chinese people oppose HK protests. Your arguments were:   
i) Chinese people believe that HK protests are violent separatist movement due to the information they receive from Chinese media.  
ii) Chinese people feel animosity towards HK people for a number of reasons, in particular better economic development through the 20st century and discriminatory attitudes from HK people w.r.t. to mainland Chinese. 

Those are really interesting points. But in your analysis you left out any ethical dimension. Whether it is ""wrong"" or ""right"" to oppose HK protests given such reasons. I think that's the essential question. 

To examine it, first I will claim that people have fundamental human rights, such as a right to assembly, a right to free speech, a right to free trial, a right to self-determination etc. Hong Kong pro-democracy protests started as a way to protect their human rights. In particular with the extradition bill where Hong Kong citizens could be sent to be tried to China where they would very likely not face a fair trial. The protests then further warped as pro-democracy protests, as a fight against their diminishing human rights. I argue that it is wrong to oppress human rights as it causes suffering to said people. The question becomes whether it is ""right"" or ""wrong"" for Chinese people to oppose HK pro-democracy protests given the reasons your provided. 

i) As I argued, being misinformed does not excuse one from the gravity of their actions. People have a responsibility to make that the believes they act on are reasonable. Your argument was more applicable to mainland Chinese people, but certainly not to rich Chinese students in the west.

ii) Envy for HK superior economic development during the 20st century and being unfoundly discriminated against by HK people I argue is not a valid reason to oppose their strive for democracy/human rights. Whatever discrimination HK people exerted over mainland Chinese people was marginal because HK people were not in power over mainland Chinese people and were not governing them. 

Because of these reasons it is unethical for Chinese students in the west to oppose HK protests.",1571486519,1,0

"Hey there! So I'm a water resource specialist, I mostly run hydrodynamic models of the bay Delta and see how changes effect flow and ec and how that hurts for fish. One thing I did that really helped was took the intro python class and really focused on learning how to read and analyze data using python. Libraries like pandas, ogr, matplotlib and numpy are invaluable and python can really help Manipulate data.

Also if you can, try downloading QGis and becoming familiar with it. It's like ARC but free, so most companies will want to use it. Lastly, the biggest thing is being able to learn and pick up stuff on the fly. There's a lot that Davis can't teach you because it's so specialised. Once you learn GIS software, there's many programs very similar to it, so don't get stuck on ""Im comfortable with arcmap"" but instead ""I'm comfortable with gis software"".

"I used to be a little shit when I was younger. Helped my friend sell a stolen bike. This is how I got busted, maybe you can try this.

They texted and called me to meet to buy the bike. Met a guy (turned out to be the owner's acquaintance), he asked if he can have a test ride around the block. When he came back, the owner was with him. The owner said he's called the police and they're right around the corner. Showed me a contact card from the PD with a case number on it, told me to sit down. Police rolled up.

I'm guessing that he called the PD up ahead of time, let them know what he's doing, and when the acquaintance rode around the block, they called the police to confirm that it's his bike and to come around. 

This was all in a really public place and they had probably figured that I was a young kid and didn't pose much of a threat when speaking to me over the phone.",1572526066,1,0
"If you can wait for it to be shipped, you can do ZenniOptical.com. If you have a simple prescription and get their cheaper frames, you can get a pair for $15-$25. Or at least buy some spares from there, so if you ever have your glasses stolen again, you’ll have backups.",1572522964,1,0
"They cover $120 of the frame price but there's I think a 130ish charge for the lenses. The frames are priced in categories, with $120 frames, $130 frames and so on.


When I got mine the total was $153 after adding the lenses. I think I got a $130 frame so they covered $120 of that.


Anyway I ended up hating the frames and they were uncomfortable so I ordered Warby Parker the week after for $95, frames and lenses total.


They're gonna tell you something along the lines of ""if you purchase your glasses someplace else SHIP wouldn't cover the full $120 that they would cover if you got it here."" Which only matters if you go to lens crafters or some bougie spot. The total was still more than my entire out of pocket cost at Warby Parker.


When they give you your prescription, ask for your pupillary distance. It's not listed on the prescription itself so that when you buy cheaper glasses online you'd have measure it yourself or guesstimate, resulting in less ideal glasses. So just ask them for it so you can tell the online retailer what it is exactly.

Besides the group project (and small checkpoint assignments) and studying for the final, there is no work outside of class.

Also, there is a quizlet set of all (or at least most) of the participation questions.  This makes the participation fairly mindless and you can do other homework in lecture, and it makes studying for the final very straight forward.

"I encounter this a lot in my job, which requires a lot of intermittent periods where I need to be on my mental A-game. There's no easy answer but:

1. Get enough sleep
2. Consistent, non-enormous amounts of caffeine. Don't overdo it compared to whatever your usual is because you don't want to be jittery. But whatever your usual is, don't drink any less than that. For me that means a small coffee in the morning and a second one in the afternoon (or immediately after lunch). I sometimes swap either or both with half of an energy drink.
3. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. That can stave off a lot of feelings of tiredness. I tend to drink water all day, and/or work on a small Gatorade steadily all afternoon. Especially important to counteract the dehydrating effects of coffee.
4. I'm bad about this, but try to eat less-processed / healthier foods. If I remember to pick one up, my go to is one of several carrot-broccoli-nut platters from Safeway.
5. If I begin to feel a headache or know that I haven't been keeping up hydration, I judiciously pop a painkiller. I prefer Advil/ibuprofen with food as my go-to.

"Oh my goodness, I can relate with your situation 200%. I just transferred in the fall and I assumed I wanted to do CogSci when in reality I wanted to do Neuro... so that meant that 2/3 of my classes were completely useless to me; not to mention that I need to watch my credit limit for graduation. Davis was EXTREMELY depressing for me--I live in San Jose so coming from the city life was a huge culture shock for me. I still have to wait until next fall to see if some of my friends are moving up here to attend Sac State. I skipped all lectures for my classes so as a result, my grades dropped purely from the lack of attendance points to save my grade. I would've had A's had I attended class--to think that, I gave up too. This quarter was also the first in my entire academic journey in which I had failed a Bio class with flying colors. I was so confused and discouraged, and knowing the fact that I was accepted to Davis from the waitlist when I applied, it only made me feel that I wasn't good enough to be ""Davis material"". 

But all I have to say is this: Don't give up. You were able to transfer from a CC to Davis, which is HUGE, especially considering how intimidating and pressuring it is to do so. Be strong to get up and try again! Try to shift your schedule around the next quarter just to give yourself a break. Go to the gym, hang out at the coffe shop, study at the library, go out with friends! I'm planning to do the same--during break, I made sure to enjoy with friends and family as much as I could at home so that I could go back to Davis with a fresh, positive mind. I hope things turn around for you next quarter, because I'm sure they will. I'm with you when I say that I failed my last quarter, but I hope you will also join me on the journey to rising back up again &lt;3 All the best in your academic journey, this is only the beginning!

"I dont think you got my point. I went to class every day till the first midterm, and after I realized the midterm was nothing like the lecture, I stopped going and instead started studying on my own. Guess what? I scored higher on the 2nd midterm and the final. 

And most of the problems on the final were much more in-depth than the lecture. You're assuming I didnt understand beyond imitating the practice problems, which is completely wrong. I always understand in-depth and learn a concept from scratch.

Almost half of the class failed. I was 1 of 2 students in my class who hadn't taken any calculus in high school. I still managed to get significantly above the curve and a C+.

The reason I'm ranting is that another student who studied with me (but had a different professor) did the same practice problems with me (that my professor gave). He told me his final was much easier than the practice problems, while my final was significantly harder than the practice problems (not just me, 70-80% of the people in my class said so).

That being said there are probably more introverts in Davis and unlike back in LA, more effort is probably needed to be social to meet your “group” in undergrad.

I believe one of my profs said it takes like 21 days of doing something to make it into a habit. So I’ll see you in 22 days 😤,1577688215,3,0

best of luck to you too. I’m already failing the “try to sleep by 10pm” goal lol but I’m downloading the app right now 😤,1577687935,3,0
"yeah so you pasted in your post ""PROMENADES (LL)-W/ACCESS (9781680050257)"". so if thats the book u need, then it means you'll need to get the online access code which you can only get from the book publisher.",1577687605,1,0
"For getting into the google calendar- start now! You can add classes and their locations and timers now. You can duplicate events on a weekly basis so you don’t have to retype everything lol. Also make sure to set it event to private (personal pref but I think it’s a good idea). And just pop new events in your phone the moment you learn about them, that way you can forget about them til your phone reminds you later. Those all are really positive things! Best of luck to you, you can do it!!",1577687586,5,0
"this pretty much sums up what I’m trying to change this quarter. I want to get into the google calendar thing, sleep early, meet new people in my classes so I can maybe form a study group. I’m also gonna add finding a new gym partner bc my normal gym partner’s schedule won’t fit mine this quarter lol",1577687427,4,0
"Google calendar everything! Alarms 30min and 10min before important events. Put in office hours and their location, classes, work, schedule food so you remember to take care of yourself. I also try really hard to have a consistent bedtime at the start of a quarter, and make it last as long as realistically possible! Also, say hi to a new person in one of your classes. You’ll either make a new friend, a study partner, or at least won’t be sitting next to each other in un-introduced silence the whole quarter!",1577686922,7,0
So I use the excel weekly schedule as a template then from there use my planner for day to day planning/ task checklist. I also have a whiteboard in my room where usually I write a list of things I would like to accomplish once I get home and there’s a “back burner” list to the side that helps me not forget long term check list items.,1577686608,5,0
Put everything from all of your syllabuses in one planner right away!,1577686412,2,0
Do you create your own timetable in excel for your daily/weekly schedule? And do you use a planner to write tasks?,1577686164,4,0
"I love to draft a week schedule outline on excel with my classes, work schedule, designated study times, realistic times to work out etc. I also try to push myself to the max (doing all my assignments, extra studying, office hours, working out as many days as possible) the first two weeks so I can gage what’s realistic for a weekly schedule and where I have wiggle room (which comes in handy for midterm weeks). Hope this helps!",1577685990,10,0

"Former peer advisor for etox here. I definitely recommend seeing your faculty advisor— if you don’t know who that is, email your peer advisor then set up an appointment with your faculty advisor to discuss your options. Building connections with your professors is extremely helpful in not only getting involved in research and letters of rec but also if you can get a professor in the grad program to sponsor you, you can get a huge advantage in the admissions process (and that way you dont have to search for a lab to join after you get in). Your faculty advisor can redirect you to professors to talk to depending on your interests.
I personally did my undergraduate research in environmental (chemical) fate of an insecticide with mentors in both Agchem and ptox grad programs. If you take ETX 102A, you can get a better idea of the emphasis as it can branch into environmental
chem, env tox or pharmtox programs depending if you’re looking into a chemistry emphasized grad program or biological emphasis. Also gives you a better idea on what type of research you’re interested in. Ex. Im interested in pesticide research in soils and water while some people might be interested in air. There’s a lot of faculty doing research in air. If you want more details, PM me!",1577683804,1,0
