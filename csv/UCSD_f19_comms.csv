If you try to reenroll and they are full then my advice is this:

1. If the waitlist is very small (a few people) then sit in the class while you wait to get in.

Both places will have their rush hours, which tend to be when people are on their way to their next class 

No matter what dining hall you land in, you’ll be doing literally everything. From handling the register once you’ve been trained, to making drinks/food, and having people move you around everywhere during your shift. You always want to do your job well no matter where you are but I feel like you get taken advantage of a fuck ton at dining halls if you’re that type of worker, because I was.

"Debatable, my pal. A single bedroom on campus is MUCH more cheaper on campus, compared to off campus, even though the chances of getting one is slim to none. You don't have to commute, you only have a single bill to pay, and someone cleans the apartment once a week. Those are a ton of responsibilities taken off the shoulders of a student that still needs adjustment living away from home, or even doesn't want to tackle those day to day responsibilities in their college life.

But if we assume the best way to tackle HDH is to have on campus students dine out...

Freshmen and sophomores can't get parking permits now, which makes the outside world really inaccessible to them.
And with that said, we are missing a big point here: students living on campus HAVE to pay the 2700-3400 Dining Dollar money, depending if you're incoming or returning student. So an on campus student will never try to eat outside because you have to spend that Dining Dollar money.

To be honest, the best way is to force the school to change the HDH policy. Not to have Residents invest 3400 because theyre incoming. Make DD/Triton Cash optional.

This, and MANY more issues can be solved by student orgs and bodies being involved in the college administration. Campus politics matters, but most of us prefer to take the easy way out, blame the school, do nothing about it and whine.

The 89 democracy movement wasn't simply confined to a square - the movement seized the capital of China and spread to numerous cities around the country as well. The movement was *massive* compared to Hong Kong's protests. It received support from students, factory workers, Beijing residents, reformers, soldiers in the PLA, police officers, even officials within the CPC all throughout the country. It essentially held the capital hostage. Their demands for anti-corruption and widespread democratic reforms of the country's government directly threatened the party's control over the country. The CPC tried to make concessions and compromises in an effort to calm the movement down. It was when it was clear the movement showed no signs of slowing down and instead was continuing to grow and gain popular support that the government decided it was necessary to mobilize over 200,000 troops to impose martial law on Beijing (for comparison, the scale of this mobilization exceeded even that of China's wars against the Soviets, Vietnam, and India). When the troops arrived on the city, they encountered resistance before they could even get close to the square itself. Residents of Beijing emerged from their homes and began to set up roadblocks throughout the city to slow their advance. Some residents would join hands and form human chains to slow them down. When the APCs started driving through crowds and machine guns started being emptied into people's backs, the crowds descended into open hostilities against the soldiers, using molotovs, rocks, and sticks which lead to a few dozen military casualties. The resistance was so fierce that hundreds of military trucks or APCS were damaged or destroyed along a 2-mile long road outside the square. Some police officers and soldiers even turned on the advancing troops during the carnage. 

The situation isn't the same in Hong Kong. The protests are confined strictly within Hong Kong. The CPC used the lessons learned from Tiananmen Square to make sure of it. Any kindling movements in other Chinese cities are immediately extinguished by the state's massive propaganda machine. The government of Hong Kong has been thoroughly infiltrated by the CPC with a pro-Beijing majority and a puppet chief executive. Although controversial and shocking, police crackdown and repression tactics on the protests have steadily decreased protest turnouts from nearly 2 million (according to pro-protester estimates) to a couple hundred thousand last week. Peaceful protesters are discouraged from attending demonstrations as protest permits were denied by the police and the anti-mask law went into effect. As a result, violent protesters (still a small minority of the movement) started taking more public attention. Using propaganda and undercover police within the protesters, the CPC has even succeeded in partially turning public opinion against the movement.

Although widespread by today's standards, Beijing has the situation more or less under control for now. Even if the protests were to somehow blossom out of control, the worst case scenario for Beijing would only be a delay of the annexation of Hong Kong until 2047, *NOT* a decent into carnage and civil war as the Tiananmen Square Protests could have lead to.

If I sound like I'm pessimistic about the outcome of the protests, it's because I am. I think many protesters agree when I say that Hong Kong will not beat the CPC. The atmosphere of the protests have changed from that of hope (香港人, 加油!/Hong Kongers, persevere!) to one of desperate resistance (香港人, 反抗!/Hong Kongers, keep going!) It isn't just Hong Kong's freedom at stake anymore, because we know the CPC won't stop with Hong Kong. Taiwan's next. The eradication of Uyghur people is going on right now. Debt-trap diplomacy in Africa. News about Blizzard and the NBA shows that they see no problem with restricting freedom of speech in other countries. We're desperately trying to punch back in any way we can to show China and other totalitarian governments that the people will not surrender their freedom without a fight.

"haha no need to stress bro it is BILD4. Purifying DNA is a relatively quick and simple process and can easily be repeated. The purpose of these lab courses is to make mistakes and learn from them. Keep in mind that labwork does not come naturally and can take hours, weeks, even months of practice depending on what technique you are using. Everyone, even professionals, PhD candidates, and post-docs, make silly mistakes all the time. Science is 90% failure. 

My advice is that if you are worried about fucking up in lab, then just study the protocol very thoroughly--don't think of each step as what reagent you need to add or how much of it you need to add, but think about them from a broader perspective. For example, after lysing the bacteria, you need to precipitate the DNA so that you can extract it with the spin column--adding 70% ethanol will precipitate the DNA. Even then, it is very common to make mistakes after studying the protocol--you can use these little fuck-ups as opportunities to think on your feet and work around the mistake. 

Since you are taking BILD 4 I assume that you are very early in your college career. Don't even stress bro, one little mishap in an introductory lab course is not going to fuck up your career. Make mistakes, record it in your lab notebook, learn from them, and do better next time.

Wallow in anxiety for the rest of their life as a self-imposed prison? No, to truly move forward and to learn, you must learn self-forgiveness. Yes you may feel bad, and it's natural you do. Some would say it's bad to not feel bad when you make a mistake. But wallowing in it does nothing. So for the sake of your mental health, and the forward movement of your team, look at the mirror and say ""I forgive myself, I love myself and I can learn"".

"Other colleges in the US are experiencing the same thing, it’s not JUST UCSD. While I do understand that having midterms make a certain impact on social life, you have to take into consideration that these professors have a scheduled deadline and agenda to meet, and they’re going to stick with what they think is best for students. It doesn’t make sense for some professors to push the exam back especially with Thanksgiving break approaching, because then students would have even more content to be tested on. Wouldn’t that end up hurting us more?

There’s always going to be a trade-off. Hopefully you can ace your midterms and still find a chance to relax, and if not, it’s not the end of the world either.",1572490618,1,0

"There you identified a bias of mine. I'm lucky enough to have my education paid for via the government and being over the age of 25 (independent student) - if you make under 80k a year all tuition and fees are paid for by UCSD. 

You bring up a great point, and really one of the difficulties associated with paying for college. What should you be entitled too? What kind of product are you receiving? 

Compared to other universities that I know of, UCSD isn't the sole university suffering from these issues. To name a few: UCI, UCLA, UCB, SDSU, CSUSM and even community colleges.

Personally if I wasn't an independent student and I had to accrue substantial debt to go to college I would not. I would wait till I'm 25 and do something else in the meantime. I know this doesn't negate the argument of paying x amount of money and receiving x return. The anxiety and lack of freedom of being in debt does not seem worth it to me. 

I think the system in general is broken. College should be treated as a public utility and educating our citizens should be of more importance; college should not be this expensive.

I didn’t get to go to school earlier for some of the same reasons you’ve listed  (family and unexpected life events) but I’m here now and I’m just taking it a quarter at a time. There is no deadline that says you have to be done by this date or that date. Progression is the name of the game, and as long as you are still moving, even making lateral moves, then you’re doing great. Also, taking a quarter off or asking for help isn’t the same as not progressing. I would say it’s actually equivalent to making huge strides in your development because you’d be tackling obstacles head on that are currently slowing you down. Asking for help is a sign of maturity and strength, and everyone needs help sometimes. I don’t know you, but I sincerely hope that you take whatever time you need to regroup and continue on. If that’s a quarter off, then so be it. If it’s the rest of the year, that’s okay too. Your life is valuable, and your health is valuable, and your family is valuable. UCSD will be here in 3 months, 6 months, or a year from now and I want to make sure you are too because you are way more important than a university.

but i agree that students share responsibility for this. i always keep my trash in my pocket or backpack until i find a suitable trash can. car trash should be thrown out at home or if you see a trash can in a public place then throw it out there but dont just dump stuff at school on the curb thinking it's appropriate for someone else to pick up.

I can tell you he does not kid about that, from personal experience. He self-admits that he puts on a show during class just to scare students a little, but if you are able to talk to him outside of class, he is an entirely different person. If you show genuine passion in science, you will likely get along well. I enjoy his teaching so much that I took him for BIBC 102 and currently am in BIBC 103. He also grades very generously, quite possibly one of the most generous STEM professors I have seen—he just doesn’t make it obviously seem that way so students continue working hard.",1574613428,1,0

The midterms for his class for 4c at least were representative of the hw and quizzes( usually same questions but diff numbers) also for our class at least tho he would tell us in lecture that this problem would be on our quiz and it would be// also he would post it on piazza reminding us.

No. TELL me - what do---""

"I had Goran for a different class (BIBC 102) and what you describe sounds pretty accurate; that is his style of teaching. However, I do think he does care about students' overall well-being, which is why he goes off on so many tangents. And I'd say he doesn't try to humiliate students but does come off too strong for my taste. Some people really like him, which is great for them. Personally,  I do wish he had focused more on lecturing the material, but I was taking the class for grade/major purposes, not for ""learning for learning's sake.""  I won't take him again because I need more structure and straightforwardness. I will say he is one of the most unique professors I've had and I really can't think of anyone who teaches like him after being here for 2 years. So if you're worried you'll run into other professors like him at UCSD, it most likely won't be a problem.

"Bullying is a pretty harsh term here. Every point he has raised is true. Majority of the students don't do the reading properly. My friends and I have always noted that a good number of questions on his slides are based off the reading assignment and if majority of the class can't answer it, it indicates a problem. Also he is right about his quiz questions being answerable. When you look at the solutions all it is is a slight twist in concepts from additional questions. The only question I saw as unfair was the dT/dt one because it isn't that intuitive to use Q = mc(delta T) for that one. Regardless I agree with a lot of the points he makes",1574571266,1,0
"I think that goran does a good job of promoting discussion and encouraging students to think through problems rather than just stopping at the surface. He just has no tolerance for people who seem uninterested. To me it feels that goran presses students when they ask question to better understand where their question is coming from to help them reach the conclusion on their own. I don't think he intends to humiliate people (most of the time) which can be seen in how he will ease off when people become unsure and how he'll usually give the solution as it becomes more apparent they individual is struggling.

Also, I don't remember the person who got called out on Friday being as civil in their response.

"He said it should be “somewhere around” what was given, “based on previous quarters.” It’ll never happen with the way he bullies us and makes the exams difficult af, but let’s say 90% of the class gets above 90% their final grades. The grading scale would probably be curved accordingly so that even somewhere in the 70s or 80s is a failing grade because clearly, the exams would have been so easy that scoring just that much below an entire 90% of the class demonstrated a lack of studying and understanding to not also score in the 90s in such an easy exam. This is sort of how Professor Swanson is curving his class this quarter as he really doesn’t believe in defining a fixed grading scale at the beginning of the quarter.

But, given how motherfucked midterms 2 and 3 were recently for Phys 2C, the grade cutoffs might just be at or below what he suggested in the syllabus to account for his bullying of us.",1574561875,1,0

"First, no one grades 350 papers alone. Even, if you are the only TA (or reader) in a lecture, and I don't see how you would be in a course with 350 students (or 175 if you had to grade two assignments at the end). This sounds like a GE course for one of the colleges. 

Second, how on earth are you grading anything without getting paid? The only case I can think of is that your advisor, or another professor, asked you for help. That's fine. It's up to you to decide if you want to help another person out. I do understand that if your advisor asks you for help you may feel obligated to do it, but it still up to you. Most professors are decent and honest people. They would certainly understand if you couldn't help. Don't forget that they used to be graduate students too.

But still you wouldn't be asked to grade three hundred and fifty papers, or assignments, of any kind!

I am sorry, but your story doesn't add up.

"Hey, I think I can fit right into the conversation. So I’ve been involved in research for a year now and interning at the hospital last month. I took a decent load of units (~12-16). So far, I think I stand pretty well academically, not the best lol, but good. I think the best way I’ve managed myself was to keep a consistence schedule and studying schedule. Here’s my tips. 

1) Plan each quarter with a decent and honest workload. Balance your classes out. Don’t overestimate yourself, especially STEM majors. 

2) Make a study plan prior to midterms and final. I usually study a week in advance before any upcoming exams and plan out what to study each day. 

3) Do your assignments in advance!! Don’t procrastinate. Utilize your study week to review and practice. Don’t cramp very last minute content. Write out your notes in advance because you don’t want to stress out during midterm and finals not knowing the information in advance.

4) Be sure to get enough sleep. I cannot stress how important this is for your health. 

5) Constantly practice over problems. Be sure to test yourself weekly so you know what stuff you need to go over before last minute. 

These are the ones I can think of right now, but feel free to message me if you have anymore questions.",1576713690,1,0

Also, some time must be allowed for a grade dispute - say if there is some miscalculation.",1576711597,1,0
"I took them at the same time last winter quarter too! They share some concepts but honestly didn't overlap much imo. I found 20D much easier to figure out on your own even tho the concepts are very vast. If your professor allows cheat sheets on tests (which they probably do) you should be fine tbh. If you ever struggle with something in either class I highly reccomend going to the TLC in geisel for drop in tutoring, they're pretty great with homework help and such.

Now this is like the 3rd time I've said this on Reddit but I can NOT stress how great SI was for math 18! I was terrified of the class bc it's so many concepts and not much plain, simple math so I decided to go to SI from the start and that was honestly the best decision I've made in college so far! If you go from the start you build a great base of knowledge from the start and even such a conceptually difficult class isn't that bad. I got an A in both classes, but 100% would have failed 18 without SI because the abstract concepts didn't sit well with me, especially since there's very little computation unlike 20D. I know tons of people get good grades in 18 without SI but it's a really nice thing to have to back-up your knowledge (:",1576711509,1,0

"Not currently an undergrad, but I'm a grad student who has TAed for various bio classes.  For undergrad I was a double stem major at a difficult school, worked, did sports, and generally took a 1.5x or greater a standard courseload, so I feel like my experience was probably relevant.  

Honestly, for me the main thing was staying on top of things.  The only times I really hit crisis mode were when I didn't and I was trying to cram, say, an entire semester of biochemistry in the week before the final, multiplied by five or six courses.  Once I started forcing myself to actually go to lecture, to stay on top of the readings, to do the problem sets even when optional, and to go to office hours throughout the semester, everything got much easier to manage.  

In terms of how to do that--I started mentally treating it like a job.  I've been working ""officially"" since I was 16 and actually longer than that and I always got to work on time and got that work done, because, well, I took it seriously.  I started treating school (including things like office hours and networking events) like I treated work; I mentally filed it under ""important.""  I read all sort of productivity ""hacks"" that are supposed to make you make yourself do things, but none of them really worked for me.  At the end of the day, I find that you hit a point where the only way to do something is to start doing it.  

One thing that UCSD doesn't do but that my undergrad did was that our units were actually the number of hours per week you were expected to have to spend on a class in total, not just in class.  A normal basic class was 12 units, or 12 hours.  (Something like a big lab class could be 18.)  That means 12 hours minus 3 of lecture and 1 of discussion is 8 more hours per week we were theoretically expected to be spending on things like doing the reading, doing problem sets, going to office hours, taking self-tests, etc..  I started expecting myself to actually spend that time.  (I didn't actually succeed--I had too much going on for that generally.  I probably spent more like 4-6, but even that was a \*huge\* improvement when spread out over the course of an entire semester.  Especially given that in my experience TAing here, I've had a lot of students start showing up to office hours terrified in the last two weeks before the final who apparently previously spent \*no\* time on the class outside of classroom time and required assignments.)    So I think setting aside time to study as if it's hours I was scheduled to work helped me a lot.  

The other thing is just figuring out what works best for you.  For me, I am really easily distracted in lectures by everything from professor accents to people making noise to just brain background noise.  If someone drops a water bottle down the steps I'm distracted for like five minutes and by the time I'm back I'm just lost.  So I find that I learn best when I do the reading before class so it's easier to follow the lecture even when I'm getting distracted.  This may not apply to you, but you've almost certainly got some quirk like that that you should figure out how to work around effectively.  Also, research shows that things like rereading, highlighting, and reorganizing are far less effective than more active studying like recall practice, problems, and testing, and my own anecdotal experience bore that out, at least.  I find that it's most effective for me to spend nearly all of my time after hearing the lecture on a subject doing problems (and going to office hours when I can't do the problems), taking practice tests, and teaching others.   

That was the other thing that really helped:  I had several friends who were in my majors and we would sometimes split up subjects and have different people give review sessions on different classes.  I ended up doing much better in the classes I had to ""teach,"" which changed how I studied going forward--I started studying like I was going to have to give a review to people.  For me at least the level of understanding that you need, especially of which concepts are important and how different ideas link together, is way higher for explaining something than absorbing it, and knowing how things fit together makes it way easier for me to remember them.",1576708649,1,0
"It's terrible. For calc grading we just get holed up in a room and divide up the problems and go non stop to finish that day. The only break we take (and the only meal we have) the whole day is an hour lunch we have in-between proctoring the exam and grading. I graded the same problem 548 times, it took 6 hours solely to grade. Tallying, checking each others' tally was more. We then had all the calc profs who taught the particular course come in and look at the stats and lastly we uploaded grades. Students got their final exam scores the same night but all in all it was an 8am-8pm ordeal and I had a migraine for hours after. 

No food or breaks really is bad for you and I wouldn't recommend this. The Profs just kinda put the expectation on us and we have to get the shit done bcs we wall want to have a vacation. I, for example, was flying out at 5am so I had to get done. 

I'm not saying this to ""guilt trip"" anyone, I'm just adding a TA's perspective. I love my students. I actually really care for them and they motivate me when I'm grading to keep going and keep being efficient. I don't get how asking for students to be understanding necessitates a guilt trip.

yeah i think a lot of them do like private consulting or have board positions in private companies and then come to work at universities sort of just for fulfillment because they like to teach. i knew a professor who was a millionaire and had worked at really big tech companies but he was like a contract professor earning like 30k and i was like whaaat?,1577751428,1,0
"I'm also a night owl and I'm not sure it's possible to become an early bird... 

I am always at my best in the evening, around 8 or 9pm... I often do my best thinking at this time, am most active and often am most productive at this time. This affects the time I (and other night owls) go to sleep. With a 9 pm peak, my productivity often doesn't wane until a few hours later. I struggle to fall asleep at 10 or 11pm. When I have in the past, my body literally treated it as a nap. I woke up an hour or two later and was wide awake.

It's a shame that the world currently caters to early birds. I'm honestly not sure we can turn things around; this is still being studied by researchers. I also have an 8 am this next quarter. And this is going to be hell. Good luck to us both!",1577751409,1,0

"I joined a gym in Mira Mesa and went to a few classes. It was me and a bunch of Middle Ages Filipina women. Most people weren’t even speaking English. That was the cheapest gym and really the only one I could afford. There are no coffee shops in Mira Mesa, the only ones are a good 50-1 hour away by bus. I went one time and there weren’t any tables available, I waited 20 minutes then had to suck it up and go home. 

Yes, tons of people, have walked by me in Mira Mesa, but so what?? Not a single soul talks on the bus, and don’t act like that’s a normal method of making friends. 

Volunteering is a good idea, but unfortunately I need to work any hours I can at the food joint because I’m broke. It doesn’t really make sense for me to be volunteering my time when I can barely afford my rent and loan payments.

"The school pays these professors for everything that they do - not just for the teaching. If all they did was teach, and had TAs as graders, then perhaps they wouldn't deserve a higher income that HS teachers. 

The university wants researchers that are submitting publications and are making themselves relevant in their fields. It may or may not be in the contract (I wouldn't know) but it is certainly expected that they are working to make a name for themselves...the University obviously wouldn't keep them around if they were stagnant in their research and in publications. Regardless, *this* is the job that these professors are passionate about. Of course they will go out there and submit material and give talks because it makes them feel accomplished and gives them purpose. Teaching is a side thing that is part of the contract. They put a lot more of their efforts into what that which they are passionate about, and if this University has hired them, they are surely pretty good in their field as researchers and deserving of a higher income than a HS teacher

"You should befriend a professor...you'll soon realize that they are in fact quite busy. 

When it comes to teaching alone, the professors do more than just stand at the front. Many of the professors go over their slides and prepare their talk for a period before each class, so that they don't ever forget the point of a particular slide. They write problem sets and exams. They receive and try to respond to hundreds of emails daily (most from students). They have weekly faculty meetings to attend. They meet frequently with their TAs to discuss what should be mentioned in each discussion and to hear feedback.

Many professors are also teaching graduate students and do not have TAs to grade those assignments. 

Then, of course, there are all of the responsibilities that come along with running a lab. They mentor the students in their lab. They write grants; they write research articles. Many travel throughout the quarter to give talks. Etc etc. 

And more than anything, they're more qualified than HS teachers. They have reached the highest level of education possible. Typically, level of education determines income.",1577748132,1,0
Took it with Kitsela. Theres alot of content compacted into one quarter so the lectures consisted of mostly the conecpts and formulas and a few basic examples but most of the exam questions were based on the HW. Final exam is worth 45% so that's also sonething to consider.,1577748063,1,0

The latter requires the former, but you can't pass Warren Writing as masterful writer without knowing what material to use as supporting evidence.

As for your point with the language proficiency, if you were to show proficiency in that level of the language you would just be placed at the next level. Unlike with CSE courses, where you have to progress from one course to the other, the language department would specifically make you place into a higher course if you already had enough experience with the language.",1577743077,1,0
"Personally I have found that using a blue filter all day really helps because the only blue light I get is from other's devices and the sun. More importantly, having a routine right before going to sleep really helps that melatonin kick in. However, these are tricks for getting to sleep and not becoming a morning person. To be a morning person it kinda depends if you wake up right on the first sound of the alarm or you just need x amount of sleep before your body wakes you up. In either case, you need to sleep at a particular time so you don't have trouble waking up. Personally I have set two particular times to sleep, one where I can sleep some more or sleep enough.

"One professor was extremely understanding and gave an opt-out of i-clicker option by the end of week 3-4, originally earlier but extended. You literally just told the TA and the i-clicker points, or participation as a whole was at least 10% of the class and was weighed into your exams grades instead. As the professor mentions in the podcast, ""we are adults and have the option"". I forgot to opt out and still missed class. There's only one person to blame here and it isn't Khosla.

I think 271 has a good point, especially a unique one I hadn't considered, but man, it's hard to not trust my own judgement when it comes to allocating more time in one class for another. It may be a false sense of security  and the research may prove my thoughts to be wrong, but at least I can take full responsibility for my conscious decisions. I'd rather face the consequences for my own doing rather than playing the woulda, coulda, shoulda and when it comes down to it, I think it's unfair to penalize someone for not being present when being present at the lecture would literally negatively effect the GPA that quarter (time allocated in another class, proper sleep before an exam, etc.).",1577741122,1,0
