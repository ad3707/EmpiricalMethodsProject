As for getting from the Megabus Stop to the school, you'll want to take a V on the in-bound route. There's a stop just a couple hundred feet from where the Megabus drops folks off. Just look for a regular ol' bus stop and have like 3 bucks or whatever it is handy to pay for the route. You won't need to buy in advance, it's just a local commuting system that you pay with cash or swipe a bus pass.

&gt; After a season full of speculation about whether he would take another high-profile college football coaching job, Penn State’s James Franklin has agreed to the terms of a 10-year contract worth a minimum of $75 million to remain as head coach of the Nittany Lions through 2031.
&gt;
&gt;The terms of the contract, which also includes a maximum of $1 million in incentives annually, were approved Tuesday by the Penn State’s Board of Trustees’ Subcommittee on Compensation.
&gt;
&gt;The announcement also came about three hours after Franklin ended his weekly Zoom news conference at which he deflected two direct yes-or-no questions asking whether he’d be back as the coach of the Nittany Lions in 2022.
&gt;
&gt;The contract calls for a base salary of $500,000 per year, supplemental pay of $6.5 million annually, and a $500,000 retention bonus at the end of each year, for total guaranteed compensation of $7.5 million. Franklin’s incentives include $800,000 for winning the national championship, $500,000 for finishing second, and $350,000 for winning the Big Ten title.
&gt;
&gt;Franklin’s buyout starts at $12 million for the first three months of 2022, then decreases to $8 million for the rest of the year, $6 million in 2023, $2 million in 2024 and 2025, and $1 million for the last five years of the dea",1637711544,28,0

&gt; I've never met someone who did summer session/LEAP

I usually teach a LEAP summer session every year (typically, media ethics). 

1. I would recommend LEAP over a general summer course. It is a good way to ease into the complexities of going to a large university (e.g., figuring out housing, etc.), complete six credits, and meet some people. It is also an environment where you can ask ""dumb"" questions without feeling like you are wasting everyone's time. A portion of my LEAP class covers things like ""how to join a club"", ""how to study"", ""how to get a TA position"", ""how to build professional relationships with faculty (and why you would want to do that)"", or even ""how to pay for college"". A lot of this stuff you normally would have to learn on your own. 
2. I'd say there is a downside to starting in the summer. I've noticed that some more introverted and brighter students can get a little bored. You could fill this with socializing, but, again, that might not be your cup of tea. So, I'd bring a side project to work on if you fall into that group.",1636740948,2,0

Obviously there are probably *some* professors willingly to go out of their way, but that's generally rare, or at least from what I know of the professors on reddit. Would it hurt to try? Probably not, but I would not expect it to work. If it does, you're lucky.",1636727570,5,1
"I don't think it hurts to ask. Some professors are willing to make accommodations for this type of thing, but I don't think they are required. Of course, talk to your academic advisor since maybe there is another way to fulfill your requirement, e.g. independent study?

"Honestly Harrisburg isn't that bad. I did the 2+2 program too. It's not a big campus but the student population is the largest after UP. There are still parties, though you have to look around a little bit, I know Greek life is alive and well there and typically students will be throwing their own parties in the nearby off campus housing (I've never personally been but I know people that have).  Freshmen are also allowed to have cars so if you have one Harrisburg and a few malls are just a few minutes drive away, there's always something to do if you're willing to spend a little time on the road. Middletown itself is pretty boring but there are some good restaurants.

The freshman housing is great too, way better than UP imo, you get your own room and a washer and dryer (just no kitchen). They also have lots of events on campus, and since everything is pretty nearby (unless you're a commuter) then they're not a hassle to go to. Also, since maybe 75% of the campus is commuters you get plenty of weather delays.

Intramurals are also good there. I personally did flag football, volleyball, and badminton while I was there, but there are plenty of others like soccer to do. You also generally get to play more games than at UP too since there are less teams. My flag football season at UP this year was on 3 games (one of which was rained out) but at Harrisburg I got probably 6 or 7 with a guaranteed playoff game even though my team didn't win any games lol. The intercollegiate sports are good too, I know they have very competitive baseball, soccer, and volleyball teams, and I'm sure there are other good ones too. There's also a pretty good gym there and rooms for racketball, ping pong, and badminton that you can usually get pretty easily as there isn't a ton of competition. And yes there are still clubs, I didn't personally do any but they still recruit year round and I know they have THON organizations there too.

The academics are good there too, they have plenty of professors with amazing resumes and the classes are generally smaller so you can have better interactions with them and don't get lost in a big class. If you're in the sciences they have good facilities for that too.

Overall it's not as bad as it might sound as a branch campus. I had the choice between 2+2 and UP based on academics and I chose to go to Harrisburg, no regrets at all. It's honestly way easier to get acclimated to college life and college work at a smaller campus, and you don't have to deal with the crappy dorms. It's good to find people there that are doing 2+2 as well so you have a built in friend group when you move to UP, but of course maybe you'll decide you want to stay at Harrisburg, I know people that planned on 2+2 and stayed because it's a great campus. 

So yeah, you may not have gotten into UP, but you're not as unlucky as you think.",1636725411,4,0

"Hi OP, I took a couple of these courses! I \*strongly\* suggest you talk with your advisors/mentors and 4/5th year PhD students on which courses they'd recommend. Statistics and design of experiments is the foundation of a lot of people's research, and you may find it extremely helpful for your future.

That being said, the rule of thumb is STAT 500-509 are master's level courses, while 510+ are PhD level. Thus, STAT 500-509 courses are typically  easier, and don't expect as much of a math/stat background.

Since many of these courses have prereqs, you should consider taking classes in the following order: 500 -&gt; 501 -&gt; 502. (If only one class, then STAT 500.)

"Last summer was [$1,458/credit for out-of-state freshmen/sophomores](http://tuition.psu.edu/tuitiondynamic/tabledrivenratessummer.aspx?location=up#up-NonPA); for the average LEAP student taking 6 credits, higher than $8,700 would be a good tuition estimate. I don't see the summer housing rates posted, but [here's what the different dorms cost per semester this year.](https://liveon.psu.edu/university-park/rates) Traditionally, LEAP students are housed in Simmons, McElwain, and Beaver. That link also has meal plan options; I believe most students get Level 1 for Summer Session. That meal plan price sounds about right, you'll probably pay less than the posted rate for housing since you're only living there for under 2 months.

You do not keep the same dorm for summer session and fall semester, so you have to move out. Pre-COVID housing usually let you either move your stuff into your fall/spring dorm early if it was ready or helped you with alternative storage if it wasn't; that was clutch when I was mentoring and hopefully they bring it back.

women face 4x higher depression rates and attempt suicide more, men just use more violent means. also oppression means there is a more powerful oppressor, women arent the cause of this

because of fragile masculinity from a patriarchy that devalues womens qualities and thus looks down on men having emotion bc its a feminine trait

IFC provides organizations with oversight, safety training, general guidelines to follow, and sanctions for failure to follow them. Without IFC, insurance companies logically see an increase in risk and raise their prices. These price increases get passed along to members.

I am not separated from the reality that COVID has placed on society. My great aunt, who was 100 years old in a medical facility, died a few weeks after contracting it. My uncle, who is a nurse and triple vaxxed, just got COVID last week and he said it's worse than the flu. 

At the same time, I am not afraid, and I am saddened to hear people speak like you about being ""scared shitless,"" because the scientific reality IS that for the vast majority of people, COVID is nothing to be so afraid of that you live your life in perpetual restriction mode. And, if you are younger with no underlying health conditions, and in a healthy weight range, and eat a healthy diet full of necessary vitamins and minerals, your chances of suffering any major illness from COVID is even smaller...extremely tiny, in fact.

So you can continue to be ""scared shitless"" if you choose - I'd argue that's mainly a result of fearmongering that you hear from the people whose job it is to report on what's happening in the world. Because the tone and themes of their ""news"" has a major effect on people's reactions and moods. Try turning the news off. I did that earlier this year, completely. I literally uninstalled every news app from my phone. I stopped putting the news on the TV. And my life has improved remarkably since I did that, because my mind is not being polluted with repetitive scary messaging that exceeds the reality of the world.",1640918106,1,0

 I know it approaches all kinds of ethical issues, but Mount Nittany needs to just figure it out, and make sure they deliver. The town, and therefore Hospital are symbiotic with the University. If it weren't for PSU, Mt Nittany would be a country store with an impressive array of bandaids.  
The services and infrastructure of Mt Nittany exist because it was necessary to match the demands of the University as it grew. If that's really the core of the problem, that's a pretty fast way to end up with a ""Penn State Medical Center - State College"" when Mt Nittany doesn't meet their end of the deal.   


The Penn State student body isn't specifically a COVID-threat. They're +90% vaccinated, and largely stick to themselves. If COVID didn't just sprawl like mad with the 100K+ influx of tourism in the Fall, the argument that the student body is a community-spread risk is kind of flat.",1640916201,1,0

Y'all can hate me for this but I fucking hate pass/fail. I understand it's use during the covid switch, that took students by surprise but there's no reason to keep it. 

College isn't supposed to coddle you by giving you a backdoor for shitty grades. And more importantly, it puts students pursuing additional education after undergrad at a serious disadvantage. 

Graduate pursuing undergrads are not encouraged to use pass/fail because often times, graduate admissions will just recalculate your GPA as a C. In addition, GPA is used to calculate class rank which had very real consequences of money and honors. For example, I'm on the cusp of getting magna cum laude honors for graduation, but if a lot of people in my year decide to pass/fail, that raises the GPA needed for honors graduation because the average GPA is now higher. But my GPA won't go up comparatively because i plan on going to grad school and will not use pass/fail. More importantly, this could apply to GPA based scholarships. High achieving students who can't or will not use pass/fail because of personal reasons can get screwed over if many students decide to pass/fail. Again, average GPA goes up, GPA needed for scholarship goes up, and aforementioned student is now ineligible for scholarship.

That being said, if administration confirms that pass/fail is not taken into account when calculating merit based scholarships and honors, I honestly don't care. Just the wording on pass/fail seems like it will affect it.",1632543513,4,0

"I'm not sure skipping dual-factor is an option. From what I can tell, most universities already require it, and it's probably due to a combination of needing to protect student records better and compliance with various government research grants or contracts for sensitive projects. That being said, my undergraduate university (and my PhD advisor mentioned that Princeton, where he previously worked, was the same) only had it expire once every thirty days.

Your alternatives are time-sensitive codes that you also have to use an app for, codes that get texted to you (also available through Duo), or a hardware token that you have to carry around everywhere that makes you input a separate password to get a special code to enter on your computer.

"You sound like you are in a pretty normal situation and have a good grasp on how it works.

I don't blame you for trying to get an apt. close to campus.  I lived both close and far from campus, and you definitely feel more disconnected when you are far away and don't see and hear the everyday bustle of the campus.  I did skip more classes when I lived far away, so let that be a cautionary tale for you.

As far as the roomie situation, you will get many different viewpoints on that.  I agree with you that trying to find good roomies after only knowing them for six weeks is virtually impossible, although the real jerks show their personalities early so you can spot them quick.  Personally, I would try to find one of the complexes where you can get your own bedroom.  Sharing a sleeping space is a very un-natural experience unless you are married to someone, and it's a situation where you never feel totally at peace at night when you need rest.  Sharing a bathroom with one person is tolerable, but I lived in an apartment with three other guys and it was not ideal in the morning when we all wanted to take a shower.

At this point, I would create a spreadsheet or Word table on your laptop and call it ""Apartment Search 2022"" and then start entering data as it comes --- make a column for apartment name &amp; address, another column for rent price, another for utilities available, etc.  That will keep you very organized since apartment hunting can get chaotic.  Try to find some free time to scope out potential places and see if you can get a tour of an apartment to see what condition it's in and the parking options.

You are definitely ""on the ball"" by attacking this whole process early and you'll likely be rewarded with finding a nice place for Fall 2022.  Good luck, my friend!",1634592395,1,0

"I was in a similar spot freshman year. I had a lot of pressure from my parents to get a 2 bedroom/4 person apartment with the girls I had just made friends with, like my older brother had done at PSU with his friends for his sophomore year. None of the girls in my group wanted to commit to an apartment, so everyone decided to stay on campus. Of the girls that didn't get single dorms, three of my friends had a MESSY falling out within *weeks* after moving into a triple together. By the end of the semester one girl had moved out to another dorm. I moved into a double with another girl in our group and we got along fantastically before making the jump to an apartment the year after. Oh yeah, I also saw my brother's apartment scenario devolve into a shitshow over the next two years with falling outs, roommates not paying rent, and roommates causing damage to the unit that my brother lost security deposit money for. And I have other horror stories in my extended friend groups...

The point I want to make here is if you really aren't confident in who you want to live with next year, it is ***so much less stressful*** to stay in a dorm. Housing will support you if you need to move to another room/building if your great friend ends up being a nightmare roommate.

""High intensity activities

Masks should always be used in public settings, but if you are unable to wear a mask because of difficulty breathing during high intensity activities, choose a location with greater ventilation and air exchange (for instance, outdoors versus indoors) and where you can keep at least 6 feet of distance from others during the activity. If such a location is not available, opt for low-intensity activities such as walking or yoga that allow for mask wearing.

If you are able to wear a mask, remove your mask if it gets moist from sweat and replace it with a clean mask.

Opt for an activity that does not require using mouth guards or helmets. Wearing a mask with these types of protective equipment is not safe if it makes it hard to breathe.

"First of all, the CDC recommends it, when did a recommendation become the right to make a law? Secondly, COVID was very much a thing 10 months back and the WHO has still not updated their guidance, meaning they haven't found any information to disprove it. 

I don't personally believe that there any long term health effects working out with a mask on but it definitely doesn't let you workout hard. The US is the only country where I was forced to wear a mask while working out during the pandemic. Other countries with stricter regulations had the common sense to realize that it messes up your workouts. The people who are OK with this either are not exercising hard with a mask on or have never exercised with a mask on.

If a recommendation from a scientific body means we can make laws we should start making laws on sugar intake limits and adequate daily exercise, but we aren't doing that and around 40 percent of the country is obese which ironically is one of the massive risk factors for COVID in younger people.

"I switched majors before my 4th semester into one that had a language requirement, so I didn’t start taking my foreign language until my 4th year.

I knew that I was going to struggle mightily in French 2 if I didn’t have a better foundation, so I retook it in the spring semester (I got a medical post drop for the fall). Then I enrolled in Intensive French in the summer session (skipping the first 1/3) and knocked out the requirement.

"I'm a teaching assistant working for a teaching professor, so I'm fully aware that they exist, and I'm fully aware that there are programs in place to improve teaching. The point is, though, that most faculty (or graduate students, for that matter) are *still* not good teachers. Standing at the blackboard or pacing back and forth across the room while lecturing is objectively one of the least effective methods of teaching, yet it is by far still the most prevalent, at least in my experience in STEM. Every now and again you find some great orator or someone who lays out their ideas so logically that even lectures are a great way to learn, but your average professor gives pretty crummy lectures that could easily be replaced by a 50-minute mandatory study hall spent reading the textbook.

To be fair, I'm not blaming them. Without any guidance otherwise, most instructors are going to teach the way that they were taught, which is by standing at the front of the room and lecturing the whole time.

"Certainly Penn State is a major research university, but many professors are hired just to teach and have no research obligations or expectations. If you check a department's website, you'll find them listed as ""teaching professors."" These are positions without tenure but often involve multi-year contracts. I don't know about the math department, but in my college of Liberal Arts, about half the faculty are teaching faculty. You're most likely to see them in lower-level courses. In my department, teaching professors teach something like 80-90% of the students in 100, 200, and 300-level courses.

A lot of effort is actually put into improving teaching. You mentioned engineering. That college has the ""Leonhard Center for Enhancement of Engineering Education,"" which works to improve teaching. The Eberly College of Science has something similar and for University Park, there is the ""Schreyer Institute for Teaching Excellence."" All of these groups work to help all faculty teach better. In addition, some faculty meet in ""faculty learning communities"" to discuss teaching. I help run two of them, the ""Liberal Arts Teaching Group"" and ""Innovative Teaching at Penn State."" In short, a lot goes on behind the scenes to improve teaching.

One of the toughest things about teaching is explaining something you know really well to a novice in that area. You've probably been in this situation with something you know well, like a video game, a sport you play or watch, etc. and you try to explain it to a novice. You might have been surprised by how little of what you said was understood by the person listening to you.

She is thinking about applying to Penn State, partly for the campus environment and football Saturdays, etc. She would definitely be interested in joining the Blue Band guard, but it would be kind of a drag to show up and then find out that it’s super-competitive and hard to get in.  From what you say, it sounds like someone with good skills and experience would probably get to participate, so long as they make the commitment.

"Been a PSU fan since 1968. I haven't seen such a disgrace as this game, not at Penn State, not even in all of division I football. Yes, Michigan once lost to Appalachia State, but the argument can be made that AS was a more talented team than UI. The blame has to fall squarely on the shoulders of Franklin (who I don't actually dislike). Not to have a decent backup QB ready to step in is simply a dereliction on his part as a head coach. And no running game this far into the season? To think that what was once a play-off caliber team two short weeks ago becoming what we saw today speaks very poorly of the coaching staff. So, go ahead a grab Franklin, USC, or LSU or whomever wants him. Be careful what you ask for.",1635045802,10,0

"No you are wrong on so many levels.

Franklin is not going anywhere.  He has this job for life just like JoePa did.  Besides, he is a great recruiter --- probably the best in the Big 10 --- or otherwise we would never get quality players like McSorley and Barkley.

Are you kidding about putting Roberson in?  Did you even watch the Iowa game?  He couldn't complete a pass to save his life!",1635038795,-1,0

"It's weak enough that plenty of the furniture scratched it immediately, and it's absurd to have put in the bedrooms. There wasn't a need for rugs until that point, and goddamnit my living space should not belong to the economy.

It also had gaps, bumps, and altogether a color that didn't suit the space",1635037594,1,0

"FRANKLIN SHOULD BE GONE. He never challenges anything, he is a “flat“, low energy, non motivational person most of the time which trickles down to everyone else and, at times, it appears he doesnt even know what just happened.  And his strategies/decisions (or those of the coaches he lets do his job) are not fact based and obviously dont work. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again ( even in one game) and expecting different results. Cant figure out one good reason, with Clifford obviously not at all up to par, why Roberson or Veilleux were not given a chance. if neither one of them could be even remotely ready given two weeks of prep time, what does that say about our coaching staff?   
The outcome with one of them in there couldnt have been much worse. in fact, it would have been over with sooner with the same outcome and our guys wouldnt have been beat to hell, including Clifford.  
Its been coming for awhile now. Speed the departing guest. USC can have him.   
And right about now, even though Urban Meyer has done us plenty wrong, he might just be what we need to win again. At least we woukd know who is in charge and that he will always fight for us, which I have never felt Franklin has done.",1635037073,1,0
