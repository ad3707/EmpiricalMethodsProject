Friend problems at Cal,"This might just be a personal issue I’m struggling with, but lately I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting on this. I’ve never been a very introverted person (people consider me as pretty socially active), but I do tend to value academics and clubs a lot so I spend more time dedicated to those activities over hanging out with people. 
I’m only a freshman, but for some reason, I feel like the people I’ve met here are so temporary. I first meet people who I get along with super well and we really vibe with each other. Then after a while, I realize people here tend to either flake a lot or they just don’t prioritize hanging out with me (I’m always the one reaching out to them). I just don’t really get it because I get along with people really well but I just feel like a loser sometimes because I can’t get people to value me as a friend here the same way I would value them? And when I help people out with things I don’t feel like they would do the same back? 

I just feel like relationships are so shallow here for me personally which sucks because I see everyone becoming best friends with roommates and floormates or club members, but I either 1) don’t fit in their clique or 2) am never considered valued as equal of a friend as I value others. People always tell me that it’s only freshman year and there’s plenty of opportunities but I feel like I almost can’t even count on clubs or classes for close friends anymore. 

Maybe this is just a rant and only something I face, but would love to get any advice of how to go about this? I always just yearned for a close group of friends or just a few close friends but I feel like that’s so hard here.

Canvas Sucks. My friends and I created an app to replace it.,"I hate using Canvas because of how confusing, slow, and unorganized it is. I rarely ever want to chat with anyone using this platform, even when I actually need help in a class.

Myself and other Berkeley students felt similarly about this problem, so we created an app called LoopChat. LoopChat makes it much easier for students to connect in any class at Berkeley. The app has a class groups feature, that allows students to easily join class group chats, and connect with their classmates. This is done by having users search their class name on the app, and adding themselves. This is an easy way to meet people in your class, and a great replacement to Canvas, as the professor is not constantly supervising the chat, and our app is much cleaner and easier to use. It is also available on desktop. We have lots of class groups being actively used right now, for the many different classes at Berkeley, with thousands of active users. We have class group chats for the many CS, Econ, Math, Bio, Psych,Engineering, and other subject classes. We have class group chats set up for most classes at Cal, and we want to grow!

This app can be very beneficial during midterm season, to connect with hundreds of other students in your classes to assist and help your studies. If you are interested, please support me and the other Berkeley students who created this app by downloading. LoopChat is available on iOS, Android, PC, and Mac.",1582241594,1,0

"AG Barr will not resign. Not before the President does. AG Barr is the same as Mueller, Schiff, Nadler, Pelosi: feign opposition to cover the true motive of obstruction to keep Trump and in power. Wray and Alito on board also. See latest updates."," 

# ""Impeachment"" Is A Diversion And Delay - Part II: Blocking of the ""impeachment"" witnesses was collusion planned before the new year. Listen to an FBI agent's disclosure from January 1, 2O2O here. The President was to resign late summer securing election for DNC. See latest updates.

The dialogue about the impeachment starts near the beginning. Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.

Here is what they are trying to distract from &amp; cover up to retain power. $100+ billion in bribes to the highest offices in this country. 815+ deaths from child rapes to prove loyalty!

See the latest PDF updates: FBI Director Wray, AG Barr, SoD Shanahan, &amp; SoS Pompeo each raped boys and were paid billions in bribes for a Soros &amp; Koch funded child rape org.

Our strike has been growing, and solidarity movements have popped up at several other UC campuses, as well as a number of campuses nationwide. We were even endorsed last night by Senator Bernie Sanders.

feeling a little screwed over by advising,"going to try to make this as short as i can...update: oops it's long. (also never post on reddit but wanted some feedback from fellow students)

ok so...i got a lab position around the start of this semester at a lab i am super excited about, but the hiring process has been lengthy. therefore, i was told by my lab to enroll in a class for research credit the week of the add/drop deadline (i am a freshman so i am pretty unfamiliar with all these research processes). i went to four different advisors in different colleges (none of them could help me until the last one) to figure out which class in which college was best for me to enroll in. the final advisor was very helpful and gave me the correct form, and told me that even though the add/drop deadline was tomorrow, that she had access to enroll me through friday, and that if i emailed her on or before friday, she would get it done for me (i was so thankful for her!). i email the form to my lab immediately, they got the signatures really fast, and as SOON as i saw the signed form pop up in my mailbox friday morning, i forwarded it to my advisor. yes, i know that this was all extremely last minute, but this just happened to be when i got this lab position. i did all that i could to make it as fast as possible, and the lab was very timely as well. when i sent the form to the advisor via email, i got an automated response back that she was actually on vacation, which she did NOT tell me in our appointment a few days earlier. at the bottom of the email, she noted that she would be checking her email throughout the weekend for emails regarding enrollment issues and would try to fix them because she knew it was time-sensitive. i also went into the advising office that day with a hard copy of the course enrollment form. the doors were locked, but i somehow caught the eye of one woman walking by who told me the advisor was on vacation but that she could put the form in her mailbox, which i appreciated. i then emailed the advisor one more time saying that i also put the form in her mailbox. flash forward to TUESDAY, after no response all weekend, i get a response from the advisor saying that she missed my emails and was not able to enroll me. i immediately emailed my lab saying i am willing to do this without credit, that i really just want the experience, and that i hope this is still okay etc. etc. this morning, i receive an email back saying that they will not take me without being enrolled in credit as it is part of their rules, which i understand. i called the advisor and told her that i am NOT losing this position because she missed the deadline she told me she would make. i told her i NEED to talk to someone above her, or please please please help me out somehow because i did all that i could. she sounded extremely doubtful, and i still don't have an answer, but i am feeling pretty bummed out. this position meant so much to me (yes, i know i might sound stupid because i am a freshman and i have time etc. etc. ...but i really did not think i would get this position, and i have already trained for it and the project was something i am very passionate about). i really don't think it is fair that i might lose the position because the advisor was MIA. anyways, i'm not sure what my point was in posting this, and i am not trying to bash the advisors or berkeley, i just think this was really unprofessional and if there is nothing they can do (which is what it sounds like right now), then i guess i have to readjust my whole semester/summer plan. ugh. not the end of the world, but a really big disappointment. any advice welcome.",1582150205,1,0

Should I take CS 61A over the summer? (prospective math/CS major at MIT),"(I apologize in advance if this is not the right place to post this. Please do let me know if this is the case.) I am a high school senior that was recently accepted to MIT, and I am planning to major in math or CS there. I haven't decided yet, mostly because I am interested in CS, but have very little experience in it compared to in math. My CS experience is fairly minimal - USACO Silver and taking AP CS right now - that's about it.     

So I was thinking that I could take CS 61A over the summer to try to ""catch up"" a little in terms of experience. I was thinking that taking 61A would possibly (1) help me decide whether I actually want to major in CS and (2) give me a better foundation because with my current experience, I would likely be a little (or very?) behind at MIT if I do decide to major in CS. At the same time, I feel like this is my last real break and I should have some more fun (travel?). Also, I'm not too sure how hard it is to get an A in this course.    

I would love to get some current students' thoughts on this. How helpful do you think this class would be for me and is it worth sacrificing my last break for? Thank you!",1582048692,1,0

"Why You Should NOT Join DSP/Rho, BAP, AKPsi, PSE, and/or Theta Tau","**I HIGHLY suggest anyone if its you or your friend to read over this chat before considering pledging one of these ""professional fraternities""** 

Business frats, and including Theta Tau, are some of the worst and most toxic organizations on UC Berkeley's campus and having previously been a part of one of them, I can most confidently say that NO ONE should be subject to the treatment you go through in the pledging process of these ""organizations"". Now that I've graduated, I feel a lot more comfortable sharing my experiences and the underground process of brutal mental and physical hazing that is worse than any social frat on this campus. 

**Mental &amp; Physical Hazing:** Imagine that being berated, yelled at, forced to wake up at 4am-8am after sleeping at sometime between 2am-3am, and humiliated many days for 7-9 straight weeks. That is the hell that pledging involves. You are given quizzes on the brothers, the chapter, the pledge class, random professional topics from engineering to math to business, and more randomly throughout the week and if you fail them you are threatened each and every single time with the risk of being ""kicked out"". 

This mindset forces you to focus on pledging and ""the process"" for an incredibly taxing amount of time and the frats act as if the process is equally as important, if not even more important than school and the classes you take. (This is especially true with the business frats). They yell at you for failing, and when you try to leave they will always attempt to hold you back and manipulate you to stay only so they can mentally abuse you. At a certain point, they stop caring about your grades and your difficult your life is; they are so power hungry and caught up on pledging you and breaking down your mental stability all for the point making you become a ""brother"" in their ""exclusive organization"". You are also given pointless tasks, under the false vision that there is a reason for things like fundraising and selling shit like Chic-Fil-A and In-n-Out on Sproul for a fake purpose (Yes they do that, take a closer look at the orgs fundraising during the semester next time), as part of pledging. Furthermore, they will also assign you work and random tasks for the sole purpose of their own enjoyment that will force you to sacrifice not only your time, but your sleep, health, grades, etc.

Not only that, but many times you are put in situations where you are pressured in to drinking; BAP &amp; Theta Tau are especially known for making their pledges drink alcohol during events as a part of ""wet"" hazing. DSP/Rho was also heavy on drinking until pledges LITERALLY became injured and their process was exposed by the university due to their usage of the berkeley email domain (which is why they rebranded as Rho are underground nowadays). DSP/Rho is a very very dangerous organization. 

UC Berkeley generally turns its shoulders to this literal abuse of students. Please reach out if you have any questions. I personally used to be in one of the ""lower"" business frats and although the process wasn't that bad; I've realized how horrible it is and how most people just let it happen.

Student perspectives on MET EECS?,"Hey everyone! I was just accepted to EECS + Business MET '24. Super excited! The program seems to encompass everything I could possibly dream of studying in college. I've not yet had the chance to chat with an actual MET student though, and am curious to hear some current students' perspectives. Here are the many questions I have about the program -- they're a lot, but if you guys could answer any for me, I'd be eternally grateful! It's not particularly easy to find first-hand information about MET online. Thank you guys so much!

\----

First off, do you like MET? 

How time-consuming is the MET workload? 

Do you find time to work on your own businesses during the school year, despite what I assume is a pretty hefty workload (though please correct me if this assumption is false)? Is it feasible to balance MET + personal business venture + social life?

Do MET students often collaborate with each other to launch entrepreneurial ventures?

Do many MET alumni end up working industry jobs, or do they do other things? Is there any kind of vocational skew post-MET?

What practical technical skills will you learn studying EECS under MET? (web dev? C++? Arduino? etc.) How much freedom do you have to explore different areas within CS?

What do you study as part of the business side of MET?

As a MET student, is it possible to fit in outside courses that don't fall under the business / CS umbrella into your Berkley schedule? Or are basically all your classes going to be from these two areas exclusively.

Thank you so much in advance! Can't wait to join Berkley '24!",1581127064,1,0
So I just got into UC Berkeley and I got regents at UCLA. Both in L&amp;S. I'm interested in CS as a minor or potentially a major with a minor but didn't want engineering curriculum.,"I know that there is a gpa minimum to declare CS from L&amp;S. How hard is it to hit that minimum if I'm really determined? What percent of kids don't meet the requirements? I know UCLA is even harder to pursue CS at since I have to transfer. If I don't meet the requirements for the major can I still minor? If not a minor, could I be a math minor and sign up for CS classes?",1581122754,1,0

Hey y’all,

I just moved to Berkeley last month and I’ve been feeling fairly lonely, and I’m not sure how I can meet new people. I just graduated from school (UCSD) last year, moved up here for work, but I’m not sure where people go in Berkeley to make friends, since I don’t know anyone here to ask. I have a few thoughts:

1. Some type of location I can go to (store, cafe, idk)

2. Some type of event in the city 

3. OR something at UC Berkeley...but since I’m not a student idk if that’s OK. I don’t want to waltz into a club or campus event and then get kicked out because i don’t go to school there. If it’s OK, this would be the easiest option.

Which Colleges Feed Berkeley's Grad school?," Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I’m a US Army veteran that is interested in applying for Berkeley's Computer Science graduate program. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m currently taking the recommended courses listed on this website: [https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/recommended-coursework](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/recommended-coursework) as a non-degree seeking student. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I wish to attend a school with a strong COMPSCI program that boosts my chances of getting accepted into Berkeley grad school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a very limited list of candidates at the moment, but I’m willing to discard them if they’re not prestigious enough according to Berkeley. As of now, Florida University is leading the list (since I live in Florida) followed by Miami University.

&amp;#x200B;

Would Berkeley consider applicants from these schools? If not, which universities typically feed your grad school program? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that recommendation letters, past research and a high GPA are the biggest factors, but I’m assuming high GPAs from certain universities are more valuable according to Berkeley's standards. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I’d be willing to relocate if necessary, or take online classes. I’ve heard The University of Georgia has a great online option for students out of state.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time!",1580919396,1,0

Should Big Tech Companies be Broken Up? Berkeley Economic Review is now accepting submissions for its Spring 2020 Essay Contest!,"Once hailed for their ability in realizing economies of scale, big tech companies are now under scrutiny for hindering competition, maintaining artificially high prices, and sidestepping government regulations. While the FTC recently announced that it was expanding its antitrust investigation into the Big Tech industry, many economists are now questioning the role of these giant monopolies in today's capitalistic markets. In his last book, The Great Reversal: How America gave up on free markets, Thomas Philippon goes as far as claiming that America is giving up on healthy competition and consequently discouraging innovation.

Berkeley Economic Review is now accepting submissions for its Spring 2020 Essay Contest!  
By writing one of the top responses, you will:  
• have your work published in the Spring 2020 Issue of Equilibrium, the premier Cal undergraduate economics magazine.  
• be recognized on BER’s social media and website.  
• receive cash prizes

Every semester, we pick a contemporary economics-related issue that Berkeley students of any major can write about. We then publish the best submissions in that semester’s issue of the magazine (see [https://econreview.berkeley.edu/magazine/](https://econreview.berkeley.edu/magazine/?fbclid=IwAR0qPKp35jrqMjnOkteQbfQ4VOJrYTvMje0bsxpMY9YJJ80uyH66KrcdWrM) for past examples).

Our prompt for this semester is:  
Should Big Tech Companies be Broken Up? Provide evidence and research to support your argument.

CS61C Coronavirus Planning: Crosspost from Piazza,"Since some students who are webcast only and therefore slightly behind.  So doing this as a separate post.  (I'll also cross-post this to Reddit myself to save someone else the hassle...)


tl;dr:

1)  You personally don't need to worry about the Coronavirus:  Get a flu shot, wash your hands, and stop touching your face.  Otherwise, chill.

2)  No more EPA from clickers in lecture, so no penalty for not showing up.

3)  Significant chance of classes being cancelled but if so, We Haz Planz:  If classes are cancelled we will simply move online only: Online lectures, hangouts-based discussion sections &amp; lab checkoffs, etc.  If classes are cancelled during MT2, we will just cancel it and distribute the points evenly amongst everything else.  If classes are cancelled during the final, the final will be a take-home exam, either 3 hours during the scheduled time, or 24 hours during RRR week.  If the latter it will be more coding heavy.

4)  Change of clobber policy:  IF you don't make MT2 (assuming it happens), you can clobber both MT1 and MT2 based on the final.  So don't come to the midterm if you are feeling sick.



Detailed explanation:

COVID-19 appears to be a droplet/content spread virus and fairly virulent.  For older populations the lethality is significant.  But for the college age demographic, it is mostly about as severe as asking for a beer and getting a Corona instead [1].  We can see this eg in the Kirkland, WA outbreak.  There are estimates based on genetic studies that the virus has been circulating for a month+, with probably 1000+ infected.  But the only fatalities so farhave been those in a nursing home that got infected. 

So the biggest advice is wash your hands, get a flu shot, don't bother with an N95 [2] and chillax.

But, in computing, we have a 0, 1, infinity design philosophy: We either give the programmer nothing, give them just one thing, or give them the illusion of infinite resources.  But infinite resources is always a lie, there is really some finite amount of stuff.  As you approach or exceed the limit, if you are lucky, you generally get some performance degradation.  Usually your performance just falls off a cliff.

Hospitals are the same way.  If you are a hospital with 100 beds and 95 patients, everything is great.  But if you have 105 patients its a catastrophe.  Plus, if you are a hospital where you usually only have 45 patients, you are way too big and the accountants will already have downsized you to 50 beds.  When people do get COVID-19 badly they need hospital care.

The public health system has lost containment: we don't even have good surveillance to know how badly containment has been lost in the US.  But that just means from a public health perspective they need to move onto phase 2: slow the spread.  As long as the spread is suitably slowed down, the system can actually handle a huge number of infections, it just can't handle a significant number all at once.

That is why I'd expect fairly soon there are either outright moratoriums or strong restrictions on gatherings of large numbers of people...  Like, oh, say, on college campuses.  This is why we are planning for the possibility of having classes shut down.


[1] Corona is like sex in a canoe: its fucking near water.

[2] N95 masks are very good when we have fires and otherwise unbreathable air.  But against the Coronavirus, the biggest advantage for wearing a mask out in public is people just stand back (giving you more space on mass transit) and HOPEFULLY reduces the rate at which you touch your face (except that, hey, you keep adjusting the mask, and rubbing your eyes appears to be just as bad from a transmissability standard).  Save the masks for those who need it: Healthcare workers and those who actually do have a cough.  And for those people, don't use the easy-breath N95s, those are only N95 in, you want N95 in both directions...",1583257816,1,0

Making it on a Ph.D. student stipend,"Hi to the Ph.D. students here!

I was accepted to a Ph.D. program at UC Berkeley this cycle. The research is absolutely captivating, and I'm visiting soon and am excited to see the campus and surrounding area. My only (albeit big) concern is the stipend, which is currently valued at $36k/year (plus health/vision insurance and tuition covered). I've heard pretty concerning things about the cost of living in the Bay Area, especially wrt housing. It might be a naive question to locals, but multiple former and current residents of the area have gone out of their way to stress to me how expensive it is, so I wanted to ask if this is a wage that'll let me pay my bills and have some left over for emergencies/travel without needing to pinch every penny. For context, I'm currently living in the greater Boston area on a \~42k salary and have been able to make it work out despite the cost, so I'm pretty good at budgeting and saving a little money each month.

Is Berkeley as unlivable as I'm led to believe?,"Hi all.

Prospective Chemistry PhD student here, current undergrad living in Washington, DC. I have a question that I've been getting pretty mixed responses to. As of now, I've narrowed down my decision as to where I'll be spending 4-6 years doing a PhD in Chemistry (focused in Organic) to 2 choices: UC Berkeley and Princeton.

My top choice going into these applications was UC Berkeley. I'm wicked interested in the research going on, though I have yet to visit, so I can't speak to how I'll fit with the grad students, groups, professors, etc. Overall, though, I think my interests *outside of research* are better suited to living in the Bay Area than to living in Princeton, NJ.

The small town of Princeton is nice, don't get me wrong; I like to ski, golf, cycle, and hike, however, which are hobbies much less accessible in Princeton than they are in Northern California. The Bay Area has beautiful weather year round, which seems to make Berkeley a no-brainer compared to the frequent bitter cold of Princeton.

My reservations lie in the horror stories I've heard about some professors at UC Berkeley and the fact that, though the Bay Area has the *opportunity* do easily and regularly do all of those aforementioned things, I won't have enough money to live even remotely comfortably on my PhD student stipend in Berkeley, let alone enjoy my hobbies from time to time.

Does anyone have any insights on the work/life balance at Berkeley? I love chemistry and deeply enjoy working on tough problems, researching new science, working in lab, and speaking with coworkers, so I can work hard during the week and on the occasional weekend day... though I *am 100% sure* I won't be able to keep that up if it's a ""12 hours a day, 7 days a week, competing for credit for your research, you can barely afford to eat food"" type of environment.

Please let me know any thoughts you may have; I will deeply appreciate your input.

Thanks much, and take care.",1583188827,1,0

Housing crisis?,"Hey guys! I’m currently a freshman who’s having a lot of trouble with housing for next year, and I would appreciate any help I can get!

I’m currently on medical leave for the rest of the semester. I’m not 100% sure I’ll be back for the fall 2020 semester, and if not I’ll definitely be back for the spring 2021 semester. Here’s where it gets tricky:

I cant apply for on campus housing until I’m reenrolled as a student, which won’t happen until late May or June. By that time, it’s unlikely I’ll get an offer for on campus housing. 

I was going to get an apartment with some friends, but if I end up not being able to go next year I don’t want to screw them out of an apartment, and I’m also not too keen on losing the deposit for the apartment either. 

If I wait until June, do you think it would be possible to just rent somebody’s extra room? Where would I go looking for that? Would June be too late to find something like that?

Would it just be better to plan to live with my friends, and if I end up not being able to go back then I just lose the deposit and have to help them find another roommate? Would it be easy to find another roommate to fill the room?

189 Coronavirus Email,"Instructor Jonathan Shewchuk posted a new Note. Your instructor selected to notify everyone in real time of this post, bypassing user email preferences.

THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS

We still do not know whether the novel coronavirus will be merely a tempest in a teacup or a serious disruption to our lives, but we should prepare for the worst and hope for the best. We do know for sure that there are now multiple cases of COVID-19 in the San Fransisco Bay Area, including some that got it from ""community transmission""; that is, they did not travel from another country nor has the disease been traced to somebody who did. We have reasons to suspect that it has been circulating for longer than most people realize, and some of us may already have it.

SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, much moreso than a regular flu. In many patients, the virus seems to have a relatively quiet period of 2-4 weeks before pneumonia symptoms develop. (It's a bit complicated and uncertain; see the information attached below for some speculation.) One Bay Area COVID-19 patient checked into NorthBay VacaValley Hospital in Vacaville on Feb. 15, implying that community transmission was probably already occurring in the Bay Area at the beginning of February. There is also evidence that it was already spreading in the Seattle area in mid-January. Which means that there is a possibility that some of you already have it and don't know it. There's also a small possibility that I might have it; I've had a mild cough for the last week and a half.

Given our uncertainty of the danger, I think it's better to risk overreacting than to risk underreacting. COVID-19 has a Case Fatality Rate estimated at 2-3.5%. An estimated 20% of cases require hospitalization (allegedly 50% in Italy), with a mean hospital stay of 10 days, usually with pneumonia symptoms. And although the virus is deadliest among the old and sick, some young, healthy people have died. Your odds of survival are very high, but if you have a severe case, it might be the worst experience of your life. Many patients need to be intubated and kept on ventilators. Moreover, if there are too many cases at once, then like in Wuhan, there won't be enough ventilators.

I do not think that the campus response has been adequate. I expect the virus to spread particularly quickly on campus because of our large population and our many large meetings, and it is distinctly possible that it is already spreading. I don't think campus authorities are acting in a manner commensurate with the long latency of the disease, or the fact that by the time the first severe case happens on campus, there will already be thousands of others on campus who also carry the virus.

I have both a hopeful message and a warning: small changes in behavior, if adopted by everybody on campus, could make the difference between a semester of minor inconveniences and a semester of cancelled classes and people you know suffering.

For these reasons, I cannot in good conscience recommend attending classes in person when videos are available. I have sent a request to the Course Capture Department asking them to minimize the delay between lectures and posting the videos. If you do wish to continue attending class, I would recommend spacing yourself out from other students.

Unfortunately, it is getting hard to find face masks and rubber gloves, but if you can get some, I recommend wearing them whenever you leave your home. (If you don't mind looking silly, add goggles, as it is reputed the virus can infect the eye.) Some authorities have been telling the public not to buy masks. I would strongly advise you to ignore that message (the product of a bureaucracy that sees us as nothing more than interchangeable resources). Also, remember that masks are not only to protect you, but also to protect other people if you have the virus. (Most people who have it will not initially realize they have it.)

Even more important is to avoid public meetings insofar as it is reasaonbly possible (stay home), to wash your hands frequently (alcohol alone doesn't suffice because it doesn't cut through oil; use a soap/surfactant and optionally add alcohol), and to avoid touching your face, mouth, eyes, nose, ears, etc. at all times. (One of the nice things about masks and gloves is that they remind you this.)

Lastly, I would like to solicit experiences from those of you who have used conferencing software that might meet our needs for online office hours and online discussion sections. The ideal conferencing software would include a choice of audio or video for up to at least 30 people, and some sort of shared whiteboard that mutliple people can draw/type on. People have suggested the following platforms, but I haven't yet tested any of them: Zoom, Google Hangouts, Twitch, and BrainCert's Virtual Classroom. Does anybody have enough experience with one of these platforms, or another platform, to say if it's suitable?

Thank you,
Jonathan Shewhuk

===============================================================================

Appendix:

It's amazing to contemplate that 10% of the world's population is now under restrictions on leaving their homes, quarantines, and/or martial law (mainly in China, but also 50,000 people in Italy asked to stay home). Japan is closing all schools and colleges. The number of cases in Italy has been doubling daily, and the number of cases in South Korea and Iran has been increasing by 50% every day for at least a week. In Iran, a Vice President and a Deputy Health Minister are infected. Saudi Arabia just closed Mecca and Medina. Even the Pope has COVID-19! From China, we see videos of officials in hazmat suits everywhere, videos of sick Chinese being welded/nailed into their own apartments so they can't leave, videos of citizens being tackled and arrested for not wearing masks.

SARS-CoV-2 is extremely infectious (with an R0 estimated to be between 3 and 8), moreso than original SARS or MERS, and while we should do measures like hand-washing and even wearing masks, those aren't going to be enough. ""Federal health officials starkly warned on Tuesday that the new coronavirus will almost certainly spread in the United States,"" says the New York Times. ""`It's not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,' Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a news briefing."" ( https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/health/coronavirus-us.html )

We now know that the COVID-19 patient at the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento is a Solano County woman who brought herself to NorthBay VacaValley Hospital in Vacaville on Feb. 15, who did not travel from Asia, and whose source of infection is unknown but probably happened several weeks earlier. California is currently monitoring at least 8,400 people for COVID-19. Community transmission is probably well underway. I suspect there are dozens of people with undiagnosed COVID-19 in the Bay Area already, if not hundreds.

The likelihood of a serious disruption (such as a campus shutdown or delayed final exams) here at UC Berkeley is high enough that we should plan for it. It's not completely improbable that we will all be confined (to some degree) to our apartments some time in 2020, as the residents of Wuhan and (to a lesser degree) Shanghai are now. But that doesn't necessarily mean we have to cancel classes. In principle, we should be able to do almost everything online, as many students in China are doing now.

Back in late January, we started to see dozens of videos of people collapsing on the streets or in malls in China, and medical personnel collapsing while on the job in hospitals (perhaps suffering from septic shock). Now we're starting to see it in Korea.

The following is very tentative and not confirmed: some people believe that COVID-19 is a three-phase disease. This figure is a rough guess at the timeline:





In Stage 1, one experiences flu symptoms, usually not severe enough to curtail normal life. In Stage 2, one may be asymptotic but still transmitting the disease. (It is still a matter of controversy whether asymptomatic spreading is rare or common.) In Stage 3, the disease recurs. In about 80-85% of people it is still relatively mild, but in 15-20% it is severe. In severe cases, it usually manifests as pneumonia. Although the majority of the deaths seem to be due to respiratory failure, there are also deaths due to viral myocarditis of the myocardium of the heart, septic shock, and kidney or multiple organ failure. The virus attacks the lungs, but the virus or secondary bacterial infections also can cause problems with the heart, kidneys, stomach, and other organs. See, for instance, https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=772&amp;v=Q0A0LyMru3I and https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-23/coronavirus-patients-long-ventilator-stays-strain-hospitals (""Severe COVID-19 cases spent more than 4 weeks on ventilators."") For those who die, the end typically comes 3-6 weeks after infection. (For example, Xia Sisi, a 29-year-old doctor at a hospital in Wuhan, was infected on January 14 and died on February 22, 39 days later.)

It is believed that the incubation period may be as long as 24 days in some people. ( http://archive.is/8dsa9#selection-3735.0-3739.21 ) I'm not sure if that means 24 days before Stage 1, or 24 days for people who show no symptoms until Stage 3. A danger of the long incubation period(s) is that SARS-CoV-2 might already be spreading widely on campus.",1583177248,1,0

Berkeley Social Club,"Hey All,

As you may have realized, meeting new friends can be tough at Cal and it is easy to feel isolated. Many clubs are difficult to get into and it can be demoralizing when you are not able to join a club, especially if you were motivated by the chance to meet new friends. 

In order to remedy this, me and a few others created a ""Social Club"" of sorts where anyone can join so that they can can meet new friends in a low-anxiety environment. Basically, we started a discord that anyone can join (but please be civil). We thought discord might be a great way for people to get a feel for one another and ideally there could be some gatherings every so often. This is a dedicated social server so we hope to distinguish ourselves from the /r/berkeley discord in that way. Since we just started the server, it may be kind of slow at first but I am confident we can get it going quickly. Please leave any suggestions down below, we hope for this to turn into a sizable club that provides a low pressure environment for people to meet one another in. Let us know what you think!

How late can I declare CS?,"Hey all,

I'm currently in my 4th semester here at Cal and am an undeclared intended CS major in L&amp;S. As a bit of background, I have already taken 61a and 61b in the first two semesters of my first year, and unfortunately didn't do great in them - I have to get an A- in CS70 if I want to be able to declare. Originally, I was taking CS70 last semester, but I only scored ~0.5 std deviations above the mean on the first midterm and just around the mean on the second one, so I ended up late dropping the class and deciding to retake it in the future as I would have had to do pretty well on the final to get an A-.

After dropping the class, my plan was as follows:

**Spring 2020**
* Take CS61C along with some EE/Data Science classes in order to get lower division requirements out of the way and gain more programming experience.
* Apply to more summer software development internship positions.

**Summer 2020**
* If I get an internship, do the internship.
* If not, take CS70, since you get a separate drop for summer courses so I have another fallback in case I fuck up with 70 again.

**Fall 2020**
* If I had an internship in the Summer, take CS70 and declare at the end of my first semester of my 3rd year.

I have contacted my academic adviser about this as well, but pending a response, my question is this: is this schedule allowed and/or viable? I picked my current semester schedule with this plan in mind, but I am now questioning it as I was recently informed about the fact that there is also a registration hold placed on people who have accrued too many units but still haven't declared, which could be an issue if I end up taking 70 in the fall. Moreover, I am also concerned since declaring in the fall of my Junior year would only leave me 3 semesters to explore upper division CS classes here at Cal.

Advice on Math 1B for Econ?,"Am a sophomore trying for the Econ major. I took my second prerequisite, Math 1A, last fall and got a C+. My first prerequisite was Econ 2 and I got an A-. I’m currently at 20 units for this semester, including Math 1B and Economics 100B.

I guess the question is should I just wait until fall 2020, when I’ll be applying to the major, to take Math 1B? Or do I have some semblance of a chance of getting a good grade in Math 1B and not completely tanking my chances of getting into the Econ major?

A question from a recent admit,"Hey guys. Hope yall are well.

So I'm trying to decide on what university to commit to for next year, and I wanted to ask you if Berkeley would be worth it for someone like me.

I am an international CS major seeking a career in tech (machine learning/computer vision to be specific) in the US. Berkeley would require my family to get a loan worth \~$145k to cover all four years. However, this would be a loan from a family member, so no interest and more flexibility (so not really a loan, just borrowing a lot of money). My second choice is Kenyon College (I know, big jump) which is a safety that gave me great financial aid. It's far from ideal for a CS major, however; they don't even have a CS major, only ""Scientific Computing"". 

Is Berkeley worth borrowing this amount of money? Entrepreneurship has also been growing on me--you think my proximity to SF and Bay Area location will add value to my experience?

Essentially, will I get bang for my buck in the CS program here?

Decision Time,"      I just got admitted to the school of engineering at Berkeley, but I happen to live in Maryland. I also applied in state to UMD, and also got accepted to their school of engineering, which is very prestigious but not as prestigious as Berkeley’s. I was talking with my parents regarding college, and a number of factors came up that they wanted to make sure I was completely aware of.
     First was the obvious variable, which was money. The money that my parents have saved for college for me would pay for roughly three and a half years of college at UMD, but around 1 year for Berkeley. As such, this complicates my decision making process quite a bit.
      Also, they were concerned about the distance. This would be a complete jump from one end of the country to the other, and though they were sure I’d adjust well, they’re mainly worried about what they would do if something were to happen all the way across the states (the whole COVID-19 situation doesn’t help this matter a whole lot).
     Truthfully, just being able to write this down has been my own attempt at personal therapy for dealing with the situation, but if anyone, whether they’re kids in similar situations or students that currently attend Berkeley, or alumni, or whoever would want to comment or help sway me one way or the other, I’d be more than grateful.",1585449969,1,0

        2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 1))

&amp;#x200B;

I've done this by hand over and over and I can never get the correct answer (s0 is 43 and s1 is 15).

I'll type out my process; I'm probably making some horrid mistake lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Player 0 gets a roll of 3, so s0 = 2+2+3 (7)

(**2, 2, 3**, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 1)

&amp;#x200B;

Player 1 gets a roll of 1, so s1 = 4

(2, 2, 3, **4**, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 1)

&amp;#x200B;

Player 0 gets a roll of 5, so s0 = s0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + \[3\] (because 5 is 2 away from 3). s0 = 20

(2, 2, 3, 4, **2, 2, 2, 2, 2**, 3, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 1)

&amp;#x200B;

Player 1 gets a roll of 2, so s1 = s1 + 3 + 5 = 12.

(2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, **3, 5**, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 1)

&amp;#x200B;

3\^(12+20) = 1853020188851841; first and last are the same so swine swap occurs. s0 = 12, s1 = 20

&amp;#x200B;

Player 0 gets a roll of 8. s0 = 12 + 2\*7 + 6 = 32. Game is now over

(2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, **2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6**, 1)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My final answer is s0 = 32, s1 = 20, which is completely wrong. I'm not sure where I screwed up here. Could anyone lend a hand (or show their process on how they achieved the answer)?

UCB EECS vs. UCLA Engineering - how to weigh student life vs. academics and post-graduation?,"Hi! I'm having a hard time deciding between Berkeley and UCLA as an undergraduate Engineering major.

I got into Berkeley for Undeclared Engineering (which would turn into EECS probably), and UCLA for Mechanical Engineering, except I'm looking to take CS classes or even switch to a CS major there.

After talking to several students at both colleges, it's become clear that UCLA's student life is superior, when it comes to the social environment, housing, food, etc. It seems that by going to Berkeley, I'm sacrificing all of that just for a slightly better education and more clout as an EECS graduate. My main question is: how much does the university I graduate from really matter in the job market? Do interviews and resumes (previous work experience) matter more or less? Is an employer going to inherently prefer a Berkeley graduate over a UCLA graduate if both students studied in the same major? And most importantly, if I'm sure that I'd be happier at UCLA, is it worth it to go to Berkeley just for the better post-graduation situation? 

(Also, on that note, if anyone knows anything about the amount of engineering or technology work/internship opportunities in the Bay Area vs. LA, that'd help me make a more informed decision. My initial thoughts are that there isn't a big difference because both cities are huge and have a lot of tech startups, but I know nothing.)

Any information would be greatly appreciated!",1585440031,2,0

Berkeley CS vs CMU Stats/ML,"What is up people I have been fortunate enough to get accepted into Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon.

Stats/ML is essentially a data science degree. I live in CA so Berkeley would be a lot cheaper. The money isn't necessarily an issue but I don't want to pay like 3x more to go to CMU if it's not going to be worth it.

Berkeley L&amp;S vs CMU SCS,"Hi! I’m having a tough time choosing which school and would love to get any advice possible. (I’m OOS btw) Here’s my thoughts:

Berkeley

Pros:
- top CS program
- Other opportunities outside CS (entrepreneurship)
- More fun than CMU
- Nicer weather (but still not optimal)
- A little cheaper than CMU (by 7k)
- People are more social and less work obsessed?
- Cali

Cons:
- Not guaranteed CS major (i’m not super experienced in CS so this is very scary)
- Not a private college (no close knit community + bonding with professors + opportunities)
- CS is still a very hard major

CMU

Pros:
- top CS program
- More technical CS program
- Lots of research and job opportunities
- Guaranteed CS major
- Private school (more worth the money)
- Safer route if I want to do CS
- Takes more AP credits
- Nicer campus

Cons:
- Super super hard coursework
- Barely any social life?
- Wacky weather
- People are more antisocial

I'm not particularly struggling (currently taking 61B and 16B). But it would be nice to have people to talk to that are doing the same stuff, and possibly work with. For the past year, I've worked on all my stuff alone, and it feels so distant.

Best dorms for prefrosh (my opinion),"Blackwell is usually best for most people though, but it’s also the hardest one to get into. Here are my thoughts about the on campus dorms

For best design/comfort: Blackwell, Clark Kerr (ckc)

Ranked

1.	⁠Blackwell/ckc
2.	⁠Units 1/2/foothill
3.	⁠Unit 3

For most convenience: Blackwell, Unit 3

Ranked

1.	⁠Blackwell/Unit 3
2.	⁠Unit 1
3.	⁠Unit 2
4.	⁠Foothill (move it to #1 tied with Blackwell/u3 if you are EECS/chem)
5.	⁠Clark Kerr

For most social: All units (that aren’t suites)

Ranked

1.	⁠Unit 3
2.	⁠Unit 1/2
3.	⁠Clark Kerr
4.	⁠Blackwell/foothill

Highlights about each dorm:

-Blackwell is Blackwell. Nuff said (usually eats at cafe 3, usually deemed as worst dining hall. Imo tho it’s more or less the same as croads—also more consistent than croads)

-Unit 1: social, small rooms but quality wise actually pretty good compared to unit 3 rooms (usually eats at croads, pretty good dining hall. The best food served is better than c3, but sometimes it kinda sucks)

-Unit 2: same thing as unit 1 but a block farther away from campus (eats at croads)

-Unit 3: worst rooms of all, but also most social and closest to campus (VERY convenient) (eats at c3–directly under unit 3)

-Ckc: huge rooms, literally looks like Stanford (look at google images), great dining hall (usually serves westernized food such as chicken tenders and stuff), usually where athletes live, pretty wild, con is that it’s a mile away from campus (20 min walk)

-Foothill: safest dorm, very peacefully but also kinda boring because it’s north campus (south campus is where the fun is at). Great dining hall (usually serves more oriental foods like fried rice and stuff like that). Close to the engineering/chem buildings",1585383909,1,0

Help me choose: Cal L&amp;S w/ a CS/Data Science intent or UCLA CS and Engineering direct to major,"So I've gotten in to both UCLA and Cal (beyond thankful :)) but I'm really not sure where I want to go. I applied for CS for both schools but applied to Letters and Sciences in Berkeley. I know it is a really competitive school for classes and getting that major in junior year. But I do know that it is #1 for CS and has great job opportunities. However it is really a big risk that I could potentially not get the major and compromise to data science or something similar.

For UCLA however, I've been admitted directly to my major, so I know getting classes/opportunities in school won't be as cutthroat. I've also totally fallen in love with the campus and overall vibe. It just worries me that I won't get as many job opportunities (as I am farther away from the bay area) and that it isn't as prestigious in CS as Cal.

Here's my pro/con list for each school:

**UCLA** \- Computer Science and Engineering

**pros:**

Has a great ""college experience"" feel

Really beautiful campus and location

My best friend is going to a nearby university

accepted direct to major

prestige

**cons:**

great for CS

nice campus/good location

L&amp;S is really competitive for CS and might have to resort to Data Science or other majors

Paying it forward. AMA!,"**A bit long, but TLDR at the end!**

Four years ago, I was exactly where a lot of you are right now -- with a hodgepodge of college acceptances and rejections and about a month to decide where to spend the next chapter of my life. The decision was immense, but one thing stood between me and total darkness:

**This complete stranger on Facebook.**

See, you know that feeling when you know so *little* about something you don't even know where to start asking questions? That was me pretty much my second semester senior year in high school. I didn't understand how to enroll in classes. I didn't know how to apply for financial aid. I didn't even get the process of declaring a major. **""What do you mean you can't major in 'pre-med'?""**

It wasn't until I stumbled upon the admit Facebook page until I saw a glimmer of hope. This random stranger, a graduating senior no less, was answering *every question* one could ever hope to ask. ""How big are class sizes?"" ""Can you double major in different colleges?"" ""I'm interested in doing research with Professors X, Y, and Z, but I only have experience with A, B,  and C. How should I email them?"" She was honest. She was detailed. Above all, she was understanding.

And in my time of need, that was exactly what I was looking for -- someone who understood that I was going through this period of uncertainty and gave me whatever information I needed to make an educated decision. I never got to ask her a question myself, but reading through her answers gave me an incredible peace of mind.

So in the interests of paying it forward, I thought I'd do something similar and hold an AMA! **Here are some things you may want to know about me:**

* I'm majoring in Public Health. I'm also minoring in Public Policy. 
* I was a GBO leader my second-year, so hit me up if you want ice breaker ideas.
* I was a GBO leader for *transfer students*, so I can try to answer any transfer-specific questions, too.

And, finally, much to my surprise four years later:

* I'm pre-med.

So comment below with your questions or PM me! If your question is out of my expertise, I'll try to reach out to someone else who may know more than I do. Whatever the case may be, your questions are valid, and I'd like to help any way I can!

Admitted Applicant Question: UIUC vs Berkeley?," Hi I hope you all are doing well amid this outbreak,

I want to start out by saying that my college acceptances were poorer than expected (Primarily because CS is soooo competitive). However, I did get into Berkeley Letters and Sciences, which is the best college that I have gotten into overall. I was wondering what was smarter: going to UIUC where CS is guaranteed or going to Berkeley and taking a risk to get into CS. Berkeley is currently ranked number 1 in CS (tied with some big names). UIUC is ranked number 5.

Here are some considerations:

I have always wanted to go to school in a city (Caltech/MIT were my middle school crushes)

I really wanted to get into and go to a competitive school whose names commands respect (corny I know but I have not worked this hard for nothing) UIUC is great! But its 66% overall acceptance rate leaves a lot to be desired in that category.

Berkeley is a huge risk (getting at least a 3.3 GPA in 3 req classes) but I do have prior programming experience (a 5 in AP CS A and been programming since 5th grade).

I need (and I mean NEED) some advice as I am an international student living in the US and this is my family's first interaction with the college system here in the US. Most of my Dad's friends are telling me to go for UIUC and most people online are recommending that. I just wanted to post for myself and get some answers.

I guess I am disappointed that I didn't get into some top tier schools and really want to attend a school like Berkely. But I don't know if that's smart especially with such a good offer from UIUC....

Please let me know what you think I am so frustrated and confused!",1585363456,1,0

1. I heard that the dining hall food is terrible, but are there other food options on/around campus that taste okay and aren't overpriced?

"Propsective transfer here, which classes should I focus on self-studying this summer?","Hello,


I'm currently a CC student and I'm hoping to transfer in as a EECS major. I really want to spend the next 8ish weeks and the whole of summer preparing for the classes at Berkeley (if I get accepted that is). 



My current plan is to study 61A, 61B, and also 70. I plan on using the websites for those courses and just doing the homework and practicing the exams. 




Any suggestions or recommendations would be appreciated! On a side note, I will most likely not need to take 61B, and just take the bridge course, 47D. Is this recommended? I have also heard that 16A is incredibly difficult, should I swap one of these classes with 16A and practice that instead? I have very little experience with electrical engineering.

Cal L &amp; S vs Univ of Chicago for Computer Science,"Hi,

I got into UCB L&amp;S and UChicago. As an OOS at Cal and with a small grant at UChicago - price difference is negligible and can afford either without loans. 

My intended major is CS and Math (plan to double major). I know Cal's reputation in CS but worried if I will be able to declare CS as a major. I know a bit of Java (did AP CS and scored a 5) and learning python on my own - plan to do some python programming in a summer job. I am fine in Math with a lot of competition math experience (AMC10/12/ARML etc; qualified to AIME multiple times but never made it to USAMO). What are my chances of declaring cs as major at Cal ? (any tips are welcome) and how difficult it is to get a second major either in math or applied math. 

Now coming to UChicago - it is not highly ranked in cs but have a strong math and theoretical cs departments; my interests in cs are mainly in theoretical/algorithmic side - so it sounded great. I heard UChicago have great resources and research opportunities - this is a plus as I have tentative plans to go for a grad program. They apparently increased size of CS in last two years as well. Being a northeast born/raised - I am fine with Chicago winters (though Cal weather would be awesome). 

After the college I want to either work for a technology company like FAANG or go for grad program (if my interest in math centric CS continues). What do you suggest I should opt or what other factors should I consider in choosing the college.

Advice for physics major struggling with the geometry,"I'm currently taking 3 physics classes (77,89,5A) and quite like 2/3 (also good at both, and like the proofs in 89).

I've never been great with visual reasoning, and when we got to Rigid Body motion last week it completely threw me. I also don't find it that interesting.
I was attracted to physics due to the concepts of modern physics and my love of math; ig I didn't consider how much geometry I'd be working with.
I'm a freshmen and if I were to switch to applied math I'd rather do it sooner than later, even though I really want to take classes like 137A-B and 139. I just don't know how closely 5A logic will mirror those classes and other classes I will have to take.

Coding Language to learn for CS (BA) at Berkeley?,"Hi all.

I am planning to double major in MCB and Computer Science (BA) under L&amp;S. Since I have all this spare time, I decided it would probably be a good idea to begin learning coding. I actually don't know anything about it or have any experience, but it sounds interesting. I've read that it's probably ideal to have an idea of what coding is and be fluent in a language before Fall this year when I start.

If I am planning to do CS, and likely go onto the computational biology upper division courses, which coding language should I familiarize myself with? I've heard of things like biopython, C, C++, etc. but I'm not really sure which one is used most frequently in college courses.

CS Easy to Declare?,"One of my friends was a top scorer for 61A, B, C, and 70 and not even CS, but thought it would be useful. I'm taking 61B and 70 right now. I'm not a CS major and this thing is really dang easy. All my other friends also find this stuff easy. Sahai's homeworks take 5-6 hours max on the really dang long ones and 1-3 hours on the short ones. This means theres about 4 hrs hw + 3 hrs lecture  = 7 hrs total a week for CS 70. Same with Hilfinger and his projects. I  don't have any coding background when I took 61a. I was looking for others that agree and looked on reddit. This is what I found on some other thread:

"" 

There are 5 basic examples of what type of student you are before you enter.

1. You did math in high school (Score of 7+ on AIME) with no coding experience. You will find CS 70 really easy, but 61a and 61b a little challenging. However, you probably will be able to declare. All my high school math friends declared.
2. You can code, but you aren't very good at math. You probably will find CS 70 hard. You will get a head start in 61a and 61b depending how much experience you actually have. You will be able to pick up the new concepts a lot quicker than someone who has never coded. You probably will be able to declare (depending how much experience you have).
3. You did math and coding in high school. High AIME and USACO silver/gold. No comment.
4. You did math and coding in high school, but you never competed at a high level or studied on your own time. All three classes will not be a breeze. You will have to work but it is still doable.
5. You did nothing of the sort. There is a higher chance that you won't be able to declare CS. You don't have mathematical maturity or coding experience.

""

People who scored 7+ on AIME or silver/gold in USACO don't go here. If there are, I would say maybe 2-5 out of the whole freshman class every year. I was far below that, and when I took 61A, last semester, it was way easier than high school classes. Same with 61B and 70 right now. 

Also, the amount of support for the CS61A, B and 70 students is astonishing. Most classes of mine that I've taken don't use piazza, hold discussion, listen to students, give back homework in a timely manner, and make sure that students have the resources they have to succeed. The classes aren't curved.

The real problem is that people don't know how to manage their time and did not prepare before hand if they're struggling. The whole entire course and all previous years are online if you were so concerned about declaring.",1584409508,1,0

"Why a P/NP Mandate For All Classes This Semester Would Be Chaos + Late Drop Information, Etc.","This would be a disaster for many reasons, and I recommend extending the deadline for P/NP but not forcing this to be protocol for all students.

This seems like something only naive freshmen would be in the endorsement of.

\*If this occurred, many sophomores and juniors would have their declaration dates pushed back, as you need a letter grade in a pre-requisite to declare one's major, given it was a regular semester, in fact the semester before many declare who's to say people weren't taking their final courses for official declaration.

\*Realize ""passed"" grades may account for no more than one third of the total units required to reach the 120 overall unit minimum. That means this would hamper you ability to take P/NP the rest of your time at Berkeley.

\*Also, ""A student who receives all incomplete grades, takes all courses on a passed/not passed basis, earns all IPs, or a combination of passed/not passed, incomplete, NR and IP grades will fail to achieve a sufficient GPA and will be placed on probation. Even if the student earns all passes, since no grade points are earned, the student will have a 0.0 GPA and will be placed on probation"".

\[TDLR; You will have a 0.0 GPA and possibly be placed on academic probation.\]

\*Also for Law Schools an NP or any P/NP past junior year will be detrimental to one's chances.

""The Law School Data Assembly Service (LSDAS) converts NP grades to F's and calculates them into the GPA as a zero. LSDAS does not count P grades in the GPA.""

\*Lastly, transfers, juniors, and seniors could be adversely impacted by a decision like this. Meaning they would have to take summer courses or come back to complete necessary requirements for courses made P/NP, especially if all like you advocate, and this would impact grad school apps, med school apps, and law apps.",1584378348,1,0

I shouldn't have wasted my last semester of my first year of Berkeley being so sad and crying in my bed all the time. But I am choosing to believe that God has given everyone the gift of time for these five months. I don't think we will ever have a moment in our lives again where we would have so much free time to work on ourselves. We can use these five months to do what we never had the time to do.

Biochem Help?,"I have a problem set due at 6pm that's released at 3pm. If someone is good at the CMP regulation, please pm/email me at [biochemtutoring123@gmail.com](mailto:biochemtutoring123@gmail.com). I can pay you very well. One example question we were given is about what will happen to the CMP in biosynthetic conditions?

The  answer we were given is here: We are in biosynthetic conditions. This  means we are using something smaller (in this case citrate) and using  that to build something larger (in this case fatty acids). For  biosynthetic conditions to even be active it implies we have a much  higher amount of ATP because ATP positively regulates biosynthetic  pathways. Since we have high ATP that means have a lot of our products  for the ETC and therefore ATP synthase will get inhibited. If we inhibit  ATP synthase this means that we have nothing to dissipate our pH  gradient and therefore it will become too unfavorable for the ETC to  continue to pump protons against its concentration gradient and  therefore the ETC also will shutdown. This will then cause a build-up of  the substrates of the ETC, one of which is NADH. Now, that you have  high amounts of NADH and ATP, they will together go and inhibit the  irreversible steps of the TCA cycle.However, this is where it gets a bit  complicated and why you need to remember the bigger picture (and this  will answer your second question). Yes, NADH and ATP will both inhibit  the irreversible steps of the TCA as well as ATP inhibiting both PFK and  PK in glycolysis. However, remember that you are also removing citrate  to produce fatty acids. Even though citrate synthase is being inhibited  by NADH and ATP, if we keep removing citrate you would eventually get to  a really really low concentration of citrate and therefore it will pull  forward that reaction even though citrate synthase is also being  inhibited (remember our bigger picture is that we need to keep being  able to produce citrate to remove it to make fatty acids so that's what  is happening here as well). Same thing happens for glycolysis. Since we  keep removing acetyl-CoA to make citrate, and pyruvate to make  acetyl-coA, and so on, the rest of glycolysis will also be pulled  forward even though we are inhibiting many of its enzymes. So there  wouldn't be an accumulation of glycolytic intermediates again because  they are being broken down to form more citrate so we can ultimately  make more fatty acids.",1584293553,1,0

Transfer regents notifications don’t come out until mid-May, but I’m tempted to SIR now so that I can register for a summer class.

PLeAsE bE mOrE cOnSiDeRaTe,"Hello students,

My name is Lakireddy Bali Reddy, some of my tenants may know me as ""our fucking piece-of-shit rapist landlord."" I have been notified that there has been some extreme misinformation floating around regarding my company Raj Properties. As landlord and convicted sex trafficker/child rapist, I would like to clarify some things regarding this.

First, Raj Properties CANNOT BE PROVEN to be a front for human trafficking or any illegal activity - we promise, we stopped doing that after I and my children went to prison for it. Second, at Raj Properties, we are committed to appearing transparent and excellent. We usually manage to treat tenants with respect (when we interact with them at all) and in fact are currently helping some tenants get through this COVID-19 crisis by temporarily reducing rent payments. We're still requiring them to pay, of course; charging people to rape children doesn't pay like it used to.

Now on to my personal life. Yes, I have been convicted of crimes in the past. In fact, my crimes were so egregious that the political landscape surrounding human trafficking was [forever changed](https://sfpublicpress.org/news/2012-02/how-an-infamous-berkeley-human-trafficking-case-fueled-reform) by my case. But my behavior 20+ years ago has almost NO BEARING on my company or the work we do; it just indicates what sort of human being we all are. I want you to think that I am a changed man and have worked very hard these twenty years to rebuild my life for me and my family, when in fact, I'm still living off the money I made ""working"" a few dirty fucking worthless untouchables, if you get my meaning 😉😉😉😉😉.

Please be more considerate and be more mindful of misinformation regarding my company. Raj Properties isn't the convicted rapist and sex trafficker, that's just me and some of my family.

Thank you all,

Kind regards,

Your fucking piece-of-shit rapist landlord

econ major appeal,"I'm a second year intended econ major.

My current prereq GPA is around 2.77 (math 1B screwed me over).

I was hoping to bring up my GPA with my classes this semester, but the econ department isn't counting any grades towards the major GPA, even if you opt into letter grades, so even if I aced my classes I'm currently taking (which is definitely *not* going to happen anyway) it wouldn't do any good.

I am admitted into Cal L&amp;S - projected major/majors: CS and/or Math (depending on how I do in first few CS courses). Currently in high-school senior year, I took couple math courses in a local college. In the fall took multi variable calculus with A- and currently taking Linear Algebra.

I am not doing well in Linear Algebra (on track to be a B-) - adjusting to online class coupled with serious senioritis made men in. I am planning to repeat the linear algebra class in undergrad but wondering how Cal treats my GPA (i.e. does it flag my undergrad class as a repeat? or does it list my first attempt at a community college in my final Cal transcript)? Any advice on should I repeat the multi-variable calculus class as well?

Will Berkeley help me get a job in the film industry or prepare for it?,"i know what you're thinking: ''yikes why are you coming to Berkeley if that's what you're going to pursue?'' (yes, i'm a pre-frosh)

Look I don't know but my family is a big firm believer in college education (as in not going was never an option) but not a believer in me so my acceptance to Cal was a big shock.

I'm not smart. I'm not good at math or science, and engineering was long out of the picture before it even entered. Law is OK but I don't care for staying in school too long.

I didn't apply to any film schools. Honestly, I lack practical and technical knowledge of filmmaking. I just know I want to work behind the scenes somewhere. It would be awesome if I was a screenwriter but there are probably too many screenwriters in Hollywood.

&gt;"" The process of obtaining California residency for tuition purposes is extremely difficult for undergraduates under the age of 24 with nonresident parents (this includes transfer students from community colleges and other postsecondary institutions within California). Virtually all nonresident undergraduates with nonresident parents remain nonresidents for the duration of their undergraduate career at UC Berkeley. ""

\- is there a minimum requirement on credits for the summer? (i've completed all my breadth requirements at cc and only really want to focus on one class)

\- if i do take the class at berkeley, where can i find who is teaching the class? (it doesn't say on the course guide and i like searching professors on ratemyprofessor before taking a class)

\- are classes going to be cheaper since they're online, and how does financial aid work? does the university still offer aid? i am a regent scholar and low income and the scholarship pretty much grants me a full ride for fall and spring, would the scholarship cover summer costs?

\- how are online classes going at berkeley? is it difficult to learn from an online platform? i really want to make the most of the class and learn as much as i can, but i dont know if it would be worth it if i am not going to learn.

\- if i do take the cc summer class, i won't get rescinded for enrolling in another university right? do i have to let the university know that i am taking the class?

\- overall from someone who has taken the class, is it helpful? if so, am i better off taking the class at cc or berkeley?

1. Are EE16a/b prereqs enforced for upper div EE classes? If they are enforced, are they worth taking to get to the upper div courses?
2. If they aren't enforced, will it be too tough to take these classes without these prereqs? As an ME, I will already have to take Math 54 and ME100 so I'll have some experience with circuits and linear algebra.
3. Any good ways I should review/self-study material before taking these courses? Are there resources online anyone could recommend (readings, textbooks, etc)? I'm planning on going through the cs61a coursework online, should I do the same with ee16a/b material (not even sure if this material is available online)?
4. How exactly do courses that have upper div prereqs work? Most of them have the option to take the course with instructor consent, so does that mean I don't need to worry about getting these upper div prereqs done. Should I avoid courses with upper div prereqs (like intro to robotics for example) because of my lack of experience or will I be fine in these courses?",1587525665,1,0

Freshman Gap Year Questions,"Hello!
I was admitted into L&amp;S for the fall 2020 semester, and because there is a chance for an online school, I am planning on applying for a gap year.

My questions:

1. Is withdrawal = gap year?

2. On ucb website, they said:
""In order to avoid cancellation of admission, students must register by paying at least the first fee installment and enrolling in at least one class. Once registered, you are eligible to withdraw on or after the first day of instruction.""

Is the first fee installment the deposit fee? Also, if I am required to be enrolled in at least one class, does that mean I can be enrolled into any one of the courses or is there a specific one? Do I have to participate in the enrolled course for the credit?

3. How does it affect my financial aid eligibility if I decide to go on with the gap year?

4. Is there a lot of process I have to go through when I come back? How should I notify them about my plan to return?

5. And lastly, I was wondering what the ""Handshake"" is... saw it at the other post about taking a gap year and got curious.

Berkeley or Davis?,"I have never been a great student, but I was admitted to Cal as a transfer student. I have been enrolled in community college for about 7 years while I worked dead end jobs. My girlfriend of almost 3 years attends Davis. Once I met her, she helped me to get back on the path to transfer because prior to her I didn’t have much help or direction. She helped me pick my major, told me what I needed to take, helped me take classes taking some on my behalf, and essentially rewrote my personal statements for me. It had been my plan for over a year to attend UC Davis where I live with my partner and major in cognitive science. To both of our surprise, I got into Berkeley where I applied as a linguistics major to better my chances. I wrote my personal statements the night before the application was due with her help. I have 11 withdrawal grades on my transcript. I don’t have any extracurriculars besides my work history. We both thought I had no chance at Berkeley. Now I don’t know where to go. I feel like I am an idiot to turn down the opportunity to go to Berkeley. I feel like I have won a golden ticket. I want the best education and teachers possible. One issue is that I am not confident that I will be able to declare cognitive science at Cal, but at Davis I definitely have the option to pursue a BA in cognitive science or linguistics. I don’t know if I will be able to pass CS61 and Calc because I have never made it through pre-calc and I have no coding experience. I feel that I will be inspired to work hard once I am at Cal, but my girlfriend thinks I am not overly optimistic and not realistic. I don’t have a plan or goal of what to do with either degree but I feel like a degree from Cal is a valuable much more valuable than a Davis degree. I have taken into to linguistics and really liked it. My girlfriend thinks I have more help and more options to explore at Davis so she thinks it is the right choice. I feel like she’s biased because some of her reasons are emotional and she probably is jealous. She brings up that she turned down her top choice school UCSD because she realized Davis was a better fit for her and that I would be able to TAG to Davis and afford housing there. I want to be challenged and I feel like I will be inspired at Berkeley where Davis is the easy route. My girlfriend feels like I have betrayed her for wanting to change our plan and thinks I am risking blowing my full ride by putting myself in n environment I am not prepared for. This year I have worked harder than ever as I haven’t had to work because I am financially supported my my family and my girlfriends family. I am used to taking a maximum of 3 classes a semester in community college. Ive been saying my gut is telling me Berkeley but my girlfriend is convinced that its just my ego and I’m stuck on prestige but I am making a bad choice. All of my family and friends think I should disregard what my girlfriend says because she is raining on my parade. She’s doing her best to let me make my own choice. My partner says she will try to support either decision but she does not want to move to somewhere in the middle so I would be commuting to Berkeley. Everyone else in my life basically says Davis is a mistake and Berkeley is an inspiring once in a lifetime opportunity.  Will Berkeley better my grad school chances? I know this is very complicated but any advice on which to choose as strangers?",1588640231,1,0

Berkeley Data Science (accepted undeclared) or UCSD Math-CS,"I was accepted into both schools as a transfer, and they're both very appealing. Ideally, I would like to work in SWE, but if I go to SD I would have to take FOUR TO FIVE  additional lower div courses before I'm even able to declare the major. 

Whereas if I go to Berkeley for Data Science, I would probably only have to take two lower div courses (61B and Data 8), but it might be harder to break into SWE(or not). Also I'm more accustomed to the semester system, since all my cc's have been using that. What do you guys think?  

I should also probably mention that I am taking the 61b equivalent at my cc this semester, but I'm probably dropping out since my prof doesn't know how to properly transition to online courses and I'm afraid of last minute grading scale changes.",1588637345,1,0
How to get a job?,"So I graduated in May 2019 with a B.A. in Physics and Astrophysics. Since then I've been looking for a job (applying for positions online) but just can't seem to get one. I understand that things have slowed down because of COVID-19, but even before then I was only getting denials, not even making it to the interview stage. I was a UGSI and have done research in Astronomy and I don't think my resume is bad (I've had it looked over a few times by my major advisor). Maybe the problem is that I've never had an internship or anything like that, or that I don't really have many connections, which seems to be the way to get jobs these days (though I don't really understand how that works).

I never expected to go so long without landing a job, but here we are. At this point I am looking all over the U.S. and applying to any position where my degree is applicable.

Thank you very much for your financial donation of $2555.30 to Sunnyvale Community Services (SCS).

Your contribution could not have come at a better time, because it will support our critical activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here’s where we stand today:

* As an Essential Services agency, SCS remains open to assist our clients and their families. We are conducting client meetings via phone and email to reduce face-to-face interactions.
* We have expanded our emergency financial assistance and case management to meet the surge in demand from people who are not able to work right now.
* We are continuing to provide groceries and emergency food onsite and making deliveries to homebound clients. We are also coordinating with the Sunnyvale School District to ensure that families have access to food even while schools are closed.

Unfortunately, we anticipate an increasing need for our services in the coming months as COVID-19–related economic effects reverberate through this area. Contributions such as yours will enable us to continue providing food and financial assistance to our neighbors in need during this unprecedented period.

With our gratitude and best wishes,

Hi. I currently need help choosing between the two. Someone please help! 

Some things: 
- From Socal
- CMU net cost is slightly cheaper by about 4000
- Want to pursue CS, and then ML and AI 
- Want to go to Grad School and get at least a Masters 
- Would like a good or at least decent social life in college (Work hard play hard) 
- Only took AP CS A, but have been learning Python by myself and will be doing that to prepare in the summer
-Will need to Declare CS at Berkeley and Obtain a minimum 3.3 GPA in CS courses (I’m not too scared of this though, as Carnegie will be equally difficult) 
- Academically strong high school student (Straight A’s all 4 years, 36 ACT, 10+ AP classes)

Can some people evaluate the pros and cons and explain why? Thanks so much.

Questions about taking a gap semester,"(1) What exactly is the policy on [readmission](https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/academic-progress/changing-status/readmission)? It sounds kinda scary, is it possible that if I take a gap semester I can't come back? 

(2) What services do I lose access to? Mostly I am concerned about my berkeley.edu email since I would like to be able to access old webcasts. Also Handshake because it is Fall semester and I plan to seriously be recruiting for next summer with my time off. 

(3) How much money will I be saving? Will I still be accountable for some part of my tuition? I am OOS so does that make a difference? 

Thank you!

My reasoning for a gap year: I am seriously considering taking a gap semester for fall 2020, because I think there is a good chance it will be online, and even in person it will not be the full experience. Also I am in a unique situation where I am comfortably on pace to graduate in three years (I have 4 semesters left), so the added benefit of skipping Fall 2020 is that I get two summers to internship rather than 1. Ultimately my long term goals are not really being affected by taking a gap semester. Finally, hearing from 08'-09' alumni it seems like the move is to stay in school as long as I can if we go into a recession so that's a slight benefit as well. If someone has another perspective I would really really appreciate it, just trying to figure out what's the best decision. Go bears!",1588612651,1,0

Choosing between Cal and UCLA in the time of COVID-19,"For the past two days, I have really felt sure of my decision to transfer to UCLA as a chemistry major rather than to do chemistry at the CoC at Berkeley. I know that Cal is possibly the highest-ranked chemistry program that one can get, but it falls short in so many important aspects to me: housing, transfer resources, a competitive environment, and the campus doesn't completely look and feel right to me, to name a few. Over the past two weeks, I've spoken to many cal students (two of which were chem majors) and I ultimately decided that there is nothing particularly unique about the school that is pulling me there, but that there is a lot that is pulling me away. I wanted to attend, as superficial as it sounds, almost completely for the name, and a small part of me for the added rigor I would obtain. But UCLA was a campus that is chock-full of transfer support with guaranteed housing in a transfer hall, clubs that pertain to transfer students, and a course that serves to orient transfer students. Plus, in my case, I prefer the warmer weather and have friends and family down there. I know my quality of life (and food) would greatly improve there and that I'd be happier in a more supportive environment.

In light of the current situation, I've begun to have second thoughts about what I should do. Housing is no longer guaranteed at either campus, classes are seemingly going to be online for the fall semester and potentially up through the next two years, and now I can't help but think that if I am simply getting an online degree and getting out, should I not be picking the most prestigious choice, which is Berkeley? Does it even matter if I'm enjoying my time there if it will only last for a year and a half at most and I'll be having trouble finding housing regardless of where I go? Should I extend my college experience by deferring enrollment after my first semester/quarter? And if I do, in what way can I productively fill my time while not in school?

All of these aspects are difficult to think about at the moment. I'm so upset because I have been envisioning my college experience since I was 11 and never imagined it to be like this. I'm at a loss as to what to do and what to choose. If anyone has any thoughts as to what they may do, don't hesitate to share them.

As a side note, I want to say that I understand that this is a minor issue compared to the grief that others in the world are facing right now, and I hope that this message does not come across as ungrateful or insensitive. I hope everyone is taking measures to stay safe right now and for those that are facing illness, I hope that you're taking care of yourselves and hanging in there.",1588582184,1,0

Taking math 54 after math 110?,"Weird question here. I skipped math 54 and went straight to 110 for my major (applied math) this semester.

"Stolen This Morning at Dawn: Cameras, Drone, Laptop, Hard Drives, Microphones","This morning around 7am a Cal alum and documentary filmmaker had all of his documentary equipment stolen out of his car in front of his Airbnb on Grizzly Peak Blvd.  A Berkeley Police Report has been filed, but I'm sure it's a long shot for them to find it.  He had hours and hours of footage that was going to be a documentary on Berkeley for incoming students.

I've heard stolen items are fronted on Offer Up, Facebook Marketplace, and Craigslist, so maybe some of his items will turn up on one of these forums.

As soon as I heard, I drove down to the Ashby BART Station where I've seen stolen stuff for sale at the Ashby Flea Market, but of course it's closed down now.

If you have any ideas about how to get his stuff back, please leave a comment here.

How stupid do you have to be to need to cheat on exams this semester?,"I took six finals this semester, one for each class. Two of those exams had practically unlimited timespan. Another two had one extra hour than usual to accommodate for submission and break time. One of them we could use the internet to search for answers. All six were completely open-book, open-notes, open-bCourses.

Because I knew that I could easily search for answers in the textbook, I did not feel extremely stressed or pressured during Dead Week. That was the point for leaving these exams open-notes and giving us extra time, to remove some mental burdens during these hard times. The only source of stress for me was the quantity of the exams and the weird time zone I was in (+16 hours from PST). Not once did I upload questions onto Chegg because it A) was not worth the effort or money B) violates the honor code C) fucks with grading system and D) fucks with my own goddamn pride.

Seriously, how dumb do you have to be to feel the need to cheat during the exam? There is no valid excuse for cheating, especially this semester. Just take it PNP if you felt stressed academically. Receiving grades won’t even matter for this semester because companies and grad schools are well-aware of the impact of the pandemic on higher-level education. 

What you should’ve done was trying your best and taking advantage of the opportunity that the school provided us. Instead of properly expressing gratitude for our profs and GSIs with honesty, you fucking spat on their faces. Fuck you, cheaters.",1589732795,1,0

I also feel like generally speaking 136 would probably be less intense than 61B. Whichever class I don't end up doing during summer i would highly likely be taking it this fall. Any advise or input / personal experiences ?

Get off the Transfer waitlist,"""Hi there,

I was waitlisted for CS L&amp;S transfer. It's not straight rejection, so it gave me some hopes that my application has some strengths. I have read a lot of tips on how to get off the waitlist, and checked on CC only to know that not many STEM people got off the waitlist last year.

Is there anyone who got off the waitlist (esp. STEM majors) who can share their advice? What did you talk about in your essay?""",1589615497,1,0

Another Stanford vs Berkeley Decision Question,"Hi everyone! I was recently accepted to both Stanford and Cal off of their respective waitlists. Berkeley has been my dream school ever since I was a child but ever since I got into Stanford earlier today, I’ve been seriously reevaluating my feelings. I like the area of Berkeley a lot more, probably because I’m a lot more familiar with it (I live around 20 minutes from the campus) and I’m not the biggest fan of the Palo Alto area. However, I’m giving Stanford serious consideration mainly because of the resources. For reference, at Berkeley I want to be a MCB major and at Stanford my major will Human Biology. 

I know it’s kind of a dumb question to ask but I feel like I need a lot of help figuring out where I should go and because both campuses are pretty much closed right now due to Covid, I figured my next best route would be to ask students on here. I appreciate any advice or information that you may have to offer! Thank you so much!",1589604699,1,0

ok what is up with the dead silence in discussions,"so finals are over, and I can rest and ask my stupid question. I am dying to know what's up with the absolute silence during discussion sections. This can't just be exclusive to the ones I've attended, unless I've been really unlucky or so annoying it kills any interest other people have in speaking loooool

In every single one of my classes, it happens without fail. Sometimes there will be a chattier day but the vast majority of the time, it's basically the GSI talking to themselves the whole time and my god it's so awkward. I understand dead silence in the massive lecture halls because that would be a shitshow but come on, a room of 20? it can't be a little more interactive when you've got someone 2 feet away just asking for an acknowledgement that you're listening?

Like, I am barely a B student, I rarely get an answer right the first try, so when I first came here, I admit, I avoided speaking in discussion because I'm 1) super shy and 2) felt so incredibly stupid and bad and afraid I'll make a fool out of myself or slow down the lecture or bore other people by asking the GSI to repeat whatever thing was said. But as time went by, around the 3 week mark or so the absolute secondhand embarrassment/cringe/awkwardness of having questions fall flat for the 8th, 9th, 10th discussion in a row was making me crazy and the desire to just break the silence and interact with the person that's trying to help distill concepts from a super dense main lecture outweighed any shyness or insecurity. And I just haven't stopped. I'm that idiot in your discussion section that's asking questions about basic concepts because this shit's hard man and I did not try so hard to get here or suffer through these homeworks just to have a front row seat at an agonizingly silent one person show. And I've ruled out online vs in person-- all semester long in fall 2019, complete silence when the GSI asked ANYTHING. computer science discs dead quiet. math dead quiet. why???

And it's still got me like... is that just how things are?  What even is the etiquette at this place, why don't people say anything, outside classrooms, ever? to anyone in discussion, GSIs, each other? I can't even count the number of midterms/finals I've taken where everyone is silently milling around the entrance then all slowly shuffle in like zombies without saying a word to each other???? what IS THIS i get we're about to take a terrible test but it doesn't have to be this way oh my god it's depressing sometimes

The only conclusion I can come to is that everyone else knows this already and don't need to be here so they're bored and uninterested and don't get much out of it, or they're annoyed when people slow down lecture OR they're also shy/afraid to speak up/whatever but it's ok!!! omg your life will be so much better if u ask for help. it's ok to ask dumb questions no one's going to judge u and if they do then fuck em you're here to learn

pls I don't want online school with this price tag AND potentially have dead silent discussions and interactions for next fall/spring

Did anyone do FPF and CS (or a major with courses not really offered at FPF)?,"Apparently waitlist admits are stuck with FPF or Global. I wanted to know how someone scheduled their first couple years.

Why does living not make sense?,"Just to clarify I am not suicidal or anything like that, merely someone who overthinks everything and ends up at this point where everything mean nothing in theory. By that I mean that no matter what we do, we are influenced by society meaning that deciding to conform or not are all based on what ideals you aline yourself with...I know this probably is like word vomit and doesn’t make sense, but stick with me cause I’ve been stuck on this for a bit. So we all, whether admittedly or not like things that are considered ‘mainstream,’ yet some people embrace being alined with some ‘mainstream’ or poplar belief while other reject some of these beliefs. Why do they attack these things that other people find human? Well I think it because we all think our subjective view is objective...I guess what I’m saying is if you can always convince yourself you’re right by following mainstream opinion or rejecting it, so why is life significant if what you believe can be changed or set by long term exposure to certain ideas or the environment you are in and the people you associate with...does any opinion really matter, if we all can do mental gymnastics to make reality anything we want it to be.

Is it impossible to apply for a MSCS if I already have one?,"Hello. So this is actually pretty clearly stated in the website that if I have a master’s of CS then I can’t apply to another MSCS, but I was just wondering if anyone knows if there are any exceptions to that rule or if there have been any cases like that??

The only reason that I’ll have a master’s is because my undergrad wasn’t in CS and I wanted to study it a bit more before moving on with life.

Any tips or feedback are appreciated. Thanks!",1581583026,1,0
