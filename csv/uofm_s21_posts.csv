Ross and Public Health,"Hey everyone

I've been doing some research but I am a bit lost because I couldn't really find my exact answer, so I was hoping someone could help me answer it. Let's say you got into LSA and decided to apply as a transfer applicant to Ross and got admitted for your sophomore year, is it possible to do a dual degree with the School of Public Health. I know that you apply for public health as a sophomore and do the program for your 3rd and 4th year, but can you be admitted to Ross your sophomore year and public health your junior year?

I am an incoming grad student at University of Michigan Ann Arbor and I have been looking at housing options near the north campus.

The cases in AA have been increasing as well and that brings up the question of whether or not UMich will have online classes next sem as well. If that happens, I'll most probably defer my admit to Fall 2022. 
I have a lease in my hand of an apartment that I like but I've not signed it yet. Because the scenario is still very unpredictable and in case I decide to defer I'll have to pay 15k USD 🥲

It shouldn't cost money to be able to succeed at the school after we've already paid out of our ass to be here,"There are many students who could succeed through high school and, after getting depression or because they had a learning disability their whole lives that starts fucking them over in college's less structured environment, now they need to get evaluated for some disorder so they can get access to the help they need.

&amp;#x200B;

Totally reasonable right? Only problem is, a lot of this stuff, is hella expensive. Particularly, a neuropsych evaluation, which is the only way to get the accommodations you need to succeed, is a whopping $1K+ depending on your insurance.

So to be clear, after paying a bunch of money to attend this school, and maayybbee get a degree, if you find your brain that got you into the school starts fucking up and won't cooperate, you now have to pay 1K just to figure out what's wrong with it, and get help if something is wrong wwith it.  There are cheaper options, but therapy copays quickly add up, medication if you're not lucky adds up, psychological evaluations still cost a lot . .. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's no cheap way to get help if your brain craps out, and kids at a top rank school are more likely to deal with this and what the hell do we do. Yes there are emergency funding resources that can help you but those feel iffy, not guranteed, like it's jsut so messed up these school resources cost this much to begin with.

A puzzle hunt can happen at a particular location, in multiple locations, or via the Internet.

Puzzles may come in familiar types such as crossword puzzles, jigsaw puzzles, cryptograms, and others, but often involve an additional twist beyond the usual structures of such puzzles that solvers must discover; other puzzles may have innovative structures whose mechanics solvers must work out from scratch. Groups of puzzles in a puzzle hunt are often connected by a metapuzzle, which is a puzzle based on combining or comparing the answers of other puzzles.",1619052853,1,0

Need help reading a UMich ebook. Please help!,"Greetings friends, I was wondering if any of you guys could help me out with an inquiry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, Paradox Interactive published a tweet teasing ""The 5th of November Act"" being added to the Polish Mission tree in HOI4. The Wikipedia for the 5th of November Act of 1916 has a line that reads ""Despite official statements, in reality the German Empire planned to annex up to 35,000 square kilometers of pre-war Congress Poland and ethnically cleanse between 2 to 3 million Poles and Jews out of these territories to make room for German settlers"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how much I believe this statement. It doesn't sound like something that the Imperial German Government would've done in the First World War. I absolutely could be wrong though, but I would like to check the source on that. I managed to track down the citation to """"Truth Or Conjecture?: German Civilian War Losses in the East"" pg. 366, Stanisław Schimitzek, 1966."" - Which Google Books says is about the Second World War, not the First. So now I'm really intrigued and I'm wondering if this citation is mistaken.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, the reason I'm on this sub is because the only ebook version available of this book belongs to UMich, and as I am not a student here, I cannot look it up. I was wondering if one of you could send me a screenshot of pg 366 (and maybe the pages before and after it for context) so I can check the validity of this statement.

Worth transferring here from MSU?,"Hey guys

I've been admitted to transfer to LSA for fall 2021. I lived in Ann Arbor my whole life and this was always the college I assumed I would go to, and I hear from a lot of people that it's supposed to be one of the best universities in the U.S

But from my time reading about what people write on r/uofm and comparing it to r/msu, I've become a bit hesitant to accept my admissions offer

Students here seem to be really unhappy with the classes on average compared to the students on r/msu. Here, I keep reading about stuff like:

\- rude professors with material split over multiple websites in a complex way, not giving rubrics or clear due dates

\- How horrible EECS 281 is with piazza posts going unanswered, long office hours queues

\- How awful Calc 1,2,3 are run

\- Labs that require a huge amount of work not actually related to the course or covered on tests

\-""Inquiry Based Learning"" 

\-Normalization of mental health issues  


Whereas on r/msu, people more just complain about specific professors, or maybe how a class wasn't taught in a way that was ""fun"". Is it really this bad at Umich?",1618974435,1,0

My reaction to Plasmadynamics and Electric Propulsion Laboratory,"TL;DR: Pretty impressive laboratory. I mean, it is a multi-million dollar facility, so kind of expected. Nevertheless, the technologies researched **were more diverse and way more innovative** than what I imagined them to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I got admitted to UMich CoE about 3 weeks ago. Here's my reaction to scrolling through the [Plasmadynamics and Electric Propulsion Laboratory (PEPL) website](https://pepl.engin.umich.edu/).

Starting with the mission statement, it sounds like the typical rhetoric of a research lab, but what caught my eye was *""Identify non-propulsion applications of EP systems.""* Now that's an oxymoron. So I went to [*""Learn more.""*](https://pepl.engin.umich.edu/about/)

Saw some history. It was a vacuum test facility started in the 1960s to simulated space and test for lunar rovers until it was donated to UMich in 1982 and converted into PEPL in the early 1990s. In 21st century, PEPL tested the [NSTAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Solar_Technology_Application_Readiness) and Hall Effect thrusters. So pretty impressive. I mean, kind of expected from a multi-million dollar facility.

Scrolled down, looked at some information on Electric Propulsion (EP). Figured out that PEPL does more than just ion engines (i.e. using an electric field to shoot out ions at high speed for thrust). Apparently, they do electrothermal and electromagnetic propulsion as well. I was like ""wow. Didn't know that. Way better than what I expected it to be."" 

People won NASA and AIAA Sperry awards, so that's good.

Now to the real part, what is the lab doing:

Looking to use Nitrogen and Water as potential fuel for ionization/propulsion. Honestly, that's so creative. How come I never thought of that. I was always like, just put some noble gases like Xenon and bombard it with electrons. But that in-situ resource utilization is so smart. Looking forward to that!

They thought of ways to increase thrust. That's expected. I mean a high-power electric propulsion lab in Georgia Tech is also working on that. After all, thrust is a downside to ion propulsion.

There are way more things PEPL is doing that I didn't get to react to. I have to go to dinner now. But whatever research PEPL is conducting is really creative and innovative. Look forward to working with these when I enroll at UMich. Go Blue!!",1618969402,1,0

BSI Transfer: Minor Questions," Hi there!

I recently got accepted into Michigan’s School of Information BSI program (UX path) as a transfer student and I’m extremely excited about it! However, I do have a couple of questions I am hoping current students could give me some insight on!

The first question I have is minors. At my current university, I am a psy and marketing minor, however, I noticed psy isn’t a minor, and my friends who currently go to Michigan told me I missed the application cut off to apply for a minor at Ross? I’m currently looking at minoring in art at STAMPS, but I’m unsure about it. I was wondering if anyone could give me any suggestions on minors that would complement my UX design major.

My second question is if anyone else who has transferred into the BSI program has found time to complete a minor, or if they would recommend I just stick with focusing on my major.

I’ve been talking to my parents about adding a minor and they are extremely worried for me. The current university I go to is barely a top 200 university and they are worried BSI’s workload will be too much for me to add a minor. I’m hoping there are a couple of BSI transfers or just BSI students in general that could give me some insight!

How long will you take to graduate?

"Got the chance to interview UMich Alum Anthony Chen, who is Employee #1 at Flexport!","Hey all!

I got the chance to speak with Anthony Chen who attended UMich Ross as an undergrad. He joined Flexport as Employee #1 (the company now has 2,000 employees and is a market leader) and I asked him about his early days, what he's learnt, and what he's doing now.

Thought I'd share in case anyone finds it useful. Cheers :)

\--------

## What were you doing before Flexport?

I was working in Venture Capital (at a firm called Signia Venture Partners) in the Bay Area. I was an associate sourcing deals and doing interesting research. Coincidentally, between investing in Flexport and another YC company, Signia went with the other company.

That other company was called Cruise, which got like a $2B exit in two and a half years, so that worked out well for them.

Before the startup world, I was on Wall Street doing Investment Banking.

## So post college, were you always planning to do Finance? And was doing your own thing or working at a startup always at the back of your mind?

So back then, startups weren’t as big a thing as they are now. I saw Finance as the fastest way to pay off my student loans. I’m from an immigrant family, so I paid for most of my education myself. And investment banking let me pay off everything very quickly, within the first 2-3 years.

As a result, though, I was nearly broke when I moved to Silicon Valley! So all that Wall Street money and bonus just went off to paying my student loans.

## That’s interesting, because I read somewhere that even Ryan (CEO of Flexport) graduated from his MBA program with like 140k in debt and used his previous business, ImportGenius, to pay that debt off. So, you’re working at this VC firm - what makes you want to join Flexport?

My background was in Computer Science and Business, so I was always interested in technology. In undergrad, I also spent a lot of time starting and running organisations - starting teams, growing teams, scaling teams etc. And my parents also ran small businesses growing up, so I did a lot of that as a kid.

International trade, freight forwarding, customs brokerage etc - it was all new to me, but because my dad used to receive cargo and stuff for his grocery store, it wasn’t completely left field.

The reason I joined after doing my due diligence was that a lot of the “goldilocks” ingredients were there. Ryan was a founder with two successful exits in adjacent industries. I had also done some research on unicorn startups and one of the commonalities was that most of the founders are in their early / mid thirties, have had a prior exit in a similar space, and are working on an enterprise company.

https://preview.redd.it/lzvnallroln61.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c95a0ce89b067422353056df248314e0a2c72fb1

So Ryan checked a lot of those buckets. The freight forwarding industry itself was fairly stagnant and ripe for disruption. We were one of the first logistics technology companies to emerge and get funding, so we did something right and helped open the floodgates for plenty of other companies.

Finally, Ryan is a true entrepreneur and someone I wanted to learn from.

## Did you see joining the company as risky?

When your bank account is small, you have nothing to lose. The only risky thing was not doing anything. I think that the challenge here is that when you leave something that is kind of a prefixed journey (step 1, step 2, etc), a lot of your friends and colleagues are going to really question what you’re doing.

Your colleagues will see it as a ridiculous risk and wonder why you’re joining a no name company. But hopefully you’ll also have some good friends who are supportive of what you’re doing.

I think that when you do a startup or join one at an early stage, you definitely take on risk but you have to trust that no matter what you have to learn or do something. The rest is all upside.

## What did you join as? Was Ryan even looking to hire someone at the time?

The actual job post that Ryan had was for a jack of all trades. Given my background in engineering, business, and a little bit of design, it seemed to resonate and work well. Mix that in with family entrepreneurial hustle, that also was well received.

And for folks who are looking to join an early stage startup, you have to have no ego and be willing to do anything and everything. My hats consisted of many things. I did ops, sales, finance, design and product.

https://preview.redd.it/sl3prrivoln61.png?width=2540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fa2958e4bebd96aa8074feb265c142c557b2dd9

## Were you getting on the phone with customers at this stage too?

Everyday. So from 9am until 5pm, we’d have a call every 10 or so minutes. Which means that the entire day we’d basically just be processing these customer requests, feedbacks, orders etc. And then we’d actually start the “real work” from 5pm to 10pm, or until later.

The first year was very aggressive. I lived in Palo Alto at the time so I would be on the CalTrain by 7am, in the office in downtown SF by like 8:30, and then we’d work until 5 or 6, have dinner, and then work until around 10 again.

Then, I’d take the CalTrain back to Palo Alto anywhere between 9pm to 11pm, get home, and work from 12 to 2 again. It was crazy because I had to work two shifts since we had both US clients and Asian partners. So when night came, Asia would wake up, and I’d need to be on the phone with our partners, factories, etc over there.

## In another interview you mentioned that when you were talking to your customers, you realized their needs were more than just customs clearance. They wanted you guys to manage their whole supply chain. When did that realization occur and is that when you truly realized the scale of the opportunity?

The big picture scale was always apparent. Our trojan horse was customs, and that was the core business for a period of time. We never thought that the business would explode so quickly in terms of scope in the way that it did - that was serendipitous. A lot of it was just down to the fact that success compounds and we had tons of momentum behind us.

To answer your question more directly - since we were on the phone all day with our customers, we got to know their pain points really well. What were they scared of? What sucked for them? These were questions that were really easy for us to answer.

More generally, most people don’t like to be uncomfortable. People don’t like pain. But you need it. If you actually want to find out what problem needs solving, you need to feel the pain. If you don’t feel the pain, you’re not going to build the right thing and you’re not going to be able to fix it.

You’re going to be working from an ivory tower and being all theoretical. So the feedback that we got over the first 3-4 months was overwhelming: our customers felt like their freight partners were often mismanaged their shipments, communicated poorly, coordinated poorly, and lacked accountability. No managed service... We wanted to step up and help.

## What did these early customers look like? Were you already landing enterprise customers or were these mom&amp;pop shops?

I think the majority of the early stage clients were mom and pop shops. Majority of them were just companies that were googling customs clearance and trying to look for someone to save their ass. And so usually, that didn’t make for the easiest of customer problems, but it definitely showed us what was painful.

To be honest, when we were more deliberate about the types of customers that we wanted to work with, we wanted to find people that were philosophically aligned with us. I think that’s true for any partnership you should do as a business. And when we started doing that, we started to find customers who were growing much faster and wanted to work with us. So as you can imagine, a lot of startups and bay area companies resonated with our vision: ""to make global trade easy for everyone"".

## In one of your blog posts, you describe the distinction between working on the business vs in the business. Did you enjoy the evolution of your role into one that focused on building systems and ensuring everything ran smoothly? I know a lot of people that prefer just doing the stuff that takes a company from 0-1.

Yeah, many of those rapid changes were a lot of fun and got to really test your mettle. I think the first few years it was a lot about turning the individual into institutional, reflecting about what was working and what wasn’t.

So, very systematically, every 2 weeks we had workshops that I led to figure out where the holes were in our process. We were very intentional about this - we didn’t wait for an account exec or an ops teammate to slowly bubble problems up. We were still small, still lean, and our DNA said we want to solve problems.

Everyone on the team felt like they were a true product owner and they were solving problems for the business that went beyond just their job title. Everybody was contributing to how we could improve the process and product.

## And I think another cool thing here is that I’ve read you guys insist on hiring generalists rather than experts. I’m sure that helped with building an org that is improving based on first principles and constantly rethinking the way processes are handled?

Yeah, it was very deliberate. We wanted to have a good mix between experienced industry knowledge, experienced tech knowledge, and then the generalist problem solvers. By combining these 3 types of personas together, you created a very strong culture and also a dynamic that allows your team to ask questions like “Hey, why isn’t this tech possible?” or “Hey, why didn’t the incumbents do something like this before?”.

And that was very powerful. It made our feedback loop remarkably fast and agile.

## How do you scale culture? I know one of your big values is radical candor. And I’m wondering with so many offices now and a much larger number of employees, how do you ensure that these principles you’ve laid out are actually acted upon globally?

That is an ever changing problem with an ever changing solution. So I don’t have a perfect answer for you. What I can say, it’s probably one of the biggest topics that every company will always need to keep on top of mind.

Values stem from people. Things like hiring, managing, and coaching. All those elements are important and you need to be intentional about how you do each of those things. For example, are you looking for people that demonstrate these attributes we’ve communicated? Also, are you instilling the right positive feedback loop when they’re being trained? Do they see that in practice? And then, do you lead or have managers that embody this as well?

In regards to scaling this, it’s hard. But in my opinion it just needs a real human touch. You are able to scale culture by having strong culture carriers and ultimately that means you need to have strong managers. I think having strong individual culture carriers is great, but if you have a manager that is a strong culture carrier, and they’re able to recruit, manage, and lead, then that’s a huge multiplier and you have a 1 to N dynamic.

## What advice do you have for others looking to join a very early stage venture?

Make it so that your decision is a win-win no matter what happens. And if you feel like your decision is going to be a win-win no matter what happens, then go for it. Because you’re going to be jittery about joining a new company, you’re going to weigh the pros and cons, think about what the opportunity costs is, etc - and all of that is true.

But what I mean by ""make it win-win"", is that you're able to make the best of the situation regardless of whether the company crushes it or has to fold. If the company does well, then great, you're in a win scenario. But what if, for some reason it fails? Do you still feel like you'd be able to pick up new skills? Learn from your leaders and colleagues? Push your comfort zone? And become more tempered? If so, then you've found a win-win scenario.

## What are you focused on now?

I’m a light-weight angel investor, but I love working with founders and helping them navigate that seed to late Series A / early B stage. I enjoy helping them figure out how to hire, grow, and build. And ultimately, set up the infrastructure needed to get scaling ready and in place. By no means am I an expert in all these things, but I think for the Seed to Series B stage, my insights are helpful for a lot of entrepreneurs. I love working on those challenges.

""Backpack for spring/summer/fall 2021 class  registration begins on Wednesday, March 24. We want to make you aware of  an adjustment to registration appointment assignments that will support  student equity and our institutional values. 

Starting with the spring/summer/fall 2021 registration  process, registration appointments will be assigned based on credit  earned as a matriculated student at U-M, or at an accredited institution  of higher education and accepted as transfer credit. This applies to  undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in a degree-seeking program  on the Ann Arbor campus. 

College credit earned through tests taken before  matriculation, such as Advanced Placement and International  Baccalaureate exams, and tests such as ACT, SAT, AVL, CLEP, and IMAT,  will not be counted for registration priority purposes. The change  ensures that U-M students who attended high schools with few or no  opportunities to earn test credit will not be at a disadvantage in  appointment assignments. 

Credit earned before matriculation will continue to satisfy course prerequisites and count toward degree completion. """,1615925330,1,0

Is it possible to get admission revoked?,"\*transfer student\*

I might be overthinking this a bit much but at the time of my application I sent a transcript which reflected a 4 credit class for this semester that I dropped roughly 2 weeks after I applied. I’m still a full time student and the 4 credit drop didn’t impact anything (didn’t impact transferable credit (I’m comfortably above the 60 credit threshold), didn’t serve as a prerequisite, was utterly useless as far as transferring goes). I got admitted around a month ago and completely forget about this until now. When I emailed the admissions office about this, informed them of the dropped class, and asked if this impacts my admissions process, they replied with “Thank you for your email and for letting us know. We will make a note of this information on your file.” Am I at risk of getting my admission revoked? I already paid my deposit.

UI/UX vs. CS,"I’ll be a Stamps student in the fall but I’m sure I want to dual degree as I would be able to combine the arts and tech. So it made sense for me to look into UI/UX at the School of Information and CS at LSA. I’m leaning towards UI/UX because I’m more interested in a design than the technical side. From what I’ve read, I can’t help but get the impression that UI/UX is regarded as “inferior” to CS and that it is seen as a joke? Please correct me if I’m wrong because I genuinely want to give it a shot but I’m kinda hesitant because of my impression of its reputation. I’m willing to put in the work so I’m wondering how far a degree in UI/UX can carry me in terms of career prospects, earnings, job stability and the like post-graduation. 

If anyone has had experience with the two or one of them, what types of students are these programs a good fit for? Also, is it tough to declare a dual degree once admitted as a first-year? Would I have to apply for cross campus transfer if I want to tack on a UI/UX major but I still plan on remaining a Stamps student? Sorry, just a bit of confusion on how declaring dual degree would work.",1615874054,1,0

UMich vs UIUC CS,"Hello! I'm currently debating between CS at UMich and UIUC in the engineering schools and was hoping for some insight from current students. This question has probably been answered before, but I had a few concerns surrounding course availability and double majoring that I hoped could be addressed. So far, I've noticed a couple of differentiating factors: 

* I want to either double major/minor in business or do a pre-med track and I know that both schools have different policies for how you can apply to study either one. UMich seems more flexible compared to UIUC, but the admissions committee said that UIUC lets you double major easily as well. UMich is also more well-known for most subjects outside of engineering. Ultimately, I want to pursue something in healthcare tech, so I want to go to a college that fits that goal best.
* I've heard that at UMich, it's difficult to get the classes you want in CS because the major isn't capped so many people try to sign up. Since the major is capped at UIUC, it's easier to get the CS courses you want there. I do have AP credits though (5 in APCS, 4 in Calc BC, 5s in Economics, 5s in Bio and Chem, 4's in US and World History) so I'm hoping that makes the process easier. 
* Luckily for me, the cost isn't an issue, but I would prefer the cheaper option (UIUC) if the academic opportunities at both schools are the same/similar enough.

Do you have any input on these considerations and which college I should choose?",1615860850,1,0

## Give UM Staff Well-being Breaks

 As University of Michigan-Ann Arbor staff and allies, we are disappointed that the administration chose to exclude us from the February 24th and March 23rd “well-being breaks.” Staff are not immune to the pandemic-related stress being experienced across the UM community, and the decision to direct staff to keep the University running in the absence of faculty and students sends the message that the University does not value our well-being. We call on the UM administration to extend the second well-being day, March 23rd, to include all staff or in its place provide all staff with two days off to use when is most appropriate for them.

Alumni: Seeking 1-2 people to interview for capstone project due tomorrow morning,"Do you have life experiences? *Of course you do!* Please tell me about them; I have 13 hours to complete this project for my capstone class.

HI UofM! My name is Brenda and I am a graduating senior and I have a capstone midterm project due at 9am EST. *I'm overwhelmed and I would love to interview you!*

The project is called ""Crowdsourcing a Launch Plan"" and I have been too busy to start it until two hours ago. This interview consists of \*adulting\* questions like:

1. What makes getting up in the morning worth it for you?
2. What have you learned throughout your career?
3. What advice would you give to a chronically stressed out college graduate like me?

*and so much more! Tell me about your failures, your dreams, and your achievements-- It's kind of like therapy, but advice!*

And if that wasn't enough to excite you to help out with this project, you get to help me! yes me! not fail this capstone project. Here are the pertinent details, taking interviews whenever someone feels bad for me and gives me one:

1. Requesting alumni of any age, preferably those with work experience
2. If you cannot help, I will also gladly take husbands, wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, parents, siblings, etc. with careers, dreams, and actual responsibilities outside of work, should you volunteer them or they also feel bad for me. Pets are also accepted to be told that they are good boys and girls.
3. Interviews are for one hour, maximum.
4. 5 participants required (I have successfully roped in mom and dad, but have no available friends because of P A N D E M I C)
5. Your information will be kept confidential and non-identifying. 
6. Interviews may be conducted via phone, FB calls, Zoom, Bluejeans, etc. Cameras are encouraged to be off-- the Zoom fatigue is real. Pets are the exception.
7. You must believe the earth is round. This is nonnegotiable.

Warning: This interview will require you to talk about failing. If that is too traumatizing due to the \*current circumstances\* (ie the world falling apart), let this serve as a warning.

Thank you all in advance! I appreciate your consideration, but even more so, your interview. I'll be up all night to take these :(",1615769116,1,0

Lost cat near Pierpont Commons,"Hey! I saw a cat next to the Pierpont Commons building about 8pm 3/14 and wondered if it’s lost.

Gen Advice + Housing 2020-21,"Hey! I'm current freshman at UM and last semester was just sad really. I lived in a dorm where we would get multiple COVID cases a day and was honestly super scared of catching it because my dad is immunocompromised. I think because of this I kinda stayed in my room all the time. Although I have a friend group, I feel like I didn't get to rlly know them cause I was scared of catching COVID (a few of them ended up catching it) and didn't hang out a lot. Now for housing next semester, I feel like I kinda screwed up because I don't rlly know who to dorm with (my roommate wanted to room with their friend group) and I feel out of place socially. A lot of the off-campus housing websites have around 10 ppl of my gender and age, so idk where to find roommates as a sophomore next semester. Any advice on what to do?

By Far the Worst Semester Ever,"It really goes without saying and I’m probably being whiny right now. But this semester in particular makes the last one look like a trip to Disneyland. 

Just had two huge midterms in my two most difficult classes (one I just found out I flunked lol) and both classes just keep piling on work constantly (before and after the exams) without the smallest disreguard. 

Having no breaks at all really makes it hard to keep my endurance up as each class hands out work without pause for week after week. At least last semester we had Thanksgiving break which was severely needed. 

There’s nothing really to look forward to anywhere. I don’t have any friends in Ann Arbor (barely any friends at all anymore lmfao) so I just spend all day in my room looking at bullshit on the internet all day and doing class work. Don’t know how to end this, but yeah. Fuck this semester",1615739363,5,0

Physics 160 material,"Hello all, not sure if this should go in the course thread, but I'll start here first. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a freshman physics major and I'm currently in Physics 160/1 and it seems pretty chaotic and a bit disorganized; there are no lectures and we have in class assignments that, so far, seem to be a bit confusing and frustrating. For example, while this is an introductory Python class as well, the first in-class coding project we received was to essentially write an algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman problem in Python, a task that seems a bit harsh towards beginners. While I understand this is likely for some reason like reinforcing problem-solving skills or to plant some intuition, it seems as though minimal topics will be covered. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm mostly concerned about 2 things: not learning very much and the difficulty of programming in the class. I know it's only a week in, but in many other classes, we're already on chapter 2 or 3 and flying through content. While I have a pretty good background in physics from HS, I'm worried that this class will kind of just prove to be frustrating and I won't learn much. I'm also taking 160 to fulfil a programming requirement (physics 160 or eecs 183 or si 106) for next semester, and I was considering going to Physics 140 and just taking EECS 183.

&amp;#x200B;

For those who have taken 160, am I just overreacting? Does it get better eventually?

Math 215 over spring/summer,"Math 215 is kicking my ass.

I have to set aside way too much time for that class, to the point where it's hurting me in other classes (Math 214 mainly). Is Math 215 offered over the spring or summer terms? I was thinking that I should drop it quickly if it is so that I don't fall too far behind in my other classes. I need it for my fall classes since it's a prereq for STAT 412, but if I can take it over spring or summer semester I could dedicate a whole lot more time to it and still get it done before fall. Is this a good idea? I have 15 credit hours right now and dropping it would put me down to 11 but I need one more humanities credit for LSA distribution and I figured I could just add a humanities mini-course.",1611508344,1,0

To Fellow Students w Financial Aid -- How Do You Pay Your Taxes?,"I have a full ride due to my financial situation but taxes every year are KILLING me. I'm also a First Gen so a lot of this stuff came as a surprise to me, and even now that I know what to expect, because of Covid I don't have the funds to pay a couple grand in taxes this year.

No one really talks about this and when I've brought it up with Financial Aid and OAMI they look at me like I'm crazy, but everything I see online says that aid that goes towards room and board or rent is taxable income. I don't really get how that's fair either, like, I've been given this money bc I have none,,,

Anyways, I hope this doesn't sound too entitled. I fully recognize that the opportunity I've been given here is amazing, and coming out only having to pay like 10k with a few student loans over my four years here isn't too bad. I just don't know how to come up with that kind of money rn. Like, can you take out loans to cover taxes? Is there anything I can do to minimize what I owe?

Social anxiety,"Hello

I’ve been struggling with social anxiety for a few years now, but it’s never been something I couldn’t handle. Since covid began, I’ve been spending most of my time along and currently live at home, not on campus. This has worsened my social anxiety incredibly. 

I find it extremely difficult to log onto my classes or club meetings each day, and I try super hard not to speak. When I do speak, my anxiety feels so strong that I have trouble putting my words together and to say something meaningful. I sound so unintelligent compared to my peers. 

When I think about returning to campus next year, I get sick. I will be living in a co-op, which I was excited for, but now I’m really really scared about the social situation there. I’m scared my social anxiety will continue to debilitate me even after I’ve returned to campus.  

I’m not going to write too much more of my symptoms because I don’t need to. I know I should get help. I’m not able to find a therapist right now as I’m living at home and simply cannot afford one.

Curious about the Well-Being of Others,"Greetings fellow Wolverines,

I know that we are in very stressful times in our academic career, and some of us are itching to head back to in-person lectures. I am sure that there are people who are struggling in an online format whether it would be drowning in non-synchronous lectures or any hardships that came with the online format. Please drop below on the comments on how you are coping with online courses so that others can draw inspiration from you.

Thoughts on EECS 281 in the spring? + dealing with imposter syndrome and self doubt,"I am planning on majoring in cs and I was taking EECS 281 this semester. However, my mental health has been seriously suffering these past few months and so I dropped the class a while ago. My mental health also started to affect me in end of last semester in EECS 280, to the point where on the first exam I scored in the 90s and on the final exam I was in the 70s. This made 281 immediately overwhelming because a lot of the topics at the end of 280 are used in 281. I’ve been struggling with imposter syndrome and questioning whether or not I am actually smart enough to be a cs major because in 281 I felt like I just had no idea what I was going and it made me seriously doubt myself. I dropped the class to help my mental health but instead I’m finding myself dreading the class and also beating myself up for dropping it in the first place and failing to learn the content well enough in 280. 

So now I’m trying to decide if I should take 281 in the spring semester or just wait to take it next fall. If I take it in the spring then I would be ready for fall internships, but I am also very intimidated by the shortened semester and heavier workload and I don’t know if I can do it. I have actually been having nightmares about the class it’s been stressing me out so much. 

So, does anyone have any experiences or advice about EECS 281 in the spring? Ways to prepare for 281? How to combat imposter syndrome and self doubt? Also, if I do end up taking 281 in the fall, do I still have a chance at getting an internship?",1614785584,4,0

From a proud alum: your feelings are valid,"Hey y'all, proud umich alum here. I can't believe it's been five years since I graduated, but here we are. Now we're more than a year into a global pandemic that's killed enough Americans to fill the Big House *five times.* I don't need to rehash how unimaginable this loss is in all of our communities, all while seeing rapid periods of social justice change, political strife, missteps by University administration, and other world-changing events.

I can't lie, this subreddit is really tough to read through some days. The varied accounts of lack of motivation, difficulty keeping up, that silly 'wellness day,' and endless work. I cannot imagine having to take classes and keep up right now. The Michigan curriculum is pressing enough as it is, but bearing the burden of the last year has surely amplified this. 

I wish I could give advice. I wish I could tell you to just suck it up and power through for a few more months. But I can't. I haven't been there. I haven't had to stay on top of classes during a pandemic. I haven't needed to attend Zoom classes all day. I haven't had to balance online class with online homework and online papers and online office hours and online *everything*. Just typing that sounds exhausting.

But I am here to tell you: **your feelings are valid.** I cannot imagine any of this. In fact, I don't think anyone outside of your position can. What you're working through is nothing short of miraculous. Please take time to recognize this. You have every right to be stressed, weakened, emptied, unmotivated, frustrated or anything else you're feeling. 

College is supposed to be the 'best years of your life.' Maybe it already has been for you. If not, I really truly hope that y'all are able to find this out first-hand soon. Michigan is a wonderful place with many wonderful people, and though I haven't been away for too long, I find myself longing for Ann Arbor throughout every day. Take time to realize what you're going through - the good and the bad. Let me know if you ever wanna chat. Your fellow wolverines are rooting hard for y'all, I promise.",1614711598,1,0
It's already mid-semester and I made a Chrome Extension!,"Hey Wolverines!

I spent too much time watching Youtube this year. So I made a chrome extension to constantly remember goals for 2021 before I type youtube.com into my browser.

This is year has been a bit bittersweet for me. Since I realized 2021 is going to be another whole year of Zoom University, everything became unproductive. I was a bit lost in my life.

My solution was regularly reminding my goals! Every morning, I read my goals out loud for 2021 and spent a few minutes checking the progress. This little practice really helped me a lot. It was a small thing but really made me stay motivated for the whole day.

As I graduate this summer, I want to finish strong and also meaningful. So my friend and I created this Chrome Extension! Yes, there are tons of extensions for new tab productivity but I wanted something simple and clean. Crazyones Tab features inspiring quotes from great entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates! Plus whenever you open a new tab, you'll be able to see new quotes as well as your goals for 2021. We designed the extension to become a source of motivation + to stay on top of your goals for 2021.

My friend and I started building this Chrome Extension as a side project and now it became the most meaningful and memorable part of my college experience. It's not perfect but I hope this helps to boost people's productivity and stop watching YouTube :)

You can find the extension here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crazyones-new-tab/noacokcfnplaajfaajhfcnmniehoddcd

This link says that math and chemistry are required.

If you scored less than a 4, or are still waiting for your score results, you are required to take the placement).""

Does this mean that if I scored 4+ and don't take the placement test, I will still be able to skip the same class as if I did take the chemistry placement test?

Additionally, what exactly is the math placement test? I have taken calc 1,2, and 3. Is it something I need to study for?

Transfer Credit Updates (?),"Hey guys! 

I applied to a program within uofm, which has prerequisite courses that you need to take to be able to apply. I took one of the courses at a local community college, and because I didn't double check that my final grades were in (my bad, I'm new at this) ordered a transcript from that college. UofM got it and put a 'T' (meaning in progress) on my transcript. 

I saw my mistake, checked that my official grades were in from my cc class, and resent my transcript. I got an email saying the university has received it, but when I checked it still shows up as a 'T'. I got that email this morning and checked now (5pm), so granted that isn't a LOT of time to update...

But still. That program checks the eligibility of the applicants 'mid-may' (whatever that means?!) so I'm a bit worried I won't get considered because of that. That's a lot of work for nothing haha.

140 Credits necessary for CS-LSA??? Somebody please tell me I'm wrong,"Ok, so I'm a prospective student planning to do CS through LSA and I've been doing some research that is hopefully wrong. 

[120 credits required to graduate, 100 of which need to be LSA courses](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/lsa-requirements/credit-requirements.html)

[CS-LSA degree needs 56 credits through these CS-LSA courses](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/cslsa_guide.pdf)

So that makes:

56 credits for CS major, 16 of which count as LSA courses and overlap with the 100 required LSA courses, 56-16+100 = 140??

looking for advices and revelations on outreach efforts searching research opportunity,"Last year this time I was admitted to urop, and later I came in with high expectation as I was thrilled by those great social science opportunities listed by mentors, and ready to start from bench work. However, later what happened left me deep trauma as someone with diagnosed anxiety disorder. I didn't do fishing, I just emailed like 6 or 7 professors as I just wanted to make sure those are what I was really passionate about so that I could write a sincere cover letter and commit unwaveringly year-long. However, neither of those received any response in several weeks (some left ignored till today) and all the response was their apology that they filled up the position. This almost ruined my first semester as this waiting induced anxiety was taking a toll on my regular coursework.                                                                                                                                       

I later dropped out the program and was grateful to find easier chances in my department semester long opportunities. However, as summer approaches I am on my own again and even as I already developed a better understanding of my academic interest and adjusted to a more reasonable expectation, I still found it extremely taxing writing outreach emails like this and feel like my summer is gonna be ruined in those anxious waiting. I knew UM is never short of research engagement from undergrads and I am extremely sorry for myself for having this intimidating feeling. Now I am looking for anyone who has relatable experience and would really appreciate if you are willing to share your journey over this or just offer some general advices. I am also willing to elicit (if any) responses from instructors on this reddit to shed light on their rationales in responding emails or selecting students.",1619997593,1,0
doomed??,"I am currently a college sophomore and this past application cycle, was accepted into umich for this coming fall 2021. I have had a difficult semester as I'm sure all of us have.

I have been retaking the chem class this Winter 2021 along with three other classes and passing this class is out of my hands at this point. Would having a W in the same course with my other 3 classes being A's-B's for this semester put me at risk for getting my acceptance taken back?

How does AP Credit (College of Engineering) work?,"Hi! I am a high school senior planning on enrolling into the College of Engineering this fall and I am so confused on how the AP Credit transfer works.

I am looking to pursue Computer Science and these are the AP credits that I will have (* indicated projected this year):

Chemistry - 4 Credits
BC Calculus - 8 Credits
Computer Science Principles - 4 Credits
*Physics C (Mechanics Only) - 5 Credits

I also have all of these but these are only listed under the LSA guidelines:

Macroeconomics - 2 Credits
Language and Composition - 3 Credits
World History - 4 Credits
US Gov and Politics - 4 Credits
*Statistics - 3 Credits
*Psychology - 4 Credits 
*Microeconomics - 2 Credits

So if I add all of these up, I am at around 43 give or take a few this year. Does this mean I am able to at least come in as an incoming sophomore? I am able to skip all of those respective classes and get credits, right?

I am just lost because I heard a rumor that only the first four classes count and the rest are a waste which would make me really upset on all that effort put. 

If someone could also help me understand how the Intellectual Breadth credits work and the first year writing requirement as well, that would be greatly appreciated!!",1619992584,1,0

Worth out of state tuition cost?,"I was accepted as an incoming freshman, but this is an out of state school for me and the tuition is frankly absurd. I would not be able to go unless without assuming a large sum of debt, and the thought of that is already burdensome. On paper, this is the best school I got into.

So, honestly, would it be worth it for me to go if it means I would have to assume a large debt? Is the college experience at this school versus another actually that much better? Are the academics?

And yes I know the academics and college experience is and would be for me excellent, but my question is: Is it worth the debt?

Campus Life/Ann Arbor,"Hey all! I got into LSA for this coming school year and I’m super pumped! I’m most likely going to be attending UMich but I had some questions about the vibe of the school. 

-How do you like Ann Arbor? Personally, I really enjoy the big city feel and so I’m wondering how “busy” it feels: is there plenty of stuff to do around campus and places to go or does it feel like you have to travel to actual downtown to get any night life? 

-How is the party scene? I’m not interested in joining a frat but I still have the “work hard, play hard” type of mentality. Are there lots of like Friday night/weekend options for a non-frat guy? Do you have any suggestions for clubs or extracurriculars to do that can help build a social network? 

-How are dorms? Decent enough quality or should I be looking into off campus housing after freshman year?

-How’s the workload in general? Do you have free time on week days?

EECS Classes Questions: EECS 498? EECS 492?,"I'm a CS minor and Computation CogSci LSA student. I'm deciding what classes to take my final semester (Fall 2021). I will be taking three classes: EECS minor elective, CogSci track requirement, and CogSci elective (I'll explain since most people aren't familiar with Computation CogSci and EECS class overlap). Here are my options:

* EECS minor elective: 100% taking EECS 485
* CogSci track requirement: Can either take CogSci 445 (I hear it's pretty easy) or EECS 492 (I've heard mixed reviews on the quality and difficulty)
* CogSci elective: Will either take EECS 498: (Special topics course- Conversational AI-Principles and Practice of Virtual Assistant AI), or I will take an easier class (SI elective).

I don't know anyone who has taken EECS 498, or that topic course specifically. I really want to take the course, but I don't know how the workload would be with possibly 2 other EECS courses (492 and 485).

My main questions are for those of you who have taken EECS 492 or that 498 topic course: What were your experiences with the course/what would be your recommendations?

If EECS 498 is a really good class, would it be too much to take it with 492 and 485? Should I take CogSci 445 instead of EECS 492, if I take EECS 498?

In general, how good are the profs at Umich or is it just a mixed bag like basically every other uni? 

How good/helpful is the careers department in helping you get internships and would you say being in cali is a massive advantage for finding internships and jobs in tech? 

Are the reputations of either school significant when applying for jobs and if so which school has the better rep? 

How easy is it to make friends and are there school events, parties etc. to help with socialising? Also what is there to do in general off campus? 

How good and affordable is the food in the area and also what’s the quality and variety of food in the dining halls like?

What is public transportation like? If staying off campus would I need a car to get around? 

I’ve grown up in a semi arid climate( hot and dry for much of the year with mil) so going to ucsd wouldn’t be too different from what i’m used to. I’ve read that long cold dark winters like in ann arbour can cause seasonal depression. So have any of you lived in such places and if so how badly does the weather affect you and do you think it should be an important factor to consider when deciding on uni?

"UMich College Of Engineering, Major availability.","Just got into UMich College of Engineering which I'm super happy about. It's my first choice at the moment. I want to Declare a CS major, however, I've heard that some people in UMich can't get the electives or even the major they want because of too many applicants. 

I'm probably choosing between CS at UCSD where I'd be getting a guaranteed admit to a CS program or UMich where I'm only getting into the College Of Engineering and I'm not sure if I'll get into CS. 

Is the risk too high? One Quora Post from a UMich CS grad said it was pretty easy to get CS once you got into the College of Engineering, however, I also read an article from The Michigan Daily  about how it can be hard to get the upper level CS classes that you want. Given that the article from the school is more recent I'm concerned that I might not get the classes or even the degree I would prefer once I've committed. 

I've read the basic requirements of how I need to maintain a 2.0 or higher in some entry level classes such as Calculus, Physics and Chemistry. I'm confident I can meet those requirements since I've done well (all 5s) in AP Calc, Phys, Chem and CSA but I don't want to risk going to a school and then not getting my first choice major. 

Could someone tell me whether it's safe to go for UMich College of Engineering? It's my first choice given the schools I've currently gotten accepted to, however, if there's issues with not being able to get the classes you want to the point where it would impact my education, I'll probably go with the safer choices.

SMTD + LSA dual degree?,"Hi everyone!

However, I was recently thinking about it and was wondering if it would be possible to do both microbiology and MT at Michigan?

UMich vs CMU MechE,"Hi there! I just got into UMich and CMU and I'm planning to study mechanical engineering. I'm having a lot of trouble deciding, so I have a few questions y'all might be able to help me with:

1. One of the biggest differences between UMich and CMU seems to be their size - is getting classes you want really difficult? Is it still possible to talk to professors/get involved with research, or does that just not happen if the classes are too big? Is it harder to make good friends at a big school?
2. What's the workload like?
3. I heard MechE is super unbalanced in terms of gender.. have any women in STEM found this to be a problem?

Overall, I think I'm leaning towards UMich rn because the academics are great and I love the big sports/school spirit vibe (I play basketball so I'm really into that) but I'm kinda hesitant about the size of the school. Would love some advice! Thanks in advance!",1617389516,1,0

So, as some advice for many of you applying to grad schools later in your academic career, don’t place all your eggs in one basket, reach out to more schools earlier in their cycle, and apply as soon as you can so there is more room in admission classes! Also, Having more extracurriculars than your supposed competitors also is a MAJOR factor, as I was someone without them due to covid and financial capability.

What is the optimal way to transfer to the computer science major of the University of Michigan Ann Abor?,"Hello, I am an international student from South Korea, and I am quite confused about how to transfer to the computer science major of the University of Michigan Ann Abor. I have graduated from high school 7 years ago and have attended medical school for some years and then went to the military for 2 years. I dropped out of medical school last year, and I am currently enrolled in California community college. I am interested in transferring to UMich, but I have some questions.

1) Is transferring to UMich much easier from community colleges in Michigan than community colleges in other states like California?

2) If I apply to one of the majors in LSA, am I applying to the college itself or the major? I am interested in majoring in computer science, and in this case, should I apply to the computer science major in LSA or LSA itself?

3) If I am accepted to LSA instead of a computer science major, can I declare cs after being accepted to UMich LSA? Is it hard to declare cs in LSA?

4) I have not taken SAT or ACT before. Will I need this to transfer to UMich? 

5) Can I transfer to UMich with only 30 credits? I am taking 25 credits this semester, and I think I can manage to get straight A's. But I am worried I might be at a disadvantage because I am from California community college. If I am dead set on attending UMich, should I transfer to community colleges at UMich?

6) Are there any sites with statistics on transfer?

LSA to Ross internal transfer?,"Hey guys, I’m a high school senior and I’ve been waitlisted by UMich. Currently I have applied to LSA; however, I intend to pursue business at Ross if I get in from the waitlist.

From what I have read, it is possible to transfer into Ross after the first year at LSA. However, it is not an easy process and spots are limited. Could some of you please shed some light on this and share what the current situation for internal transfers (LSA to Ross) is like.

I intend to pursue Finance and I have a few other options as of now. However, UMich would be my first choice and I would heavily consider picking it if there are chances of getting into Ross from LSA as a transfer during sophomore year.

Is it true that only 125 spots are reserved for LSA to Ross transfers? Besides, what would the average applicant’s GPA/profile be like?

As of now I’m on the waitlist for Notre Dame (Mendoza), UCLA and UNC as well. However, I’m really inclined towards picking UMich as long as my chances of making it into Ross are decent.

Fall 21 Admitted Grad Student Questions,"Hello. I've been accepted for the movement science (kinesiology) master's programme at U-M, which will commence this coming fall! I'm feeling absolutely ecstatic, especially since this will be my first time studying in the US. But that also means I'm not very aware of the university life/culture here...

So, I had a few questions in mind that I hoped can be answered here:

1. Orientation - Will there be some kind of ""orientation"" week for the postgraduate students? Because we have ""fresher's week"" for first years in the UK, but they weren't really intended for the master's/doctorate students. Is it the same here? If the latter, are you supposed to just figure things out on your own?
2. Commencement preparation - Slightly relating to Q. 1, I think I've seen somewhere that the official start date for U-M this year's fall will be 31 Aug: how much earlier do grad students typically return back to U-M? Is there anything going on that I should be aware of/preparing for before this date?
3. Undergraduate vs postgraduate workload - What are your opinions on the workload shift from bachelor's to master's (specifically MVS MS)? For comparison, I had 6 modules in my final year of BSc, which consisted of a practical project, library project, a couple of in-course assessments (PPT/poster presentations etc.) 4 final exams and \~250 hrs total of lectures/tutorials/workshops in total.
4. Social life as a grad student - I'm not really a hard party-goer, but I do like having a casual pint at pubs or going out to bars/clubs from time to time. What's the social life like for grad students (in normal cases as well, since the lockdowns seem to be easing)? Do grad students join in with undergrads when socialising/partying etc.? Because I always hung out with grads when I was an undergrad. Also, does U-M have a union/university bar that all students go to? By the looks of it on this subreddit, everyone seems to go to independent pubs/bars in Ann Arbor.
5. Sports societies/clubs - I was an avid fencer, but I'm interested in trying out other sports like climbing, triathlon and shooting. Can grads join these clubs as well, or is it typically just for undergrads? Also, are beginners allowed to join?
6. Weather - What are the weather conditions like in Ann Arbor during the fall/winter? In the UK, it's typically quite warm in early Sept with 68F highs/52F lows, then it goes down to 48F highs/38F lows in Dec/Jan/Feb, and starts to rise back up in Mar.
7. Textbooks - Are textbooks necessary (especially for MVS MS) at grad level? I bought 3 textbooks for my bachelor's and I think I've only opened them once in my life. Do you really need them at higher levels? I assume most students just go online/papers/Google Scholar etc. for more information?

Visiting Campus,"Hi everyone,

I was admitted to the College of Engineering and I plan on attending UMich this upcoming school year. I haven't been to Ann Arbor so my parents and I were planning on visiting sometime before May. 

To my understanding, there are no in-person campus tours, so when I visit I will probably be walking around campus figuring things out using a map or my phone. 

Are the campus buildings available to walk into? Like, can I just walk into the engineering buildings to see what's going on inside or is that strictly prohibited?

Sorry if that's a stupid question. I'm not really caught up with the campus rules and I'm not even sure if most of you guys are virtual or what's going on. I also don't want to drive up 10 hours and back just to observe buildings from the outside. 

Also, any tips for while I'm up there would be highly appreciated. Thank you!!",1617246030,1,0
How to make friends as a transfer?,"I’m going to be transferring in the fall to umich and I’m wondering what do y’all think is the best way to find friends? I will not be in a dorm with roommates and I’m not joining a sorority/fraternity, so those methods are ruled out. I’m thinking clubs are my only way to find friends, but if meetings are done via zoom I don’t see how you’re going to get yourself out there. I heard there is supposed to be some transfer orientation in a few months where I get to meet other transfers so maybe that will help.  Does anyone have any advice? Especially because of COVID and restrictions, I feel like a lot of things that would’ve been in person will be canceled. 

Anyways, any help would be appreciated.",1617242168,1,0

UMich CS vs UIUC Stats&amp;CS,"Hello! I am currently deciding between UIUC and UMich for cs and would appreciate some insight!

 I am out of state for both colleges, and cost is not a main factoring issue. I got into UIUC for stats&amp;cs. I have some reservations for stats&amp;cs students not getting equal opportunity or access as grainger students. I got into CS under the engineering department from Umich. From a prestige standpoint I know UMICH is known more than UIUC. I also personally liked the campus and culture of UMICH more. However UIUC for CS is amazing and I feel letting go of that would be a mistake. Ultimately I am lucky enough to choose between two great schools but still unsure :/

What is the likelihood of my acceptance being rescinded?,"I was admitted into the college of engineering this year.  I average A’s with a couple B’s scattered throughout my transcript.  This semester has been particularly difficult thought.  Right now my grade in AP Physics 1 is 76%.  First semester my teacher had never taught the class before, and did a very poor job.  She ended up leaving the school after the first semester, after leaving us 2 units behind schedule in the class.  My school couldn’t find a replacement teacher for her in time, so they moved us into an online program to learn from.  This program has also been an awful experience, as all the content has been free youtube videos and assignments with no teacher feedback.  I can also feel my AP Stats grade is also slipping.  It’s at an 83% right now.  My problem with stats is that I had to self quarantine for 2 weeks at a point where the second semester builds on a ton.  I have been trying my best, but continue to struggle.  Is this grounds for getting my acceptance rescinded?",1617207384,1,0
How does Umich look at grad school applicants with another graduate degree from an unrelated field that was taken online?,"Sorry, I know this case may be a little unusual. I'm asking here hoping someone knows anything.  


I have a BS in Computer Science from a traditional school, from which I graduated with honors. I'm now enrolled in an online program that is of personal interest to me, not related to my professional field--English &amp; Creative Writing. And after I'm finished with this master's, I'd like to apply to the School of Information at Umich, also at the master's level, to continue with my career goals.  


I'm now worried that my online degree will negatively impact my application, since the program is from SNHU, and even though that is a legit university with a physical campus and proper accreditation, I know there's a stigma surrounding it.  


Am I correct in worrying about this? Or would it be OK, since the degree is not related to the area I'd be applying to?   


There are of course other aspects to my application, which include industry work experience, community involvement, internship, scholarships, and other volunteer/extracurricular work, so I'm not only depending on my degree. I was also in communication with an admissions rep from the Information School in 2017, and even had an application waiver, but financial circumstances led me into full-time industry work after graduation. I know it's been a little over 3 years since then, though.

Do you still have to pay for a class you're auditing?,"I'm trying to see if I can audit a creative writing class Im taking for fun, but the auditing web page says "" An official audit obligates a student to attend classes regularly and complete course requirements *(e.g.,*  papers, laboratory assignments, tests, and the final examination).

"" Does this mean I still have to pay for the class, even though I'm not getting credit for it?

I'm a senior trying to be part-time and taking the class for credit would put me at full-time credits. If I have to pay for it either way then I might as well drop it, but I just wanted to make sure before I go through with it. 

Also, if you do audit a class, is it up to you and your prof to come to an agreement on how much work you're going to do for it?

WolvSec - A Cybersecurity Club and CTF Team,"Hello everyone!

WolvSec is a cybersecurity/hacking club here at Michigan. We host weekly public meetings where we discuss current topics and teach foundational skills related to cybersecurity. The club is comprised of undergrads, graduate students, alumni, university staff, and local industry professionals who are all focused on creating a collaborative, friendly learning environment for cybersecurity. We accomplish this by teaching each other topics, skills, and tools for cybersecurity at our meetings or on our Discord. We also compete nearly every weekend in the [Capture The Flag (CTF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security) competitions.

The club is open to anyone associated with the University of Michigan, although it does help to have a programming background and an interest in cybersecurity. Our meetings take place every Monday at 6:30pm EST. The main meetings are where we have our bootcamp sessions where we teach a particular topic, have guest speakers, or discuss recent events. We also have a more casual meeting on Tuesday at 11:30am where we do tool demos and go over solutions to recent challenges. We are pretty lax, to be a member you simply just have to attend some of our meetings. There is no requirement to compete in CTFs with us (but if you are a security savant please do). We have many members who just hop on and try a handful of challenges in the CTFs at their leisure or attend a meeting that fits their interests. 

This Monday (01/25) will be an introduction to the club and discuss what to expect over the semester. You can find out more about the club mainly from our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8CxTang8) and our [website](https://wolvsec.org).",1611250405,1,0

I don't miss sitting on the floor in the BBB for office hours,"I have to say one thing I do not miss about in person classes at all is the EECS office hours experience: spending 30 minutes searching for an open table in the BBB only to find that there is no outlet in reach and your laptop is dead and realizing that you, at 22 years old, have to sit criss cross applesauce on the floor.

Is no one else incredibly annoyed by this??

I don't understand how the college of engineering hasn't been able to solve this recurring problem. Where the fuck are my tuition dollars going? There are never enough tables or chairs in either BB1695 or the BBB atrium, where most office hours take place. If this was a space issue, then why are they wasting space on ping pong/fuse ball tables? And then if there's a career fair/recruiting event/class showcase/whatever, they put that in the BBB atrium so office hours for like 6 classes all have to take place in one computer lab. Also, whose idea was it to put like four electrical outlets in the entire fucking COMPUTER SCIENCE building???? I'm not even going to get started on EECS376 office hours because anyone even tangentially related to the CS department already knows how fucked those are. 

This is not at all a complaint against the IA/GSIs running office hours! I have always had good experiences with the instruction and help I've received in office hours, I'm just irritated that the school doesn't give a shit.",1611113441,1,0

What are the stupidest politically correct statements you've heard students say?," There is a stereotype that university kids have dumb political opinions and this thread does nothing to dispel it. 


Now, I was an EMU student but several of the below anecdotes involve UofM kids because I attended UofM clubs before. 


**Black Lives Matter slogan bickering**

Went to Kings of Color meeting in 2018. They'd meet once a month and this was their last meeting of the year. They were talking about groups that use slogans likes ""Trans Lives Matter"" and ""Hispanic Lives Matter"" and disliked how they'd stolen the slogan. 

If your activist group meets once a month, and won't meet again for another 4 months, there's probably more important things to focus on than who's borrowing your slogan. You know, like police killings, poverty, racism. No, that's not important, you keep complaining about people borrowing your slogan!

I was the only white guy there so, I'd look very bad for speaking up and saying ""This is fucking stupid!""

**Black History Month origin**

A comment I've heard from white students: ""black history month is February because it's the shortest month and whites, in order to appease blacks, gave them that month.""

Yea. Sure. It isnt because February has HISTORIC reasons to be symbolic. 

It is February because originally, Black History Week commemorated the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, because their birthdays were close to each other. The commemorative week was expanded into a month in the 1960s.

I mean, if you actually care about black history you'd wanna know why February is relative to history, right?

""iT iS fEbRuArY bEcAuSe RaYcIsM"" oh shut the fuck up neckbeard, you're a walking stereotype of college kids. 

**Thanksgiving never happened**

There never was a thanksgiving dinner between the pilgrims and Indians, thats just propaganda!

**No regulations on abortion are needed**

Granted, there's some credibility to the argument that regulations on abortion are a stepping stone to criminalizing it. But some regulations are needed. 

For example: some states require abortion providers ask if a girl is being pressured into this by her lover. 

That's a sensible regulation!

I said I agree with this once and a girl responded with ""then if a girl gets breast implants, why don't doctors ask if she's being pressured into it by a boyfriend?""

WHAT. THE. FUCK. Because tiny tits don't keep me locked down to providing for a little shithead for 18 years you dense motherfucker! (And doctors actually are required to inform women of the dangers of implants anyway)

Philosophy was only taken for a SS or HU requirement (can’t remember which), and has nothing to do with my intended major. Should I P/F to get a better GPA or would that look sus to potential future grad schools? TIA!",1620842010,1,0

Needing input from current transfer students to help make a questionnaire for transfers!!,"Hi, Lissette from LSA Student Government, aiming to make two separate small guides for incoming transfers and non-traditional students

So to create the Transfer Student guide, I decided to, rather than just use my own knowledge of being a transfer / nontraditional student, throw out a questionnaire for transfer students (and later one for non traditional students). The questionnaire  has a bunch of questions answer whatever questions you wish! You do not need to answer all of them.

[Here is the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLyM_yPLLYRmpjVTMM9A29sBBHxL-4tOa7acP8QWf58drunQ/viewform)

If you want to be credited, put in your name.

This form will be open for two weeks so you have until the end of May 31st, 2021 to answer this questionnaire.

Thank you!",1620835344,1,0

Summer classes at CC,"I’m going to be a freshman at UMich next year and I’m looking to take some summer courses to get requirements out of the way. Are there any classes that current students would recommend getting out of the way? I’ve heard to take calc (although I’m not sure about calc 1 or calc 2) and econ, but I was wondering which other classes I should consider.

For more background, I’ll be at the Ross school of business and I’m considering doing the dual program with business and cs. Thanks in advance!!",1620786413,1,0
