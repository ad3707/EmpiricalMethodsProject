"Speak to an attorney Monday about the situation, most will give you a phone consultation over the phone without charge.  Do not open the app and do not talk to anyone about facts until you have spoken to an attorney.  The attorneys I am friends with locally are juvenile public defenders or tax attorneys but do have an attorney handling a civil matter for us up in Powell, think he is an OSU grad and young and very friendly.  PM me and I will give you his number. Alternatively contact the student legal services but I don't know if they get involved in these matters.

Even if an attorney costs you a few hundred that pales in comparison to the cost failing a class or expulsion.

Having said that, relax a bit.  The evidence as you present it is circumstantial and you have not actively communicated with the perpetrators.

"Yup the University tells departments a total percent they can spend on raises (was 2%, past two years it's been 2.5%).  They then distribute it as they see fit. I've been told it's an average of the percent not the money (so your salary doesn't matter just the percent raise).   Equity adjustments, bonuses, etc don't factor into this.

So if your dept does merit raises, (let's say they rate bad, good, great and great gets 1% extra) and you get a ""good"" rating you may only get 1.5% because they need to makeup the extra money they are giving the ""great"" (who get 2.5%)ratings.  

Another example would be in a dept of two employees with no merit raises.  If someone takes on extra responsibility and is low paid they may try to give them a boost with 3% raise, well the other person has to take a 1% raise to make the average 2%.  Lastly,  the University says CCS and AP have to be the same/close.",1599964396,1,0

Hopefully physical distancing, mask wearing, and quarantining continues to work. But I don't think you can *just* look at the positive cumulative rate and make the definitive statement ""this works so well that we are unlikely to be sent home before the semester ends.""

At the time OSU admissions process was much different. Up until the early 90s if you had a high school diploma from Ohio you were guaranteed to get into the main campus at OSU. OSU anticipated the enrollment would eventually surpass the capacity of the central campus.

"I have read some articles (and posts here) on the best sequence of science classes.  Many in education believe it is better to take physics first because you can understand the chem material better rather than just memorize.  The challenge in HS education is most 9th and 10th graders do not have the math skills for physics yet so chem generally is thought first. Do you have a physics 1 yet?  


My youngest (10th) is taking calc 1151 and physics 1250 at CState SP21 with plans for Chem 1210 FA21 or SP22.  All are fully transferable to OSU. The only issue with you taking it at CState is I don‚Äôt beleive you can then use grade forgiveness with it.  Maybe you can if taken at a OSU regional as another suggested.

I gave a real number (on which I made a typo and have edited the original comment) because I *have* done the research and been thinking about this issue all semester. You can check OSU's credit report, made public by them on their own website, at [***this link right here***](https://busfin.osu.edu/sites/default/files/moodys_credit_report_osu_series_2020_a_jun_2020.pdf), which you probably would have found if you had done any amount of (re)searching before falsely accusing people of not knowing what they're talking about. The relevant info on cash &amp; investment reserves is on p. 3

again i ask: how much do you think the average student has? who will be more negatively impacted by a few hundred dollars in fees each semester, the multi-billion-dollar corporatized university, or the student who struggles to make rent during the best of times and whose job has probably been impacted by the pandemic?

"No, not really. This might sound like a Karen wants to see the manager moment to most of you, but that's because you guys have it easy. 

When I came here as an international student 12 years ago, we sold our family property and land to fund my education.  I paid at least double the tuition that my classmates did because internationals pay full frieght (which in turn is used to subsidize the natives).  I didn't have access to cheap government loans - I was paying 11% interest from day 1, and bill collectors in the 3rd world are, let's say, more insistent about getting paid.  My student visa was subject to me being actively enrolled in full time courses or I'd be asked to leave the country if courses were cancelled. ICE literally asked all online students to leave the country a few months ago if they weren't enrolled in in person classes - you can Google that news.  I didn't have access to part time jobs because the visa doesn't allow employment outside the campus and all on campus jobs were taken before I even landed in the country. I didn't have the social connections and daddy's golf buddies to help me get internships - I literally didn't know a single person IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.  And I had (have) a foreign sounding name, so 90% of recruiters did not even bother to read my resume.   

On top of all this if a professor decides to just pocket my tuition fee and walk away coz he got the boo-boos and the university lets him do it without compensating me, then yes, I will see them in court...not that I could afford a lawyer back then, but I am married to one now.",1606244295,1,0

"As someone in Daryl's class right now:

1. He's a really good dude. Cares about his students and is actually very knowledgeable in stats. He expects a certain level of professionalism but is quite accommodating when you show you're trying.
2. Class format: He gives you a list of video lectures for each week and one or two tophat questions corresponding to each lecture. Each vid is 15-25 minutes. 2 midterms and a final. He also gives you both a blank and annotated copy of his slides for you to use (i fill in the blank copy as I watch). He'll break textbook chapters down into a few parts, but each chapter is probably 4 or 5 lectures. There are carmen discussion boards for you to ask questions about homework/tophat to not only teachers, but students too. Homework is \~2 hours long, typically weekly and (sorry about this) on Webassign.
3. Class material: If you've ever taken any kind of stats class before, you'll be fairly comfortable except for a couple of chapters of new material. Otherwise, it's something you'll need to study for but is 100% doable. You said you're a math major so (assuming you're *good* at math) I wouldn't stress.

If you accept that there's a limited amount of time and that your animations won't be perfect, it's not that bad. You grade yourself for assignments.

\-flipbook assignment

\-pixellation (stop motion animation with a real person)

\-found object stop motion

\-bouncing ball assignment

\-walk cycle assignment

For the flipbook, pixellation, found object assignment, and the final project, you can animate what you want (as long as its feasible to do and is using the concepts you learn about).

&amp;#x200B;

For the bouncing ball and the walk cycle, you have to animate a bouncing ball and a walk cycle.

"Yeah, like I said it's not that important if you don't know Java going in. I took 1222 (the C++ course) before I took Software I and didn't have too much trouble picking up on the basics of Java, syntax-wise Java and C++ are similar. I remember that I thought some of the first few labs were a bit overwhelming due to not knowing some Java keywords/syntax, but if you take just 30-60 minutes the first week to figure out what's going on then you'll be fine. Again if you're already familiar with C++ you should be able to pretty easily pick up on the bits of Java you need to know throughout the first few weeks.

Usually you're given about a week to work on projects. Projects 4, 5, and 10 are some of the harder/longer ones imo so be especially sure that you start those early. Usually you'll have at least one homework per week, but sometimes you'll have maybe 2 or 3.

No it just induces a lot of stress in students and massive grading curves; But the student at the end of the day decided to attend OSU and all the information(about getting into the mechmajor) can be find online.

"&gt;If you‚Äôre not at risk, and don‚Äôt plan on being around anyone that‚Äôs high risk 

That's not how this works though. So let's say you yourself are not at risk and you have no intention of being around anyone at risk, you can still spread to people who are high risk.

Let's say you get covid and are asymptomatic or having low symptoms. You go to McDonalds for a burger and, right before you open the door your nose itches and you scratch it. You now have germs on your hand, which you use to open the door. Now the handle is infected. A few minutes later a person comes behind you, they touch the handle and scratch their eye. They are now infected. They go home and give it to their partner, who gives it to others, and so on. At the end of the chain it is likely someone, probably someone old or sick will die, and you will be the link in the chain that is responsible for that person's death.

The only way to ensure that you aren't going to spread the virus to someone at risk is to quarantine. It's not about you living in fear, it's about having the decency to care enough that those who are fearful (the vulnerable) don't have to be.",1609370448,1,0

 Lobbying like this may not make a difference for this term, but showing the drive and the tenacity can make the difference in the next round.  Build the relationships and keep at it.

High school GPA is also an absolutely terrible predictor for college success. The work is entirely different and - most importantly - the environment is completely different.

"I'm a bit torn on the issue, but here's my current thought process: sure, they had ""all summer"" to plan these online courses (assuming, of course, the professors *did* spend all summer working on this -- never underestimate procrastination). That summer planning, though, is not the same as the years of work that goes into refining an in-person class. If we put the level of prep on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is a brand new professor with brand new material and a 10 is an experienced professor in a well-established class, I'd put this somewhere around a 5. This varies depending on the nature of the coursework and how compatible it is online. 

&amp;#x200B;

This would, in part, explain why the Engineering department might be pretty split on the issue. On one hand, p/np acknowledges that the classes are different, whether we want to admit it or not. Some people don't learn as well this way (and taking gap semesters/years is not an option for everyone), professors may not be as skilled in this method of instruction, and the coursework may not be as compatible online as in-person. On the other hand, p/np punishes high achieving students for doing well on difficult courses when they could/should have just p/np'd all of them this and last semester.

I know this is hard to hear (it was for me for a long time I get it) and I know blaming OSU feels good, but it will get you nowhere in terms of feeling better.

If you‚Äôre leaving your house once a week and staying up until 3-4 to work on things for many weeks at a time, you have a bigger problem on your hand than something that is just a side effect to OSU‚Äôs covid response. You are letting your anxiety take control and choosing to run yourself ragged to finish assignments instead of taking breaks and making time for yourself. Then because you‚Äôre so stressed you do a shitty job on assignments/they take longer to finish and thus the cycle continues. 

Like I‚Äôm giving it to you straight because I used to do this shit when I was starting out at OSU and it did me very very bad. I‚Äôm sorry but someone needs to tell you guys how it is because there‚Äôs 5 posts like this here everyday. And I would rather you not actually fail your classes.

Consider dropping a class or two, consider re-evaluating how long it will take to obtain your degree (which is totally okay! A lot of people take longer, me included, and I‚Äôm so happy I did.)

I finally want to say that taking responsibility for your actions does not mean I‚Äôm advocating for self-blame or self-loathing, you‚Äôre probably doing a ton of that already honestly.

Rant: I don‚Äôt know where the perception that 1152 is significantly easier than 1172 comes from.

"I‚Äôm praying that you‚Äôll be able to make it through this season. Seriously, I know they tell you school doesn‚Äôt last forever, but it sure feels like it in the moment. And this year‚Äîyikes. It‚Äôs nightmarish in how alone it‚Äôs making everyone feel. I also have a tough job that doesn‚Äôt fit my schedule right now. But I‚Äôm negotiating with them about times so I can sort out my priorities. If you can‚Äôt change your hours, you need to find a new job. Just send out your resume everywhere and anywhere. The pharmacy CBO often has laid back jobs for students, though I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre hiring due to covid. Harvest pizza typically has flexible hours and there are multiple locations to apply to. A lot of food and grocery places are hiring right now.
Additionally, it helps if I chart out all of the things I need to get done on a big calendar or on google calendar while it‚Äôs linked to my phone. Set alarms ANYTIME you take a nap or go to bed so you don‚Äôt miss important assignments. I know a lot of people don‚Äôt like reading, but I found I get a lot of motivation if I go to a local library (worthington‚Äôs just opened and it‚Äôs nice) and I literally just browse all of the books that look interesting. I‚Äôll walk out of there with books on cookies, nuclear fallout, poetry, and submarine accidents because they all looked like interesting topics.

Finally, I‚Äôve found that having a close group of friends is key. However, that was hard for me to find when I was on campus‚Äîso I joined a small collegiate church group. You could totally get involved with Cru or H2O‚Äîbut I actually was a part of a church called Lifepoint. They meet at their campus in Lewis Center and are much more tight-knit than some of the others I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôm close friends with a number of their members and the college pastor personally. His name is Buzz. These types of friend are like a therapy session and your party mates all wrapped into one. It seemed to help me with my mental health, especially when it got cold out.

The switch from high school to college first semester is a challenge. Please don't be too hard on yourself!

Know what you want to ask about, maybe even have a list of questions or topics you want to cover.

I believe that's all of them I might have missed one.

Your next step is to hound your advisor and see what kind of exceptions could be made. You might even ask your advisor if there's someone higher up the chain that you could contact.

"Hey! I'm in Aero and I had a really wonky path to getting accepted into the program, so I know a little bit about the process.


From my knowledge, MAE literally looks at NOTHING other than your EPHR. As in no special circumstances, or exceptions. I kind of doubt that your 4.0 will affect whether or not a late application is accepted, I'd be willing to bet that it's entirely dependent on the reason that you provided.


That being said, if your EPHR is 4.0 you know that you're guaranteed in. So what we're sitting here wondering is if they'll accept your late application. Did your advisor say anything about the chances of your late application being accepted?


If I were in your shoes I would be emailing my advisor at least once a week to see the status.


Finally, start thinking about worst case scenario. In an absolute worst case scenario, you're not accepted this semester, but with a 4.0 you'll be guaranteed next year. So now the question is do you have enough GE's in order to maintain full-time status for the next year? If not, do you take a leave of absence/get a job for a year?

Looking at this article it seems they would tell you if there was a discrepancy that would reject your request And you could address it.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wksu.org/government-politics/2020-09-30/eye-on-ohio-what-ohios-primary-absentee-ballot-voting-could-mean-for-the-general-eleciton%3f_amp=true

If you still don‚Äôt receive updates or a ballot, you can still vote in person before the election without bringing a blank ballot. Note, you can only do this for early voting for it to count as absentee. If you wait until Election Day, that would be a provisional ballot and would be counted much later.
