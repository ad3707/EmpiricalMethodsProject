"There aren’t a ton right next to the school. To the south there’s a 24/7 place on 109th that’s fine if you don’t mind stretching your legs (and if you’re pulling a late study session a short walk and fresh air might be a good idea anyways). To the north there’s plenty of places open late once you get past like 123rd or so, so if you’re studying in Noco or Barnard those might be better. 

Other non-bodega places include:

* Westside Market, which is also 24/7, but like the other person said I’m sure if they serve coffee all night. 

* Nuss is open until 10 or 11 I believe and serves coffee. 

* Tom’s is open until 10 and can do coffee to go. 

* Hex N Co is open until 11 on weekdays and midnight on the weekends and serves coffee, although they might have a policy about only serving guests. I also know that they close their kitchen at some point, but I’m not sure if that includes coffee. 

* Hmart sells fresh brewed coffee in that tucked away partition behind the registers. 

They aren’t consistently located, but food carts are also usually around pretty late and will definitely have the best prices. I know some people think it’s worse, but it’s literally the exact same batch brew that everywhere else is serving you unless you’re paying for a speciality pourover or espresso drink. Some people also think that food cart coffee isn’t as safe, but you gotta remember that they’re serving hundreds if not thousands of cups of coffee every single day, if it was contaminated or unhygienic they would get shut down in a (literal) New York Minute. They’re subject to the same food safety laws as everyone else, and NYC doesn’t play around if there’s a cluster/outbreak of food poisoning in an area.",1633554016,2,0

"For the longest time, I felt the same way as you did.

Generally, the best industries for growth and earnings are anything in tech and healthcare. I think healthcare beats tech, but both are very good. Whenever someone mentions ""a career in healthcare"" they automatically think medical school/doctor, however, there are many other choices. If healthcare is something you're interested in, I'd highly recommend looking into a physican's assistant program. I know, it's not as glorious and prestigious as being an MD, but it's an excellent job with great earnings and job security.

The other option is tech, which obviously means something in CS or math. Try looking up basic CS and coding concepts and see if you like it. Data science is a great field as well.

Econ is great as well, but be careful about the banking industry.",1633532503,1,0
"Why would anyone regret going?  If you took even 1 year off after high school then you are flat out ineligible for CC, so if you have any desire to attend Columbia then it’s SEAS or GS.

It’s almost the same as CC except there’s a bit more flexibility in the core and you don’t have as much hand holding.  Also, tuition is billed per credit hour rather than a flat fee for the semester, so you can choose to take 12 credits versus overloading yourself with, say, 18 credits like a lot of kids do.

As far as rigor: the courses are not segregated by school, so the rigor is the same.  For example, when you register for Calc 3 you will be in class with CC, SEAS, and GS students (and possibly even grad students).",1633531662,8,0

It is VERY academically rigorous. You are sitting in the same classes with people who come from elite academic backgrounds. Be prepared to work 3x as hard as them to be average. I almost killed myself to get an A in a Precalc class this summer but your mileage may vary. I don’t regret going, it’s an opportunity of a lifetime for someone with my background (almost failed out of high school, very mediocre college performance). Columbia will give you the chance if you make a compelling argument for yourself. That being said, you better be damn sure you wanna do what you think you wanna do because the time and effort you need to put in is enormous and if your reason “why” isn’t good enough, it’ll crumble.

There's not really an average GS'er.  Statistically there has to be a mean age, but GS is so diverse that I think to say the average age is 25, or whatever it is, doesn't provide a good representation.",1633528749,3,0
"I love it!  I honestly wouldn't change it for the world.  While you are still taking all of the same classes the other undergraduate schools are taking, I feel there is a big sense of camaraderie within GS because we have had a different life path that brought us here (whether were coming from CC, took a gap year or a few, getting a dual degree etc) and whenever I am in class and find another GSer its almost a relief.

"What about econ do you like? Is it that it can give you a variety of options, many of which pay well, for your career? Do you like the actual material? (and tangentially, how far into the curriculum in both fields are you? There’s a big difference between principles and higher level classes and I assume the same is true for pre med ) Same questions re: pre-med. 

Both options are more than capable of giving you a good salary, so the decision should be based on which you like more. If you like both or feel that there’s a serious chance you won’t go to med school and want to hedge your bets a bit, doing both is fine. If you’re super concerned about the workload, there’s always the option to get a minor/concentration in econ.

I was also kind of waffling between econ (research and grad school) and something in math/stats (probably actuary). I majored in both and didn’t make a decision between the two until the end of senior year. It’s ok to be indecisive now. Better to be indecisive and have to do more work now than to shoehorn yourself into something that you may regret in 2 years. I picked econ, am currently doing research at the Fed before applying to PhD programs in a couple years, and have absolutely no regrets. I probably gave up a bit of money in the 8-10 years post-undergrad, but I’m much happier here.",1633524438,1,0

"The tradeoff between a medical practitioner and an economist, in terms of long term pay and a more fulfilling career, is surely on the side going to med school. But that is assuming many things will line up to your favor, like consistently good grades, a decent med school, a better residency, ability to secure cheap financing. Those variables will determine whether you'd be better off in the future if you go to med-school compared to doing your next two years and getting out and about with a career in economics. I'm a person who values risk-aversion, and in that spirit, I believe that econ, shall you do well in it, would be a great dividend payer. Make sure you get solid grades though, if you're looking for a good job placement in the city.

"Hallucinogens are not used (at high doses) with the same frequency as SSRIs. Also--although the two drugs effect the same receptors, it is not at all clear whether they share a common curative mechanism. That is, someone wouldn't be dropping acid every day to hit the same receptors as Prozac - occasional or even one-time doses might be effective, or a less psychoactive derivative may be used.

In my experience, I've seen people burn themselves out using hallucinogens daily/weekly but have also known others to have had extraordinarily productive experiences while under the influence. Similarly, I've known people for whom SSRIs have been productive and others who have felt only apathy, numbness + vague dissatisfaction with their lives while on them.

While I think SSRIs are certainly useful in the right circumstances, many exaggerated claims have been made regarding their status as ""miracle cures"" or ""magic bullets"" for depression/anxiety/etc. while the actual cause + extent of their effectiveness remains unknown in many ways. I'm sure many of the present claims surrounding hallucinogens are similar, but making an informed decision re: what you decide to put into your brain is never a bad choice.

If you're interested, you might take a look at the studies listed by Columbia Psychiatry - I recall seeing some trials using novel treatments as of late: [https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/join-study](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/join-study)",1636678831,1,0

"I wanted to ask weather HCI degree holders can get into MBA program, but you've answered my question in detail. Thanks",1636654636,1,0
"I can't tell what you're really asking about? Getting an MBA? If so, business schools in the US don't really care what background you have coming in. One background is not valued above another. Yes, people with finance, econ, and management backgrounds do make up a big part of the applicant pool, but B-schools also try to actively attract people who work in STEM/Humanities fields. They can't take ONLY finance experts. In essence, there is not one career path or background that makes a good MBA applicant. What really matters is what you've done professionally--have you spear headed a project, managed a group of people, etc.. and do you have a desire to be involved in business decisions or running a company professionally? The admissions committees are mainly looking for your past accomplishments and recommendations as an indicator of your future potential (although this is very subjective) and for you to explain in concrete terms why an MBA would fit your career goals and get you to where you want to go. 

Also, it helps to explain why a particular B-School would be the best fit for you (e.g. NYU and Columbia specialize in sending people to work in finance and banking--makes sense since they're located less than a mile from Wall Street--and Wharton and HBS have STEM and pharmaceutical industry tracks.) Good grades and a decent GMAT/GRE score are helpful for top B-Schools. 

While MBA programs at are populated by many people who go on to work at consulting companies, the admissions' committees at least seem to try to pull from a diverse set of students who have a variety of backgrounds and interests.",1636654346,1,0

"Block out your week and revisit it weekly. I use the [unschedule](https://www.beyondbooksmart.com/executive-functioning-strategies-blog/time-management-tip-the-unschedule) method and block out dedicated study hours for each class (3ish study hours per credit hour, generally, giving more for some than others). I try to make it so I’m visiting each class daily, either in person or in studying.

Never study for more than one hour at a time without at least a 20 min break. Your brain can’t take it. 

Use the pomodoro method when studying/working. 

For studying - active recall is more effective than memorization. You need to engage with your notes and ask yourself questions and answer them. Ali Abdaal has a good [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iIyDJK_SAjs) on using Google sheets to do this. 

Use your resources - the academic resource center has tutors for several subjects, some foreign language classes have cafes to practice with other students, the writing center is helpful for papers, and of course there’s your professor’s office hours! 

Lastly, and most importantly, you really need to make sure you’re sleeping a regular schedule!! Get a routine and stick to it. All nighters do no one favors. By getting adequate sleep and nutrition you’re fueling your body for success.

For math classes, tutoring center is an excellent way to replace even the classes themselves. Between exams they are usually empty. Even if you done with homework, bring future topics to the tutoring center, it helped me better than the instructions in class.

"Are the standards not higher at certain schools than others? Cause that’s basically the conversation were having here. Yes. That’s my take. If you’re going to try and push elitism into the conversation then I’ll happily oblige. We already support a system that says people who apply to Ivy League Schools (and other top schools of course) should have higher grades than average. Is that or is that not the truth? Thus, if someone is in high school, a time where the coursework is significantly easier than college coursework, this would mean that they have higher standards than average when applying to these types of schools. I didn’t say it was my choice on how things are ran, I’m saying that thats the reality. Everybody in GS has some type of college already under there belt, whether that be community college or transferring from another university. Someone with a 3.5 from another top 10 university is more likely to get into Columbia or any top school than someone in high school with a 3.5, regardless of the fact that in all honesty, a 3.5 gpa is a great gpa.

"&gt;f you’re going to step in someone’s way or try to physically restrain them—and I did see that occur, it’s not “assault” when they continue on their way.

Nobody was physically restrained by protestors. There were police and legal observers there to monitor the protest, at every picket location, as there is at every strike picket in NYC. Not a single protestor was cited for inappropriate behavior. You absolutely did not see any violence done by picketers. Several students *were* spoken to by police for blasting their way through picket lines and refusing to go around the picket through the openings left (as is legally required) on either side of the line. You absolutely do *not* have a right to physically force your way through any picket line whatsoever, regardless of the urgency of your need to cross the line. It's illegal.

&gt;Also, even your own comment betrays exactly who the target of this protest was. It wasn’t the administration, it was the other students.

However, before the class even starts there's a vector calculus + programming homework that cuts the class down by 50-60%. The effect of this is that only the try-hards remain and this screws up the curve. Despite putting in 15+ hours a week I still ended up with a B (Kathy was shooting for class average of B+).

So here's my take. If you want to actually learn awesome stuff and be challenged while messing up your GPA, go with Kathy. Otherwise, wait until Kathy has a class and pick the non-Kathy teacher so you can compete with the people who couldn't be bothered to do some calculus.",1640888478,1,0

Many profs do in-class finals at the end of the semester instead of finals week. It was also more than “a little inconvenient” it was a deliberate attempt at physical intimidation and verbal abuse of any undergrad that wanted to go to class or access campus, dining facilities, etc. 


That’s not what happy means in this context. It means they didn’t care about the effects it had on others, they did it without reservation (at least not the point that it actually stopped them).

No undergrads assaulted anyone, and the clear power dynamic was on the side of the protestors. If you’re going to step in someone’s way or try to physically restrain them—and I did see that occur, it’s not “assault” when they continue on their way. The protestors were the aggressive party at every turn. Being “pushed and battered” when you’re the one iniating the encounter and trying to prevent students from getting to campus is on you. 

Also, which one is it? Was it just a mild inconvenience or were you physically preventing students to the point that you were getting pushed and battered when trying to stop people from accessing a campus they have every right to be on?

"Generally yes, but you should always email your CS advisor to confirm which classes count as GTEs. It can vary depending on your track and what other electives you've picked.

For more detail, here's the guidance SEAS students got in Fall 2018. Again, check with your faculty advisor to make sure these apply.

&gt;For the Bachelor of Science general technical elective requirement of the major, here are the general guidelines that Prof. Verma and I are following:

&gt;**All General Technical Electives must be at the 3000 level or higher:**

&gt;* anything in the engineering school at that level is fine (including CS courses) with the exception of a course called lean launch pad
&gt;    * the one caveat to this is that we typically only allow one policy or management oriented course towards the five electives, so please get everything approved explicitly by your advisor.  Examples of these ""tech light"" courses include courses like ""Computers and Society.""
&gt;* anything at that level in the natural sciences (environmental science, physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy)
&gt;    * Psychology courses are **not** approved
&gt;* Anything at that level in mathematics or statistics
&gt;* In the Economics department you can use Econometrics and/or Game Theory
&gt;* In the Philosophy department you can use the 3000 level symbolic logic course and the courses that are jointly listed between the CS and Philosophy departments.

&gt;Please note that it is still important to run your General Technical Electives by your faculty advisor even if they appear to fit into these guidelines.  That can help prevent any misunderstandings.",1640848231,1,0

If you’re not doing a grad program that’s math heavy, I’d err on the side of econ-stats since  you won’t get much of a benefit from the theoretical math classes if you’re say, pursuing an MBA.

As for difficulty, it depends. If you’re someone that doesn’t like proofs or pure math, econ-math is going to be a lot more of a struggle than econ-stats, since you have to take the more theory heavy 4000 level math classes. You’re right, the stat department has some absolutely awful instructors, but I took the entire 4203-04-05 sequence and got straight A’s with no serious problems (majored in econ and math-stats fwiw).

"I applaud folks who, in their individual capacity, choose jobs / roles which optimize non-monetary benefits (such as healthcare / hours / personal fulfillment) for themselves such as teachers, social workers, etc. 


However, the price system acts to inform people what skills / roles are in high demand to incentivize folks into those fields. There some fields with more supply than demand (in terms of skill &amp; interest), which drive wages down, and in contrast, fields with unfulfilled demand where wages are high. 


Therefore if you want to talk about social good, it might be more holistic to consider that, perhaps, the folks pursuing these underpaid positions are actually the ones selfishly flooding the market with certain skills and preventing a constricted supply of workers to drive up wage prices.


Finally, we can take your extreme example where everyone responds only to market signals and switches majors accordingly. Over time, the influx of programmers and bankers will increase supply, driving the price down, and causing other professions to rise in pay (in both absolute and relative terms).

"I'm currently and undergrad studying CS here. I'm a GS student. 

Keep in mind, this is just my opinion of what I experienced here, so don't take it as fact.

If your plan is to do research in ML, AI or any other field for that matter, I will say that it can be difficult without any prior background in these respective fields. If you've simply taken the courses here in AI, ML or NLP, typically that's not enough to earn a research position. If you can show some prior work/research into whatever you're looking to get into (like a github, resume with projects, etc...) that will help out tremendously. 

I've applied to several research positions and I normally just get ghosted when I send my resume. I've always assumed that it's because I don't have any background in research, other than simply taking the required classes in ML, NLP, etc... 

That being said, there are plenty of research opportunities here, so if your heart is set on it, you can surely get something. Also, building a good relationship with a professor who you're interested in doing research with is a very, very good idea.

Honestly, if money is not an issue, than coming here is not a bad idea. Classes here are very challenging and they take cheating VERY seriously. Do be warned however, that there is a massive war on grade inflation at this school, so you really do have to work hard to get the A/A- grade here. I was a transfer student into GS, so I felt this right away from day 1 at this school.

If you're coming from California and can get into a top UC school, like UCLA or UC Berkeley, honestly I'd go there, as these schools are just as good and you'd be saving your parents a ton of money. In fact, I think UC Berkeley is ranked higher than Columbia and most other Ivy League schools for computer science.

At the end of the day, I'd personally rather take the class with a more clear and coherent lecturer. That can make a big difference even if the class is hard. It sounds like we might differ in our approaches to studying. I prefer to have problems given to me--it makes my life easier and I don't feel as great a need to go out and find material on my own, which is a time suck.

Either way, you'll get through it. As has been noted elsewhere, email your academic advisor as well, and let them know you're overwhelmed by school and were unable to finish a paper in time.

Finally, GS, from what I was told by financial aide, has a maximum aide up to 12 points, and beyond that you're paying out of pocket.

"Hey, this isn't me personally, but a family friend studied music at another ivy. This was to his parents' chagrin, as they believed that he had no viable future in music. Also, this was not a school with a particularly strong music program, IMO (better to go to NYU, Oberlin, Peabody, Juilliard, etc..) However, he is positively thriving! He interviews musicians on a nationally syndicated podcast, has many people that report to him at a radio station, and works in radio production. My advice: go and get some decent radio, record label, music production, or Spotify internships, etc.. and find out what is out there. My guess is that you'll find something that fits that you didn't even know about. That's what my family friend did and he's great!

In sum, if you love music, follow your passion. I think you will find that if you are passionate about something, with a bit of effort and being proactive, opportunity will follow. That said, if you want to be safe, perhaps do double major--nothing wrong with having a back-up plan! 

I wish you every success in the music world and I have every confidence that you will thrive there.",1636066993,1,0

"&gt; If you were in an exam but you got a call that your mom broke her neck and is in the ER, would you be annoyed that you heard before the exam was over?

No. What could I do? If I were to stay, I wouldn't be able to concentrate and would do poorly, which wouldn't help and wouldn't do anything for my mother. The only reason I'd want to know is if my mother was extremely close to death and my professor agreed I should leave the exam and take it later. That is not the case presented by the OP.

As for your second example, cancer obviously is terrible, but it usually doesn't require sudden trips to the ER. His mother did nothing wrong in waiting until after the exam to tell your friend. Again, there was nothing he could do. It's not like his father was minutes from death and he didn't have a chance to say goodbye.

That's not shaming. That's looking at OP's actions objectively.",1636066906,1,0

"It’s immature to get mad at someone for something like that.

It’s a legitimate question. If the OP was not going to do anything, having the phone out is inconsiderate and violates rules

If OP was going to do something, should have spoken to Professor about postponing due to emergency

A constantly buzzing phone in a quiet exam room is something a lot of people would have noticed, including the proctor, if s/he walked around the room. 

When witnesses in depositions and in trials claim they can't remember things that they obviously should they look guilty as hell. In a setting like this, one needs to look candid and cooperative, not obstructive and evasive. The fact of the matter is that even if OP is innocent, what s/he did was stupid to the point of being extremely difficult to believe, especially for a graduate student at a first-rank university who's had at least 16 years of education and many years of taking exams.
