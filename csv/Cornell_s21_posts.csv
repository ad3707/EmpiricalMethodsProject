Looking for a CHEM 2080 tutor?,"Hello my fellow lovers (?) of chemistry! Are you getting nostalgic for the grind of Peer-Led, Flipped Class, and On-Ramp, support activities no longer offered in CHEM 2080? Are you frustrated with non-Cornell tutors fumbling around with your questions geared towards the unique curriculum of the professor? Maybe you’re feeling a gaping hole of dread that without an accountability-check of required activities, your work ethic will go poof?  

Look no further! As a former CHEM 1080 TA (former support course for CHEM 2080 designed to function like peer-led) and CHEM 2070 TA who helped create the On-Ramp, PIP program, and MO Canvas modules (please don’t kill me l0l),  I’m here to offer my private tutoring services! I’ve worked with many CHEM 2080 students in the past, many of whom experienced 1 - 1.5 SD increases in their exam scores (in other words, going from a C to a B letter grade). I approach Chemistry teaching with a holistic approach, because STEM college =/= STEM high school. It’s not just about understanding Chemistry knowledge, but appropriate test-taking skills, study habits, receiving quality feedback, and a ton of grit. I help my students achieve that through meta-learning reflections, specialized lesson plans that target math and chemistry-related concepts, and effective practice techniques. 

My rate is $35/hour, and if you’re interested, feel free to DM me! We’ll set up a time to meet, talk through student/tutor expectations, and then I’ll need confirmation within the following week. **High preference** given to those who are willing to commit for the entire semester and/or meet twice a week. :)",1611512631,1,0

Like I’ll get out of bed pretty easily since I have an obnoxiously loud alarm but after that I either A) don’t have the energy to leave my room or B) go to the library and end up doing nothing after being there for hours. Stuff like eating and showering literally sound exhausting. I stopped talking to my friend group because I don’t really vibe with them and socializing takes so much effort. All I want to do is sleep and eat chocolate. I know people recommended that I see a doctor but I literally can’t motivate myself to call them lmao.

FREN 3400 or FREN 2095?,"Hi! Current freshman here taking FREN 2095 for the moment. I took the CASE exam last week and got a score of Q++a and am now recommended for 3000 level lit courses, so I’m in a pickle not knowing which class to choose while the add drop deadline is coming up this Monday. My concerns are as such:

1. I haven’t taken French in quite a while, and though my grammar has recovered, I still feel like my vocab is lacking. Will FREN 3400 be too difficult?
2. Including the French class, I’m taking 18 credits in total. I’m also in chem 2080 and are doing research for 2 credits. In the mean time, my FWS is on German philosophy, a field that I’m new to, so things are all kind of time consuming. Will switching to FREN 3400 impose too much work? 
3. If I switch, will I be able to catch up with the two weeks of material I missed?
4. If I stay, I feel like I’m not rly challenging myself. For the most part, I’m cruising through the grammar review and sometimes get tripped up on vocab. (Good opportunity to learn tho). Do I rly want to spend time doing basically busywork?

I just got the score and the rec today, and w the deadline coming up, I rly don’t know what to think or how to decide. Maybe someone has taken FREN 3400 before and could offer some insight into what the class is like? Plz any advice would be helpful. Thank y’all so much!!",1613799346,1,0

Registrar Tomfoolery,"This is half the funniest thing that's ever happened to me and also the most annoying.  


Long story short, went through the extremely annoying process of getting my name changed, as I am trans. Finally got my court documents in the mail and filled out a form from the registrar putting very clearly ""Former Name"" what my former name was and in ""Current Name"" being very careful to spell it all right, etc. On every single page of my court document is says ""plaintiff is now given leave to assume the name Jameson R---"" Sent all this to the registrar and didn't hear anything back for like a week, despite them saying it would take a day. What's going on?  


Then I realized not only was my name not my new name on Canvas, Student Essentials, etc... it was still my old name, and spelled completely wrong. Like, totally utterly unpronounceabley wrong. So I went through my whole email, and the guy emailed me back but it went to spam, confirming that he changed my name from my old name.... to my old name but with typos. Wtf lol.  


Kinda unsure what to do now, except just email him back baffled. I checked the forms I sent in a million times, and I made it very clear which name is my legal name and nowhere did I spell my old name the way he messed it up. Caught between laughing and cursing god.",1614908982,47,0

looking for a (backup) roommate,"i know this is a weird title but- i am a freshman who probably wants to live in a single next year but the good singles tend to run out quickly. so, i'm looking for another person in a similar situation to block with and get the same timeslot with, so we either get singles or, if the good ones are gone, room together.

"Profs making it difficult to learn during a pandemic (Unrecorded lectures, no lecture material)","Hey... Is anyone else disturbed by how some professors seem to be going out of their way to make it more difficult to learn, especially amid a global pandemic? I have two classes where the prof gives us zero material besides what they teach us in lecture (live lecture only/does not upload lecture/ no slides/ no textbook really used in the course), and while I understand this is a method of teaching, it feels quite insensitive to students who are struggling during this time. Especially considering the weight of exams based on lecture materials being like 40+ percent.

I understand that reaching out for accommodations is possible but there are so many barriers to doing so; one being profs literally saying no exceptions besides documented major medical or family events... like what constitutes a ""major"" medical event?? Not to mention that many students are remote this semester and may not have the same access to health care at home as they do at Cornell.

The irony is that Cornell preaches about mental health but seems to intentionally create an environment where students are shamed for needing accommodations for any undocumented emergency event. Why arent there more university-wide policies for making school more accessible to students in this time?

I'm not  posting this for pity but just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences? Does anyone else feel like profs suddenly got really rude and cold this semester compared to the previous 2 covid semesters? Like we're still in this pandemic, and even if we're accustomed to it, it doesn't make its impact any less severe. ",1614893539,33,0
Did any of you drop a class your senior year of high school?,"Hi, I got into Cornell SHA ED and REALLY want to drop my AP Computer Science A class. I have a clear reason for wanting to drop this class other than laziness or a desire for easier course load. My teacher has been unreasonably discriminating against me from my classmates; literally telling me that she will grade my assignments more harshly, avoiding answering my questions during class, imposing a different standard of work from me than anyone else, unreasonably assuming that my assignments aren't my own work, individually meeting up with my classmates without me, etc. I tried talking to the teacher but she doesn't answer and instead just literally bullies me. I feel so anxious around her because every time I go to her class, something happens. My HS counselor saw me crying almost every day at school for the past month at school because of her class and told me that I can drop the class if Cornell lets me. I emailed Cornell admissions just now, and am hoping to hear back an answer soon. But did any of you drop a class your senior year of high school? How did cornell respond? I am terrified of getting my admissions offer rescinded, but I am equally terrified of going to her class. Please let me know :( ANY advice would be helpful right now haha I'm crying",1614892661,9,0

Negotiating apartment lease for adding early termination,"Hi all! 
So for this year I had an off campus apartment but I ended up not being able to be on campus for full year. I couldn’t find subletters either so I ended up wasting my money on empty apartment room :/

With that, I want to ask landlord to add early termination contract on apartment lease when I renew the contract. I heard some states require such in law like two months rent penalty is a lease is terminated before the end of the contracted period with sufficient notice but sadly not for NY. 

But what makes it complicated is that I have a roommate as a co-tenant. Would the early termination work even when just one of the tenants moves out?

Also, if any of you have experiences in negotiating the lease, it would be super helpful if you could share them with me!

On the recent violence against Asian Americans,"The University needs to release a statement on what happened in Atlanta last night. For those out of the loop, 8 people were killed in an apparent mass shooting targeting Asians on Tuesday night. To many, this may seem like an isolated incident.

The Asian students at Cornell deserve to know that their university cares and is willing to take action to protect them during a period of historic and unprecedented anti-Asian sentiment, racism, and violence. We need to know that we are safe walking the streets of our campus. I know both friends and family who are scared to leave their homes tonight. Many will dismiss this statement as an overreaction, but for those who are being targeted we are only too used this news being swept under the rug. And now, we are suffering in silence.

On the recent killings of and attacks on Asian Americans,"The University needs to release a statement on what happened in Atlanta last night. For those out of the loop, 8 people were killed in an apparent mass shooting targeting Asians on Tuesday night. To many, this may seem like an isolated incident. But for many Asian Americans, these killings are only one event in a string Asian hate crimes that are surging around our country. The Asian students at Cornell deserve to know that their university cares and is willing to take action to protect them during a period of historic and unprecedented anti-Asian sentiment, racism, and violence. We need to know that we are safe walking the streets of our campus. I know both friends and family who are scared to leave their homes tonight. Many will dismiss this statement as an overreaction, but for those who are being targeted we are only too used this news being swept under the rug. And now, we are suffering in silence. But this time, it feels different, this incident is on the front page of The NY Times; it feels like a possible watershed moment, so I have decided to speak out. We aren’t asking you to pity us.

No one bothers to read the textbook (there is LITERALLY a PDF easily accessible online) or even do a quick Google search to verify that the definitions they're using are right, and I end up having to do every single problem. The thing is, I get that the material is difficult. I totally get it if you can't do the problems—more often than not, I can't do all the problems either! But PLEASE. At least contribute to the discussion. At least be willing to try the problems during our meetings. But I look at the textbook. I review my lecture notes. I try to find similar problems online.

How to use the reusable meal containers,"A lot of people are still using the single-use containers and I think one reason might be because they don't know the process and might be a bit intimidated (at least I was). So here's a quick guide:

&amp;#x200B;

1.) to buy the container, just let the person scanning you in know you'd like to buy one and they'll ask you to scan again to buy it; it's like $5 with BRBs and is a one-time payment

2.) They'll give you a green ticket

&amp;#x200B;

3.) When you're getting food, you show the ticket to the person serving you and they'll use a reusable container. After that, just return the ticket in a little bowl there

4.) When you go back again, show the person scanning your empty container and they'll give you a slip or just take one from the counter (they usually just lay them out).

5.) Return your used container to the bin nearby and repeat step 3. Remember to clean your container (rinse or at the very least dump out any uneaten food).

"Hopefully a little help for ""I'm so tired""","I have been there.  What you have to realize is that you are NOT a machine.  Even with a machine you can't just dump in fuel and run it longer and longer to get more work done.  Machines need maintenance or they break.  If you think you don't have time to reinstall all your computer's software or replace your car's engine, then imagining the amount of time and effort required to repair your brain should get you to do whatever it takes to avoid that repair.  

But most likely, even when you are desperate enough to complain to the internet, you won't let the repair your brain scenario even cross your mind. People are much more subtle.  We don't know when we break so how would we know if we were getting close? We just get slower and slower, feel worse and worse and fall further and further behind.  Between Friday and now, this is where I think you have gone.

Your brain isn't actually broken, it's just being used in a manner that will lead to it breaking, sooner or later, if you don't get your hands on and read the owner's manual.  Well I don't have your owner's manual but I am willing to give you a peak at mine.  My guess is that we are similar enough so that if you follow what would work for me and  take notes on what you try and how it works for you, that you can create your own.  That is much better than just doing what I say because next time, I might not be here or I won't have gone through what you are doing.

So let's start with a definition.  **Working as hard as you can does NOT mean** working 18 hours a day and laying in bed worrying about the fact you are not working for 6 more hours.  As a beginner, just hearing about these ideas, working as hard as you can is more like sleeping 6 hours per day, spending 6 more hours eating, walking outside, hanging with friends and actually learning and producing high quality work maybe 12 hours a day.  When you were in HS, you might not have been a beginner you learned how to handle that in MS.  But now your college circumstances (even if you are an upperclassman) mean starting again.  Once you are good at implementing the beginner's schedule, you will have an owner's manual that you can tweak to increase beyond 12 hours.  But you only want to do that if you can pay careful attention to see if you are actually accomplishing more.  I severely doubt you will pull off more than 12 hours but I've been wrong before.

For now because you seem to believe this is life or death, we are aiming at 12 hours a day (50% 12/24) even though when you get good at it, you can likely get as much done in 8 or 9 hours.  See if I send you off to try something you don't believe, you will fail even if it would work if you did believe.  Right now you are working the proverbial 18 hours and procrastinating at least 10. (33% 8/24)  You may not realize it but without solid ""boring"" breaks and scheduled time off with your friends even those 8/24 hours you are working, even after removing the procrastination, are still pretty poor and yield more like 6/24 or even 4/24. If you can't believe in 12/24 that might yield 2 or 3 times as much, try it because even if you don't accomplish any more, it won't push you closer to breaking.

So now make a schedule where you lock in things that are not work first.  Never break the non-work schedule. That is so much easier than not breaking a work schedule.  First schedule 6 hours of sleep.  I'm partial to 11pm to 5am but you chose.  Then schedule in an hour to get ready to go to sleep.  That hour can't include any screen time at all, 0, just trying to slow your brain down.  I suggest starting with a trip outside to look for stars or stare across your part of campus at things far away, and some walking.  This walk is about strolling, not exercise and not talking with friends.  Looking at things far away will help slow your brain.  When you get back brush your teeth and look out your window for awhile.  Then set your alarm for 6+ whatever fraction of an hour from then to total 7 hours.  Spend some time lying in bed doing whatever you think works best to go to sleep once you are in bed.  Get up with the alarm.  So apart from the 7 hours devoted to sleeping and getting to sleep, you need to schedule time to wake up, times to eat, time to hang with friends and times for ""boring breaks"" to get outside and get outside for some light within two hours of getting up.  Those slots should add up to 5 hours so you have 12 other hours to work.

When a person first starts working, they are inefficient and it can be hard to focus but after 10 or 15 minutes if you push through you will get to a state where you are working at close to your capacity.  Somewhere around 75 minutes later you go back to inefficiency and things just get slower and slower if you keep pushing.  If you break up work with say pomodoros of 25 min on 5 min of boring time off (walking outside staring at the horizon without your phone) you can lengthen 75 out of 90 minutes to maybe 100 out of 120 minutes but after somewhere between 90 and 120 minutes you need more than a 5 min break (food, a shower, exercise, a call to your mother, a timed 60 min hangout or sleep). Not all breaks take the same amount of time but you can't use only the same 5 min break or they aren't breaks anymore. Similarly, after you string about four 90 to 120 min sessions together in a day, you are going to be less efficient in your 5th and 6th and to get to 12 hours of work you have to do 7 cycles to get 700 minutes (11:40).  Even worse after a few nights where you are short on sleep, even your efficient periods are going to be subpar.  Does that mean you just can't get more than 8 hours of work done in a day?  No.  But it does mean that if you try to really up your hours of work, you have to always be on the lookout to make sure you are increasing not just hours but also high quality output. 

So keep an eye on what you do in the 5/6/7th cycles to make sure the work you do then, say writing, doesn't just all have to be redone.  Those later cycles can be used to do creative things like first writing drafts (but almost never editing) that you know you are going to have to do over anyway.  You might try first attempts at psets later in the day to figure out how \*&amp;#!! you are and what type of help you need.  Beyond your non-work schedule that you write first, you also have to figure the best order for your actual work. Make sure to use office hours as mini predeadlines. Try to schedule polishing and finishing things early and trying things later.  It's always hard to figure out when you are done so you want to do that early when you have more energy and you aren't as likely to rely on the deadline.  Working up against deadlines ""works"" but it also drags things out and kicks off the downward cycle.

 Anyway as your new schedule kicks in sleep, talking to your mother, hanging with your friends should slowly repair your brain.  Your repaired brain is what you need not only to learn the material but to also actually perform on your prelims/papers or would you rather die the death of a hundred lost negative signs or dangling participles? If you have trouble getting started, find a friend who is also So Tired and try to get on the same schedule so you can encourage each other.

I hate CS 4410,"I hate Harmony. 

I hate how the professors are casually just giving a middle finger to those of us that use Windows.

I hate how my assigned ""Study group"" doesn't reply to any of my emails so I'm left on my own.

I hate how my ""dedicated TA"" is not any more accessable than any of the other ones.

I hate how even if you get to talk to a TA, they don't seem to have any idea how to use Harmony either.

I hate how I haven't made any progress on this simple homework assignment for the past 12 hours because Harmony is a piece if garbage.

This is not true, and I know most people are kidding when they say that philosophy for example is “easier than computer science.” They’re fundamentally different fields and cannot be compared. But why is the notion that humanities is easier than STEM especially prevalent at Cornell?

Dear Cornell Community,  


The Cornell University Police are actively searching for missing Cornell student, Shawn West. Shawn was last seen in his residence hall on North Campus the morning of Tuesday, April 6. A parent, who resides in New York City, reported him missing yesterday afternoon.  


Shawn is a first-year student in the College of Arts and Sciences. He is a Black male, 18-years-old, 5'10"" tall with black hair and brown eyes and weighs approximately 160 lbs. There is no description of the clothing he may be wearing; however, two images are included in this message: the one of Shawn wearing a mask shows his current hairstyle. The Cornell University Police are asking anyone with information about Shawn’s whereabouts to call 607-255-1111 or email [CUP-inv@cornell.edu](mailto:CUP-inv@cornell.edu).  


Please keep Shawn and his family in your thoughts during this difficult time. As always, take care of yourselves and one another, and do not hesitate to use the support resources listed at the close of this email, if needed.  


We are in contact with Shawn’s family and will provide additional updates as soon as they are available.

Financial Aid Appeal Questions,"I'm a high school senior who has recently gotten my financial aid award letter and my cost of attendance is 40k, which is way more than our family can afford and 10k more than the financial aid calculator had estimated for me. We are low income but our assets are greatly driving up the cost, yet this asset is an apartment that is completely illiquid and therefore cannot be used towards my education. In addition, we have large amounts of mortgage that we are paying off to this day on our home. I have a few concerns about appealing for financial aid.

If I appeal explaining how this asset is not liquidable and the liabilities we are still paying off, could I expect Cornell to match the cost of the financial aid calculator at least? Are they generous with aid in situations like this? Even then, I believe I can only afford 20k-25k max but I'm not sure if they would provide me with 20k more of aid.  Also, in the case that they do match me on an offer that is more reasonable, would I have to appeal every year or would they keep this offer throughout?",1617920812,1,0

1. Is it possible (and reasonable) to double major in econ and bio and society (the CAS major)? I am not pre-med, but am looking to go into the healthcare sector on the business/administration side.
2. How feasible is it to graduate in 3 years coming in with a good number of AP credits? If this were the case, I might think of doing a econ major and a STS minor (in place of the BSOC second major). 
3. Is the STS minor limited to STS courses or do BSOC courses also count? As in, can I somehow do a “BSOC minor” under the name of the STS minor?

Happy earth day!,"I don’t want my kids to die because of climate change so here are some fairly easy things many students here can do, beyond just celebrating this one day!

1. Switch to a more plant-based diet if you have the means! This doesn’t mean you have to go full vegan, just reduce animal product consumption. Everyone being imperfectly plant based is better than a few people being perfectly vegan.

2. Thrift, buy less in general, buy higher quality sustainable items that last longer, and learn how to fix the stuff you own!

3. Cut back on waste. This means getting an eco box, using a reusable water bottle, using reusable utensils, etc. (Bottled water companies don’t produce water; they produce plastic.) For those who get periods: try reusable period products (like menstrual cups and cloth pads)! They take some getting used to, but disposable pads and tampons create SO much waste.

4. I know college students are broke, but if you do ever come across extra cash (or if you just come from money idk) consider donating to support climate action or other causes you care about. And do remember to research these organizations to make sure they’re transparent about where your money goes.

5. Use Ecosia!

Please take the time to think about your actions! I know everyone says, “What is the action of a single person going to do?” and it may seem that way but it just creates a cyclic mindset of not doing anything because everyone is asking themselves that question and thinking that nothing is worth it. These are some very basic individual actions that can be done, and as always, if anyone has other suggestions please share them! This is just a stepping stone and more can always be done.",1619070698,1,0

But ig it didnt really turn out that way afterall

i didnt know people would be crazy enough to room dorm party at overcapacity without masks and with illegal alcohol smuggled in, partying at 4 am in the morning and keeping ppl up all night who actually need their fucking sleep

I didn't know doing these stupid applications and interviews would take up so much time and energy. and I burned hours and hours of my time and poured passion into essays to get nothing out of it because somehow despite my relevant experience and background I'm not worthy of their fuckin standards like for the love of god you'd think that if some of these people were any more elitist they might become Narcissus 2.0 

and about friends, i really did try to meet ppl...i mean i tried joining social clubs, meeting others in classes and stuff heck, i even tried to rush a social frat/srat

but either the people were toxic all in your face type of people about their achievements, or the kind of backstabber
who'd pretend to be nice but tear you down the second you left an opening for them.
its honestly exhausting dealing with that and

tw suicide / vent / dumping,"idk who sees this anymore tbh.

anyone else literally on the verge of suicide? a small part of me always thought that it was silly to kill yourself over schoolwork (despite already being a person with suicidal tendencies), but i get it now. this semester has been the worst. i've relapsed into some really shitty, self-destructive habits that i had literally been clean of for like 3 years, and it has taken a toll on me. also im weeks behind in a few classes despite trying to get a lot done lately. i waited until the last minute to catch up - which i get is completely and entirely my fault - and now there's finals and papers due and i have nothing. ive got nothing to show for this semester. 

ive been seeing a therapist for a while now, im on meds, ive gone to group therapy, and everything. yet here i am. things always seem to go back to shit in the end. i don't know what to do. taking a leave of absence was never and will never be an option because id be a fucking utter disappointment to my mother, which ive already been disappointing with my grades from last semester. she's not mean to me about it, but it hurts, and i know deep down she thinks im stupid and not good enough to even be here. which i guess is true.

anyway, yeah. im stuck. im too far behind and i cant handle failing this semester (yet again). im so worthless and im a fucking idiot for various reasons. i think im really, really going to go through with it. ive attempted suicide multiple times in the past, leading me to a psych ward and a mental hospital and an emergency room where i had to get intravenous tubes. but this time i want to try harder and not fail like a stupid, inadequate disappointment. i want to at least get this one thing right. im so fucking fatigued. im so lost. i dont know what to do. as stupid and weak as it sounds, i think im finally giving up.",1621296584,1,0

Thank u 3110!,"Just gotta say:

3110 was by far my favorite class this semester. The camel lore, Clarkson's energy, the huge accommodations to ZoomU, all the amazing consultants/TA's (special s/o to my TA in one of the Monday sections), all of this made the class so enjoyable. It seemed like a ton of work was put into making the class great even over a virtual semester - which could be said for basically all classes, but 3110 rly stood out to me. I appreciate the work all of u have put in! The last lecture made me sad ngl watching the behind the scenes. I hope you all know that your effort made my virtual semester better, as I'm sure is also true with many other students. Thank you again, I wish you all a great summer break!",1621291278,1,0

	EzraBox - Cheapest option. They pair you with another student or Cornell staff who will pick up your things and drop them off when you're back. Cheap and convenient - money goes to other college students. I've used this you it was chill.

Any other (presumptive) grad feeling very depressed and suicidal?,"I'm a engineering senior about to graduate with a great job (think: Google SWE) and a great GPA but have basically no friends and feel very lonely. Everyone around me is so happy for me, especially my parents, because I will be the first in my family to graduate and I came here on a full scholarship. Despite this, I just feel no sense of pride at all but rather great shame because of my familial background and loneliness because I didn't make any real friends here and my only best friend betrayed me recently. All of this isn't new and I'm used to coping with it, but recently graduation festivities have become, I feel, a reminder of how little the degree/hard work mattered. I see people constantly post on Instagram and Snapchat about eating at fancy restaurants, having fun with friends on the slope, going on wine tours and boating, etc. and it just makes me think of how I will never be able to enjoy that and of the stark differences between me and my peers. While I can't say for certain that my ""class"" played a role in me not having friends here, I definitely feel like it has -- as I look to how others like me have coped during my four years here -- mostly via the implicit segregation among friend groups, etc and knowing how much a lot of the activities people do costs. All of this made me very depressed and begin to question whether or not to stick around to graduate. Lately, I've thought of wanting to kill myself as a ""fuck you"" to the world and to my parents for pushing me so hard to stay here and endure these 4 years. I know it sounds crazy: a Google-bound Ivy League graduate wanting to die? But, I feel as though, at the end of the day, it's just a job like any other and I'd basically be living to be a glorified cog in a machine. I would never be as happy or as rich as some of my peers who started out with so much. I makes me wonder if it's all worth it and like no one gets me because they all think I should be happy, proud, and thankful. It's just hard to be so when feeling so empty, lonely, and poor.

I am faking my way through life and at this point it’s getting kind of concerning,"My grades suck but no one knows that.

A lot of the things I’m involved in would probably not have accepted me if they knew my grades and my friends and probably wouldn’t want to be lab partners with me if they knew also 

My high school grades were not this bad but honestly not that great either compared to the usual standards for Cornell admissions. I’m pretty sure I only redeemed myself through my SAT/AP scores but like I am good at standardized testing not actual smartness 

And this isn’t imposter syndrome. I already looked into that and that’s when you feel like you don’t belong *even when all other signs point to you being competent*. The signs are not pointing there for me. This is not a syndrome, this is imposter real life.

any recommended courses for information science’s UX concentration?,"so I’ve been hearing things about good product design and how user research is integral to providing a good and impactful user experience. now I’m considering exploring some UX courses and wasn’t sure where to start, so I checked out the website on the UX concentration list of courses to fill the reqs.

all of the classes sound interesting, I’m just not sure which ones to take :/

any recommendations for ux-related courses? thanks!

other thoughts-
- not sure which one to take across INFO 3450 (human computer interaction design) 4400 (Qualitative user research and design methods) or 4410 (redesigning robots - im not familiar with hardware tho)
- what are these “Special Topics” INFO courses about?? like INFO 4940: Special Topics - Technology and Underserved Communities, are they offered at limited times?? 
- interested in info 4240: designing technology for social impact
- info 4430: teams and technology I’ve heard on the sub is good?
- might do game design but I’m not good at designing. still working on developer skills but I’m 100% sure everyone else will be a better, more experienced dev than me if I were to join in any future semester .",1620236684,1,0

Is one of your career goals to have a positive impact on the world? Or not really,"Curious to hear your personal take if you want to share. 

I personally switch back and forth. Sometimes I feel like at least *some* people have to give a shit and do something about the problems, and if everyone expects someone else to be that person then that’s not good. 

Other times I’m kind of like meh there’s too many problems and I’m tired of bad news. So I’d rather do an easy job where I don’t have to worry about this stuff 

I try to make a ton of money or get a high position so I can be influential. But I tend to lean selfish so that probably won’t work out well.

Big dingalees being thrown in my dream?,"Last night, I realized I was dreaming in the dream, which creeped me out. I was in my room from home, and I flew out of the house and into a white leaved/flowered tree. There were also pink trees and stuff, kind of like pretty Ithaca trees. It was nighttime, but I was trying to manifest it into daytime. I thought of the song “daylight” by Taylor Swift, but instead of it becoming light, big dingalees were being thrown and exploding in the distance. I think they were supposed to bring light but then they kept getting destroyed? Anyway, they got closer and closer, and started crashing near me too. Then my little sister was there and handed me something? Idk, but I was then lucid enough to wake myself up.

What does this mean?????? Keep in mind I didn’t realize it was big dingalees until I woke up, I thought it was a castle or something. Thx",1620228542,1,0

I wish I can come back to campus as soon as I can and get rid of the mental stuff that’s ruining my life. It feels as if I need constant reassurance that everything will be fine.

"Concerned about balancing workload, double major, and interests","Hello all,

Fall 2021 will be my first semester at Cornell University, but I am having some issues thinking about what classes I would be interested in taking.

My dilemma revolves around the fact that I have so many interests. My main two interests are physics and political science (government), but I also really love history, anthropology, biology, linguistics, literature, and so many more! I was initially excited when I saw how many interesting courses were offered at Cornell, but then I started planning for courses I want to take.

I plan(ned) on majoring in physics and government, but after looking over requirements, I realised that with those, plus the language requirements and FWS, I have essentially no room to explore at all or take classes in other fields that I also enjoy. If I try to maintain roughly 15-16 credits per semester, I will only really have 2 opportunities to branch into something else over all 4 years.

I guess my question is, does anybody have any advice or experience double majoring in two very different fields? Also, I read on the Cornell website that you need to manage how many credits you are taking because the expectation is that each credit hour results in 3 hours outside of classwork. 45 outside of class hours a week sounds like a lot, but manageable. Are most classes really 12 hours of outside work a week? If I were taking classes I was very interested in, would going up to 18 or 19 credit hours be manageable? Does anybody have experience with that? I am prepared to work hard (of course), but I need to also be prepared to know what I have to give up to have a reasonable educational experience...

Thank you in advance.",1620190532,1,0

CURB Undergraduate Symposium is a poorly organized event,"First, I still appreciate the CURB workers that make this happen in this difficult time. But there are a lot of room for improvements despite Covid-19.

You really had to send out the presentation format requirement one week before the symposium while asking us to send the application in the beginning of April, during the wellness days, after multiple people asking.

Also when people are asking questions, CURB people are so not responsive that it felt like they are avoiding the questions.

You really had to make us submit a video abstract within 24 hours and informed that to us with an email sent after midnight.

I still don’t know why a symposium has to have judges and “winners”, like how can you even compare research from different fields when everyone is having different judges? Plus if it’s hard to recruit judges during Covid and according to your email some people may get 0 judge (with all the hard work people are putting in), why don’t you just cancel the judging process at the beginning?

You also sent us our judge assignment 3 days before the event and during the weekend and after midnight and expect us to contact them and schedule a meeting within 3 days.

Plus there’s like zero advertisement about people are presenting in this week. I’m 95% sure that I’ll be spending 2hr waiting in an empty zoom room in the final week.

Oh and what’s up with the information session you promised us? It never happened and apparently most people are so confused about what they supposed to do.

Seriously, if you want to organize an event and invite people to it, put some efforts in instead of just “apologizing” or making a couple posters and get a GroupMe group and copy-paste abstracts into a google doc. I feel like I’m spending more time preparing my presentation than the time people are spending in organizing this!
