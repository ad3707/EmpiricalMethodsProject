"Current 5th year. I think it's worth it.

Pros:

You get to do research! I enjoyed my classes, but learned to read papers and push the boundary of human knowledge a little bit was rewarding. I feel like I've gotten some expertise in some tiny field of computer science!

Lots of flexibility in classes. You can take grad classes, which you usually want to focus with your research. Most times though, you want to focus more on your research and it is better to not take too challenging classes. You also take elective classes that are really flexible. I took three 100 level business classes for electives.

Cons:

It's pretty challenging. It's really fast and can be demotivating when a lot of the work you try just doesn't go anywhere. I think I tried 3 or 4 different ideas and several weeks before I made any progress. Additionally, it is one year. On one hand that's not too much of a commitment. On the other hand that is fast. It's hard to get settle and do good research in one year.

Other notes:

 My biggest advice to myself would be to learn to how to self-learn, take good notes, be independent and keep myself accountable. Research is not like classes where there are deadlines every week. I also struggled a lot and eventually asked my advisor if we could meet one-on-one a week. That helped me a lot and eventually get the hang of it. Currently we have a paper in review!

I think it's a great opportunity for Berkeley CS/EECS students. Career wise, it really doesn't matter. Most people who do it are intrinsically motivated. I had the option of a couple major tech companies, but didn't feel too bad of forgoing them for a year and having to do recruiting again. The acceptance rate is 70% with a yield of 90% so people who apply are very self-selective and motivated to do it. Some students graduate in 3 years and just do it for their fourth year. Most people do go into industry afterwards but there are a couple that go on and do PhDs. In the grand scheme of things, one year for the experience to do research is pretty sick.

P.S. A great account of one student's [experience](https://www.larryxu.com/blog/pursuing-undergraduate-research/)! Mine has been similar.",1582264982,1,0

"You might not know this yet, but the Model 3 comes with a mobile connector ""charger"" that can plug into a variety of outlets, including your standard 120V wall outlet. The difference is speed - a [120V wall outlet charges at 3mph, whereas a 240V NEMA 14-50 outlet charges your car at 30mph](https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation/mobile-connector). Those 240V outlets are sometimes already in home garages as an outlet that your washer/dryer are plugged into. The dedicated Wall Charger costs $500 to install but charges at ~45mph, and is the home equivalent of what an apartment-installed charger would probably be. [Charging stuff here](https://shop.tesla.com/category/charging).


What that means is technically, no matter where you live, you can find a regular extension cord and plug it into the Mobile Connector, and plug the other end into any 120V outlet you find in your apartment. Especially if you are doing low-mileage infrequent driving that gives you enough time to charge your car slowly.

---


That being said, the value of having a car in Berkeley is pretty low, and the risks are incredibly high. As mentioned already, parking is a PITA. It's a solid $100+/month for a covered garage spot in ANY apartment, and if you don't want your car to get scratched or intentionally messed up by someone, you definitely don't want street parking. When it comes to break-ins, the Model 3 is infamous for having the rear quarter window smashed in because it gives you direct access to the seat lever, letting people knock your seat down so they can see what goodies you have in your trunk. And Sentry Mode footage, as most security footage is, is very unlikely to be helpful when it comes to trying to track down who it actually was.


And it honestly just doesn't get used that much. Anything you do with friends will be local, and it's impossible to find parking around the campus area. People aren't really willing to leave Berkeley because of the stress of classes and midterms (it takes a lot of effort and coordination to make it happen), and you will probably find the charging thing to end up being a huge headache and drain on your valuable energy and time. 


Additionally, as a personal anecdote, I find that a LOT of personal growth comes from living on your own away from home. And I'm not just talking about doing your own laundry or doing the dishes or w/e, but a maturity aspect that is hard to describe that is very crucial when it comes to being an adult. Weird things happen as an independent adult, and you want to work out all of the downsides (as well as understand and reign in control of the upsides, aka unlimited freedom) well before you graduate and enter the workforce (or otherwise). Constantly having a fall-back plan in the corner of your mind to be able to visit parents easily for literally anything is very, very crippling to this kind of growth.",1583344900,1,0

In case you believe the arguments where people try to justify a death rate lower than 3%, here is the WHO itself admitting current total cases vs. deaths is 3.4%:

[https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020)

The figure of 6% for recovered cases vs. deaths is *worse* than the Spanish Flu. Even if recovered cases vs. deaths ends up being as low as 3.4%, which is unlikely, you're talking 11 million dead in America, &gt;4000 dead in the city of Berkeley. 

Please don't buy into the 'it's nothing to be concerned about' hype. Here is a great example of the government saying the same things about Spanish Flu:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1mrnq/spanish\_flu\_kille\_80\_million\_ppl\_media\_gov\_were/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1mrnq/spanish_flu_kille_80_million_ppl_media_gov_were/)

"Just going to put my general thoughts here. First, we should be taking preventative and precautionary measures. Wash your hands, often and correctly. Use the hand sanitizing stations around campus. Stay home if you‚Äôre sick whenever possible. The campus itself should be (and to my knowledge is) preparing to transition to online education.

With that said, however: while we should certainly be concerned and take the measures, we should calibrate how worried we are. This isn‚Äôt the Spanish Flu or the Black Death. The reason the virus is spreading so effectively is *because* it is so mild; people who are sick enough that they stay home or go to the hospital aren‚Äôt very good at spreading the virus. The current indications that I see indicate an overall mortality likely less than 1%. There‚Äôs a significant sampling bias that needs to be accounted for; again, the huge number of mild cases go significantly under reported. I‚Äôve personally heard estimates coming from countries with the best data of a mortality rate of &lt; .5%. And most of that probability is concentrated among the already sick and the old; if you‚Äôre young and generally healthy, you‚Äôre very likely to be fine (but again, we need to take measure to protect the at risk groups).

And a bit of a wake up call when it comes to the long term prognosis of this thing: this virus most likely isn‚Äôt going away. Not in the next month, not in the next 6 months, and probably not in the next year. Indeed, I believe that current indications are that it will be significantly worse (in terms of community infection rates) in the Fall. Which is why I‚Äôm reluctant to support calls to suspend classes; if we wanted to suspend classes until the virus was irradicated / evolves to become milder /vaccination is released, we‚Äôd probably have to close campus for (on the order of) years. 

It‚Äôll be a rough period for a while, but this is not the apocalypse. Be concerned, be vigilant, but not terrified. And buckle in for the long haul, because this isn‚Äôt going away any time soon.",1583342911,1,0
"Closing campus may not be the solution. Although, preventing spread is. UC Berkeley taking the action to close campus wont stop all daily activities. Everything will need to shut down (just like in China). There are also things that need to be done on campus that make complete closure nearly impossible.

The state/national government needs to do something. 


Also, I think most people are worried about becoming carriers and going home to parents/grandparents who are (without argument) more likely to catch a serious case than college age students.",1583342836,2,0

To the people claiming it's not that bad, I urge you to look at the statistics. World death rate is &gt;3% for total cases vs. deaths, and 6% for recovered cases vs. deaths. That's worse than the 1918 influenza epidemic. Source: [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Have you seen the videos coming out of China with bodybags lined up in parks? 

To the people claiming xenophobia is a greater concern than public health, I urge you to listen to the international students who have family in China affected by the virus. *Everyone* is currently at risk and *all* of us need to act collectively for our own safety and the safety of our community. To the people who really are xenophobic, understand that any person you come in to contact with regardless of nationality is a possible transmission vector.",1583341582,2,0

"I do not recommend buying a Boosted Board, but I DO recommend getting a Meepo Board. Much cheaper, same or better performance.

Carrying the board around kinda sucks, but IMO it's more convenient than dealing with a bike and you won't be sweaty. 

Carrying and storing scooters is more of a hassle than the board for comparable performance and speed, so if you're debating electric scooter vs electric skateboard, I suggest the skateboard.

Will you eat shit and hurt yourself? Probably at least once, but it's not a big deal and if you're even a little bit athletic or coordinated you will have no trouble after 3 days. Riding is also EXTREMELY fun on the big hills near the chemistry buildings or going towards Haas.

The downside with the Meepo is the battery only lasted about a year, but I paid $250 for the board so even if you decided to get a brand new one instead of just replacing the battery, you'd come out even with the Boosted over 4 years.",1583323368,1,0

"In China, there are countless cases where two people just stayed nearby for about 15 seconds and got infected. No coughing, no snoozing, just normal quiet breathing! 

Google search: Airborne spread happens when a germ floats through the air after a person talks, coughs, or sneezes. Germs may land in the eyes, mouth, or nose of another person. If a germ is airborne, direct contact with the infected person is NOT needed for someone else to get sick. Airborne spread diseases include: chickenpox, tuberculosis.

Droplet spread happens when germs traveling inside droplets that are coughed or sneezed from a sick person enter the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person. Droplets travel short distances, less than 3 feet (1 meter) from one person to another. A person might also get infected by touching a surface or object that has germs on it and then touching their mouth or nose. Droplet spread diseases include: plague, Ebola.

These are separate medical terms but they are basically the same for us. That is, the virus spread through air! That is, one can get infected without physical contact with a patient! That is enough to know about! Be cafeful.",1583319797,1,0

"Senior here who just moved back home indefinitely, as have a majority of my friends. I'm not fully moved out, but I don't have a return date locked down given the uncertainty. Said a bunch of half-assed and sudden goodbyes, some of which had to be done over texts because I didn't get the chance to do so in-person. I don't know if or when I'll next see everyone, especially since commencement's probably not happening with the way things are looking. 

I spent much of my college career hating on Berkeley up until this final semester, when I made it a point to fully appreciate it and all of the amazing people I've come across these past few years. I didn't know it'd be too late for that, and I'll never got the chance to follow through on that promise to myself. Berkeley's not a perfect institution, but for all of its flaws, it's still a really special place that I failed to cherish when I could. And regardless of your feelings about Berkeley, I think we can all agree that the best part of it is its people - many of us will never get the chance to surround ourselves with such large numbers of diverse, uniquely talented, and hardworking individuals in our lives again. I now deeply regret not being more present during my time here, especially since I can't experience and appreciate so many things and moments I set out to do for the last (or first) time, and won't have the closure that comes with a traditional senior year.

"Thanks for writing such a thorough response but there's a few things that are not clear. 

&gt;I‚Äôm sure that grad schools and internships will understand why students are taking the p/np option and it won‚Äôt be held against them

And then:
&gt;if a grad school is looking at a transcript filled with a bunch of letter grades in technical classes and a transcript filled with a bunch of p/np in those same technical classes, they are going to favor the student with the letter grades for the academics portion of application.

Don't these contradict each other? Also how can we be so sure that the second statement above is true? 

&gt;The only way the p/np option would really be beneficial to all students is if every student applying to an internship or grad program took the same classes this semester and we all took those classes p/np. Unfortunately, that isn‚Äôt the case.

I get your point here - but wouldn't the logical step be to encourage the school to put limits on who can take letter grades - like if you're on probation or need it for GPA caps? Is it not much easier for them to put limits on who can take letter grades for whatever essential reasons, than pressure the rest of us, who cannot do well in these conditions take letter grades? The more people take letter grades, the more it hurts those who genuinely need courses to be PNP. 

&gt;That being said, I'm taking all of classes for letter grades.

If all of us start doing this, doesn't it completely undermine the purpose of the default PNP? Please don't take this negatively. I have nothing against you. I'm starting to fear if I have to take stuff for letter grades too. And if how do I perform like usual?",1585488816,1,0

"TL;DR: do what makes you happy, do it really well and give yourself wholly to it, and success will follow that. Fuck anyone who tells you that a major is the sole determinant for what your future can entail.

I would lie if I said that I‚Äôve loved every second of my undergraduate education, but now that I know I‚Äôll never sit in a class at Cal again, I wouldn‚Äôt trade these past four years for anything in the world. I‚Äôm unequivocally happy to have been a student in the humanities at Cal.

Anybody who tells you that the humanities aren‚Äôt worth going into is doing you a disservice, if that‚Äôs where you truly feel that you want to be. Sorry to go off, but it frustrates me to no end when people view undergrad as a utility that you pay into for four years for a fixed return contingent on the name of your ultimate degree.

I double majored in a niche humanities and a niche social science because both of those subjects interested me deeply. Not to give a life story, but I feel like context is warranted: in high school I was a fuckaround student who would turn in assignments if and when I wanted to, and when I got into Berkeley it was a complete and utter surprise to me and everyone whom I knew. Knowing I wouldn‚Äôt get a chance like this again, I threw myself into majors that I found interesting and engaging regardless of my imagination that they would offer bleak-at-best job prospects. I loved it: the classes were engaging, the professors and the people were amazing and offered a diverse plethora of life experiences and opinions, and I came to class every day because the experience of being there was frankly fun. I got to enjoy every second of my education, and as a result, I was able to lap up all of the information in my classes and do far better academically than I‚Äôd I had settled into a recognizable degree path for practicality‚Äôs sake.

Because I was studying shit that I actually enjoyed, and loved, I was able to thrive here. I even found a new passion through my undergraduate course work and radically altered the career trajectory I had aspired towards out of high school, all because my classes helped me realize what I was really, truly passionate about. What‚Äôs more, I was able to turn my academic achievement around and have been able to get into my two dream graduate programs in tandem with one another, towards my hopeful dream career. Obviously I haven‚Äôt done anything yet, but no doors were closed just because I chose a degree path for passion over practicality. 

My experience has only validated my feeling that you can study whatever you want in your undergraduate degree so long as you do it well and enthusiastically, and you‚Äôll have options ‚Äîprobably really good options‚Äî after you graduate. Just do what makes you happy, and be sure to do it really, really well. Garner practical skills along the way, for sure, because at the end of the day we all need a job when we graduate from the debt trap of higher education. But you‚Äôre doing yourself a gross disservice if you let anyone tell you that your education is reducible to a fixed, limited set of four year down-payments on a prefixed set of stable careers.

As a final note, my roommate studied CS. He wanted to be a lawyer when he started Cal but he found himself fascinated by CS, and switched degree paths out of newfound passion. Dude‚Äôs happy and fuckin thriving now, and his starting salary is higher than 90% of people‚Äôs mid-career expectations- money isn‚Äôt everything, but that‚Äôs nothing to scoff at when it comes to educational ROI. Everyone I know who did CS without passion because it was ‚Äúpractical‚Äù has either washed out or settled into a path that seems to make them visibly unhappy. Study what captures your imagination.",1585479117,1,0

"Hi! It really depends on your major and how you manage your time, but I'll speak from my experience. I am currently a freshman trying to declare CS and while the total time of lectures aren't that much, the homeworks/projects are quite time-taking. I would say in order to have a balanced schedule at Cal you really, and I mean really, have to be on task. Like ""if I am screwing around from 6:35-7:01 pm then I gotta study from 7:05 pm - 12:25 am"" kind of level. However, I am not a perfect human being and therefore even a little bit of procrastinating starts to add up. I don't have a quantitative hour for you but this is Cal, expect to be grinding for your midterms while your friends at other universities are partying. That being said, there are few extremely smart people who have the social life and still manage to get the grades. It all depends on how fast you can learn the material.

As for the units, I would say 15-16 are a good amount (for college of lns 2 breadths and 2 technicals are a good balance). In terms of studying, I would say it does take a lot of your time (tests are significantly harder than your hw assignments, at least for CS). Additionally, you may be part of clubs/research/other student orgs which are going to take quite a bit of your time as well.

"I'll list the pros and cons for campus housing and then answer the questions.

Pros: 

Social Life: On-campus housing is great for getting to know people. Most of my friends are people who lived in my building when I was on campus. It is really helpful getting to know people early on when starting college IMO. This is not something that will be easily available off-campus. Living in the dorms, you tend to find someone in your classes who you can study with, someone with similar interests who you can chill with. Very helpful IMO.

Food: A meal plan really helps. The food is by no means great in the dining halls, but cooking is a pretty solid time commitment. I hated the dining halls when I lived on campus, but a month into having to cook for myself and I was missing them.

Facilities: Laundry is really easy in the dining halls because it works using your CalID unlike most apartment complexes which use quarters. There are vending machines for quick snacks, the place is regularly cleaned, and there are lounges with pool and pingpong tables to chill at.

Cons:

Cost: Living on campus is more expensive than off campus. Depending on where and when you start looking, you can find places for as cheap as 800 a month before living expenses. Depending on how much you cook, could range from 200-600 a month. Almost always cheaper than on campus housing. For the size of the room, the price is kinda ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Off-campus is better for cost. Location depends, most on-campus housing is a 10-15 min walk from main campus, with Clark Kerr the furthest, about 25 minutes away while Blackwell is the closest, literally across the street. Off-campus housing is cheaper the further you get from campus, mine was 15 minutes from campus, near the Units.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Units: Very social, all kind of people here. Normally pretty close to campus, Unit 1 and 3 are like 10 minutes away while Unit 2 is a little more like 15. Rooms are kinda tight, and overall the buildings are not the greatest. Unit 3 is considered the worst cause of the room sizes and the building conditions.

Blackwell: Newest, great facilities, their own gym. Rooms are nice but small. Not the most social because of the very large floors. Right across from campus.

Clark Kerr: Furthest from campus. Rooms are pretty big though. Most residents are athletes or involved in Greek Life. Socially very active, although it is a different kinda social scene than the other dorms because of its significant Greek Life and athlete community.

Foothill: Close to campus, far from everything else. Honestly dk much, but keep hearing about facility issues.

3. Not sure about this. I loved living on campus, but moving off-campus after a year was great as well.

4. I'd say it is the same as on-campus. You do what you would like. It exists, but if you don't want to, no one will pressure you into doing it. All kinda social scenes exist and you can definitely find one that you are comfortable with.",1585475218,1,0

"Most people move out of the dorms after freshman year and move into an apartment in June, so you'll likely be paying that regardless. An apartment is cheaper than the dorms. Cost will vary hugely on location, if you share a room or have a your own room, size, number of roommates etc etc. ~$700-$1300 per month is typical. The lower end of that is if you share a room whereas the higher end is for a single. Also just can depend on luck. I've seen singles for 800 and doubles for 1000. I've seen doubles for 600 and singles for 1700. Sorry this is not helpful but it's hard to budget this far in advanced.

"1. It doesn't matter a huge amount on the job market. They're both good schools. But Berkeley's engineering/cs program is more highly ranked and is world renowned. If you pick Berkeley pick it because of the quality of education you'll be getting and the rigor, not because you think it's just gonna open some magic door for you, because it won't.

2. Experience, resumes, and interviews are literally the #1 most important thing to get a job. A school will help impress or get your name on the list perhaps but you're not gonna get any positions falling in your lap no matter where you go. CS interviews are intense and you have gotta master that stuff.

3. No they'll see ""good school"" and move on to see the actual skills you bring to the table.

4. If you feel you'll be happier at UCLA, then go to UCLA. You seem to be only focused on the getting a job part, and not your actual college experience. You'll probably be able to get a good job regardless, so for now worry about actually enjoying your college, both for the academic standards and the social environment.

5. Silicon valley is the biggest area for CS jobs, but it's not like you can't apply to them if you go to UCLA, and also still plenty of jobs in LA.

I'm curious how the student life is superior at UCLA though haha. Just that it's easier so there's more time for fun? That is definitely something to consider I suppose. Housing/food near UCLA is still a struggle because it's a rich neighborhood so it's not exactly student friendly, but I guess still probably easier than Berkeley. Or maybe you're saying you'd stay in the dorms. That would be depressing imo. I much prefer the culture and character of Berkeley over LA, the people in west LA would be a huge downside for me. But everyone's different, maybe you fit in better at UCLA idk.",1585472018,1,0

"Unfortunately not :(.

The only overlaps that can happen is if a breadth also covers a university requirement (like the HISTORY classes) or if a breadth also covers a major requirement.  Just a note though - you can only take two breadths per department.

So like, 2-3 months or so before the interviews would happy. That probably sounds very early, but people remember.

In the initial email , make sure you send your resume. That sounds ""aggressive"" but it's not:

(1) Made it easier for me to refer people because I could just forward the email to the recruiting head and say ""XYZ seems like a good fit"" and they'd have all the info needed.

"Also a recent alum from one of the business frats mentioned in the title. I more want to provide a different perspective and clarify things, rather than go point by point through OP's contentions. Not sure when op graduated, so maybe things have changed.

**tldr**: It's intense. You do a lot, but you also learn a lot. I wouldn't consider it hazing. Furthermore, a lot of it has good intentions and proven results. To some extent, pledging overlaps some of the though-love-tiger-mom pedagogy portrayed in ""Whiplash."" You're the only one who can decide if those ideas resonate.

I don't agree with comments on ""mental hazing."" Yeah I'll admit that pledging is not sit around in a circle like in first grade and sing songs about cash flows and balance sheets. Yeah, you'll be quizzed on the material. Yeah, you'll be criticized for making mistakes and not learning it. Yeah, it's intense. **But**, it's with the intention of helping pledges learn the concepts, and results in terms of placement speaks for themselves. There aren't any other business (primarily consulting) orgs on campus that place as consistently and as well as the frats. I mean, just look at DSP. Per year, they had 5-10 at Goldman alone, the rest going to BB/EBs, and a graduating class of \~20. I'd be surprised if any frats disregarded grades cause GPA is heavily emphasized in almost all forms of business recruiting. 

Furthermore, I think shared experience and challenges in general help bring people closer. Being a Cal student, chances are you probably have a friend who you got close to because you guys got screwed together in the same class. You see stuff like this on Overheard all the time where people will tag a friend under a 61b screen shot, ""remember when we got hillfingered."" I think shared pledging experience truly helps draw the fraternities closer together, and has personally helped connect me to alumni who are 10+ years removed. Granted, there are other ways to meet and make close friends. 

AFAIK, other than DSP, none of the orgs wet haze. Alcohol is provided, pledges are encouraged (but never forced) to drink, and sometimes first timers don't know they're limits and spend a good part of their night over the toilet. Fact is, this isn't  an usual occurrence in many first time drinking situations. Pledges who were struggling were always taken care of by brothers, and we never had any hospitalizations or anything serious happen. I guess you could consider this ""wet hazing"" if you're really straight edge... but c'mon...",1581203970,-2,0

"Hazing is a manipulation tactic, pure and simple. Once people are done with the process and finally get to be part of the group, they look back and think it was good that they were hazed. They say things like ""it built a brotherhood between us"" to justify it. In reality, they've just become indoctrinated.

It occurs at varying degrees. Some keep it to harmless company-team-building type competetions, which is okay most of the time. Others take it a step further and make their recruits/pledges do (essentially) slave labor with the promise that they'll get in if they do good work. And some abuse their power even more by making their wannabe members do fucked up and disgusting shit, forcing them to drink until they get alcohol poisoning, or in the worse case even torturing them.

Peer pressure is the ultimate tool for these people. By putting them in the stressful situation together, they see each other as teammates who need to band together. Its a big reason military boot camp is structured the way it is. Uniting new acquaintances with each other against a common evil makes them work harder and less likely to question authority. The trouble with this is that after hazing has gone too far and you want out, you are pressured to keep going because the other pledges will hate you for ""bitching out"" or ""quitting on us"". So you stay longer than you are comfortable with and potentially last long enough to become brainwashed yourself by the groupthink.",1581195155,3,0

"Berkeley grad from \~7 years ago, did investment banking at a ""good"" bank for a few years, was not in a business fraternity. I will say....for Berkeley specifically, it  helps.

look at it from the perspective of the banks. we would get  200+ applications from Berkeley alone via \[Symplicty or whatever you guys use now\], interview \~20 Berkeley kids first round, \~12 second, and give maybe \~6 offers, expecting \~3 to take it. took a lot of time, and HR didn't help us at all. the analysts and associates had to do it.

I'd say like 150 or so of these resumes were automatic ""nos"", for one reason or another: shitty freshman/sophomore internships, bad grades, typos/formatting errors, etc.

but that meant we had to winnow down \~50 pretty-good-to-sometimes-great resumes to \~20.

and an easy way to move from the ""maybe"" to the ""yes"" pile was always an analyst friend put in a good word with the person running analyst recruiting. say a former ""brother"" from your business fraternity.

that said, I never joined one, and they're not really a ""thing"" at Ivies/Stanford/etc, likely because there are proportionally at lot more ""spots"" at Goldman for Ivies/Stanford/etc vis-a-vis the number of applicants. Like, only the lamest fucking person in the world would spend her free time at the Investment Banking Networking Club unless she thought she needed to to get a job. 

So, if you don't join, that's totally cool. Just make sure you have an ""in"" if/when you're applying for junior year investment banking internships. 

Before I applied, I looked up Berkeley alums at the firms I was interested in on LinkedIn and sent an inMail message (or, more commonly, an email to the person's work address - just Google how to do this) asking to get coffee/chat on the phone. Alums were decently responsive, and I tried to pay back the favor when was an analyst/associate.

Throughout the semester our readers have been flagging homework submissions for potential academic misconduct. Over the past week we‚Äôve reviewed all the cases brought up so far and have found a non-trivial number of cases of academic dishonesty on the homework, including use of solutions from past semesters, and copying directly off another student‚Äôs work. 
Given our generous HW policy of multiple drops, allowing collaboration, hosting HW parties, counting 75% as full credit, and allowing resubmissions where you are allowed to look at solutions, we are quite disappointed that some students chose to cheat anyway --- when simple sincere effort would have gotten them full HW credit even if they were far behind in the course.
Given the volume of cases this semester, we‚Äôve decided to open up a form where you can confess to cheating on one or more homework assignments. 
If you have never looked at past official solutions, copied off someone, or let someone copy off you, you can stop reading here. We have a process in place which makes sure you will not be falsely punished.
We expect some degree of collaboration - collaboration is totally okay (and encouraged) as long as you did not copy solutions from someone (or let someone copy off you). We will not accuse you just because you have similar solutions to someone you worked with.
We also do not consider looking at official solutions for doing HW redos as cheating so don't worry about that.
EDIT: Using online resources to solve problems (as long as you are not copying verbatim) is fine and permitted under our course policies, as long as the resources are properly cited. If you used external resources and properly cited your sources, you do not need to worry. Similarly, if you used external resources and did not cheat, but forgot to cite, do not worry about it at this point ‚Äì we will not punish you for forgetting to cite, but please remember to do so in the future. If you insist on telling us that you forgot to cite, we have added an item to the form so that you can do so, without punishment ‚Äì feel free to submit if it helps you stay calm.
If you cheated and you confess to every incident, we will record this and simply apply the penalty of a 0% on each impacted homework assignment. Nothing more. With the P/NP policies in place and homework being a relatively small portion of your overall grade, this is really not that big a punishment to bear.
If you cheated and you do not confess, we will give you a score between -200% and a 0% in the entire homework category depending on how many homeworks you cheated on. We will also report you to the Center for Student Conduct with a recommendation for dismissal. Depending on the severity of the case we may also cap your overall grade at a D+ and convey a block-on-declaration if you are an L&amp;S student. (The special policies for declaration this semester will not apply to you vis-a-vis 70.)
We saw several cases where students attempted to cover up the fact that they were copying official solutions. Rest assured that this is pretty easy to spot. Changing notation here and there, replacing a couple words with propositional logic or other symbols, summarizing some English but having the exact same solution structure on many, many problems, etc. does not do the trick. You do not see what we see - the widely varied approaches, the messy tangents, the quirky notation of every other student who did not cheat. We also saw that if a student was flagged for one submission, it was highly likely (&gt;90%) that evidence for cheating would be found on other submissions. A body of evidence and pattern of behavior like this, even if each individual instance is not a direct copy of solutions, is enough to build an academic dishonesty case.
If you cheated, you have until Friday 4/24 at 11:59 PM (PDT) to confess at this form.",1587629914,1,0
I'm not gonna say people don't change...

"Hard to say overall. I think the university under Christ has been improving, she stopped the misuse of funds under Dirks, put more money towards infrastructure improvements, cut administrative bloat. The introduction of the data science major, big donations to a data hub building, the natural resources college, and Chou Hall have helped modernize and update the campus. The partnership with Microsoft for AI research and newer labs like BAIR seem promising. Our sports teams are also improving, which does affect our public reputation.

On the other hand, there are several factors that could take it downward. Decreasing funding from the state government hurts us, and we don't have enough private partnerships to make up for it. Microsoft is a good first step but it's not clear if there are any other corporate sponsors willing to contribute in the amount we need. Our alumni groups are fractured and relatively inactive compared to the organizations around the Ivy League and high-caliber schools. There have also recently been a string of scandals regarding the behavior of the student body: the video that went viral of students blocking white people from entering Sather Gate, the fires that were set and buildings that were vandalized after the 2016 election and Milo's speech, the kid who said he wanted to ""eliminate Palestinians"" in student government, and so on. These incidents tend to get a lot of attention and if they increase in frequency I could definitely see it harming our reputation.

"""[There were quite a few from Berkeley, I gather.](http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb1p3001qq&amp;doc.view=entire_text)"" Berkeley x Illuminati, baby!

I delved deep into the pits of the internet while bored in quarantine (+ after seeing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/glmr84/happy_109th_birthday_to_berkeleys_first/)) to uncover information on how Berkeley is one of the most prolific originators of membership for the [Bohemian Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Club) and [Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove); most, if not all, of our male chancellors are invitees, as are plenty of top professors, donors, and alumni.

To name a few: Charlie Hitch, John Henry Boalt, Albert H. Bowker, [Benjamin Ide Wheeler](https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf7r29p3kg/), Clark Kerr, Robert Gordon Sproul (who also founded the [California Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Club) himself), Ernest Lawrence, John A. McCone, Jack London, Porter Garnett, Ira Michael Heyman, Dean McHenry, David A. Shirley, Glenn T. Seaborg‚Äîmany more are mentioned in the archives without a name. And some were offered invitations to Bohemian, but chose rival clubs like the [Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_(club))‚Äî[Earl Chiet](https://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt4199n8f6;NAAN=13030&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=d0e17282&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e17282&amp;brand=oac4) being a good example.

Berkeley's connection to the Bohemian runs very, very deep; in fact, the de-naming of Boalt was because of a speech he delivered to the Bohemian Club titled ""The Chinese Question"" being resurfaced. Librarians attempting a renovation of Bancroft Library have held fundraisers at the Bohemian, albeit sometime ago (obviously, more recent events won't be public information). During the Free Speech Movement, members of the Bohemian Club were in charge of both the entire University of California (Clark Kerr) and the CIA (John McCone). This led McCone, a critic of Kerr's, to help other agencies in blacklisting him from holding federal office. I bet Reagan mentioned Kerr to his Berkeley friends at this very table, despite talks of business being usually left outside the retreat.

That's funny you say that because I actually had the opposite experience.

The tests were more simplistic but also more formulaic and you couldn't get stuck or you'd lose the whole question.

"That‚Äôs very true, but I also feel like within the classes themselves cheating is even more harmful because the homework is great help for the exams. It‚Äôs probably a bit easier in fact, but I genuinely believe if you can‚Äôt do the homework you can‚Äôt do the exams. And that if you‚Äôre able to eventually do the exams, it‚Äôs because you worked hella hard to learn the material in a much more complicated way than simply doing the homework. 

For example, Hilfinger‚Äôs 61b exams this semester used questions that built off the homework with little explanation of the assignment, aka if you didn‚Äôt do the homework or understood it deeply you were screwed. Additionally there were simple assignments on implementing BASIC bubbling up/down, or just a very straightforward assignment on sorting algorithms... if you couldn‚Äôt do those assignments you definitely wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do the exams. Lastly, some content was solely on the homework and not in slides at all. So even if you initially cheated, the pretty much only way to learn the material is through doing the assignments, so you might as well have done it on time anyway. 

In 61a the homework may have been not quite as straightforward, but I distinctly remember that after the policy on only doing 10 labs you could stop going to lab, I didn‚Äôt do the assignment on scheme. Then when the exam came closer, I realized that I didn‚Äôt understand what scheme even was and ended up doing the entire scheme lab weeks later to learn the material.",1589762614,1,0

I would take Data 8 in your very first semester.  You get some registration priority that you won‚Äôt get in later semesters.

If Italy is any indication, short of a China-style militarized lockdown, this isn't going to go away  anytime soon (and there is debate whether corona is really gone from China or if it's going to flare up soon once the government can't hide it anymore) so we will have to continue social distancing, although I certainly hope we aren't under stay-at-home orders until next year.  

What I would hope to see is a soft re-opening of campus, where non-essential buildings like Esh/MLK stay closed, and all classes are still online except for exams, labs, performing arts, PE, and other classes that require being in person etc.  Don't allow student groups to reserve rooms on campus so that exams can be more spaced out in more classrooms.  This would eliminate the huge spreading vector that the massive lecture classes would be, and I could imagine people whose families live in Fremont or something just deciding to stay home if social life was still shut down and they are in a major whose classes don't suffer enormously from being online, reducing crowding in the dorms/apts.

It's still here, and people are still getting it, just not at a rate that overfills hospitals and makes the NY state department buy 100,000 body bags preemptively.

When the curve is under control, you can't just go ""good job guys, everything resume again"". Because that accomplishes jack shit, there'll be another outbreak. The curve is only dipped because of social distancing. The majority of Americans will have not had the virus, and there is no herd immunity as a result.

So what's after social distancing? The reality is that there is legitimately no plan. Like no one has a plan, there are multiple thinktanks developing plans, some of the involve working for a week, then a week a social distancing, some of them call for splitting who's allowed to work for each day by your last name, etc.

In any case, there's a pretty good chance college, which *can* be done online, induces mass domestic and international migration, crams a bunch of people into dorms, dining halls, and lecture halls, will not be part of the plan after we're done. 

It's safer to just do it online until we have a vaccine, and it actually helps the rest of the workforce start up again.

The workload consists of:  

1. 5, decently long projects that get consecutively harder with each project (4 of them are java projects, the first is SQL and is pretty easy). Most people take about 20-30 hours on each one, though this varies greatly by project. some say the last one takes like 30-45 hrs.

I don't know what hilf's assignments look like, but I would recommend trying to implement various data structures (resizing array, hash map, red-black tree) and if you get stuck and have to look something up, that's fine. If you can, lookup just enough to get an idea of what to do next and then try to do as much as you can yourself. A few days to a week later, try again without any help.

"Like the other commenter said, math background matters a lot more than physics background. I think the case is closed based on what you describe; you should absolutely take 5A.

5A is *very* different from 7A in that all of 7A is covered in roughly the first half of the course and from a much more mathematical perspective. 5A problems are harder but force you to actually understand the math and derivations of classical mechanics problems, which leaves you basically being able to derive anything you'd want to in classical mechanics at the end of the course. 5A also uses almost no numbers, which in my opinion alone makes it a much more fun experience than 7A.

The rest of the course teaches the basis of resonance/oscillators and special relativity, which both get even more intensely mathy (deep understanding relies on knowing some linear algebra concepts, they teach the necessary diffeq stuff). This stuff is fascinating and well worth learning, I'd argue!

The 5 sequence is also a lot more coherent (which is a matter of opinion, but I'd stand by it) in that in both 5B and 5C, you can see all the time how things you covered in the previous course(s) appear again. And as a side note, I took 5A/B alongside EE16A/B, and 5A/B made 16A/B feel *much* easier in comparison (with the one exception being 16A/B's help in having a feel for circuits that most of the 5B kids didn't have).

I've heard that the 5 series covers significant portions of the first parts of 105/137A/110A, but I can't confirm that for myself. Take that for what you will, but I don't think I know anybody who's regretted their choice to take the 5 series. The grading is also generally lenient and the professors excellent.",1582231562,1,0

The north side of campus (where I live now) definitely is a lot quieter, and I tend to see more working adults, families, and graduate students than undergrads walking around. Friday/Saturday nights on the streets of Telegraph or Durant are typically full of loud drunk students either walking between parties or going out for food, so if that is the kind of student-y that you are trying to avoid, definitely look for places further north. Of course, just going a mile or two in any direction away from campus reduces the student vibe a lot.",1582231264,1,0

"no particular advice except keep practicing and don't be afraid to ask for help but... big ass mood, I feel like most people are not very good test-takers but are able to knock out assignments easily and I've always been the opposite so 61b was relatively frustrating for me compared to 61a/70 :((",1582229553,1,0

Thanks! Could you not complete the lab work independently and submit it yourself outside of lab however?",1582228360,1,0

I saw someone advertising [Ursatech](https://ursatechberkeley.com/about/). I think it's their first year. I assume they're easy based on the shitty website + no previous projects. Idk if the experience would be worth it though.,1580133400,1,0

"I think the stress of the gpa requirement made me work harder than I would have, and as a result, I've been doing pretty well academically. It's kind of wearing off a bit now after declaring but the foundational study skills I built over freshman year helped.",1580129283,1,0
"I didn‚Äôt even have a clue at my major or take a single non GE class at Berkeley until my sophomore year here, and I‚Äôd never have gotten into EECS with my weaker technical skills and lack of ability to pre- lock into engineering.

Getting the opportunity to declare CS after finding out it was what I wanted to do, rather than being forced into something as demanding as CS here without making sure it‚Äôs what I wanted has been a blessing for me. 

I have a few EECS friends who don‚Äôt really like their courses, have much interest in the material, or have much desire to do the jobs they would be most qualified for after graduating, but instead just feel obligated to stay the course. I‚Äôd not enjoy a situation like that for any major.",1580125475,1,0
