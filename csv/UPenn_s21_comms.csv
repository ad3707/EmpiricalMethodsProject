"I'm a current undergraduate at Penn and looking back I have to say I was really fortunate to have not had any major periods of severe social anxiety, despite all the pressure to succeed even here at the university. I don't say this to boast or suggest that having social anxiety is something you should feel bad about, but I have learned a lot from my time at Penn and maybe this can help the author of this subreddit:

1. Surrounding yourself with good people is one of the wisest things you can do. Whether your current challenge is dealing with social anxiety or finding the right college, people who genuinely always want to do the right thing are a blessing to surround yourself with and an incredibly underappreciated asset as a young person. You'll be able to tell them the good and the bad going on in your life and know you're dealing with honest advice, counsel, or encouragement.
2. Focus on what you want to do in life. Steve Jobs' has an iconic quote: "" Your time is limited, so **don't** waste it living someone else's life. **Don't be trapped by dogma** \- which is living with the results of other people's thinking. **Don't** let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.""  A lot of anxiety, and I imagine social anxiety, comes from wanting to pursue the ""right path"" set out by others, and feeling unworthy when you maybe don't achieve that when others do. However, what is ultimately going to make you both the most fulfilled and the most exceptional version of you possible is pursuing things that genuinely interest you. You won't worry about what other people think, and you'll be living a great life so when you do interact with others, you'll be excited to share the things you're doing and they will hopefully be excited by your passion.
3. The important things in life really are the most important things. Your family, relationships, personal hobbies, quirky personality traits, are the things that comprise the core of any person. Celebrate and love yourself for it, and make sure to put in the time so each of those things that matter to you now always matters to you.                        

I am by no means qualified to be a life coach, and there are exceptions to all of these, but broadly speaking I think you'll have much more confidence in yourself and enjoy your interactions with others if you remember these three things. I have fallen short MANY times in achieving those, so I know from experience that they are helpful. Just remember you are an awesome person who deserves to enjoy life.",1614816531,2,0

"When you call their 24hr line, someone answers and gets some basic information, (Name, Phone Number, Penn ID, Address, and whether or not you are in imminent danger) and then they'll connect you to someone else. This person usually asks a few questions (name, phone number, and address) just to make sure they've got the right info since they're all working remotely right now. Then you just talk to them about anything. I've called a few times in the past few weeks: once about grappling with a decision that made me anxious at and then a second time with general anxiety about things. Most of the folks you talk to here are just there to listen and help soothe you in a way.

CAPS can't release any info unless you're in imminent danger or will be a threat to yourself or others and even then it won't get out to any Penn profs. 

Afterwards, you may get a follow up call later in the week asking if you'd like more regular appointments with a therapist of some sort and that process seems to take a while. I wanted one and it's taking a while because I'm in a different state. 

One note to make is that some counselors are just crappy and probably had a shitty day or something. It sucks because one time I called I got a counselor that was literally the most unhelpful person and I left the call feeling more helpless than before. Tried again the next night and I got the sweetest woman alive who helped me feel better about my choices and I was able to think with a clear head in what felt like weeks and make a decision on something I had been rocking back and forth on for months practically literally right after the call.

What's good about him is that the class is fair, you put in the work, you reap the benefits. After you attend the 3 hour lecture on Tuesday (completely messing up that entire day tbh) you have the entire week to worry about orgo. That's the beauty of the 3 hour lecture, you get it all done with all at once. He assigns weekly homeworks so you never ever fall behind and his exams are relatively straightforward. They're 50% multiple choice and free response. He also posts his very well annotated slides and the pacing of the class is never too intense. Especially because the class is mainly LPS students, they have a much chiller culture and they spend a lot of the lecture time asking questions that completely meander off.

While I agree that the vaccine is likely going to be very effective, it seems shortsighted and reckless to throw away our other precautions against spread until we have a better idea of what protection looks like long term. Hopefully more studies will come out in the next few months that makes this discussion moot, but until then, this seems like a safe move on Penn‚Äôs part.",1619137249,4,0

Also, what does Penn being isolated have anything to do with this? If we‚Äôre vaccinated, we rarely transmit the virus either.

Instead, I would suggest you make your alternate for each request in the order the primary one of the one below it (ex. for your 3rd request, the alternate should be the primary request of your 4th request, your 4th request's alternate your 5th request's primary, etc.).

"I finished college a semester early and used that ""last semester"" to work on a startup. Honestly sometimes I think I should have just stayed in school for the last semester and taken some interesting courses, worked on my startup at a more relaxed pace, and enjoyed college life a little longer. The thing is, unless you're making a decent salary, there really aren't a lot of ways to enjoy life as a ""young adult"" straight out of college, especially when your friends and peers are still in college. My experience in that ""last semester"" was pretty lonely: my friends were all busy and on a much different schedule than I was, and I was pretty much just working and hiking and not doing anything else. It wasn't until I moved to a new city to work and go to grad school that I actually started to have fun again.

Traveling during the ""last semester"" instead of working or being in school sounds fun, but don't underestimate the impact of a semester off for a young person's prospects. Yes, there are plenty of people who will understand the whole ""gap semester"" or ""backpacking through Europe"" thing, but these days employers are more likely to look at that kind of thing negatively. If you want to graduate a semester early, it's a good idea to secure a job first, then move the start date back so that you have something concrete to come back to before you set off. That way you'd be able to enjoy your travels more too - I did something similar out of grad school. I secured a job, then moved the start date back so I could spend 6 weeks traveling to visit my friends around the country. I felt incredibly free during that time, since I didn't have any obligations during that time including not having to search for a job.

1)  this is honestly how proofs work. they have to be rigorous so if you forget to state an assumption that feels obvious then like boo. I remember tons of hs math comp kids were complaining about it, because they knew all the material already but were losing points because they weren't rigorous or thorough (while I was grinding just to understand the material sooo)

2) write more. sometimes it helps to slightly blab, because you want to make sure you cite everything!! explain every single assumption. Constantly ask yourself even stupid stuff like how do you know x is even because that might end up on the rubric?

"Took both first semester. I took 312 with Peterka and 430 with Tony. If you‚Äôre chilling in 160, both classes are relatively trivial. If you took AP Stat in HS, the latter half of 430 is much easier. I got As comfortably in both classes. Peterka is a great professor. His grading is reasonable and frequently gives homework extensions. Tony is the GOAT. That entire course has two grades, your midterm and final. No homework whatsoever. For context though, I didn‚Äôt attend a single lecture of either class. If you had to choose one, I would do 312 since 160 is basically 430.",1617055050,1,0
Anyone hear from Mike Oxlong?,1617050488,4,0
"To describe each briefly: 312 is lin alg with mostly computations; 314 is a proof-based lin alg course looking at vector spaces more abstractly, defintely unique from and more theoretical than 240; 370 is a first semester algebra course covering group theory, modules, and intro to rings; 371 is a continuation of 370 focusing more on ring theory.  Since there's a lot of overlap between 312 and 314, you'd only get credit for one of those, but 370 and 371 are definitely distinct from eachother and 312/314. 370/371 each assume that you have prior proof experience, and I believe they both require 314 as a prereq (although its not very heavily enforced, especially if you know how to do proofs), so I'd recommend taking 314 before either of those.  I don't know too much about 312, but from what I've heard it'll be less challenging than the other options. 

I took 314 and 502/503 (the masters versions of 370/371) and each of them have probably been my most fun/interesting math courses taken at Penn.  I've heard that the quality of 370/371 depends a lot on the professor so I can't really vouch for what those are going to be like next year, but Prof. Bell is going to be teaching 314 and I'm absolutely loving her in 502/503 this year.  She's really good at explaining the material intuitively and bringing in more complex topics in an accessible way (for ex., we proved the banach-tarski principle in a pset last semester, really cool stuff!!), all while keeping the lectures very engaging.  The 314 content is also really interesting, so I'm sure it'll be a really good experience with her teaching it.",1617050167,2,0

"You should absolutely take MATH 314. While MATH 312 is technically sufficient for getting the hang of linear algebra, it‚Äôs an awful lot like MATH 240. In MATH 314, you really get to know the subject in greater depth. More importantly, MATH 314 serves as (a) a liaison into higher mathematics (including 370/371), and (b) an introduction to important mathematical formalisms used in advanced physics.

So, if you end up wanting to take advanced physics courses in QM, GR, SM, etc., then you certainly want to have MATH 314 under your belt. Then, if you want to get to know the field of algebra even better, certainly take MATH 370/371. These will also be helpful in advanced physics courses (e.g. in quantum mechanics, you talk a lot about group theory in the context of matrix representations, which is the majority of what you learn in MATH 370).

In summary: Take MATH 314, and if the material resonates with you, then take 370/371.",1617048894,2,0

"If you have previous linear algebra experience (I had a little from high school, but no college courses), MATH 312 is very manageable. Not a whole lot of work besides a pset every ~10 days. My grade got bumped, too. Peterka is a kind professor. My attention started slipping last semester when we started doing matrices with complex numbers and complex numbers with change of bases, but overall it was fine. Keep in mind he's only been teaching online, so the ratings don't reflect his in-person quality, which is almost certainly better.

STAT 430 is shit (taking this semester). I'm not absorbing any of the material and only got through the first half because it's identical to CIS 160 probability, but more applied, so a bit easier. The second half is just absolute nonsense. Not much calculus is needed, but it's just incredibly uninteresting. It feels like we're doing the same ""Poisson process"" or ""exponential distribution"" or ""normal distribution"" problems over and over, with a slight twist. As long as you took CIS 160, the first half will mostly be second nature with a bit of second guessing. I got an A in CIS 160, but I'm P/F-ing STAT 430 because it sucks and there are very few resources available. Also, the final is 50% this semester. The fuck?

So coming back to school after some work years makes everything seem difficult as i dont remember much. But from a general perspective, its not all that bad if you are thorough with your math.  However, some classes are more difficult than the others. If you are in MEAM, you will have a math requirement of 2 courses. I have heard of students failing midterms and having a lowered gpa due to the math course being too hard (i haven't taken one yet).

Average class size for a normal course would be around 30ish students but some popular courses like MEAM520,513,510,etc. may have ~100 students (at least for the online format).",1616978175,1,0

I recognize MEAM 520 as the intro to robotics class and I plan on concentrating in robotics! 

If I could follow up, how would you gauge the difficulty of the classes you've been taking? Would you say they're more difficult than your upper level undergrad courses or about the same? And what appears to be the average class size? Thanks in advance.",1616977006,1,0

I was really fortunate to get an out-of-state scholarship at the Big 10 school so the difference in tuition would have been close to 150k for the remainder of undergrad. I'm fairly certain I would still be in debt today had I gone to Penn as an undergrad. That said, I was an Accounting major back then and later went on to engineering.

I'm a rising sophomore as well and have to say second semester was difficult socially. I drifted from many of my virtual first semester friends and struggled to get into the social/party scene as I am not in Greek life.

"I'm a rising senior who came to Penn as an undecided major. Now, I'm double-majoring in computational biology and computer science. To answer your questions, (1) yes, take intro-level courses in your first semester, and (2) afaik, there is no ""special"" support for undecided students in CAS. Honestly, all the majors that you listed as your potential interests (i.e., computer science, bioengineering, pre-med) are p popular tracks. With that said, there are certain courses that might be easier to get into with a declared major. 

Now, I didn't plan on pursuing biology or CS. I thought I'll be graduating with an econ degree but I dropped all econ-related classes my first day of school and instead sat in BIOL 101 and CIS 110 for fun. Some kids start school knowing exactly what they will pursue in their undergraduate education, but you'll find that many don't. Even if you start off thinking pre-med, you can veer off-course and that's completely normal. 

This year should be all about exploring your options. Penn accepted you as an undecided major, and there is a reason for that. Based on your hs stats, the admissions must've thought you are a polymath with potential shown in many different areas. With all that peer pressure coming at you, it can be hard not to feel anxious but doing it your own way will help you in the long run. Past that phase where everyone asks you ""what are you majoring in?"" nobody gives a shit about what you study but instead they'll be interested in who you are, what you like, and how passionate you are in your work/study. Be yourself and you will be ready for college. In the meanwhile, there are a couple of things I wish I had done during my freshman year.

1. Know who to talk to when help is needed. I was too shy to talk to professors but they are really helpful when it comes to getting academic advice.  They could recommend appropriate courses and even get you a permit if needed. Soon, you'll realize that you can (not always) make exceptions to certain rules by talking to the right professors. 
2. Write down your plans. What is your plan A, B, C, etc.? What are the risks that come with pursuing one plan over the other?
3. After you've executed your plan, always reflect. If you were satisfied with your choice, why? If you weren't, what could be improved? 

Be systematic in your approaches to avoid wasting your energy and eventually burning out. Wish you the best at Penn!",1621246532,3,0

"I‚Äôm not at Penn yet (‚Äò25) but I accidentally found that if you trick yourself into thinking that the trigger is something else, it can really help. 
Ex: One of my triggers is gum popping. One day in class I heard a pop and started to get upset until I realized it was one of my classmates messing with a toy that made a very similar sound. When I realized it wasn‚Äôt actually someone popping their gum, I instantly felt better. From then on, whenever someone popped their gum in class, I tried to imagine the sound was instead coming from my classmate playing with that toy and if I focused hard enough on convincing myself that was true, it would work and I would feel better.
I don‚Äôt really know why it helps. Maybe the stimulus causing the sound plays a larger role than the sound itself when it comes to a trigger (probably why I can tolerate my dog eating her food but sometimes can‚Äôt even eat at the dining table with my family)
It has worked for me a couple times but it takes a lot of focus. It really helps when I‚Äôm in a situation where I can‚Äôt leave/block out the trigger (like in class and stuff)

"If you're considering a transfer into SEAS for bioengineering, heavily recommend you take BE 100 in the fall and make that decision by the end of freshman year at the latest. SEAS majors start to specialize pretty quickly, so if you want to transfer, the quicker the better.

On the engineering side, you can reach out to [Research and Academic Services](https://ras.seas.upenn.edu/) and get some advice about what your different options might look like. For instance, if you want a bit more flexibility in bioengineering, there's the BAS in biomedical science.

Honestly though, in the college you don't even have to declare until end of sophomore year, right?

"If you are a typical Penn 1st year student, with a fairly rigorous HS backgound you will find that the courses are tough but reasonable and the curves ok.  I am more familiar with SEAS and CAS and don't know how Wharton curves work.  If you are a engineering major taking, for example, a lot of CIS courses, it is my view that these introductory courses are a lot of work (sometimes 2-3x the work of other courses) and some are very tough.  If you pre med, for example, introductory bio and chem are not easy, for sure, but very manageable if you took AP Chem and AP Bio and tougher if you did not.  If you did not have a challenging HS curriculum, I think you might find the work more difficult, but you can do quite well -- but you need to keep your schedule manageable.",1614755301,4,0
"Kai, hope you are doing well and not sure if you have already applied or if you were accepted or not or if you are thinking of coming to Penn.  I am sorry that you struggle with severe social anxiety.  Whatever college you go to, and as much as it may be difficult, you will probably make a lot of progress by being in a setting where there are a lot of people struggling in varying degrees to find their niche socially.  You will find that there are many persons like you that struggle to varying degrees and I am sure you will see that there are many places where you can get refuge such as CAPS, joining mentoring and mental health organizations, and just being open and honest with your classmates.  My suggestion is to force yourself, no matter how difficult, to get involved with things that you have a passion for; it could be anything from music and dance to tutoring local kids or joining an academic club or support group.  Within those groups you will find some friends. Penn is a big place with great diversity and I don't think you should be discouraged from coming to Penn because of your social anxiety, in fact, there are so many opportunities to be engaged in things you enjoy that it may just be the place.  So, I would encourage you to attend if the school otherwise is a fit for you. Good luck",1614754458,2,0

"I've never sought a diagnosis for social anxiety but I have always been uncomfortable around strangers, large groups of people, public speaking, etc. I'm extremely introverted and had the same concerns coming to Penn. After being here for 2 years, I still have trouble approaching people and haven't gone to any parties, but I've been able to make friends in my dorm  and classes, and I've found some small clubs that I look forward to going to each week.

In the beginning, I'd always eat alone in the dining halls and watch YT or TV shows w/ headphones on my phone. I'd spend most of my free time in my dorm room on my computer and felt very isolated at various parts of my freshman year. After a few weeks, though, I had a small friend group to eat with in the dining halls and to discuss philosophy, politics, and to just joke around with. After Covid, I've lost touch with basically everyone, but I've also made new friends from online clubs and feel more comfortable meeting people on my floor and classes since I've had a positive experience doing so before.

So, the lesson I learned is that it's perfectly fine to be introverted and have time to yourself, but it isn't healthy to actively avoid socialization, especially with there being so many interesting people at Penn! Watching anime on your phone in the corner of a dining hall is fun sometimes, but it becomes extremely isolating after a bit. Don't be afraid to meet your floormates, talk to people in the classes you enjoy, and maybe find a club or two. If things don't work out at first, it doesn't mean that you're stuck with not having a solid friend group. Keep talking and asking people about their interests, and you'll find friends. Ask them about their friends, and soon you'll have chances to get to know awesome people!

Also, in class, don't be afraid to ask questions and talk to professors after class or during office hours. Initially I was scared to go to office hours, but the environment tends to be really relaxed and it's a great chance to ask deeper questions about the material and meet other students as well!",1614724364,3,0

"Hi there! I'm sure a lot of people here have social anxiety -- it's fairly common among college students. I think there are a lot of resources here that can help you, most notably CAPS.

I will be honest: there are aspects of starting college that can make things more stressful. It's a lot of meeting new people, there are parties with large groups, etc. But, I think there can also be smaller gatherings through your college house, multicultural organizations, clubs, etc that be more your vibe. You will also find that there's a number of people that are just as stressed as you. Penn Face is a real thing (look it up) that makes people seem better than they really are. 

Hang in there -- college will be hard at times, but it will be fun at times. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to have ""the perfect college experience"" because there's no such thing. Do the things you like, hang out with the people that you vibe with, and ask for help when you need it. As always, you can PM if you have questions or want to talk to someone",1614721056,2,0

I'm a happily-married staff member, but I remember how Naive College Me thought I'd meet my future spouse during college (I didn't). ""Penn Marriage Pact"" caught my eye, and I'll admit that I was *super* curious what sort of questions this questionnaire would include.
 

They're good questions for matching people up‚Äîno doubt about that‚Äîbut I'd totally be wary of handing intimate details about yourself over to...whoever's running the show here? 


I reviewed their ""Data Principles and Practices"", and...yikes. ""We don‚Äôt get your IP address"". So you have my name, pretty much every protected characteristic about me under federal law, *and* how much I like kinky sex, but *thank goodness* you don't have my IP address, because that would just be Too Much.


The document also neglects to answer some pretty important questions: how this information is stored? Who can access it? When does it get removed? If their security and privacy measures were anywhere near professional-grade, they'd want to brag about how secure it is, so I think we can safely assume that the answers are: ""Insecurely"", ""Anybody who has a hand in running the site"", and ""Never"". 


Even if the site runners have the best of intentions, I'd be concerned about the site getting hacked by an outside party. This is a veritable treasure trove of information. I'm surprised they didn't ask for your social security number, just for good measure.


You've barely entered the prime years of your existence, you're going to an Ivy League institution, and I think you're pretty great. You probably don't need to be stressing about marriage just now, and you *definitely* shouldn't be handing your information over to some dodgy site.

"FGLI nursing student here. Welcome! You'll be pleased to know Penn boasts the best nursing school in the world, some of the best professors and network connections you could ask for, and great clinical experiences. This is all great, but there's still a lot of hard work, confusing requirements, and definitely some imposter syndrome that you have to overcome. Be sure to find a group of friends (they don't have to be in nursing) who are supportive and encouraging. It makes the greatest difference. 

Hardest class is probably A&amp;P, but with a good tutor and study habits, it's not as bad as people say. I was also scared about the transition to Penn. I did the Pre-Freshman Program, a program primarily for FGLI students to help them transition over the summer. Definitely reach out to someone at Penn SON to ask about PFP and whether you can be considered as a candidate. \*it's technically invite only but it never hurts to ask for an invite ;)\*

As for exams, I wouldn't worry about that right now. It's hard to say since things change from semester to semester and also the online learning component is weird. Tough but not impossible is the general consensus.

For instance, I had a bad a quarter in which my grades were lower but my grandma died everyone accepts grandma death. If it's just a weird bad time you can explain what you learned from that quarter. Depending on the program it's better to try to retake it if you can.  A p/f might demonstrate that you didn't quite get the material or that you aren't capable of delving deeper into that subject in the future.",1614294739,4,0

"I mean, Wharton is one of the best finance schools. Penn Bio is sorta a drag. A lot of LSM kids drop LSM by their junior year because of the lower Penn Bio gpa + increased time studying.  

Honestly, if you are set on Finance, Penn is the way to go. But keep in mind that Penn doesn't really have great tech exits if you are thinking of exploring. The best tech exits are still out of Stanford, MIT, Harvard, Cal. Penn is hyper-optimized to have their students exit into consulting and finance. (I was in the former.) 

But, you can't go wrong with picking either. The companies that recruit at the T5 recruit at Penn because of how pre-professional / hardworking the students are.",1614294023,1,0

"Honestly, the strongest dual degree programs in terms of recruiting and ""prestige"" are Huntsman and M&amp;T. Those feel like the strongest ones on campus. 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of your job recruiting, there is a slight benefit for Huntsman and M&amp;T at particular companies. I remember that Mckinsey does a special info session for Huntsman kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

But after you leave Penn, there is no difference. 

&amp;#x200B;

Penn has created an academic system that silos students and creates more pressure. The rest of the world isn't privy to this system. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just study what you want whether coordinated or uncoordinated and things will fall into place.",1614288792,5,0

"As a dual degree student, that‚Äôs SO incredibly untrue.

There are also positions at some companies that are reserved specifically for those dual degree program students.
