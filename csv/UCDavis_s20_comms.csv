The information for admitted students says you need to have your grad student ID done by early August. So gotta figure it's not too long after that especially since you have to be in Davis to do that.,1580122718,1,0
"Davis doesn't have any real clubs, there's a restaurant (Ketmoree) that turns into a club on weekend nights. Davis is very gay friendly and there is an LGBTQIA center in the middle of campus, along with many LGBT student associations, but there isn't really a ""gay scene"". Sac has a gayborhood with several gay clubs/bars, but I would describe it as more cozy and friendly versus Weho which I would say is more showy and flamboyant.

UCD has a student run radio as well ( [https://kdvs.org/](https://kdvs.org/) ) and a craft center ( [https://campusrecreation.ucdavis.edu/recreation/craft-center](https://campusrecreation.ucdavis.edu/recreation/craft-center) ).",1580122079,1,0

"My main issue with UCSB was the fact that you are technically admitted as a pre-econ major. Which means, like the other guy said, you have to get a 70% in one of their classes (I believe it's intermediate micro) to be admitted. Sounds easy enough but based on what I read on the UCSB sub the class is pretty hard, a lot of econ majors mentioned it was the hardest class they ever took in their time there. Idk about you OP but I worked my ass off in CC to get to this point and I didn't want to risk it all because of one class. If you make it through though, I believe their program is quite good.

I would say the Davis econ program is decent. There are a fair number of good teachers who care about students and teaching and there are people you should avoid. UCD Econ's department policy is to curve grades to a B- average, so I don't think it's incredibly difficult to do well here. 

But there are other factors you should consider. A BIG reason I chose Davis is because I'm from the Bay and it's close to home. I did not want to be on my own for the first time 300 miles away from my family. Visit both schools if you have the chance, it'll make things a lot easier for you because you do not want to live in a place that you're not gonna vibe with.",1580109366,1,0

"I chose ucd over sb (and I transferred from sbcc) mainly because the econ program at sb is kinda sketchy cus if you get less than a b- in the intro classes you get bumped out of the program. So basically they admit a bunch of econ majors then weed them out and force them to choose other majors or keep retaking that class. Plus, sb has a certain scene that i was less comfortable with compared to davis. Im graduated now though so im talking about like 3 years ago, prob the same",1580108191,1,0

"Honestly, experience isn‚Äôt everything in these types of positions because they‚Äôre super entry level. The biggest thing I keep in mind is that I‚Äôm looking for someone who will be reliable once I train them. Some of the biggest things I looked for were:
-Strong communication/customer service skills: someone who is able to adapt and interact with people from different backgrounds (staff, faculty, students at all levels). Sometimes professors just aren‚Äôt pleasant to work with, how will a candidate handle this (within reason)?
-Ability to work independently, often doing mundane tasks. 
-Ability to look ahead and organize
-Ability to follow directions: if the job posting tells you to attach references and your course schedule, ATTACH THEM! Otherwise you‚Äôll probably be disregarded

A lot of times someone who has worked retail exhibits a lot of these qualities.

"Regular Economics is a B.A. Not sure if it's considered a STEM degree though. Managerial Economics is however considered a STEM degree now and is a B.S.

If you're trying to decide on which one to take, my recommendation is based on what do you wanna do? Regular Econ is like Econ at any university and is more theory based, and usually since it's researched based, you should go for a PhD or at least a Masters (My personal opinion), because again it's more theory and researched based.

Managerial Economics is like a regular Business Degree, even though it's a B.S. I just graduated with this and took usual business classes like Accounting, Marketing, Real Estate, Finance etc. You should do this degree if your going for a classic business job rather than a research based job. As far as getting a higher degree it depends on the job. Some business jobs you only need a bachelors and some you need a Masters, but in classic business jobs, you can def succeed far with a Bachelors.

"To respond to your edits:

After it hits $15/hour CA minimum wage will be adjusted for inflation every year from then until the end of time under current law. And that info is mentioned in the ballot but because of the strict layout guidelines for fee referendums and the rules on what can and can't be said on a ballot dictated by UCOP we can't go into this level of detail on the ballot. It is mentioned though (without any detailed explanations of course cause f\*cking UCOP).",1582232268,1,0
"I'm in ASUCD so that number comes directly from the ASUCD Controller (the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations Officer for ASUCD). It's the increased costs associated with wage increases over the next 10 years, (based on what we know minimum wage will be over that period) but year by year the cost increases are $400,000-$500,000 when you add on stipend to hourly wage transitions (to clarify stipend to hourly isn't in the $3.5M number, that's just rising minimum wage)

And yeah, the UC Office of the President (UCOP) has rules and regulations regarding the layout of fee referendums and its complete shit, ASUCD tried to write it in a way that made sense to students and their legal teams rewrote like 30-40% of the referendum so it would be in legal-ese (so almost completely incomprehensible as a ballot measure for students to vote on). The effect and intent of the referendum stayed the same though.",1582231886,1,0
"That kind of information would be helpful if it was explained, and sources were provided, in the ballot measure or as a supplement to it -- at the very least provided on the elections website.

Where does that $3.5MM figure come from? Is this immediate need or 9-year projected need? CA Min wage increases will hold at $15 in 2022. Will ASUCD just deficit for 8 more years until that annual increase plugs the gap?  This is all info voters should be provided in the ballot measure or a supplement.

Poorly-written ballot measures were always a problem in ASUCD when I was active in it, and it looks like it never stopped.",1582231158,1,0

"So based on minimum wage increases under current law, and assuming no changes to the number of employees or how many hours they work, ASUCD can expect $3.5M in increased annual costs (that's just to account for minimum wage going up), the university also wants all stipend employees in ASUCD to switch to hourly rates, best estimates for that are between $1.6M and $1.9M per year in increased costs. That's $5.1M to $5.4 million.

Also need to take into account that inflation is going on in the background, and while you can't know what that will be over a 10 year period until it happens, if costs go up around $400,000/year now 10 years from now you could expect \~$540,000/year in increased costs annually 10 years from now which inflates all the previous numbers. (Assuming 3% inflation the math is: 400,000/year \* (1.03)\^10 = \~540,000/year).

So 90% is accounted for entirely by known wage increases with some wiggle room because no one knows what prices will look like 10 years from now (hence the added 10-15% or $600K-$900K)",1582228438,1,0

"A little late to the thread &amp; I'm an alum so doesn't matter to me in the end, but y'all should zero in on what ASUCD plans to do with the massive amounts of new funding they're awarding themselves with.

$1.75MM per year in base fees immediately for 2020-2021 with $531,000/year increases every year for 9 years? 

Thats over $6MM/year ASUCD will have by 2030 to play with in the ASUCD Base Fee.  An increase from the $500k of today.

Great that ASUCD has such high ambitions, but shouldn't they present a roadmap for what they plan to use those funds on to justify such a huge increase?

The greenbelt in Davis basically spans the whole city  [https://localwiki.org/davis/The\_Greenbelt](https://localwiki.org/davis/The_Greenbelt).

Research opportunities are not that easy to get in either school, there are thousands of students wanting hundreds of positions. Both UCI and UCD have medical centers, which (at least I know for UCD) have internships available for you. 

Regarding the cars, it's not that freshmen aren't allowed to have cars, it's that freshmen aren't allowed to have on campus parking permits. You can either pay for monthly parking downtown (only a few blocks for campus) or you can park it for free on some residential streets a bit far from campus, since the streets near campus are permit restricted to residents only.

"I second this, except I'm not sure a comp sci minor would do much you couldn't do on your own. I'd recommend a double major with comp sci and Cog sci with the computational emphasis. Do an internship as well and you're absolutely set for a really lucrative career. There are so many basic computer science majors right now, interdisaplinary majors are highly sought after. Another option is to do the computational emphasis and double major in stats with an emphasis on machine learning. Then make sure you really practice your programming at home and create a few sample projects to show employers. 

I'm doing a B.A in psych and a B.S in cognitive science with the neuro emphasis. While I absolutely LOVE the major, much more than psych, the computer science aspect is crucial to understanding what cognitive science really is, which is understanding the mind as an information processer running algorithms like a computer. I still need to take the basic computer science course all cognitive science majors need to take, but it definitely won't be enough. It's too late for me to switch into the computational emphasis, especially because I'm pretty much finished with my psych major and will quickly meet the unit cap. That and I would need to take more math prereqs to change emphasis. Not enough time. 

Originally I wanted to go to med school, but I changed my mind and ALL the jobs related to cog sci need you to understand programming. So my solution is to take a programming bootcamp to get sample projects to show employers and then learn on my own. Tons of resources online. I'm going to apply to grad schools in systems learning but I'd like to take a year off to work. My prospects without programming are looking scary. 

OP if you're more interested in the other aspects of the field make sure you get research experience and set yourself up to get into grad school! You'll absolutely need it as there won't be many opportunities for jobs after undergrad. Tbh tho, that is true for the majority of majors, even STEM apart from engineering, and all those sub fields and a few others. You can do any major and as long as you network, do internships, and develop some specific skills in your own time and learn how to sell it, you can make it work for you. So I don't want to scare you away from the major, it's awesome",1586551884,5,0

For non-majors, I believe they've even recently added a new class taught in C  in their track to prepare them for the C/C++ in 34. It seems that the school's trying to get students in the groove of programming in C/C++.

Edit: On another note, I also took APCSP, and it was definitely veryyy unlike anything in the lower division CS courses. I would take a look at some concepts in APCS to know if you'll be prepared for ECS36a.",1589770229,3,0
"Thanks for your response. I took AP CSP and got a 4 on the exam. I took a 25 hour Python course on codecademy.

That's good to hear, yeah that's what I didn't like about the 141 series. There is so much variability within these courses. I can't believe STA 141BC is being taught in R now, what?! Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm under the impression that R isn't used that much in industry compared to Python. That's so surprising to me, can't believe they'd do that.",1589756669,1,0
I‚Äôm not sure why you would think you‚Äôre able to do this. If you were able to switch after final grades came out then everyone would just switch to pass if they got a B or something. Short answer: no,1589756594,12,0

I think STA 141C this year has been great. It's the same professor as the 141B series (Prof. Lai). I'm not sure if he's sticking around next year as he's a visiting professor. To be honest, I don't think the department knows what they want to do with the 141 series as a whole. It's been taught by a different professor every quarter/year and has changed several times in the past few years. For example, 141B and C used to be in python, but now the full series is in R. 141A used to be just homework and a major project, but now it's a small project and exams.",1589754988,1,0
I would really recommend the UC Davis housing pages if you decide to live off-campus.,1589754527,2,0

I lived in the transfer housing (The Colleges At La Rue) and it was an amazing experience. If you have extra money to spend, I would really recommend it. You come into school surrounded by people in your exact scenario, making it easier to make friends and network. 

QUICK POINT TO THAT.... I would ONLY recommend going to the Colleges at La Rue (and going for one of the two-story apartments). It really is the only one that is worth the money $$$$. You are across the street from campus (right by the gym) and you are next to the Rec Pool. I wouldn't pay the money for any of the other transfer housing as they are far from campus and comparable to the cheap housing you can find off-campus.",1589754483,1,0

"I think you‚Äôre allowed to go to SJA for things like this.

This might be a similar scenario but instead of more content it‚Äôs more time?",1589753868,1,0
"I have seen this rule backfire on people. If you opt into pass/no pass you must earn a C- or higher to pass/earn credit. Although if you take the class for a letter grade and get a D- the class counts towards your degree for credit (it will tank your GPA though). 
I watched a situation where someone had to petition to several high up people to get a retroactive grade change (to a D) so they could graduate, because they initially opted into pass/no pass.",1589753480,1,0

"I didn't know there was an applied path for CS, did you have to get approved by the department for that? There doesn't seem to be a CS section on the pre-approved class list.

&gt;My only complaint would be that there aren‚Äôt enough data science classes. I found STA 141AB really useful but 141C kind of lacking but has potential. I don‚Äôt recommend the STA machine learning classes, take the CS version instead.

I think this is because DS is interdisciplinary, I'm on the data science track and minoring in CS for that reason. Davis' curriculum is very classical in nature, so it's not the best for data science unfortunately. There are some good data science courses in other majors like STS and MAT.

I think both 141B and C are useful but cover two very different sub-fields within data science. 141B focuses more on the data wrangling, querying, and presentation. 141C focuses more on the data/software engineering and computing aspects of data science. Personally I like STA 141C a lot more than I liked 141B, but I think both are equally useful.

Hard agree in regards to taking ECS 171 over STA 142A, but it's very difficult to get into ECS 171. I'd say it's worth taking STA 142A just for STA 142B though, that class is awesome. You could take ECS 171 for the ML elective, then use STA 142A and 142B for the upper division electives.",1589752151,1,0

I had Mitchell for 9A and was struggling because he tries to make the degree of difficulty was really intense imo and that‚Äôs kind of his teaching strategy (he taught out of a graduate student textbook).

For ex. our entire grade depended on 9 problems and for one of the problems our class average was an 18% and he curved it such that a 0% became a 60% (that‚Äôs how bad it was). I had a lot of difficulties in that class esp bc 9A doesn‚Äôt really interest me. On the other hand, I Savrasov for 9b and it was honestly a breeze.

The number of units someone is taking right now in winter quarter is not going to affect their spring quarter pass time because winter quarter classes haven't been completed yet.)

It had been years since I took high school chemistry, and Workload covered all the major basics as well as nomenclature and problem solving. It gave me a great foundation to do well in CHE 2A the following quarter. Since you have not taken a formal chemistry course, I would recommend taking it as it will thoroughly prepare you for CHE 2A and beyond.

Side note: I tried to do the ALEKS online chemistry course the summer before my first quarter, but since it had been so long for me since I took any chemistry, I was unable to teach myself the material and opted to take WLD 41C instead.

"""Best"" is a highly temporary term in technology. No single computer at a specific pricepoint is going to be ""best"" for very long. There are some general factors that make some comuter builds better than others. 

**Desktops** (tower only)

* 8+GB RAM, preferably expandable
* Previous generation low-TDP processor (best bang for the buck). If you can get a modern generation, all the better. If you're going with Intel, go with an i3 or i5 processor. i7+ is too much heat, power consumption, and price for what most students need.
* 250GB SSD + 1TB HDD storage
* Low-TDP modern discrete graphics card w/3+ GB RAM
* WiFi and Ethernet
* Blu-Ray Drive (bonus)
* ~300w power supply

**Laptops**

* 8+GB RAM, preferably expandable
* Previous generation low-TDP processor (best bang for the buck). If you can get a modern generation, all the better. If you're going with Intel, go with an i3 or i5 processor. i7+ is too much heat, power consumption, and price for what most students need.
* 500GB SSD, preferably expandable
* Pref. discrete graphics chip/RAM
* 2+ USB ports
* 1 Video Out
* microSD card slot
* Metallic case to act as heat sink
* 13"" or 15"" screen with 1080p vertical. Do NOT accept less than 1080p. You'll see a LOT of budget laptops with 768p. This are wretched and will show you only a portion of what web designers/programmers intend on your screen. 

Depending on the economy at the time, you could find the above power-sipper computers for $600 or less. Worst case scenario, you could build the tower for that price. Today, prices have gone up due to various aspects relating to the pandemic. Right now, it all depends on sales. 

Windows 10 vs. MacOS. It's still a major debate. I always suggest a Windows 10 system because you can simply run more programs on them. Also, you'll want to have owned, updated, and installed all your preferred programs BEFORE coming to campus. You want to start fresh and ready.",1588691617,1,0

10 minutes should be enough time if the classes are in the same area of campus.  But if they‚Äôre on opposite corners or something, I would look for other sections - campus is pretty big and it‚Äôs really easy to underestimate how long it takes to bike somewhere.

As for whether you‚Äôll actually get these classes, the answer is most likely yes, but the odds of getting the specific sections/class times you want are pretty slim, since continuing students will register first. It might be a good idea to make a few backup schedules to use in case sections start filling up.",1588691133,1,0

"Wow dang there are a lot of apple people on here. What's your major? That will affect whether or not you'll ever run into issues going Mac. I don't have specific criticisms of them, but I personally haven't been swayed that they're worth the $1000, especially given the low requirements of your average college schoolwork and the omnipresent chance of it getting dropped or splashed with beverages. Windows is also a lot better than it used to be so I do think some of the Apple brand loyalty is inertia from the old days when Microsoft was putting out a legitimately bad product.

I had an HP Envy in my last year of undergrad and some of grad school -- it was great (until I broke it, but that was 100% on me). I thought HP did a good no-nonsense job of adopting the design elements that Apple does well (in terms of general sleekness) while also keeping the price reasonable.

I see the Envies are more expensive now, but I still recommend HP in general after using a couple more of their laptops after my Envy. For example, something like this with the screen upgrade option:

[https://store.hp.com/us/en/ConfigureView?catalogId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10151&amp;urlLangId=&amp;catEntryId=3074457345619384322&amp;quantity=1](https://store.hp.com/us/en/ConfigureView?catalogId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10151&amp;urlLangId=&amp;catEntryId=3074457345619384322&amp;quantity=1)\\

would be reasonably fast and suitable for pretty much any major unless you were doing some sort of graphics-heavy work.

Some things to keep in mind:

* You're gonna be spending a lot of hours looking at that screen. Size matters, but so does resolution. I personally don't like to go below 14"" or below 1080p if I can help it.
* 17"" meanwhile might be too big to fit in a lot of your standard backpacks/travel bags etc. Those tend to be made for 15"" computers.
* Some people prefer having a 10-key number pad on their keyboards. You're basically going to need a Windows 15"" or 17"" laptop to have that feature.
* Another option is to cheap out now and expect to upgrade. I linked you to one that is on the high end of the price range you had, but you could alternatively buy a cheaper model with a worse processor and screen, and just get another $400ish one a few years from now if lower specs don't bother you.
* Yet another option that I did my sophomore year was a desktop/laptop combo. Basically my aging laptop was just a note-taking machine, and I would do actual work on my desktop back at my apartment. Not as feasible in a dorm room, but good for productivity once I had more space. Midrange desktops can be in relatively attractive price/performance ranges, and building them is also an option.",1588658356,2,0

"&gt; We both thought I had no chance at Berkeley. Now I don‚Äôt know where to  go. I feel like I am an idiot to turn down the opportunity to go to  Berkeley. 

You're not an idiot for thinking about turning it down. There are people around who chose Davis over Berkeley, myself included. It's a good school but it's not the right fit for everyone, and prestige is indeed overrated. Davis was a better fit for me for financial and logistical reasons, and on top of that I liked the town better. There are things I regret about the college search, but the Davis vs Berkeley decision isn't one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I don‚Äôt have a plan or goal of what to do with either degree but I feel  like a degree from Cal is a valuable much more valuable than a Davis  degree. 

If you don't even know what field you want to go into or what major you'll be able to get into, then it's impossible to say whether a Cal degree will be ""much more"" valuable, or even more valuable at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I want to be challenged and I feel like I will be inspired at Berkeley where Davis is the easy route. 

If you think Davis -- a campus in the same university system, accredited by the same organization -- is ""the easy route"" just because it's like in the top 5% of US universities instead of the top 1%, you're in for a nasty surprise. Your major and how you manage your time is going to be what makes it easy or hard. Also, Davis is on quarter system, which is a much faster tempo than Cal's semesters and faster than what you're probably used to in CC. I personally thought Davis was plenty brutal.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; so I would be commuting to Berkeley. 

Well if you're looking for a challenge that would definitely do it, and not in a good way. If you run with the premise that Cal is more competitive in its coursework, then it's essential to find a study group and campus support resources. Also, you probably wouldn't be able to attend as many social and networking events as otherwise, which will limit your enjoyment of the college experience and also limit the alleged advantages you get out of Cal's prestige.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Everyone else in my life basically says Davis is a mistake and Berkeley is an inspiring once in a lifetime opportunity. 

I had this happen too. Generally these are people who are not super familiar with both schools who say stuff like this. Davis has its flaws, but those are intrinsic flaws to pretty much every big university. Like I said before, it's probably more important what you study than where you study it. I'm pretty sure I ended up having a more rigorous education with my Davis physics degree than my non-STEM friends who went on to Berkeley or the Ivies. I can run circles around some of the people in my current job -- more policy/consulting -- whenever we do quantitative analysis.",1588656975,2,0

"Honestly man, this sounds like more of an r/relationship_advice post, but I understand why you posted this here. It is true that your girlfriend has helped you get this far-- she has, considering what you've told us, really pushed you to pursue greater academic and life goals-- but also, she should make more of an effort to understand your point of view. 

It IS an incredible accomplishment to get into Cal, it IS a decision that should be difficult to make, and you should absolutely consider both your relationship with her and what you may be passing up with SIRing to Davis as opposed to Cal. This shit is hard, and it should be hard-- I hope that's something, at the very least, that you're comfortable with feeling. 

Logistically speaking, there are a couple of very important factors to consider: 

1. What would this mean for your relationship? Would this end it, and would it ending be a something that greatly impacts your ability to succeed academically? Not even speaking in terms of how she has helped you-- more in the sense that, when you go through something difficult, it can be very hard to cope without someone who has been a support system. 
2. Do you financially have the means to live in Berkeley or Oakland? I'm from Berkeley, and it is SO expensive. It's not like, ""I can deal with this even though its hard"" kind of expensive... It's insane. Truly, at least double what you would pay for a similar living situation in Davis. It's REAL fucking hard to regularly commute from Davis to the Bay. Like, I live with my boyfriend in the Bay Area right now, was just admitted to Davis, and I won't even consider the possibility of commuting. The (non-corona) Traffic will be 2.5-3 hours during bad times, easy. 

Also... non-academically related... 

NOT SAYING THIS IS DEF THE CASE... But, is she really jealous, or is that your projection onto the situation given that you do feel enticed by a university that isn't her first choice for you? Have you looked into the things that Davis CAN offer you? I know its hard to, considering you may be enamored by Berkeley, but its still a good call. 

Either way, of course, this is YOUR choice. Just, try and speak with your girlfriend. Try to come to an understanding about whats the most important. Good luck.",1588655751,1,0

"Intelligence isn‚Äôt just numbers and stats. Not too relevant to this current conversation, but many graduate programs on campus are no longer accepting GRE scores for this next application season (GREs are like the grad school equivalent of the SAT/ACT for undergrads). These committees just don‚Äôt think standardized test scores are that representative of an applicant‚Äôs potential anymore. Now of course, this won‚Äôt be happening for undergraduate admissions and the SAT/ACT any time too soon (there are many valid arguments on both sides which cause many heated conference rooms during these meetings, so for now, we‚Äôll just keep things how they are). But they did remove the SAT/ACT requirement for this upcoming application season due to the Coronavirus situation, so we can use this chance to see if we can admit an incoming class we‚Äôre proud of without using test scores.


And then GPAs can be a whole other mess... how do you compare between a highly rigorous high school that limits their A‚Äôs given out vs. a high school that gives out A‚Äôs like candy because their average student doesn‚Äôt try as hard and so giving just a little bit of effort gives the student an A? We had an applicant who was rank 1 in her class and her GPA was under 4.0 even when weighted. Is that a rigorous high school or just a bad cohort?

"Was the same for me dude. I‚Äôll always have a windows machine, but over the course of my experience I learned it should be a desktop. I‚Äôm still using the PC I built in 2011 and it runs games and Popcorntime on my TV very nicely. Windows laptops however, are a pain. I grew up with windows desktops, but my first laptop was a Mac, then I got the surface, and now back to Mac. It feels like home to open it up, and not necessarily because I had a Mac before. Windows just doesn‚Äôt work as smoothly on a mobile + small screen platform, I decided. The only thing that was objectively better about my surface compared to most Macs is the the keyboard. But the 16‚Äù has a new keyboard and it‚Äôs almost as good as the surface. The base 16‚Äù is a fine computer if you can swing it (financially OR literally. it‚Äôs heavy). If you want something lighter and less expensive, a 14‚Äù is supposedly coming out soon and I‚Äôm sure it will have the new keyboard. The keyboards on post-2015/pre-16‚Äù MBPs just blow and that‚Äôs part of why I didn‚Äôt get a mac back then. 

As far as adjusting to Mac, I think it‚Äôs pretty easy to adjust. The most annoying part is close/move/maximize being on the left side instead of the right üòÇ

Anyway, there‚Äôs a reason so many people here have them, and it‚Äôs not because they were suckered. Not all of them, at least.

"Hi there! I'm a second year physics major. I probably can't speak very well about the strengths and weaknesses, but I can talk about my experiences so far. So far I've enjoyed physics at UC Davis. I'm about to finish the 9 series this quarter which is basically lower division intro courses. I also go to physics club every now and again and the people there are very nice, they'll host game nights or info meetings with resources for all sorts of opportunities you might be seeking. I would definitely recommend making connections with faculty members, I started doing a small research role with a professor I had last year and have been learning a lot of really interesting things in cosmology.

Ultimately your experience with physics at UCD will be what you make of it, like in any department. Probably the biggest disadvantage is that Davis doesn't necessarily have the name recognition in physics like some other universities have. The result is that you may run into some faculty or graduate students who aren't super excited or enthusiastic about being here. Nevertheless, you also find a lot of the opposite. I've had some great instructors and TA's who clearly really enjoy teaching and discussing physics, and aren't at all snobby or difficult to approach. (I don't mind naming names since its purely praise: Thomas Weideman is a brilliant instructor and an even more brilliant mind, Sam Blitz is a PhD student who does a great job as my discussion TA and is teaching 9A this quarter I believe.)

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps a bit, feel free to ask any other questions you have. Or, alternatively, feel free to email a faculty member with your questions!

""Consequently, the costs of maintaining these initiatives and services decrease significantly as they have fewer individuals to accommodate. Much of our learning comes from interactions with professors and teaching assistants at faculty office hours and study groups, not the lectures themselves. It is hard to recreate that remotely.""

Office hours and ""study groups"" are the only ""initiatives and services"" the petition mentions. Doing these things virtually (a) doesn't deprive students of these services, and (b) doesn't make them cheaper.

If you're going to gripe that you think you shouldn't pay full tuition for an online course because you think online courses are of lower quality, then just say so.

If you're upset that you're paying fees (not tuition) for things like the ARC but can't go to the ARC, then say that.

I'd feel bad for her but she literally decided to reinvent the wheel to teach this class. Her notes are nice and I like the book but that's about all I have to say about that.",1587594774,4,0

"One of my instructors is a masters student who is refusing to adapt her plan at all. A large portion of the class had technical issues with the platform we're using for quizzes. I'd say at least 20% of the class couldn't answer a single question because they were asking unrealistic things and worded very poorly (based on Piazza post activity).

This is what she said to address the issues: ""Remember, this is all just for fun and learning. The quiz will be graded on a curve, so even if the most anyone got is 1 problem that is all you will have to get to get an A"".

While it's nice she's going to curve, if the highest score is 1/3 and the rest are 0/3, it's just A's and F's at that point. Oh yeah, quizzes make up 50% of our grade.",1587592567,8,0

"If the class is a prerequisite for another class, you can't do P/Np. 

If you're planning to go to grad school , they look at grades for major classes / Not GEs. It will affect your chances.

If you said yes to any of those, I suggest you try to earn whatever grade you can, then retake the class if you're unsatisfied with your grade.

If it's a GE, P/Np is ok, P/Np doesn't count towards gpa, and you would get the units completed. If you pass.",1587586359,-1,0

"Thats an interesting question! At least for my classes, exams would be a bad idea in the perspective of feasibility. Which relates to your concern of cheating. It would be something in which would be difficult to prepare, facilitate, and manage due to the online nature. Perhaps, if such issues could be addressed then maybe? However, I have yet heard of any class successfully doing so.

Regarding the latter half of your comment, I actually really love this. This is pretty much how the quizzes I had mention amin my prior comment are carried out. The reason why I like this is probably on a more personal perspective, but I really do like how the time flexibility really allows us as students to go deep into the problems and let our curiosity take us through lecture notes, online resources, etc. Often times during in person exams, when I see a problem I don't know how to do, usually I take the L and upon receiving my midterm I don't really find myself looking back at it and being ""resourceful"" and ""curious"" to find the answer. But for time flexible tests, I feel like it forces you (in a good way) to be curious and resourceful.

However the downside to this format is it is not going to be fair for all students. Meaning that, say for example you have a test scheduled on Thursday and the professor gives you the entire 24 hours to work on it and submit it, but the amount of time each respective student can work on the test may vary because some may have work, more classes, time difference etc.

Ultimately, I think this format has great potential and suffices for now, but can be improved upon. Though solutions seem a bit complex. For example, giving students a week to start and finish a test, but once they "" start "" it they only get 24 hour to complete. But there probably is even more practical solutions to such problem.",1587584294,1,0
"Thanks for the response! Do you think that exams are a bad idea? One of the concerns is cheating, so some have opted for open note exam where the questions are more critical thinking based with a flexible submission schedule. What do you think about that.",1587581659,1,0
"Take what I say with a grain of salt, as of course it is just my experiences :)

Like many professors int his situation, my professors have little to no experience teaching an online course. In a way, I think this has actually helped my professors see things in a fresh perspective and be more empathetic towards the student situation. This is exemplified by the canceling of midterms and online tests, because they understand it is something that is not feasible due to too many complications. Its been replaced by projects and ""quizzes"" which you have an entire day to complete.

More often than not, I see students trying to look at the class itself or professor and seeing whether this is working or whether that is not working. However, I feel it would help to even look at ourselves at this time. Like we have an opportune time to utilize office hours, but usually in my experience it will just be me and the professor. To put it in further context say a class has 50 students. Only 30 students attend lecture, and of those 30 students say 10-15 are fully engaged through the lecture. Perhaps the rest are playing animal crossing or just chilling on their bed lol.

I just empathize for the professors who are working so diligently at this time with little time for preparation, constant emails, and managing their research. They must be going through so much. Some host 3-5 office hours a week plus individual appointment office hours. But maybe only 1-2 of the students of a class of 50 make use of it. And during lecture time its probably weird for them too, since all our cameras are off, but you sometimes get that ""one guy"" with his camera on (you know he's a front row sitter during lecture haha jk).

 I hope students can appreciate the professors more at this time, how? With effort and action. Its a win win for both :)",1587580913,3,0

"I took bis102 with baldwin last summer and it was a pretty hard class, he seems to really know what he is talking about, but the tests were pretty difficult and I ended up getting screwed over a bit in the end cause he said the final was going to be cumulative, and it ended up being the stuff we learned the few days before the final. His curve is weird and he doesn't use canvas. I was taking it with che118c though, and I was mostly focused on that class.

His rating on rmp are biased since he teaches a much harder class (mcb124) so a lot of them are based on that. At least with bis102, he's not expecting people to come in with a background knowledge of biochemistry.

That being said, last summer I'm pretty sure Hilt taught bis103 ss2. It's currently TBA on schedule builder so idk if it'll be him again or someone else.",1587573184,1,0

Did you retake it with Baldwin by any chance? I'm thinking of dropping this and taking 102/103 over the summer.
