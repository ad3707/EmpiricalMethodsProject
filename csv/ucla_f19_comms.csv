"That’s very true, professors work for the university and the university should work for the students. The only problems with that is that the only reason that that’s true is because students have to pay tens of thousands of dollars for an education that allows them to pursue an education. In an ideal world, yes, educational material should be readily available to the public, but out world is far from ideal, so it’s not very realistic. Students are paying for their courses—they are paying for the material given. Releasing the material would probably cause problems and just isn’t a good model for a school to follow. 

Again, when it comes to readings, they are posted on the syllabus and anyone can just look them up, so that shouldn’t really be that big of a problem whether course material is released to the public or not.

I understand where you’re coming from for exam material. We all pay to go to the same school, so why shouldn’t material be equally available to everyone? Well, let me ask you, why does it need to be? Exam material is useful to the people taking the class, not the people who don’t take it. Making this material equally available simply on the basis that it’s given by a university who you pay tuition to could be an argument, but the reality is that the material doesn’t belong to the university, it usually belongs to the professors. Take the test bank for example. It’s not technically a part of UCLA, but it has become a staple in the academics of many south campus majors. Professors can request that any exam given to the test bank from their course be removed because it’s “their property.” They came up with the work and it’s their choice what to do with it. However, not many professors do that, so students can freely go and look up any past exam from any past professors, provided that it’s in the system. So even if the exams are not open to the public student body by ccle, they can still be at the disposal of students who need them.

Also, why wouldn’t it be okay if past exams are only available to students in the class? You make it seem as if it would be better if exams be available to no one rather than only people enrolled in the class. It’s not as if it’s some great injustice that the material given by a professor is only available to the people who need it.",1569398452,1,0

Universities don't have a monopoly on knowledge.  There are plenty of other places to get open source course materials if you are interested.  UCLA also has a mechanism to audit classes.

She ended up going to that school 300 miles away, and I wasn't thrilled about the school (tbh and the academics, I had a 2.3 in high school and got in), so I did the community college route instead. 

We stopped talking, I went to Santa Monica College, and we started talking during the first winter break, and ended up going on about 10 dates in 15 days. 

We dated for 7 semesters in a long distance relationship between two cities. I spent about 100 hours of driving on the I-5, weathered the storm, and now we live together.

"Well, a classes syllabus usually tells students what books will be used in the course. If the professor were to publish the actual works on CCLE, they could infringe copyright. If the syllabus is released, the student can look up the material themselves and read it if they’re interested. 

As for tests, you can take the LS core as an example. After taking an exam, you don’t even get your actual exam back, only your answer key because the LS core uses the exact same exams for each lecture in a given quarter and sometimes even recycles questions between quarters. Releasing exams means that they would constantly need to make new exam questions every quarter, and their tests are pretty long to be doing that. Professors in other departments don’t do this, but many use the same problems and just change the numbers in problems. Then there are others who make completely new exams every time they teach a class. Releasing exams to the public wouldn’t necessarily be a negative or a positive, but as it is their intellectual property, they can do whatever they want with it. These professors usually do give their past exams to the class as practice midterms and finals to study for the actual exam, and they usually do give exams back. Either way, you can probably go to the test bank if you really really wanted to see them even if you’re not taking the class, just take the class info.

As for quizzes and homework... at this point I’m imagining you might be saying this to either see what the course is like over all or to either follow along with the course. If it’s the former, professors change things from quarter to quarter and most professors (chem and math at least) don’t teach in consecutive quarters so seeing this wouldn’t mean too much as it will change. If it’s the latter, as messed up as it sounds (and like most students, I haven’t gotten a class I’ve needed), the professors job is to teach the people in their class, and releasing their quizzes and homework to the public just isn’t something that they have to do. Any professor can release stuff they put on CCLE to the public, but it’s their own choice. It’s frustrating not getting into a class you want but it is what it is.

Overall, professors are not contracted to do so and doing so would not serve any purpose to the class that they are teaching, so it’s their choice whether they release this material to the public or not. Besides, most STEM classes release practice material to people in their current class as a way to get a feel of what exams are like and to help students actually enrolled in the class.",1569393758,1,0

"i took 185. The hardest part of that class is pleasing jon. He's the one who supervises your group project and your team will get a few reviews from him on some deliverables throughout the quarter. For my team, he criticized out delivarables throughout the quarter giving us like maybe 80-90%(?) in them but his criticism was super vague and we could not figure out what he wanted. We changed some bullet points to paragraphs and paragraphs to bullet points for our final project documentation and boom 100. So that's the first way that Jon can treat your group: criticism throughout the quarter but it turns out fine - you might just feel stressed along the way that your project is heading towards doom. 

The second way that Jon can treat your group is much worse, imo. Basically if he really loves your product idea, he tends to overlook any issues in your deliverables throughout the quarter. Then, when you give your final presentation, he brings up all these issues that should have came up like on the first or second review. Then you end up getting a lower grade for the final presentation and report which sucks because that is a huge chunk of your grade. (this happened to a few groups I know of)

Idk, there's probably a middle ground, but I don't know what it is. also the teams are basically disasters without mechE's because the product you pitch has to have a physical component to it AND your team is supposed to demonstrate knowledge in every area you use (can't suggest that your product do cool mechanical motions unless you have a mechE who can back up with his expertise)",1572513767,1,0

"I've only taken 185EW so I don't know exactly what the alternative would be like to compare with (I guess nobody's masochistic enough to take both classes), but from what I've heard the consensus is 183EW is less work than 185EW, which in my experience is more like four whole classes rolled into one:

1. Random quasi-ethics stuff Don talks about (for lack of a more descriptive term). Technically this sub-class can be skipped but they will hand out quizzes each lecture to track attendance like it's a god damn North Campus class (which I guess it spiritually is...)
2. HUGE team project with big deliverables almost every week, which are subject to the unquantifiable whims of the other professor, John.
3. The ethics content of the exams, which to me seemed mostly disconnected from what Don actually says in lecture.
4. The papers, which also seem disconnected from classes 1, 2, and 3 (info for the papers seemed to come mostly from the TA during mandatory 3 hour discussions)

The truth is I don't know if 183EW would have been much better... at least sub-class 2 won't be a problem but there could be other shitstorms that I wouldn't have experience with having taken the other option. What I do know is that 185EW for me was a random youtube-mashup-like course of off-the-wall horrors, and if 183EW has even a prayer of being a less miserable class I would take that option instead.",1572504552,1,0

Also faced a lot of parental pressure to attend Berkeley. But now I can say that we ended up being #1, so...!

"Study tips is such a broad topic that I could lecture on but here's a couple

1. I really want to emphasize theawkdork's first point. Your class time is IMPORTANT and you also paid for it in your tuition. So make sure to actually pay attention. Let's be real, a lot of lectures are only 50 minutes. That's honestly not a lot of time. Some people take dumps for 25 minutes. Make sure to pay attention to the professor and the concepts. Take good notes and if you're confused on anything, ask for help. Don't just brush it off. Some people might think this is called being a try hard...well guess what, you're in college now. You're an adult. It's not called being a try-hard. It's called being disciplined and working hard because that's what we're called to do as a STUDENT. 

2. In regards to preparing for exams when it's cumulative. I make study guides/summary sheets of every important concept/terminology and I SAVE them. By the time midterms or finals comes around, I have a succinct summary of everything I've learned thus far and it makes studying far more efficient and easier. 

3. Try to stretch out your finals schedule. Don't be choosing classes in which your finals schedule has 2 finals on Monday and 2 finals on Tuesday. You will literally hate yourself for doing that. 

4. Your study environment is far more important than you think. Trust me on this, studying without distractions at a library will get you far more efficient studying progress than constantly checking your phone in a loud dorm room. If you study better at a library, then go to a library. Don't be lazy.

5. In most cases, skip the textbook. Reading the textbook is overkill and should only be done if you want further clarification on a lecture concept. Most of what the professor tells you is suffice for the exams. I'm a bio major so this may vary for other majors but for all my classes, the textbook was a total waste of time and my professors even told us to focus on lecture material and NOT the textbook. 

6. Make good friends. Prob. my biggest regret. Making good friends who can help you study and keep you accountable is important. This doesn't need further explanation. Surround yourself with people who will help you do better, not people who will constantly distract you.

7. Go. To. Office. Hours. If you need help, seek it. Office hours is a huge help. A lot of people don't like their ego's shattered so they think Office hours is for losers or idiots. That's totally their loss. Office hours has helped me tremendously in understanding material, getting to know the professors for LORs, and meeting other students whom I could help or receive help from. There's nothing shameful about going to office hours and I wish I had done so sooner. After I started going to Office hours, my GPA went from avging a 3.2-3.5 each quarter to a 4.0 for the last two years of college. 

8. Don't pull all-nighters or cram. There's nothing ""cool"" about cramming or drinking 10 red bulls and pulling an allnighter just so you can post on instagram that you pulled an all-nighter. Nobody gives a flying fuk about how little sleep you get and you're only hurting yourself and your grades. You don't even need to study 10 hours a day. Study 2 hours each day or maybe like M-Thurs you study 3 hours a day and Friday you have off, and Saturday you study for a couple hours. If you add it all up, it's a lot of hours you studied but it's spread out so you don't feel like you're studying all day everyday. 

9. Worry about yourself. UCLA has some insanely smart people so if you start comparing yourself to everyone, you will feel like shit. Focus on yourself and on your own improvement and you will be happier.",1568351991,1,0

"Hey, I figured I'd chime in as a non-traditional Bruin myself.

I never would have considered moving into the dorms in my 30's (for a variety of reasons), but I think we can all agree someone choosing to do so in their 50's or 60's deserves respect.

I mean wow.

That takes a metric shit-ton of guts. Guts I just wouldn't have.

I remember feeling incredibly out of place my first few quarters after transferring -- it seemed as though everyone in my major already knew each other and had groups to study in.

In fact, I know there were weeks where I didn't speak to any other students on campus. I didn't make any friends in my first three quarters, and to this day I don't know the names of any of my classmates from that first year.

I just really didn't want to be this guy:

https://m.imgur.com/gallery/EMYoR

It wasn't until that Summer when someone who was in both of the classes I was talking that session sat down next to me and introduced himself like I was just any other student. Now, I consider him a good friend, and through him I met and became friends with a bunch of other students at UCLA, which made me feel more comfortable talking to other classmates too.

Of course, I'm a ""big boy"" and should be capable of going into a social setting where I'm different from the norm, and no one other than myself is responsible for the quantity and quality of my social interactions, but it's always easier (and nicer) when someone invites you in rather than trying to figure out how to work your way in.

So, I'd caution you to avoid making assumptions about your new roommate. Perhaps for some reason *they* never had the opportunity to have the ""typical college experience"" until now and that is exactly what they want. Or maybe they just feel they can't handle a commute at their age and they want to be on campus for ease of access to classes and office hours. Or possibly they're low income and this is the most cost effective way they have for pursuing their dream of education.

The point is: *you don't know* so don't assume.

Instead, spend some time imagining how apprehensive they must be sharing a dorm room with two younglings!

Maybe start out by having a conversation with them. (By the way, this is the same conversation you should have with all roommates.) Ask what their expectations are, what their needs are, what you can do to make them more comfortable, and share your own. Understand it should be treated as a dialog, trying to get everyone on the same page so you can start out on the right foot on the party toward harmonious living.

If you're going to have people over to play SSB maybe try something like, ""hey, I wanted to have some friends over to play some games, I want you to know you're welcome to join in and if you want I could teach you how to play before they come over.""

Or, if you really want to be nice, phrase it so they'd be doing you a favor by joining. Something like, ""Hey we wanted to play a game tonight but it's 2v2 and we only have 3, it'd be really cool if you could hang out and play with us...""

Also, not every old person wants to dispense life advice, so please ask if it's okay to ask first.

And, of course, remember: you're under no obligation to like them. Lots of roommates are assholes, even 60 year-old ones, but they might be really cool too, and you won't know unless you give them a chance.",1568344110,1,0

I could be better about that, but I'm not deep in debt or anything and have pretty good credit with just one two-year-old card.

"Between the two, I've had Samani. His 5A class was one of the hardest courses I've taken, but not the hardest to do well in. His tests were made to be hard, and he's said that when he designs the test, he makes it so that an A student can get a 75 or so.. lol. 

5C as far as content was easier than 5B, due in part to the smaller ""amount"" of topics. 5B has like 10 different chapters of differing concepts, while 5C flows really well. 

Shriver I've heard is boring, but his exams are apparently manageable. 

As far as a recommendation, I'd take 5C. 14D will take up a lot of time, and LS7C can take up time too. I think even if Samani is hard, youlle have a better time overall since you wont need to balance many differing topics.",1577762749,1,0

"this is so true. Basically ""right context"" as in she's gotta be feeling you beforehand. I've done some simp shit before in the past, so I can confidently say spending an entire quarter drawing a picture of a girl smiling, and then telling her ""this picture makes me so happy cuz of your beautiful smile"" is, in fact, some super simp shit. Super simp shit doesn't make the girl woo over you like in the movies... tbh it makes them dry as a mf from my experience. I'm sure OP can learn tho, I'd say he needs to stop hanging out w/ the girl, at least until he can move onto another girl, unless he's absolutely confident he can stop obsessing over her",1577752685,1,0
"hey dude I went thru a pretty similar experience, even taking the same summer classes and all. Tho I never drew art for her, I actually know how to play piano and she was near obsessed w/ my playing. When I tend to like a girl, I unfortunately start really falling for her and I get oneitis which is what happened here. I didn't let it get to me studies tho. Anyways, I got the ""let just be friends"" talk too, and it hurt but I'm good. I decided to finally get into some online dating and it's be going pretty well, much better than I thought it'd go! 

It seems like you suffer w/ oneitis also and you put her on this crazy pedestal. You gotta just get out there and talk to more girls. Also, you may think that this super special thing of drawing a portrait of her and confessing your feelings for her will woo a girl over, but truth is this real life shit is nothing like the movies and it does not happen like that. Sure, it can work for some girls but in reality it I don't believe most girls will actually think that is attractive, unless she was already into you beforehand. You gotta play this shit like you almost dgaf, like you have options... ppl can say that misogynistic if they want but from what I've seen girls do not like it when they think a guy is obsessed w/ them, it shows desperation in a sense even if you don't think you're exhibiting it. 

Basically, regardless of the outcome, i think it's really good to go thru experience like this. Helps you grow as an individual... 20 years of being single is not that bad, don't pressure yourself to get into a relationship just cuz all your friends are in one.",1577751760,1,0

In 14D with Pham, you'll be speeding through a bunch of mechanisms throughout the quarter.

"In my view, stating these things represent ""a breeding ground"" for illness and are to be avoided to preserve one's health is a wild exaggeration that only serves to further isolate those experiencing homelessness and those living in poverty. If someone is concerned about germs from metallic surfaces on a bus, the hand sanitizer you mentioned would serve them well. Students are not at any significant risk of contracting bloodborne infectious diseases such as HIV or Hep C by merely being in the same vicinity as a homeless person, and if they are worried about contracting TB from day-to-day interactions with those experiencing homelessness, a population which includes their fellow students, then they can visit the Ashe Center and find out how to alleviate their concern.

Looking past the ""breeding ground"" rhetoric, it's certainly possible that being on a bus with someone who has cold could lead you to come down with a cold, just as sitting near someone in a classroom could. However, I would be wary of making condescending ""translations"" that come to the conclusion that we could lower rates of illness and save money overall by lowering the rate of public transit use. As noted by the final study you've cited:
&gt; Correlation, however, does not prove causation, when looking at an epidemic on a large scale many contributing factors need to be taken into account... While these results are not enough to quantify the role played by the use of public transport on large-scale infection transmission, they are interesting for both researchers and policy makers alike.

"Chances are this will not happen and you're setting yourself up for failure and disappointment.

You say you have scheduled all of your classes for the next two quarters and Summer, how the hell did you do this when most departments don't have their own schedules set for Spring yet? The classes you need for your major(s) may not actually be available in the quarters you are planning to take them (especially during summer), if the class is offered you can't always guarantee you'll be able to get into it, and it's very possible the classes you want to take will have time conflicts which would prevent you from taking two or more of them at the same time, or they may have conflicting finals, which professors may (or may not) choose to be accomodating of.

A typical 4 unit class is *supposed* to require an average of about 12-15 hours of work per week, so a 12 unit load is considered full-time (36-45 hours per week). School is *supposed* to be a full-time job. If you are taking a 20 unit load, that *should* require 60-75 hour per week on average, some weeks will almost certainly be more.

Now, perhaps your classes are all easy and you can get by with much less, that's fine, you could still end up with 5 midterms in a week, multiple long papers due around the same time, etc.

According to everything I know about infectious diseases, both the homeless &amp; people surviving poverty have elevated rates of contagious illnesses.

&gt;Poverty is arguably the greatest risk factor for acquiring and succumbing to disease worldwide, yet historically received less attention from the medical community than genetic or environmental risk factors.

Source: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168775/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168775/)  


&gt;Social and economic conditions underpin poverty and can directly and indirectly affect health status and health outcomes. Major epidemics emerge and chronic conditions cluster and persist wherever poverty is widespread. Lack of food, shelter, security and social protection make people more vulnerable to infections, while affected populations are often unable to obtain even the most basic means of prevention and care. Poverty creates conditions that favor the spread of infectious diseases and prevents affected populations from obtaining adequate access to prevention and care. Ultimately, these diseases – infectious diseases of poverty (see Box 1.1) – disproportionately affect people living in poor or marginalized communities. Social, economic and biological factors interact to drive a vicious cycle of poverty and disease from which, for many people, there is “no escape”.

&gt;...riding a bus isn't going to ... jeopardize \[someone's\] health... **nor will being in the same area as those experiencing homelessness** or those in poverty.

In response to the part in bold:

&gt;A systematic review and meta-analysis of 43 studies (four of which are from the UK), involving 59,736 homeless people, assessed the prevalence of TB, hepatitis C virus and HIV in this population between 1984 and 2012 (Beijer et al, 2012). Results showed that homeless people have a much higher likelihood of having one of these three diseases than the general population, although there was considerable variation between the studies.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the United States, the prevalence of TB was at least 46 times greater in the homeless population than in the general population, and the prevalence of hepatitis C viral infection was increased approximately four-fold. In the UK, the prevalence of TB was at least 34 times greater in homeless people than in the general population, and the prevalence of hepatitis C viral infection was approximately 50 times greater.  
&gt;  
&gt;HIV prevalence was typically 1-20 times higher in homeless people in the US than in the general population

Even if you ignore the ways hepatitis can be transmitted by being in the same area as the homeless, TB certainly can jeopardize someone's health by being in the same area as an infected individual  


&gt;...**riding a bus isn't going to ... jeopardize \[someone's\] health**... nor will being in the same area as those experiencing homelessness or those in poverty.

In response to the part in bold:

&gt;Our study suggests a link between public transport use and infectious diseases transmission and encourages further research into that area.

&gt;""Results could be used to inform the development of non-pharmacological interventions that can act on preventing instead of curing infections and are, potentially, more cost-effective.""

Translation: We may be able to save money treating illnesses if people didn't get infected in the first place by riding public transit.

"This may not be too helpful to you, but just to share my experience with research positions so far... 

I'm CaSB so research positions may be less competitive than other majors or the faculty I've contacted are in less demand than others but I pretty much emailed two people and got two responses. The first position was through a TA that I had in an earlier quarter and I didnt even really meet the main advisor though I'm pretty sure this was because of carelessness and inexperience on the part of my TA which is why I ended up leaving that position. I set up a meeting time and the TA ended up trying to sell ME the lab after checking to make sure I had the basic skills he was looking for. I chalked this up to their inexperience and need for menial work.

The second position I emailed the main faculty member that headed the whole lab and he got to me like two months later but we set up a meeting. This meeting again did not look for technical skills, but rather I was told what the lab was doing and various interesting projects I could have a hand in. I left knowing more about the lab and with an open invitation to join. They sent me a list of lab staff that I could contact to get more insight into the lab and figure out what project I'd be working on. Luckily the first person I met with at the lab was amazing and I've stuck with this lab.

Again, my experience is probably different than many other majors and areas of study, but I was very upfront about my lack of knowledge in both introductory meetings and both people told me not to worry and that I was joining the lab to learn, not to contribute to ground-breaking work. Any work that you can carry out is a help to the lab, and I feel that a good lab understands that undergrads are joining labs to learn and will not know all the concepts immediately.  

To ease your mind about interviews in general. Most of the research positions understand the education you have recieved. They also understand that the research position is a part of your education, not just a place to exhibit and utilize previously gained knowledge. Make sure to be clear in your emails and get your point accross as efficiently as possible. Don't be disheartened if you are ghosted, everyone in academia is flooded by emails and they may not see your email, or dont want to spend the time writing up a rejection. Just move on and try to find another position you like. 

I hope this helps a bit. Not sure if you are already sure you'll need to interview or if you assumed that all positions will require a rigorous process to weed out candidates. I know I thought the process would be much more arduous.",1577697769,1,0
"I wouldn’t say I have a LOT of experience, but I have some. These tips have also been echoed by professors, those in charge of labs, etc. Went to several undergraduate research workshops, and they also confirmed these tips.

-Attempt to understand and show interest in the lab’s research as best as you can. It’s particularly impressive when you can link multiple studies together. For example, if they ask you why you’re applying, you can list your reasons for ranting to do research but ALSO mention how you found the progression of research in that lab particularly inspiring.

-Know what you’re talking about to the best of your ability. Labs have different kinds of students they want from those who have little experience to those that already have worked on a project. However, trying to come off like you’ve made an effort to understand the subject the research is on can make a good impression. 

-Highlight your relevant skills and education. Do you have precious lab experience? Do you know how to use equipment, especially if it’s relevant to the research. Have you taken relevant classes and done well in them?

-Make sure you know the lab well you’re applying for. If it’s a small lab, emphasizing that you applied because you’d like a more personal research environment can make it look like you care more than other applicants.

-Don’t just be a walking resume. They have that already. Discuss all the things above and why it personally makes YOU a strong applicant.

I hope this helps!",1577697686,1,0

"my friend is psych and she graduated in 1 year and an extra quarter. She could've probably graduated in one year if she came w/ more classes from CC, and also psych is extremely hard to get the right classes, you have to be very lucky since they all fill so quickly. 

I mean in your case I think you should try, given the fact that you're paying international student tuition. It's gonna be tough but it is doable, since it's not like pre-law has prereqs like med school or other grad schools. However, since you are pre-law if you wanna go to an elite school GPA is obviously extremely important, a 3.8 is great but if you wanna get in to a really good law school tbh it's just ""good"". and thats when you took 4 classes, so keep that in mind since you'll be doing 5 classes now, which is gonna be significantly more challenging even if you're a north campus major. (if you were south campus I'd say don't even attempt this unless you're a masochist) 

Also, keep in mind that even tho it may seem like this can work, you have to be sort of lucky for everything to occur the right way. You have to get good first enrollment dates, and the right classes need to be open at the right times. And you're not gonna be able to be that picky w/ times and professors either. Regardless, if I were you I'd be somewhat picky about electives. There are classes that no one knows about that are very easy, you just have to look. Since you're gonna be taking 5 classes a quarter, picking easy electives is going to be key. Also the A+s help your law school GPA like crazy",1577687899,1,0

From my Bruinwalk review:

&gt; ...the TA for this class, Nathan Tung, was quite simply the best TA I have ever seen at UCLA. Not only was his personality great, but he was clearly smart, prepared, well-spoken, and above all, enthusiastic. His sections went above and beyond the other physics discussions I have had so far. Instead of just throwing practice problems and solutions at us, he came well prepared with a plan, and extended topics, explained things from a bit of a different angle, connected things from previous physics classes, and even brought in some cool physics toys to demonstrate with. He was so well-spoken that he almost always felt more like a professor than the actual professor did. At the end of the quarter, he released the 150-page note document to all of us, which was longer than the actual professor's notes and slightly more simply worked in my opinion. Even though he just graduated, I think he was a great example of what TAs can and should try to be.

He has absolutely glowing reviews from everybody else who’s had him as a TA before and I really think he’s going to be a good 1C professor. 

Kang looked to have average reviews, so from my perspective it’s either you take the average professor with probably easier exams, or take the better professor with probably harder exams.",1576695046,1,0

"Hi, current musicology student here. I’ve just finished taking the 125 series and the following 126-8 series as well. 125 is fairly straightforward, just music history from medieval music to postmodernism, although each professor offers a fairly unique take on what that means. For instance, the second class in the series is the 1400’s to the late 1800’s, but it’s done non-chronologically, so if you are really good with dates, you’ll likely have a difficult time. For the most part, the workload is just journal assignments and a final paper. All the professors in the department are more interested in teaching you something than grading you for your work; if you put in the effort for the final paper, show up to class, and do the five-minute weekly journals, you’ll get an A and you’ll learn a somewhat unconventional but altogether standard history of music.

I would really recommend taking a class with Le Guin, Fink, Upton, or Redmond. Le Guin should be teaching 125B next quarter and she’s a genius, could not recommend her class more. The professors at UCLA stand out for being among the most progressive and forward-thinking musicologists in America, so if you’re expecting to learn about Beethoven, then the minor may not be for you. But Fink offers a history of EDM in the spring that’s supposed to be good and will likely give you a good idea of what many of the classes are like.

"I was so confused until I had to learn it to teach it over the summer lol. I thought I had to touch my elbows or something (?? Thanks 2018 transfer orientation) and had a hard time. 

Brief refresher for those who don’t know:
“U” simultaneously pumping (raising, or like punching the air up) RIGHT fist in the air and clap three times
“C” same but pump LEFT fist
“L...” same thing but your “L” is stretched out until your third clap (“Ellll..” *3x clap* “A!”)
“A” Pump left fist and clap three times 

Now you pump your fists right left right left (no claps in between) while saying “U C L A”

Finish with “Fight, fight, fight!” at the same time as pumping your right fist 3 times.

"One thing regarding teaching quality.  When I was in grad school at UCLA there was a major push to improve the quality of teaching.  I don’t know what is happening with that these days, but I can tell you at least in the math department that those course evaluations you fill out at the end of the quarter are taken very seriously, and can have very serious consequences for profs in terms of career progression and for graduate students in terms of future teaching opportunities.

I’d use those opportunities responsibly (it’s not helpful if you just write “teacher was a dick” because they will just assume you’re salty over your grade....instead writing out examples of where this teacher was rude or demonstrated some other failing will get much more attention), but otherwise just know remedies like that do exist.",1575635298,1,0

That said, even if we accept that exactly as you say, I can tell you 100% that potential employers will NOT only care about GPA and will care greatly about where you went to school (in many instances, companies won’t even recruit at, and in some very harsh cases even consider applicants from, lower tier schools).

He usually assigns a bunch of problems (\~10-20) for HW each week, but only 4 are graded. I'd recommend doing as many as you can since his exam questions largely are based off of the hw and the examples he does in class. 

The exams were a little more difficult and proof heavy than I thought they would be, but weren't terrible

The textbook for the class is ridiculously expensive and for some reason chooses to explain algorithms using pseudocode, which I personally found to be annoying. The good thing about Math 61 though is that for every topic you'll be able to find great printed notes and slides online just by googling the topic name, since basically every university has this exact class.

You'll have a lot more time on the final compared to the midterms (3 hours for 10-ish questions compared to less than 1 for 5-ish). Keep calm, study hard, do practice problems, and finesse the hell out of the partial credit system.

"It's supposed to be your introduction to assembly language as well as general processor computer architecture.

I believe CS33 focuses on MIPS. So it would be good to familiarize yourself with what types of instructions there are in that particular ISA as well as how a simple single cycle MIPS implementation would operate (the stages of Instruction Fetch -&gt; Instruction Decode -&gt; Execution -&gt; Memory Access -&gt; Writeback). Should probably also know in high level abdtract how different types of memory operate: e.g. SRAM, DRAM, disk and their relative performances (fast &amp; small, medium size and slow, big and really slow).

"I am very sorry.  The dorm life is certainly challenging, especially for somebody going into it for the first time. I know I struggled quite a bit when I moved into the dorms, and would have mental breakdowns because I felt so alone and far from home. I think that this situation could definitely fall under mental health if you were to try to end your housing contract.  You have a compelling case to do so. In order to end the housing contract, I believe you have to talk to the people at Housing Services. Their office is located to the right of Sproul Hall. That is my best guess.

Keep in mind that if you do go down this route and choose to commute from home, that will be its own challenge as well. You will have to commute quite a ways away everyday that you have class. You'll have to leave extra early in the mornings. Additionally, if when you're not in class you're at home, you might find it harder to make friends on campus and get involved with extracurriculars etc.

There's a part of me that wants to say that I believe that you can get through this and potentially become stronger because of it. But the fact is that it's been two weeks and you are still in significant emotional distress. Be honest with yourself: Has it changed at all? Has it gotten worse? Have you had moments where you thought that ""this isn't that bad"" and perhaps you could get through it with a little bit of struggle?

Think about just having to be in LA for 5 days then a 2 week break. You can motivate yourself that way to get through the week. Commuting will be hell even with the van pools. You can definitely terminate your housing quarter when the quarter ends if you bring up your mental health. Please go to CAPS if you have further problems. Homesickness is very common for freshman. I felt some homesickness in week zero and one. However, as I got busy, joined clubs, and found some friends it got better. Sit at your floor lounge and study in groups or socialize if possible. If you are an introvert like me then try to find people in lecture and labs or just stay outside your dorm if possible. Use the library, check out Westwood, or join some recreational clubs. Test this for a quarter and see if it gets better. If you commute it will be much harder. You will spend the majority of the day at school and come back home pretty late. Then you will have some of the night to be with your family and do hw. Your mornings will be hell too. Also check out the uci-UCLA rideshare on Facebook.

"The only stuff you'll definitely learn in order is lower-division CS material.

First, we start with basic C++ programming to build applications that handle a plethora of mathematical tasks, over the course of two classes (CS31 and 32).

Next is CS33, which goes over more low-level stuff like bitwise operations, assembly, and computer organization. This class uses C.

CS35L goes over a bunch of software development and Unix concepts, including Linux commands, Emacs, Git, Python, patching/diff files, SSH, and pthread parallelization.

CSM51A goes over a bunch of low-level stuff as well, though I'm not familiar with the entire class's curriculum as I'm taking it right now.

Most of the upper div stuff can be taken entirely out of order, but the main well-known upper divs are Operating Systems, Software Engineering, and Algorithms &amp; Complexity.

There is no knowledge that you're required to have by the time you get here, but it's pretty much impossible to be admitted to UCLA's CS program without some CS experience.

"Anything with food waste shouldn't be recycled because it can cause contamination and then everything that came in contact with it can't be recycled. But stuff like cardboard boxes and the takeout containers are compostable, so that bin is probably the safest bet if there's food residue. 
A lot of plastics actually can't be recycled, ""hard"" plastics like empty bottles can be, but the flimsy kind like ziplock bags or thin plastic wrappers have to be thrown in the trash. Plastics with polystyrene (styrofoam) are super hard to recycle, so most facilities don't. 
Any type of bag with aluminum (chip bags, candy wrappers) also have to be thrown in the trash.
Receipts aren't recyclable nor compostable, but if you're throwing them out anyway, the most environmentally friendly option is to ask cashiers not to print them. 
But whenever you're in doubt, it's best to just throw it out to prevent contamination. It's better to have one plastic bottle end up in the landfill than to have to throw out an entire load of recyclables because of something that shouldn't have been there. However, stuff like batteries and fluorescent light bulbs are considered hazardous waste and should not be thrown out in the trash.

"Sure. I can only speak to my experience, but I feel like those who become disillusioned with law experience similar things.

The first law firm I worked for was a ""boutique"" firm that focused on pregnancy discrimination in the workforce. The cause felt right, but it was a really tiny firm with maybe two lawyers at any given point and me as an assistant. The owner was a brilliant lawyer, but a terrible businesswoman who was struggling to keep her head above water. I had to quit after she cut my hours to 15/a week bc business was slow.


The second firm I worked with was for consumer rights-- specifically dealing with lemon law. At first I thought it was a sweet gig. But then I was being asked to do 60+hrs a week because somehow we were always behind on cases. Our day-to-day tasks were pretty much making sure we were responding to discovery requests, subpoenas, and filing motions on time. The junior lawyers all hated it-- you have very little courtroom time in front of a judge, and when you do, it's pretty much for the exact same type of meeting, presenting the same boilerplate objections or a motion that you put together using a template that's been used for 40 other cases. Like, legit, we'd pull the exact same motion and do a search function for the plaintiffs names to replace and that was it.  Even when I got moved to head of trials (where I'd prepare the clients and the attorneys for trial, made sure all required filings were done and exhibits in order, etc.), there was hardly any ""out of the box"" thinking. Also, everyone had an attitude bc the firm pretty much had a pecking order-- partner yelled at junior attorney, Jr attorney yelled at paralegal, paralegal yelled at staff, and everyone got thrown under the bus.


Ultimately, I realized I'd end up with two choices: pursue a law degree to work for a cause I deeply cared about and make no money, or work for a firm that I didn't necessarily feel passionate about and possibly get stuck in a toxic work environment, but can actually pay the bills. Unfortunately, law school is extremely expensive. The ""law firm lifestyle"" you see on TV only applies to a few. In my case, the only people I saw driving the bentz and living it large were the partners at the second firm, both who had had separate businesses elsewhere and were essentially pulling a double income from their investments. All the junior attorneys pretty much felt like they were underpaid and over worked, which fed into the disillusionment.

Saying all that, I do have friends who chose the law school route after all and haven't regretted it. But if this is something you're seriously considering, I strongly recommend you work full-time in that environment before investing all your time, money, and energy on going to law school. Maybe you'll find you  actually enjoy the work and can thrive in that environment. I just personally didn't.

Unsolicited advice: if you're looking for a job that allows you to ""make a change"" in the world and enjoy poli sci, consider looking into a masters in public policy. It's all the consulting and research fun minus the law firm. That's what I ended up doing, and a lot of the work  my grad school peers and I do is used as empirical evidence in policy drafting and state rulings.",1571465644,1,0
