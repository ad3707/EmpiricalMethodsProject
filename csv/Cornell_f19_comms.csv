"It’s honestly pretty good! There are two parts to the course: Music and Neuro. The class has no prereqs, which makes sense, because half the people are those interested in music with no neuro knowledge and the others are neuro bio majors with no music knowledge. So everything you need is taught to you. 
There are no exams, but there are projects and some short papers. The music projects are super fun and open ended and don’t need to be spectacular, so you can do whatever you want. The bio papers are usually you have to watch a performance/listen to something and then BS your way to making it fit with how the brain works. 
It’s definitely not a hard course and is fun! Highly recommended!",1571468480,1,0
"1. Both routes cover roughly the same material. 3420 is less work than 3410, so I personally recommend doing the 3420 route. 

2.
-  Fall Algo with Tardos is generally easier than the Spring version. 

- Consider the prereqs of the elective classes you want to take to decide the order.  

- You can take multiple core classes in one semester. The only pairing that's impossible is (3410, 3110)

&gt; MATH 2940 + BTRY 3080 + CS 2800 + ECE 2300 be possible??? 

Yes that workload is definitely doable. 

&gt; I haven't even thought about the electives, should I already be trying to plan those out as a freshman or can I just chill? :'( 

Just chill for now. At most, look up course offerings and see what courses you want to take at some point. But planning out each semester now doesn't make much sense since course offerings tend to be fluid.",1571463862,1,0

"Took it last semester with her. I would say the class isn't too difficult and has a reputation of being easy, but you do need to put in the effort. Your entire grade is basically made up of two exams (midterm and final) and eight 1-page response essays. The exams weren't too bad and somewhat crammable but surprisingly, the essays were actually graded pretty harshly (at least with my TA) so you do have to put in the time and not last minute BS them (they're worth a lot too, collectively as much as an exam iirc). 

As for the professor...I would say most people weren't a fan of her lectures and cut most of them. She does have a bit of an accent that made her somewhat hard to follow (at least for me) and to be honest she wasn't really the best lecturer in general. However, she seemed pretty kind and approachable, and most of the information you need for he exams can be found in the slides or textbook anyway so it wasn't really a big deal.

"I took it last spring while also taking CHEM 3580 and CHEM 2510 (orgo lab), plus its lab (NS 3420) and two pretty easy NS classes. I believe the median was a B+. If you're a pre-med it'll teach you a TON and be super helpful for shadowing, but the professor is mind-numbingly boring and studying for the weekly quizzes is a lot of work. The prelims are moderately difficult, but nothing you can't do well on if you invest energy in them like you would for orgo. 

I definitely don't recommend the lab — that was a lot harder, and a lot more of your grade rides on big-point items (the practicals). The median was also a B+, but I did worse in the lab than in the lecture.",1572491363,1,0

I thought it was fine, the prof does a decent job of explaining but the thing that'll really help you is the hw. The hw really solidifies all the ideas/concepts.

"1. you don't necessarily have to write about art but it would't hurt to try and connect it to why you do art. tbh i think its good to write about something unrelated to art because the new art curriculum is focused on interdisciplinary artists so they're pushing art students to pursue more scholastic subjects as well as fine arts. 

2. &amp; 3. im not sure how much academics and portfolio is weighted cuz im not in admissions. for portfolio, i would still try my best and meet the requirement, even if the work won't be as strong. thats honestly fine because out of 18 pieces there are bound to be pieces that arent that great. like in my portfolio, some pieces were weaker but i put them in there to show variety and range in my art-making. as for academics, they matter. like for any student that is applying with an added portfolio or what not, you're still going to be evaluated by the regular admissions panel, so you're still expected to meet whatever standard they have for the rest of the class. it doesnt matter if youre in aap or other college. so, yeah your academics would probably be just as important as ur portfolio,

4. right now, cornell has a new art curriculum that focuses on encouraging art students to branch and pursue academics/studies in other subjects. so its good to mention that you have an interest in different areas of students because thats what theyre looking for. in fact, we have a requirement number of electives that we have to take and we can choose what courses no matter what college.

"Before dropping, try practicing a bit more. The learning process, especially when learning something physical, is heavily based on creating routine and memory so you can get used to the motions. 

I did not know how to swim when I first started and I was that one kid everyone giggled at when I tried to float. I was the last one to pass the swim test. I would encourage you to go to any office hour offered. They also have open swim hours on Saturdays and some mornings or something like that where anyone is welcome to come practice. Try doing that. Watch youtube videos of instructors talking you through it and try to immitate. You'll finally get it. 

The goal of the course is to have you know how to at least float. That's it for the swim test. Practice just that for a few times a week and you'll get it. 

If you really feel like you can't do it, go to the floor of Helen Newman where the gym is located. Down the hallway and to your right is the PE office. There is a form you fill out and they'll drop you but remember that you'll get a W on your transcript. Also in the future, please keep in mind that some PE courses with fees are nonrefundable and you may be charged to merely drop. I signed up for a PE course with a  $340 fee and was charged an extra $50 for dropping so I basically paid nearly $400 just to add then drop the course.

Good luck.

""Generally, however, hate speech is any form of expression through which speakers intend to vilify, humiliate, or incite hatred against a group or a class of persons."" -- [ALA](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/hate)

""‘Hate speech’ consists of verbal or non-verbal communication that involves hostility directed towards particular social groups, most often on the grounds of race and ethnicity (racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, etc), gender (sexism, misogyny), sexual orientation (homophobia, transphobia), age (ageism), disability (ableism), etc."" -- [Oxford Law](https://oxcon.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law-mpeccol/law-mpeccol-e130)

Hate speech is a statement intended to demean and brutalize another, or the use of cruel and derogatory language on the basis of real or alleged membership in a social group.[1] Hate speech is speech that attacks a person or a group on the basis of protected attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech)",1570437391,1,0

"A few things: 

1. Just don’t take notes. What’s the point? If your baseline is learning nothing in lecture, and taking notes does nothing, then those notes are pointless. They’re a sunk cost anyway so just don’t take them and tell yourself you’re going to watch the lecture like a movie. 

2. Tell yourself you only have to absorb 40% of the information. Again, that other 60% is a sunk cost because you weren’t going to absorb it anyway, and 40% is better than nothing. Not putting too high pressure on yourself will keep your mind from worrying about whether or not you’re learning enough. You can review any posted slides, maybe your friends notes (if you have friends, I kinda don’t, so this motivates me to talk to people in class)

3. Figure out the topic beforehand and try to learn about it for like 10 minutes before lecture so that you frel familiar with it. Like just read some Wikipedia on it or something and you’ll absorb so much more if it feels like you’re not being exposed to it for the first time in lecture. And let’s be honest with ourselves: we weren’t going to thoroughly do the readings beforehand anyway. 

4. Find a place to sit in lecture and sit in it all the time. I think it makes it kind of fun to feel like you have your “own” seat, and you also might notice regulars sitting around you. Don’t worry about this if you’re always late to lecture.

5. Lastly, I haven’t tried this one yet, but try to play with something in your hand while you watch the lecture. I recently got diagnosed and my parents just bought me a fidget cube... 🙄 I’ll lyk how it goes",1570435284,1,0

"&gt;""If someone can put together an argument for the statement ""supporting Hong Kong is hate speech"" I would like to hear it""

Yeah, I'll play devil's advocate for this one.

Supporting the Hong Kong protests, by definition, is supporting protesting against the Chinese Authoritarian regime.  As a result, doing so invariably influences Hong Kong citizens to revolt against mainland China.  This revolt directly leads to physical altercations, altercations which have caused harm to thousands of citizens of Hong Kong.  As a result, regardless of the Hongkongers desire for freedom and self-representation, these protests have resulted in massive amounts of infighting between citizens and local police.

So, because this infighting is inherently bad and not ideal for a well-constructed nation, the Hong Kong protests are inherently hateful, and support for Hong Kong protestors is inherently Hate Speech^^TM.

While I would denounce anyone for following this train of thought, it wouldn't be the most ludicrous train of thought to come out of Mainland China, and it is for this reason (among others) that I believe anti-Hate Speech laws are insidious by design.",1570430964,1,0

"It's so inappropriate and disrespectful to peel off those stickers — what a shame. People put them up for a reason. Whoever put back those stickers deserves supports, and I stand with you as a Cornell student. However, I am afraid I mostly have to disagree with the message the stickers conveyed. While the protest certainly began from a good point, what's been happening in HK turned out to be a real fight, and not only for freedom anymore. As extremely biased Chinese nationalists might report the news from the Chinese media and controlled by CCP, I attached a piece of the news published by the L.A. Times, which might be more trustworthy (at least the messages in the photo are undeniable).

Here are two suggestions to people who'd like to speak out for the ""One Country, Two Systems"" policy, going against the violent activists in HK, or whatever:

1. Don't peel off the HK stickers. Seriously it's disgusting.
2. Spread your messages on campus. Your voice matters, and you could certainly make some good points with all the facts that have happened so far.

Also, I just finished watching the Politician on Netflix this weekend and I am still in that state of mind. this is probably a bad criticism, but it is possible that all the putting-up-the-stickers-and-peeling-them-off could be done by the same group of people...

Theo's grading philosophy is just different, the numbers aren't what you would think, i.e. a 70-79 isn't actually a C/D, it's actually an A/B. I forgot exactly what number grades I was getting for essays in that class, but I thought I was getting a C/D, too, until I talked to him and was pleasantly surprised. 

The basic gist of his grading philosophy that I got from his explanation was that getting a 90-100% on a  math/science test makes sense, because it's hit or miss. But getting that high on an essay doesn't make as much sense to him, because there's always so much you can improve in writing.

The median for PHIL 1111 on my transcript shows as an A-, but it probably also takes into account all the other PHIL 1111 FWS classes, which are not taught by Theo. But my feeling is that his class probably had a median of A- as well, so your friend's probably doing alright.",1576708719,1,0

"Senior here. I took 2070 with Lancaster when I was a freshman.

First, a couple of things I wanna clarify.

Lancaster actually likes teaching 2070, ever since he was brought on board. It’s his baby, and he even restructured the whole content schedule to a more reasonable sequence a year ago. The reason that he was not the Professor this semester was because this semester was his sabbatical, which means he could not teach. From what I’ve heard, Dr. Lee asked to fill in for Lancaster this semester, one because he wanted to teach 2070, two because no one else in the department wanted to teach 2070 (not really a page-turner of a course).

Now (and take this with a grain of salt, I’m going off of what I heard from some chem people), there was a bit of hesitancy allowing Lee to teach 2070, because when he taught 1560 (baby Gen Chem) some years back, it was apparently a disaster. I don’t know how true this is.

Now, on to the Final.

Knowing both professors, they are both good people. They both want their students to succeed, and they are both good instructors in their own way. However, they both have flaws. Lancaster sometimes overestimates student ability, and Lee has a lack of patience and short temper (back in my year he screamed at a girl in 1070 for not understanding a concept well, it was extremely rude and mean-spirited, but I guess he lost his temper). There does exist animosity between the two, they both believe they are better at teaching than the other (personally I believe Lancaster’s method is superior), however they are both professional and would not work to actively sabotage the other, and neither would certainly not be out to “get” students. What I believe happened based on all I heard is that Lancaster overestimated again, and his final was simply too hard. He didn’t do it out of spite or malice, it was probably an honest mistake. If it really was that challenging and people did poorly, the class will be curved accordingly.

But enough about that. Congrats to all of you for finishing 2070! It’s a hard class no matter who’s teaching it, so great work everyone!",1576706852,1,0

"My final thoughts are that yes there are benefits from GL, but as far as I can tell, those benefits go to those who participate in GL (which is inherently exclusive), while I personally and impersonally know plenty of people who have been hurt by GL that we’re not participants. So my outlook is that it is a displaced sense of benefits and costs, since all the benefits go to one group while the harms are more spread out through the greater Cornell community. But I acknowledge my own bias on this issue if that means anything

Yeah, you too. Thanks for talking it thru",1576704844,1,0

"I think its hard to pin sexual assault on college campuses, which is a massive issue, solely on fraternities just because they host parties. 

When 50% of campus sexual assaults are alc related, it makes sense that they occur in those spaces but I dont think its fair to say that “GL is raping people” like your trying to imply. 

I agree its an issue that GL has to do a better job addressing but once again, not really a believer that banning alc/GL is an answer here.",1576703993,1,0

"No, it’s pedantry when you ask ridiculous hypotheticals or say things like “the university shouldn’t control who can be friends”. No shit.

Even when I talk to people who go to OU (in my home state), they have frat boys die about once a year or more, and I never hear of it happening to other students. 

Again, I’m not saying it never does, but there is clearly something different in frat culture that leads to more deaths than band, squirrel watching club, normal friend groups, etc.",1576703871,1,0

"Ok. I disagree, since I kinda don’t like unchecked sexual assault and hazing, but we can disagree on that, bc I don’t doubt that GL members do enjoy many benefits. The question is, at how many people’s expense do frat bros and srat girls deserve those benefits? I argue that if one rape happens in a frat, then that frat deserves 0 benefits that they enjoy from being in GL, but I also will admit that I’m much harsher on GL than most.",1576703210,1,0
"
Gonna have to strongly disagree with that one esp at Cornell. Most incidents aren’t people in greek life, its people/freshman that dont know how to drink and will continue to drink irresponsibility whether its in Greek houses or Lev B/some random house party in ctown

“Banning GL” isnt a solution for student safety, only a solution for Cornell’s legal team, who now wouldnt be responsible for student safety when they all inevitably go underground and start to become actually dangerous.

Ppl in GL also report being happier, feeling supported, and have higher gpas, which is very important when you remember that the highest number of college age deaths is sucicide (esp at Cornell) and not anything alc/greek related. 

Theres issues in GL, but banning GL is a non-solution and would hurt students/campus life more than anything else",1576702983,1,0
"Again, this is pretty pedantic. It’s not about the university regulating your friends. Seriously? It’s about either the university taking it upon itself to allow GL and manage it, or cut it loose and wipe its hands of it. There’s no reason the Cornell should do neither: either step in and fix it yourself, or let frat bros kill their brain cells off your dime. 

And I literally never said that, but frats do produce more alcohol related deaths than other groups.",1576702939,1,0
"I think banning Greek Life is actually a very popular opinion. My concern is what does that actually mean? Like the University could kick the fraternities out of the houses. However, if those students just continued off campus should they be disciplined? What if me and a couple of friends put some random Greek letters above our house in Collegetown, could we be expelled? How far does the university want to go in order to dictate who can and can't be friends with one another? In legislating what we can and can't do even if it is nothing illegal or against the code of conduct?

Also, come on. It isn't like the whole country has perfectly healthy alcohol behaviors and the only deaths are coming from Greek life.",1576702769,1,0

"I mean I would rather ban hard liquor and let frats have as beer. 

I know this may not a super popular opinion, but I truly do believe the problem is Greek life itself. We’re sitting here trying to dance around that point, but I think it’s time to address it. Most college students drink, many party, and some go too hard for their own good. But it seems clear even from just this single source I linked that the culture in Greek life is incredibly problematic. Most college students can drink alcohol responsibly, and then GL manages to get students killed and has high levels of sexual misconduct. Imo, it’s time to ban GL",1576702149,1,0
"One of the biggest reasons for the increase in recent deaths nationwide has been alcohol bans - since it forces people to switch to liquor(which is easier to do in secret) and much more dangerous to overconsume.

The root of a lot of alc issues is just the drinking age - and over 136 presidents have signed a call to lower it. Meanwhile Martha just passed a rule that calls for any house who calls an EMS to help a party-goer to receive an automatic 3 year suspension...",1576701984,1,0

Depends on what you want to do after graduation. If you just want to be a SWE at a tech company then as long as you have above like a 3.3 then it doesn't matter.

"Probably bc seniors get first dibs on pre-enroll...if you really want to get into a particular course ask the math department now to see if they have room often times they acknowledge that if you care enough to ask that you deserve a spot.

"Keep in mind that Cornell CS grads tend to get the best CS jobs, and the best CS jobs are in extremely high COL areas. You have to read in-between the lines.

For example:
&gt; For example, HUD defined “Low Income Limits” in San Francisco as $82,200 for an individual and $117,400 for a family of four in 2018,

That 102-112k base you get out of school in the bay isn't all it's cracked up to be. 

___________________

Conversely a lot of MechE jobs are in cheaper areas. A very large Lockheed Martin office is in Fort Worth, Texas and compensations are generally around ~65-75k out of school for just a MechE B.S. You see 112k vs. 70k and you say, ""wow! mechE/&lt;other major&gt; blows!"" but COL plays a very big role:

See this [cost of living calculator](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&amp;country2=United+States&amp;city1=San+Francisco%2C+CA&amp;city2=Fort+Worth%2C+TX).

"Hang in there, I'm a junior studying CS at Cornell and I have definitely been through a similar situation. It's the point in the semester where paying attention in lecture becomes near impossible and people start doing their best to just stay afloat. You are absolutely not alone in that. I had a really tough time trying to make friends through CS classes, the lectures are too massive and the average CS major is generally pretty introverted which makes it hard to make meaningful connections. Most of my friends came from outside of CS but over time I've definitely made a few great CS friends as well. Imposter syndrome is especially prevalent among CS majors and you have to remind yourself that there are a ton of people that feel exactly the same as you do rn. You really just have to put yourself out there and try to meet people and not be afraid of being rejected. Joining other clubs and having non coding hobbies will also make a world of difference. Along the same lines, you dont have to take super heavy semesters loaded with CS classes even if it seems like everyone else is. Try to find at least 1 class that you are genuinely interested in and seems like fun every semester.

"
I am a graduate PHD student in the Hotel School and witnessed an assault by Ankur Mulji on an undergrad last night.

Ankur approached an undergraduate student and harassed the individual with threats on a sidewalk as the undergraduate student was waiting for the bus, and continuously stating that the individual ""does not belong at Cornell because he/she is an undergraduate student"". Ankur also continued his verbal assault, stating that ""undergraduates are scum and do not have any jobs when they graduate Cornell"" and other racial slurs directed towards the student's home country, and that he himself is part of the ""prestigious Baker Program, and will make sure the [undergraduate student] will have an awful time at Cornell"". Ankur then continued to attempt to physically intimidate the undergraduate student by standing right against the student's physical body, physically slapping the undergraduate student's chest, and stated that he will follow the student onto the bus when the student explicitly told Ankur ""to get away"". Ankur only stopped when the student stated that he/she will call the police if the behavior does not stop, and Ankur walked away saying that ""[the student] made a mistake, and he (Ankur) will be seeing the student real soon"". All of these assaults and threats were because the undergraduate student was merely waiting for a night time bus on the sidewalk, as Ankur pushed past the student, only to turn around to tell the student to ""move the fuck off the sidewalk"".

This conduct by a graduate student clearly indicates a distinct pattern from Ankur of hatred towards undergraduate students, which is completely unacceptable as Cornell now host nearly 15,000 undergraduate students during the school year. The physical and verbal threats for harm is completely unacceptable from graduate students, especially as they are often times a lot older and stronger than undergraduates that just entered college. I also believe Cornell shouldn't allow this type of behavior at all from graduate students or permit the acceptance and existence of these types of graduate students, whom do not intend to ""share"" the campus with undergraduates, as this erodes from the ""Cornell Community"" that we all sought to build here on campus. This feeling of graduate superiority, egotism, and hate should not exist on our campus, to the point of nearly a hate crime, as it specifically targets undergraduate students.",1575669856,1,0
