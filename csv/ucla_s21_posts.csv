Poli Sci 115 w/ Lohmann Groupme?,"Shot in the dark but is anyone in a groupme for this class?

Sorry to be posting this here but long story short there are somehow no lectures and discussion sections for this class... and the professor somehow removed all the forums from CCLE... and this is possibly the most confusing, least intuitive looking syllabus I've ever seen. Honestly I'm confused how even call this a class.

Grade Dispute - what‚Äôs the best route forward?,"Hey guys, I took a class this past quarter and basically I was on the edge of an A- and A. I received my grade which was an A- but saw that I had a few questions on the final where there were some grading mistakes. I usually wouldn‚Äôt make a big deal out of this, but as I was on the edge I calculated my grade and found that those grading errors, if corrected, would bring me to an A. 

I reached out to the professor with multiple emails regarding the grading errors, and a detailed explanation of why I felt I was incorrectly graded for each question. The professor‚Äôs responses were dismissive, and the last email I just received was him saying he‚Äôs now on break till fall so I‚Äôd have to wait until then to discuss the questions with him, which feels unreasonable. 

While an A- is still pretty good, it‚Äôs just frustrating knowing that I should‚Äôve had an A but didn‚Äôt due to minor grading errors, especially when my attempts to discuss it with the professor are being dismissed.

What is my best route moving forward? Should I contact the department or just take the L?",1617059248,1,0

CS 31 Question,"Hi, 

I am a baby bruin who just got accepted into EE (although I am going to try to switch into CS once I go). I was looking at the CS curriculum and it is my understanding that the primary language taught at UCLA is C++ (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong lol). I use primarily Python and so once I got in, I have been practicing a little C++. I was wondering if there was any way I could access past CS 31 (which i believe is the introductory cs class at UCLA) projects and tests to practice? If not, what resources should I use to practice my C++? right now I'm just doing leetcode easy problems.

so these days i feel like on top of work, school, clubs, internship searches, i have to walk on eggshells at home. recuperate w my mom, console and protect my younger sister, avoid dragging in my older siblings w any arguments. when my fathers home everyone is on edge, and he likes to hang out in the room by our kitchen, so i havent eaten a genuine meal while he is home. just tonight he told us to stop buying food ( we have an extraordinarily complex relationship with money as a family and he is enabled by it )

basically i cant really escape the restlessness and avoidance, and i really want to focus and do well this quarter. obv there probably arent any accommodations from the school itself that would help w our living situation, esp bc my father is paying for my tuition and i am nowhere near financially stable on my own. i cant really leave home for class either bc the pandemic is very... present lol. any suggestions?

People always say wow you go to UCLA so cool but I fucking hate it here. I hated UCLA so much by the end of my first year and it has been a full year since I been back and my bitterness and resentment has hit an astronomical level. I fucking swear if you graphed my resentment it would be a stupid logistic curve. Hopefully it‚Äôs an S curve?????

I‚Äôve muted everyone on social media but I have literally been tagged in graduation posts and I can‚Äôt fucking cope. No one cares and I just want to scream into the void and see if anyone else can understand because no one else I know does. I feel so behind in life because of this and a number of reasons. I know everyone has different paths in life and that‚Äôs cool but I can never relax my standards for myself.  

I quit pre med because I am sure it‚Äôd eventually drive me to suicide at any point in the timeline and my brain is so shit right now. I have an autoimmune disease and I have the worst fucking brain fog. I can barely speak without sounding like a complete empty idiot. I can‚Äôt even do simple shit for my classes and I‚Äôm sitting and crying staring at my test for 15 minutes trying to figure out how to ‚Äúconvert‚Äù 90/134 on a percentage scale up to 100. Jesus Christ you just fucking divide it and there!!! 

I don‚Äôt look forward to tomorrow. And especially chem 14d. I barely passed 14c and ughh.

CSE or CE?,"I'm currently a CSE major transferred last Fall.  I took CS97 last quarter and that class traumatized me so much so I'm considering changing my focus to hardware.

Would appreciate it if someone can give some insights about the two majors and the job outlook for both of them. 

p/s: I took some ECE courses (3, 100, 102) and I kinda enjoy them and the materials weren't too terrible for me. I also took M51A and 97 so I'm not really sure if I just hate CS97 or software in general.",1616991959,1,0

UCLA ($$) vs UW ($) vs UNC ($) vs Rutgers vs Texas A&amp;M (free),"I was really struggling with this decision before I got into UCLA, but now that I got into 3 of my top schools and got a full ride at another school, the decision is insanely hard.

Truth be told, I really loved UNC, UW and UCLA. I was shocked enough when I was accepted to UW and UNC/full rides, and was really stressed about that decision, and was leaning UW, but then UCLA decided to accept me. Now, I have no idea what to do. I can't tell if a UCLA degree is worth 50-60k more in loans compared to UW or UNC, or whether anything is worth taking loans for compared to full rides.

Plague of Thirst,"Finals season is coming soon, we're all burnt out from zoom uni. Some of us can barely wake up in the morning, others feel like they're perpetually suffocating. A lot of us have void social lives, with a Discord call or two every so often to catch up, or maybe nothing at all. Some of us have deferred back to comfort video games from 2004 to escape reality. Some of us have started cultivated coca plants in their backyard, others have picked up on cooking with ghost peppers. There are even those who have decided to make their own hand lotion, and those who learned the name of every observable star in the sky from the northern hemisphere.

Can someone explain to me why UCLA doesn't give a single fuck about its business students?,"UCLA - top 20 school, crazy low acceptance rate, but for some reason, our career center is one of the worst. Can someone explain to me why a school like Indiana University sends about 80 kids a year into investment banking while UCLA only sends like 25-30 at max? Outside of that, Indiana University has dedicated workshops all across the board for other business careers as well that successfully propel students into other high finance careers outside of investment banking, like capital markets, wealth management, and other business roles like consulting.

Look here: [https://kelley.iu.edu/programs/undergrad/academics/workshops/index.html](https://kelley.iu.edu/programs/undergrad/academics/workshops/index.html)

Meanwhile, UCLA, although it claims to want to boost its numbers, only took 16 students this year into its prestigious IB Sharpe Fellows program, and about 20 kids into its workshop (with pretty much every kid from Sharpe in workshop). Also, the investment banking workshop at UCLA is run by students, so a lot of times, it's students letting their friends in. While at Kelley, it's run by faculty, so they're able to judge their students based on merit, and not which clubs they're in and who they're friends with. Speaking of clubs, we have a bunch of selective clubs here that make everything worse for everyone as well, destroying hopes of underclassman who can't get into those clubs their first and second years.

For a top 20 school, why the fuck is our career center so content with sending the majority of our Business/Econ majors into shitty paying accounting roles every single fucking year? UCLA loves to brag about they admit a shit ton of first generation college students - okay, well the poverty cycle is gonna fucking continue if all you do is send them into audit. Pretty much all the kids who nab those successful IB/consulting jobs are UCLA are privileged/rich - I seriously don't think I've met a single one who was a first-generation or low income student.

Consulting recruiting is pretty bullshit here too - we only send about 5-7 kids a year into MBB, and probably about 10 more into T2 firms. Berkeley, Michigan, UVA alone send about 20 kids into MBB, and another shit ton into T2. Meanwhile, UCLA is content with sending a bunch of kids into fake consulting roles like Deloitte Tech and Accenture Tech Development Program.

Just wanted to rant here. My friends at UVA have such an easy time with recruiting because their clubs matter less and their alumni push for them, while it's been kinda rough for me at UCLA. Just wish the career center saw this shit and revamped recruiting at UCLA, instead of letting everything be ran by the kids who knew they wanted to be in banking since freshman year of high school because their parents were.",1614837139,85,1

Do you or someone you know fear social situations or have sudden anxiety? (UCLA Treatment Study),"The Anxiety and Depression Research Center at UCLA invites you to participate in an ongoing psychological treatment study. The Optimizing Exposure Therapy (OptEx) Study is designed to examine the effectiveness of two different types of therapy for individuals with panic disorder or social anxiety disorder. Both treatments involve repeatedly confronting feared sensations and situations, known as exposure therapy. One treatment focuses on methods to enhance the learning that occurs during exposure therapy, while the other emphasizes reducing fear during exposure therapy. Each of these therapies includes components and therapeutic strategies that have been demonstrated to be effective. 

Payment and Fees 

Participants will be offered 9 weeks of free treatment and a $25 E-Gift Card at the end of the study! 

Treatment Procedures

Treatment is conducted one on one, over 9 weekly sessions via Zoom. 

Remote assessments are conducted prior to beginning treatment, mid-treatment, at the completion of treatment, and 3 months later. These assessments include diagnostic evaluations and a battery of self-report questionnaires. 

Screening Procedures If you are interested, please follow the link below to learn more information about the study and to determine your current eligibility: [https://uclapsych.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_bDgQvtz5hx6NzbT](https://uclapsych.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bDgQvtz5hx6NzbT) 

We will contact you regarding your eligibility within the next few business days after you submit the form. 

Note you must be between the ages of 18-65 in order to be eligible to participate.

what do i do...,"my grandfather passed away last thursday right before finals and i tried to power through the work. i don't know what i should do for one of my classes. i literally had zero time to study for the final due to grieving and being there with my family, what is the best course of action. he was someone that i grew up with and maintained contact when he moved out of the country on facetime and he just left so unexpectedly. i have had family and friends coming over for the past week and his funeral arrangements are still up in the air as i may end up leaving the country during the pandemic and i just don't know how that is going to be either. i have a final tomorrow but i feel as if asking for an  incomplete is a bit ill timed because i should have contacted him much earlier. should i at least contact him and let professor know whats happening. how would i even structure something like this. i just am stressed out because i have so much on my plate right now and this class is my lowest grade and i fear i may not pass the class. i think i am able to deal with my other classes because i had studied ahead and far more before this happened, but this class in particular i was banking on studying for the last week and now it is essentially past and gone with no progress.",1615932101,1,0

Should I drop Cog Sci minor and take up a History minor instead?,"Okay so I‚Äôm a transfer DESMA major and I‚Äôm currently trying to double minor in both Cog Sci and Digital Humanities. I‚Äôm currently taking Psych 85 to fulfill the Cog Sci minor requirement before I can declare it but I just recently took the midterm for Psych 85 last week and I feel that I did really bad. I haven‚Äôt gotten my grade back yet so I‚Äôm not 100% I did horrible but I‚Äôm already considering taking it P/NP to save my GPA if I do end up doing bad. So my question is, if I end up doing alright and passing the class, should I even continue pursuing the Cog Sci minor? I do find the material very interesting and the reason why I chose this minor is because I‚Äôm interested in potentially pursuing UI/UX design. However, I don‚Äôt exactly need the minor and I‚Äôm unsure if I want to ruin my GPA over it. I‚Äôm confident I can keep my grades up for my major but Cog Sci is completely different and is for the most part unrelated to it. Plus I‚Äôm low-key kind of anal about not getting straight A‚Äôs. 

I talked to my best friend about this issue as well and he said that if I‚Äôm interested in the material than I should stick with it. Basically he said C‚Äôs get degrees and that I should get used to not getting A‚Äôs in University all the time. A part of me thinks he‚Äôs right and that I should just settle for not getting straights A‚Äôs all the time but also apart of me wants to graduate with a high GPA and with Latin honors. I also want to pursue Grad school as well so I‚Äôm conflicted on what I should do. Should I chicken out and drop it and pursue an easier minor like history? (I‚Äôm a good writer and I love history as well so I believe I would excel in this minor). I don‚Äôt know what to do. Any advice is welcome, including some tough love.

Also if I do stick with the Cog Sci minor and end up declaring it, how do I get into the upper division classes? Most of the classes I‚Äôve seen require pre-requisites but my major is completely unrelated so I won‚Äôt be taking those pre-requisites.",1613851611,1,0

What are my chances of getting into UCLA as a transfer student from a CC?,"I originally applied to UCLA as a freshman out of high school and was rejected, but being my dream school, I am trying again from a community college. My GPA from my college coursework is 3.78, I have finished a lot of coursework for my intended major of Psychology, and have passed 7 out of 9 AP tests from my high school education. I am also in Alpha Gamma Sigma at my community college which is for academic honors and have an internship at a physiology department, and plenty of employment experience throughout college and high school (averaging 30 hrs a week from freshman year to present), but based on the statistics of getting into UCLA and the increase in the number of applicants this year (from 26,000 transfer applicants to 29,000 transfer applicants and 139,000 freshmen applicants) I am constantly stressing as to whether this is even enough, as I never participated in any organized EC's, I mainly just discussed my passion for skateboarding in one of my prompt essays. A few questions I had were; will be requesting financial aid deter my ability to be accepted versus someone who can pay upfront, and also will a YMCA internship from freshman year of high school still count as applicable for my application, or is that too far in the past to account for anything?

Chegg Tracking Ip Addresses,"So I had a midterm today and I'm pretty sure somebody posted a midterm question on chegg. Our professor allows us to use the internet during our tests and I was confused on one of the problems so naturally I went to the internet to get ideas on how to solve it. This is a math exam so I was scrolling through google images to see if I could find a problem similar to the midterm question and learn the process on how to solve it. I instantly came across a question that looked eerily similar to one of the midterm questions and I clicked on it to open up the picture to examine further. Turns out it was actually one of the midterm questions posted on chegg. I left the tab immediately once I realized that it was a midterm question.

For those whose SSN have been leaked or is just overall anxious about the whole data breach: Steps,"See if you guys actually got an email from ucla that your data has been leaked. If you have follow UCLA's instruction to sign up for experion and monitor any fraudulant activity.

Now, lets say your nervous bc what if your too late. Then, intiate a credit freeze at all 3 of the natl credit bureaus( experion, transunion, and equifax). Its really simple, just a quick registration and you should be able to enable it. This will prevent a 3rd party indv from having access to your credit report which helps to prevent someone from using your identity to open credit cards, lease a car, etc.

Now, that you've done that heres just a quick side note. Someone having access to your ssn isnt something new. You practically hand it out for a lot of things, school, official documents, leasing, etc and those receiving it are random people as well. Also, keep in mind unless you actually have a good credit score(700-800), I would say its hard to open anything under your name.",1619154370,1,0

As the Daily Bruin only reaches out to students, the statement would be credible either way.

Potential Abuser as Professor,"Hi guys,

This is obviously a throwaway account but the other day I was browsing for reviews of a current Professor I have for a class this quarter, and came across a very disturbing post about him. I have attached the links below. Please do NOT open if you are triggered by cases of sexual assault or domestic abuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is evident in these posts that he is a psychopath and an abuser. Although there are two sides to every story, this side is with so much evidence its hard to see the other. What can be done about this? I have already emailed the Geography department where he teaches and was met with no response, almost like they did not care or were trying to cover it up. An individual with qualities and past behavior of that nature should not be in a position to teach young adults, especially at UCLA.

"Advisory to Female Bruins: Foot Fetishist on Campus Asking Students to Record Feet, Disingenuous","Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to post a friendly advisory here about a foot fetishist who has been frequenting campus and asking women to film their feet. 

&amp;#x200B;

His channel on YouTube is ""Scouting Sessions,"" and features him championing the benefits of ""dialectal behavioral therapy"" and ""exposure therapy"" to unsuspecting students‚Äîbefore asking them to film their feet. He frames the interaction as a mental health exercise he has personally used to overcome unfounded anxiety in his own life. He then pressures his ""interview"" participants to allow his playing with and smelling of their feet, countering students' objections with a formulaic line 

""Is this posing a threat to your life or health? Well, then you should embrace the experience. Sometimes we hold irrational fear towards new experiences, but you might find that beyond your fear is a great time waiting for you, if you let go of your inhibitions."" He has already made dozens of videos on campus (in a couple-month time span), and seems intent on making more.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to make a few points with this post:

&amp;#x200B;

1) This person, ""Scouting Sessions"" is well within his rights to film on campus. I do not intend to shame foot fetishists with this post, nor do I mean to suggest that he should not continue doing what he has been doing. I wish more power to him if he introduces more transparency to his interactions. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, for an interaction to be just, both parties must be informed about the nature of their interaction. In this case, about the nature of their **transaction**. He sells the process primarily as a mental health exercise, and this is **patently untrue.** This is fetish content, plain and simple. If you peruse the comment sections of his videos, they are populated entirely by foot fetishists, who make plenty of comments about the feet of the students featured, but who couldn't care less about the ""therapy"" aspects of his videos, unless they are trying to adopt his methods wholesale in their own quest for fetish models. 

&amp;#x200B;

So his framing of the interaction is deeply disingenuous. He pretends as if both him and the participant are growing as individuals in lowering their mental defenses and trying this new thing. **But the student is the only one that is letting their guard down.** **He is following a script, a formula, that he has rinsed and repeated hundreds of times, and the sole aim of his formula is to produce fetish content with students' feet.** 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Should you encounter him on campus, you should feel free to say **NO** to his requests. I am not a psychologist, and I am sure that dialectal behavioral therapy is a great therapeutic tool. But the logic of that system can be abused by individuals using it for personal gain. Keith Raniere and the NXIVM cult used CBT and other legitimate therapeutic tools to program their victims for the leader's gain.

&amp;#x200B;

3) If you are a woman Bruin on campus **(he is not interested in opening the mind using exposure therapy with male bruins for some reason)** you too are well within your rights to grant him an interview. I should not need to say this. No one should be shamed for participating in the interview, because there is nothing wrong with making informed and consensual fetish content. For this reason, I was hesitant to even make this post. But I truly believe that the majority of students he stops on campus are being misled, and deserve this notice before they are uploaded to a fetishist YouTube channel. Please consider letting friends who are on campus know.",1611646512,1,0

The B I deserved but the C was a fluke that may be my most impressive L I have ever taken in my life (I slept in for a test worth 20% of my grade, and it wasn't the final, cuz my phone ran out of battery in the middle of the night and I had somehow unplugged it in my sleep so my alarm never went off.

If the rest of your internet works but Zoom glitches, the ports that Zoom uses might be blocked on your individual modems/routers. After spending 1-2 hours trying to pursue a wannabe career in IT, here is a list of steps so you don't have to do the same: 

1) find your IP address. a good guide on how to do that for devices: [https://www.purevpn.com/what-is-my-ip/router-ip](https://www.purevpn.com/what-is-my-ip/router-ip)

2) you'll need to forward ports -- basically unblocking the firewall so Zoom can connect efficiently to your WiFi network.  this is a good general guideline I read:  [https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/)

Has anybody heard from the Financial Aid Office about student relief from the latest stimulus/covid-relief bill?,"The COVID-relief and stimulus bill signed into law on December 27, 2020 allocated another round of the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund  (HEERF II). When CARES was passed in March, there were universal and need-based grants given out because of the first round of HEERF. 

The financial aid office website states only:
&gt; The UC and UCLA are still waiting on guidance on the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (HEERF II) signed into law on December 27, 2020. We will post additional information on our home page as more information becomes available to us.

See [this post for some details about last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gcg4m5/cares_act_update/)... UCLA was super slow with disbursement last time too. It's now been almost a month since that law was passed and the Department of Education guidance for institutions is already out. 

According to [this PDF from the U.S. Department of Education](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/314a1allocationtableheerfii.pdf) it looks like the latest round of HEERF resulted in $52.6 million being allocated to UCLA, with at least $17.9 million of that going towards student aid. (Page 7)

My question is: **has anybody contacted the financial aid office about when we will receive the student aid allocated from the latest COVID relief package?**",1611632743,1,0

I suppose humanities classes tend to have a lot of reading which takes up time, so I understand that.

"TW: Mental Illness, SA // Are there any students who struggle with severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD that can offer any insight or advice?","I‚Äôve had severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD since I was a kid, and it‚Äôs improved a lot since 2020 when I found spirituality and stoicism, but I‚Äôm struggling a lot with school. I practice gratitude and mindfulness in attempts to keep some peace in my life, but everything still seems so stressful all the time. I also have been going to therapy for a year. 

I used to experience constant graphic suicidal ideation in grades 9-11 during class, and it‚Äôs been occurring again since the start of the quarter :( I‚Äôm always crying, and I hate it. My brain is also extremely foggy and forgetful because of the depression. School has just made me so angry and sad for some reason, especially in my stem classes. 

Everyone I‚Äôve met so far absolutely loves UCLA and isn‚Äôt struggling in their classes at all, they‚Äôre first years like me too. I feel so stupid, and I know I‚Äôm behind in my classes. 

I think this week has been especially rough since my aunt has just passed away two days ago. And in therapy last week, I realized that I was groomed and raped by one of my (ex)best friends and I‚Äôm learning how to recover from it, and midterms are this week. It isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve grieved the loss of a loved one, nor is it the first time I‚Äôve had to recover from SA, but I know it will take me some to finally be ‚Äúokay‚Äù again.

Summer Sessions Advice 2021,"Hi all,

I was wondering if anybody had any advice on taking the summer sessions? I'm currently a first year pre-psychobiology major, and at first I thought I could take CHEM 14D during the summer but that isn't an option, so now I'm left looking at my other prerequisites. I still need to take the LS7A series and PHYS 5A series, and I still need to take PSYCH 10 too. Does anybody have any advice as to how manageable any of these classes would be during the summer? Especially now that everything is online? I could also take a GE during the summer too I suppose, but I wanted to use my GEs to balance my 3294723 other stem classes during the school year haha. 

It seems like LS7A is offered in 3 or 6 week format, PHYS 5A is offered in only 6 week format, PSYCH 10 is 6 weeks.

I'm curious to hear from anybody who has taken any of these classes during this year online! Would love any input on how manageable it would be to take them in a shortened amount of time?

"Do you or someone you know feel depressed, anxious, or stressed? (UCLA Treatment Study)","Do you or does someone you know feel sad, down, or stressed most of the time, or experience low mood or loss of interest? The Anxiety and Depression Research Center at UCLA invites you to participate in an ongoing psychological treatment study in collaboration with SMU to reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression. If you are eligible, you would receive free-of-cost, individual treatment, and diagnostic assessment. All therapy sessions will be conducted remotely via Zoom. You will be asked to come to the UCLA campus at four different time points. We will assess your behavior and physiological responses like heart rate and breathing, while you are asked to attempt several computer tasks. 

The laboratory sessions are on two different days: the first day lasts 3 hours and the second day lasts 2 hours. 

Parking will be reimbursed upon request. Additionally, you will be compensated $75 after the completion of the in-person assessments and a chance to win up to $70 from the computer tasks! 

The evidence-based treatment does NOT include a placebo or drug condition.

Things get complicated because I now have the potential opportunity to move to the Bay, instead of LA. My partner is starting a 5-year program, and I'd like to move with them. Not really wanting to be in LA alone/broke at this point if for only year 2/2 of my program, especially if I'm just going to move again right after. My job also allows remote to stay post-pandemic.

One treatment focuses on methods to enhance the learning that occurs during exposure therapy, while the other emphasizes reducing fear during exposure therapy. Each of these therapies includes components and therapeutic strategies that have been demonstrated to be effective. 

Payment and Fees 

Participants will be offered 9 weeks of free treatment and a $25 E-Gift Card at the end of the study! 

Treatment Procedures

Treatment is conducted one on one, over 9 weekly sessions via Zoom. 

Remote assessments are conducted prior to beginning treatment, mid-treatment, at the completion of treatment, and 3 months later. These assessments include diagnostic evaluations and a battery of self-report questionnaires.

Writing 1 requirement,Hi! I‚Äôm a freshman and I haven‚Äôt satisfied my writing 1 requirement but my writing 2 requirement is satisfied through transfer credit.

BRUIN TRADITION KEEPER SENIORS AND TRANSFERS OF 2021 OPINIONS WANTED," 

Hey guys, I'm part of the student media group Bruin Life, and for all you seniors and 2021 transfers out there who'd love to rant or voice their opinion are more then welcome to share their opinion in this thread.

I'm writing about the Tradition Keeper Challenge, and if you don't know what that is, its a challenge where you finish 30 traditions as a transfer or 50 as a 4 year student and you get a cool medal. These things have obviously changed, and I just want to know what that journey could have looked like for you now that we have spent a year in the pandemic. 

Bottom line, I'm asking you guys what does being a Bruin look like? And could this challenge be the ""college experience"" we've been missing?",1612741551,1,0

Advice on Applying to DevX (Backend Developer),"Hi Bruins! I was wondering, does anyone have any advice of how to prepare to apply to DevX as a backend developer? What are some things I should try to accomplish to become competitive to join a team?

Also, I am an untraditional applicant (non-CS/technical major) but have recently decided that I want to pivot into SWE cause of the rapidly changing job market/Covid-19. I am graduating December 2021, with limited programming experience, but am looking to accelerate my skill acquisition in any way possible to potentially recruit for DevX Spring 2021 or Fall 2021 as a backend developer. As context of where I am in my pivot, I'm currently taking CS 31, planning to take CS 32/35L next quarter, 180/33 over the summer, and 111 in the fall. 

I know that I should work on projects in different languages to build my portfolio (which I was planning on navigating with Coursera), but beyond that, I am not sure what else I should be doing to become competitive. What are some recommendations you may have?

1) I'm pretty good at Chem and have been acing my chem classes so far, but I dread physics and really am having second thoughts about this stream because of future job prospects and how limited it is to chem and delves greatly into physics rather than chemistry in general. 

2) On the other hand, there is Econ, a subject I'm vaguely interested in after reading books and anyways plan on doing the entrepreneurship minor so it seems to have a good overlap with the same, but I've never taken an econ class so have start from 1/2; from what I've heard, they are horrible. 

3) I am taking a gap in spring to do an internship and I can't really do these long stretches of online uni so I was going to do Econ 1 and 2 over the summer but again I'm overthinking and having cold feet about this. If I do econ in the summer I'm also falling behind on chem if I do choose to stick around.

Currently having a pre-med panic attack and need reassurance/advice,"I‚Äôm quite literally losing sleep over this and I just need to hear people‚Äôs thoughts on my thoughts.

The programs I‚Äôm in right now are great in my opinion, but I don‚Äôt feel like they really contribute to my pre-med resume if that makes any sense. I‚Äôve spent all my efforts trying to get into competitive programs to no real avail, and as a result I didn‚Äôt explore many other opportunities. 

There are a few theories I have for this, ranging from me being a first-gen student that went into a school like this not knowing how to navigate the pre-med environment to feeling too overwhelmed with classes to explore and put time into extracurriculars. I wish I could go back 3 years and be smarter about all this, but that‚Äôs just not possible. With me nearing my 3rd year, I only have so much time to get my shit together and have a chance at the career I want and I just don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs possible at this point.

Would you consider this being safe or potentially wasting my time?

Upper Divs for Statistics Major? Switching Major Advice? (Part rant),"Context: Current Freshman

As we all know the math department sucks. I'm currently taking the prereqs and I'm utterly miserable. I love statistics, but I hate calculus. Although I'm not sure how much you can separate the two. I'm wondering if the upper div stats classes are any better?

I'm not particularly bad at math. I used to love it. But now it just gives me so much anxiety and makes me depressed. I have to spend so much time every week to just get myself to do math work. It's even worse with some of my neurodivergencies.

Honestly, while I do enjoy stats, I think a major reason is because of my parents. To do stem and not humanities. Also, if there is one thing im sure of is that I'll find myself working in a creative field. I was thinking of switching my major to one of the linguistics majors as I really enjoy it and languages. But of course, as everyone fears, doing something that isn't stem bc ""you cant make money with it."" But to hell with that in this pandemic and economy. I've never believed in myself before. I want to try it for once. But i still have doubts. Should I take the leap and switch or should I just push through and get a stats degree? Of course, ultimately, I'm the one who has to make this decision, but I'd love to hear any words of advice.",1620223180,1,0

LOOKING FOR AN IRL SOCIAL JUSTICE WARRIOR GROUP ON CAMPUS -- SUGGESTIONS NEEDED,"420spook420 checking the fuck into the subreddit. how is everyone doing today? 

anyways, i am in absolute dire need of your help. a little backstory:

i am a ucla student who is absolutely sick and tired of the various toxic communities that i am currently involved in, this includes but is not limited to: the esports community, league of legends community, some portions of the anime community, a small group of ""tiktok influencers"" that me and my friends have created, and last but not least the pokemon go community. after much contemplation during the pandemic and online classes, i have decided to put an end to the negativity in order to meet my 2021 new years resolutions. i think its time for myself to reform, and i cannot realistically think that the next step is to become a social justice warrior incarnate. there is no need to thank me fellow bruins, i am aware it is a difficult role, following the footsteps of the ultimate-heroic SJWs such as Lebron James, the god hero that has bestowed the Los Angeles Lakers with a proper moral backbone. 
 
420spook420, what sort of toxicity do you face within these communities? i feel like you are a top contributor to them, how could you face such backlash?

thanks for asking. alas, i have faced much back handed compliments and microagressions such as ""how could you not possibly catch that pokemon? it must be because of your north campus major luck"". like what does that even mean? it triggers me to see my fellow peers to stoop down to these low levels, as it is emotionally violating and mentally taxing to take upon such comment on a daily basis.

i am thinking about joining ASUC. from the vibes that i get, they seem like the corrective action that some UCLA communities need. can anyone recommend any more clubs worth checking out so that i can carry out this next chapter in my life. thanks.",1620175382,1,0

UCLA candidates are flawed,"Look I‚Äôm new to the UCLA election cycle but one thing I noticed is that so many of the candidates have no actual tangible policy proposals. People‚Äôs introductions are filled with what backgrounds they come from which is fine and dandy but if your running for public office I expect you to be cognizant of all backgrounds to begin with. To me that‚Äôs just a meaningless appeal to popular trends. Only a few candidates actually had real proposals like fighting landlords or expanding the Bruin bus systems. Even social issues which seems like is all that‚Äôs  talked about, still lack of real ideas for change. If you wanna talk about social issues without turning people off you need to know why this is a legitimate issue first then explain why it‚Äôs occurring and third what you will do about it. All I see is people listing off their ‚ÄúBIPOC‚Äù status without giving any deeper thought as to what they will do for UCLA students. The Only clear social justice proposal I saw was training UCPD to handle situations appropriately other than that it‚Äôs only been platitudes and buzzwords. I‚Äôm far left by any standard I‚Äôm just worried we are falling into the same essentialist behaviors prevalent on the right. If you wanna talk about social issues don‚Äôt limit your platform to your identity and buzzwords like ‚Äúunderrepresented communities‚Äù without taking the time to think of real ideas to change that. Also economic and social issues work hand in hand, hate seeing people leaving one out in order to emphasize the other.

I developed a mental health related app to be mindful of your actions!,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn‚Äôt know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.

Are UC's actually bad for pre-med?,"Im trying to decide between transferring to UCLA (chem) in the fall or Emory (neuroscience). I have so many pro's to Emory but mostly cons for UCLA apart from brand name and ranking, dining, location. UC's dont have money, class sizes are rlly big, hard to form relationships with profs, they're more interested in their research than teaching?, have to be more of a go-getter and persist for opportunities...

Manifest: Local Networking Web Application For UC System,"# Manifest: Local Networking Web Application For UC System

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRW-w\_UIjYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRW-w_UIjYk)

The best way I can explain this app is with a Spongebob metaphor. In this episode, the krusty krab is the university/college system of clubs, resource centers, etc. and the bulletin board is the Manifest app. Manifest brings a bulletin board abstraction of messaging to the abstraction of the Krusty Krab, which is actually the entire university system of clubs, resource centers, and institutional orgs (thus currently working with UCSC Resource Centers and the rest of the UC system for this pitch).

We may hope to see Manifest as the community bulletin board machine of great good, so long as it is free from unlawful censorship and has community standards that facilitate amazing and inspiring interactions.

Here is a more formal pitch for a web app I'm working on called Manifest to connect clubs on campus within UCSC (my school) and the rest of the UC system (including UCLA):

* What is the Manifest app? Messaging for local communities.
* What is the problem it solves? Sharing information between locals quickly and efficiently.
* So what, who cares? It may help to streamline events, activities, and more in real-time within the local area. There are so many steps to joining a club, promoting events, and emailing groups‚ÄîManifest was created to unify these activities in a local platform.
* Demo link: [https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)

Here are the instructions to install the app on any smartphone home screen by going to the demo URL ([https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)):

1. Have location services enabled via Privacy &gt; Location Services (on) &gt; Safari Websites (Ask or Allow)
2. Have location services enabled via General Settings &gt; Safari &gt; Location &gt; Ask/Allow, you can add the app to your home screen via the Safari app on iPhone.
3. Once added to the home screen, it should work as a native iPhone app.
4. After location is enabled, here are similar Android instructions to add on home screen: [https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en)
5. Note: to enable location on Android, it is required that Google Chrome settings allow for the location to load, and this must be adjusted via Chrome or the default browser.

The url to access the site and add to home screen is: [https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)

The main bet behind Manifest is the idea that locals can share contextual information more quickly and efficiently than anywhere else on the web.

"Computational and System Bio, Tech Industry, Premed","I'm thinking about trying to switch into the CaSB major because I want to take a major that is more math heavy and gives me some contact with the tech industry while still being in the realm of typical premed majors. I'm just overall tired of obsessing over my grades and looking yrs into the future at medical school. So I would like to have some background in a more technical field in case I decide not to pursue medicine. If I end up with just a bachelors degree I want to have access to a more lucrative field. 

I'm wondering if the major prepares you enough to break into the tech industry if you decide to go that route. Does it prepare you enough in coding to be able to compete for the type of jobs that CS majors are looking for after graduation? Or is it more like a watered down version of CS? 

I'm also curious about what it's like to be a CaSB major and premed. Is it doable? I know the major culminates in a thesis and I'm wondering if that takes time away from premed activities. 

Overall, what kind of careers are ppl expecting with this major? And are ppl doing anything specific outside of the major in order to accomplish that?",1621275687,1,0

Math 182 summer difficulty for stat background,"I am from a grad biostat background and graduated few years ago from UCLA undergrad in a different field. Trying to satisfy prereqs for grad DS and bioinformatics fields. 

I have the stat background but they often require a DS&amp;A course and was wondering how difficult is Math 182? The highest math I have taken at UCLA is 115A, and otherwise MS level math stat. CS wise I have only done 31 a long time ago and forgot C++, but I know Python. 

I have never taken discrete math and it seems like 182 is quite different from the usual stat/lin alg/mv calc stuff. 

Are there other classes that might be better to satisfy the Data Structures &amp; Algorithms requirement? Seems like 182 is very theoretically challenging and might not even have actual programming. But its not clear what programs even mean by a Data Structure and Algorithm class‚Äîlike whether its something like CS 32 or CS 180/Math 182.",1621208776,1,0

Help getting registered as a Visiting Student,"Hi Everyone, so I'm a junior undergrad in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at BITS Pilani University, India. My university allows to do Bachelor's Thesis (something like a final year bachelor's project, but executed like a Thesis) at other universities as well for different and possibly better exposure. Therefore here I am, at UCLA! I've Thesis (from June to Dec'21) under a Professor from Samueli Electrical and Computer Engineering (my project focuses on Analog Circuit Design) 

The Thesis, due to COVID restrictions is going to be a remote arrangement :( (atleast for initial stage) and I need access to Design Files and Lab stuff which will only be possible if I am affiliated to the university due to licensing issues from semiconductor foundries. Prof told me that the way out is to get registered as a visiting student and that way there would be absolutely no issues in accessing lab and sharing design files.

Not feeling safe in Westwood anymore :/,"During covid, I started taking walks every night around campus or through the residential neighborhoods across Gayley. I spent hours walking around every night and it was one of the only things that kept me sane; I never saw another soul, it was peaceful and quiet and one of the only stress-free parts of my day. In Fall I moved off campus into an apartment, but since there weren‚Äôt really any parties or anything, I still rarely saw people between 11 and 4am. 

Cue a few weeks ago when more people were vaccinated and parties became more frequent. Every week there are more people in the streets, and at first I was excited for the college atmosphere, but pretty soon I realized how much it sucks having masses of drunk idiots in the streets with nothing else to do. 

For some reason, drunk dudes just can‚Äôt resist harassing me when I walk by. I can‚Äôt make it the 3 blocks to campus or across veteran without some idiot yelling at me or trying to get my attention or something, and when I don‚Äôt respond to them they get agitated and sometimes their friends join in. Idk what the deal is, it‚Äôs like they see a small dude walking alone and they can‚Äôt resist messing with me. One dude started yelling at me, walked into the middle of the street, whipped his dick out and started pissing in my direction.

It‚Äôs probably unwise to be out alone at night anyways but during covid it was never an issue, I carry a stun gun regardless. Sometimes I even walked to Ralph‚Äôs at night by myself and the homeless people gave me less trouble than these drunk students. I‚Äôm just annoyed that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable leaving my apartment cause these idiots can‚Äôt behave.",1621154976,1,0

2. How much writing do you do (by this I mean major essays or research papers, not written homework assignments graded mostly for completion)?
3. Any advice/general thoughts? Do you enjoy it or regret choosing it?

I also want to add that I‚Äôm planning to pursue a Masters in Public Health after graduation before ultimately working in healthcare, in case that affects any responses related to career prospects :)

I was the one who provided the exam to the student currently in the class, and I had previously received an A in the class a few quarters ago. I know, I'm stupid.

What's the worst that can happen to me here? Can/will the professor change my grade to an F? Could I be suspended (or worse) from the university? Just trying to figure out what can happen here so I can prepare and notify grad schools I've been admitted to etc.

Thanks!",1616981139,1,0

Math of Comp + Stats double major or minor doable?,"Hello smart people,

I was just admitted as a Math of Comp pre-major, and I've been trying to research as much as I can about the major and its alignment with my interest, which is statistics/data science/math (vague for now).

Coming from a not-so-wealthy family, my main concern lies on the job prospect after my four years in UCLA. 

Looking at the course requirements for math of comp, I noticed that it requires a lot of upper-div math courses and very packed. 

Does anyone know who has done math of comp + stats double major/minor? how was their course load? Did they have enough time to continue with their side projects that are preferred for the employers?

Also, I certainly see a lot of variants of major majors at UCLA: Applied math, math of comp, data theory etc. 

Some possible paths I was thinking were math of comp + stats, data theory, transfer to CS (if possible).

Does anyone recommend math of comp + stats over data theory or vice versa?

Thank you so much for your time reading my concerns, and have a great day!",1616966420,1,0

"UCD, UCB, or UCLA??? Current admit to all 3 and conflicted in choosing because they all look like they'd be great to go to.","Hi, I got admitted to UCB, but my dream school for a while was UCD (which I also got into). I also got into UCLA which has made choosing a university very hard for me now. I plan to take psychology and from what I hear, both UCD and UCB have good psychology programs. 

But I'm still conflicted. I want an academically challenging school life but not too much that I can't have a little fun. I do have depression so that is why I am wary of UCB. But I feel turning down UCB would be a mistake because of the many connections and opportunities it brings. I'm not sure how I even got into UCB and UCLA, I'm not insanely smart (As, Bs, one C and 3.85 unweighted GPA). 

Any advice would be so so helpful. Sorry if this was long.   

**TLDR: Should I choose Cal (might struggle academically/mentally but good connections &amp; presitge) OR should I choose Davis (less prestige &amp; may not look AS good on resume but I would be average/above-average academically and mentally okay)???**",1616933319,1,0
How can I get more involved at UCLA as a late freshman during the pandemic?,"I'm currently a freshman at UCLA and I've basically done nothing all year because classes are online. I really wanted to go in person, find an apartment or something, but my parents refused because they said there was no point when classes are online.

I've been really angry and upset that I've basically lost my entire freshman year. And I don't know how to deal with that except by avoiding it, which is what I've done all year. I've stuck with my friends from high school who are still here, and tried to pretend like I wasn't losing and wasting my entire freshman year. 

So I haven't really made any friends from UCLA. And I know it's partially just really difficult to make friends with COVID, but also, I could've done more. Tried harder. I'm extroverted, but also shy, which in my opinion is the worst combination for right now because I flourish with social support, but struggle to find it when we're not in person.

Anyway, so I'm wondering if anyone can give me ideas on how to get more involved and make friends? I'm an anxious person and get overwhelmed easily. I'm also going through a lot mentally right now, with some other personal issues that aren't relevant but are affecting me (luckily I just started therapy, so hopefully that helps). But so, it's just really difficult for me to get started when I have no clue where to look, and this school is so big. There's so many options, I have no clue where my place is or what the best places are.

If it helps, I'll give some info on myself: I'm currently undeclared. Thinking of transferring into engineering, but also it seems really difficult and stressful. Otherwise considering Public Affairs or English... I'm interested in creative writing, particularly as an author or TV script writer, though those jobs are obviously dream jobs. I've joined FPS, but am not too involved yet. I need to start going to meetings!

I did robotics in high school for my last two years and absolutely loved it, but I loved it mainly for the hands on aspect, feeling useful, feeling part of a team, rather than engineering specifically (though I do enjoy hardware and STEM subjects and math in general). I loved being part of a team and a community of friends. The people I still talk to from high school are all from my robotics team.

I also did theater, for all four years in HS. I really miss theater and originally wanted to minor in it, but admittedly I'm not very good at singing or dancing, though I really really enjoy both. I was looking forward to joining beginner a capella and dance teams at UCLA; both of those are obviously difficult to get involved in during the pandemic :( 

I do also really like acting and am better at that! I also did ComedySportz and really enjoyed it. I tried out for an improv team at UCLA in the fall actually, and it seemed super fun, but I didn't make the cut :( And finally I also did ModelUN, which I didn't get too involved in, but seemed fun.

So would anyone be able to provide me recommendations for clubs I can join, or activities I can do, or just ways to make friends that aren't too painful? Even just some helpful words about how to get over the pain of losing my freshman year would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",1616928377,1,0

"Deciding between UCLA, Georgia Tech, and other schools for engineering","Hello Bruins!

I'm super excited to have been accepted into UCLA! In fact, I have this sub in part to thank for it because some of you [helped me out](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/iqwzlz/apply_sse_or_ls/) while I was applying. Thank you for that!

Now, the time has come to decide where I want to spend the next four years. I'm an in-state student (from the Bay Area) who will almost certainly be paying full price, and I'm still getting an idea of what I want to study. At the moment I'm leaning towards aerospace engineering, while taking other courses in areas such as computer science, business, and geography, though I would not be surprised if my interests change through college. I'll be coming in with 1-2 semesters of credit, though I want to utilize that space to take a wider variety of interesting/useful courses, instead of graduating early like many in my situation do (being able to learn about a wide variety of things is something I value a ton, and I feel like that's where new ideas and perspectives come from).

At the moment, I've gotten into (shown with the major I was accepted for): UCLA (College of Letters/Sciences), Georgia Tech (College of Engineering), UCSD (Electrical Engineering), Illinois (CS + Geography, College of Letters/Sciences), Cal Poly (Computer Science), Arizona State (Computer Science, full-tuition scholarship).

Of these options, I'm looking most strongly at UCLA and Georgia Tech (though I mentioned the others in case there are pros to them that I'm sleeping on). I'm feeling pretty stuck between those two top options, and I've identified pros and cons to each. It's a long list lol, since I've been thinking a lot about this, and it feels like such a big decision.

UCLA

* *Pro* \- In state costs ($145k)
* *Pro* \- The social scene seems great. So far, Bruins seem chill and easy to talk to, and I've been meeting cool people with very diverse interests. Everything I've heard suggests that in terms of socializing and student life, there don't tend to be too many great negatives at UCLA.
* *Con/Pro* \- I have heard that UCLA's engineering school, while nothing to laugh at, is a bit under-resourced, and tends to be pretty theoretical as far as teaching goes. However, I feel like that could leave me with a very unique opportunity to keep my math/science majors in L/S, gain engineering experience from the hands-on projects students do outside of class, and enjoy greater course flexibility in different areas. If any of you are math majors but are aiming to work down the road as engineers, please hmu, I've got a ton of questions about that.
* *Con* \- I got in for letters/sciences, instead of engineering (kinda wish I applied for SSE, but eh). I've heard transferring isn't impossible, but I'm still not sure how much of a hassle it is and what grades I'd have to get in which set of courses.

Georgia Tech

* *Pro* \- Behind MIT, it seems to possibly be the 2nd best engineering school in the country. For all the engineering majors I'm considering (everything from aerospace to environmental to electrical), the school ranks firmly in the top 5. I don't put too much stake in those rankings, but overall, everything I've heard seems to point to Georgia Tech being excellent in just about every engineering field. It seems that Tech students can generally obtain really interesting opportunities through pretty straightforward networking at school ‚Äì I was chatting with an student there who showed me that as a computer engineering student, he was even getting emails from Boeing to join them as an aerospace intern. I also really love the depth of hands-on maker-spaces, studios, and other facilities, that UCLA doesn't seem to offer as much of.
* *Pro* \- I'm a pretty big fan of Georgia Tech's location. Atlanta is a booming city, and Georgia Tech is located in a great part of town within walking/transit distance from tons of great spots (especially because I probably won't have finished learning how to drive until next year). I really really like how much of a new experience I could get, going to such a different part of the country.
* *Pro/Con* \- Georgia Tech does well in other areas I want to learn about, such as business/entrepreneurship and global development, and even their liberal arts school, while small, doesn't seem like a bad program if I want to take classes. However, outside of its engineering school (which has fantastic depth and breadth) it doesn't have as much of the huge diversity of other course offerings [UCLA does](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1fudmo/have_you_taken_a_class_with_one_of_uclas_famous/).
* *Con* \- Out of state costs ($210k). This is still (thankfully and luckily) relatively comfortable for my family (they've been able to save pretty well for this), and they don't want me to make the choice just off of the cost difference. However, it is definitely in the back of my mind, since I respect the work my parents have put in to earn what they have, and don't want to ask for more unless I think there's a good reason.
* *Con* \- I'm a little scared that not being from Georgia and not having a ton of super nerdy interests (don't really play video games, watch anime, and such), it could be a little harder to find my crowd at Tech, compared to a school like UCLA with a much wider diversity of interests.

**Honestly, when weighing everything, it feels like a wash. I'm leaning slightly to Georgia Tech, but I have no idea which school I'll choose. I want to see what you guys could add to my thought process, so I can make the decision that I ultimately feel is right for me. Thanks so much.**",1616908882,1,0

"Going to be a freshman in college (co'25), want to transfer to here","Hi! I'm currently a senior in hs who got rejected for co'25. UCLA says they need at least 60 units prior to transferring (by the spring before you plan on beginning classes here). 

I looked at the ap credits they take, and currently I think I can get around more than 60 units with the classes I've taken. I'd get credit for: 

apah- 8

apcsa-8 

apcsp-8

ap4 - 8 

ap euro-8 

apush -8

calc 3? 

ap phys c, e, and m - 8

stats-4  

micro/macro - 8

My thoughts while visiting UCLA‚Äôs campus this afternoon üêªüéâ,"HI YALL, I visited UCLA‚Äôs campus this afternoon and here are my thoughts while walking and looking at the campus:

1. Why the hell are there so many squirrels? And why the actual hell are they so defensive? My family and I are walking by Royce hall and all of sudden, we see 2 squirrels standing on their hind legs and staring into our soul. We then experienced this a couple of times. Fuck those squirrels. 

2. HOLY )]%]*+[%#[# MOLY, from what I heard, ucla is the smallest campus of all the UC‚Äôs but Jesus, that is the most strenuous walk I‚Äôve ever had in my life (maybe I‚Äôm just out of shape?). That is a whole ass year‚Äôs worth of exercise. And the dorms are SO FAR AND IM PLANNING TO BE A SOUTH CAMPUS MAJOR. AHHH

3. The campus is so beautiful. Holy shit, please excuse my language, but it looked so vibrant and so much better than the pictures. The vibes are immaculate. It‚Äôs literally inexplicable how happy I felt, I know ucla isn‚Äôt 100% perfect, but just wow. 10/10 recommend.",1616889655,1,0
