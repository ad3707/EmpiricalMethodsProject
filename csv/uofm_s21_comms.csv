"&gt;re: sexual abuse within the department?

You mention Chen.  Are there new allegations or charges that his actions happened within the department?  You said you don't want to get into actual allegations but I think that is important to understand the sense of peril you feel for students.

I'm not splitting hairs here or suggesting that the department NOT react.  But our expectations for how a department should react to something that is a very real threat to student safety, as you cite, might be different than what we expect as a reaction to something that is highly upsetting, disruptive, and a threat to reputation and confidence.  

All these things are serious and need a response, but perhaps not the same one.  For example, if you have reason to believe you have other as-of-yet unidentified sexual predators likely to pursue students in the department, you might prioritize actions like changing about meeting and gatherings, moving advising appointments to common areas, increasing security presence, and making sure all the doors to private offices have windows (for just random examples, I'm not an expert but you get the picture).",1612372174,5,0

"&gt;it's hard to take DS jobs as an undergrad in general regardless of what you major in

I would agree with this assessment. As another commenter mentioned, the most helpful thing you can have is internship/other experience, but that can be difficult to get, since most internship opportunities are for graduate students.

&gt;majoring in CS and going into SWE seems like a better idea if you're trying to work straight after UG.

This is a good and more traditional route. However, if you really do want it, I don't think a DS major would hurt you in the job search. Many CS jobs don't ask for a ""CS"" degree. They want a related degree, which would include DS imo. I think two factors to think about here are 1) the difference in material covered for practical purposes so you can get the most out of your undergrad experience and 2) how grad schools might perceive the application if you're still keen on eventually applying to grad school. I know that sometimes less ""traditional"" majors get more attention in the application process. While DS might seem very traditional, I'm not sure how many colleges have specific DS majors. (I would imagine many more applicants would be CS majors.)

Consider talking to an EECS advisor about this. They should be able to help you out more at least where grad school is concerned.",1612365865,1,0

Here are my options:

* EECS minor elective: 100% taking EECS 485
* CogSci track requirement: Can either take CogSci 445 (I hear it's pretty easy) or EECS 492 (I've heard mixed reviews on the quality and difficulty)
* CogSci elective: Will either take EECS 498: (Special topics course- Conversational AI-Principles and Practice of Virtual Assistant AI), or I will take an easier class (SI elective).

I don't know anyone who has taken EECS 498, or that topic course specifically. I really want to take the course, but I don't know how the workload would be with possibly 2 other EECS courses (492 and 485).

My main questions are for those of you who have taken EECS 492 or that 498 topic course: What were your experiences with the course/what would be your recommendations?

If EECS 498 is a really good class, would it be too much to take it with 492 and 485? Should I take CogSci 445 instead of EECS 492, if I take EECS 498?

More thoughts to expand on that:

Everyone's cost/benefit analysis is going to be different.  For some, it would be worth assuming some reasonable amount of debt to attend.  But that's not true for everyone.

I think this is a great place, but you're not going to find it a great place if your foundational premise is that it's just not worth it.  A lot of people's college experience has some glitches--a bad class, an unfair professor, some weird bureaucratic thing that locks you out of that class you wanted, etc etc --you gotta be able to bounce back or shrug those things off, and I think that's a lot harder for someone who carries around a lot of questions about the value of what they are getting.

The quality difference between schools is sometimes exaggerated.  A smart person (that's you, right, you got admitted here) who chooses sensibly can have a good experience at a lot of campuses--not just the most selective/prestigious place they got admitted to!",1617054127,2,0

"You don't want to look at ""Best"" perse. You want to optimize your benefit to cost ratio. 

How to do this: 

1 tally all your potential debt. This should be lesser or equal to one year of salary. For example, if you wanted to go into engineering, 60-70k of debt for your 4 years isn't a death sentence. 

Conversely, if you did a major where your first year of salary was 40k. Then 60-70k of total debt is not wise. That's 1.5-1.75 debt/ to salary.   


2. What is your major? Some majors, while a better name school may make it easier to climb the ladder, a good school can still benefit you.

"So I've already gotten my first dose of Pfizer elsewhere and I've taken myself out of the Blue Queue (if your last paragraph was directed at me. If not, OP can decide what is best for them). 

What it boiled down to for me was that I was not confident that MM would vaccinate me before UM requires I come back to work on campus. Their website implied that they wouldn't get to me until August, but Schlissel keeps saying he wants staff back in ""spring"" (I'm using quotes because... aren't we in ""spring"" now? I'd love even a teeny ounce more of specificity from him!) The gap in those timelines left me very uncomfortable. I held out hope that during the March 12 COVID briefing we might get reassurance from someone in authority that the UM community would be prioritized so that we could achieve the goal of having a somewhat ""normal"" fall (plans currently rely heavily on faculty, staff, and GSIs being vaccinated), but I did not get that reassurance. I took matters into my own hands and was able to get dose one elsewhere. I would have loved to have gotten the vaccine from MM, but I also have to do what's best for me.

I can only speak from my experience, which is why I'm telling most people who ask about MM's vaccine clinic to not hold out hope for getting an invite and look elsewhere. Even if they're being truthful, their rollout has been disappointing (from both the patient and staff perspective) and I don't think there's much that will change my mind on that front :/",1617049324,1,0

"1. there is *so much* to do in ann arbor. it‚Äôs not a large city, it has a small town feel. but that doesn‚Äôt hold any weight to the amount of things around campus. campus is directly next to downtown (you literally just need to cross the street), so theres a ton of restraunts and bars at your disposal. there‚Äôs also a few gems, like pinball pete‚Äôs. there‚Äôs a ton of parks nearby, and there‚Äôs the huron river for tubing in the summer. there‚Äôs also an amtrak station that directly connects to chicago.

"I don't think that MM is being deliberately inefficient. I have a few acquaintances who are directly involved with organizing the logistics of their vaccination delivery, as well as tracking their progress, and they are indeed administering all the doses they are given per week that very week, and sending scheduling invitation in the manner they describe on the web. So, I buy their explanation.

I would reframe the take that ""they are two phases behind."" It's not like the county and the pharmacies have already successfully vaccinated everybody who belonged to previous phases outside of MM patient population either ‚Äî they just have no way of distinguishing between them once the eligibility is expanded. Since MM's is an invitation-based scheduling system, they are prioritizing sending scheduling invitations to people who qualified earlier and haven't already been vaccinated. (Note that the county is asking everybody 65+ who hasn't been vaccinated to call them directly rather than going through the online scheduler ‚Äî same idea.) I think it's appropriate, since MM has access to their patients' medical histories (by definition), and so can assess their comorbidities. I'd much rather have them doing this kind of assessment than the county health department or a store whose pharmacy I otherwise don't use ‚Äî especially since in just a week the latter will be giving shots to everybody, and not having to ask anything about your medical conditions. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people in the previously prioritized groups remain more vulnerable, and so if they have one more potential source of vaccines available to them than the rest of us, it's only fair.

Finally, based on various announcements in the media and by officials, it seems that the vast majority of additional doses procured in recent weeks were purchased (and are being distributed) by the federal government, not the states. So, it's plausible that MM, which gets its doses from the state, has not been able to significantly increase their availability. OTOH, the retail pharmacies get their allocation from the feds, and the expansion in their capacity can be directly linked to the massive push on that level to secure more doses. (I would even speculate that, in light of this push, the states don't see the point in dedicating extra funds to increasing their purchasing commitments, since the federal investment will cover everybody soon enough.)

To sum up, I think the right strategy is to get on the MM waiting list, since you don't need to do anything else afterwards to remain in line, and meantime, check pharmacy websites periodically to see if an appointment becomes available at a time and location that you can make. This way, you'll get vaccinated as soon as you can, and have a small but non-zero chance of getting vaccinated in the Big House, which may have sentimental value for some folks ‚Äî just remember that the sentimental value does not outweigh the benefits of getting vaccinated sooner, even if it happens in an ""uninteresting"" place. :-)",1617045680,1,0

"I second this! I work at EQ dining, and I waited a little bit to get a job. A lot of people underestimate the need to spend time transitioning your first semester. As for working for Dining, the pay starts off at $11/hr, and you can make an additional $2/hr working nights or weekends. There are opportunities to earn a $0.25 raise per semester. I'm not sure about other units, but you need to work at least three shifts a week at EQ with one weekend, one night shift, and one mid/morning shift. Night shifts are usually around 5.5 hours, and a mid/morning shift can range from 2 to 4 hours. Most people end up with around 11hr/week. Also, the weekend shifts alternate (A and B weekends), so you wouldn't work every weekend. If you end up becoming a coordinator or manager, you can earn $1-2 more dollars an hour. For example, I am a student manager, and when I was working a manager shift on a weeknight, I was earning around $15.75/hr because $11/hr base pay, $2/hr night shift premium, $2/hr manager pay, and $0.75/hr from semester raises. I also did onboarding and training at EQ so hmu if you have Dining questions, lol.

Take courses that are interesting to you; I felt like some ENTR stuff was interesting but didn't really want to take the minor's required courses so instead of wasting 4 months of my life on them, I just took the cool ones I wanted as a non-minor. Also, there are quite a few Ross classes that are technically open to non-Ross people, so check 'em out and see if you'd actually *need* to minor for the classes you want or if you can just pop into them. If there's a bunch that seem really ross-only, minor might be worth it for class access.

This change will obviously hurt some people, as all progressive motions do, it also sorely misses some points (like dual enrollment), as most progressive motions do, but it does help to mitigate inequity, as good progressive motions do. 

Also, if people's parents ""suck"" and refuse to help pay for expenses, that makes a student independent and they would have to reach out to the financial aid office for special circumstances, as far as I'm aware.

"To those upset about how hard they worked to get those credits: people who didn't have the option to take those credits worked just as hard as you. This is a difficult school to get into. You aren't better than those who weren't afforded the same opportunities as you. 

To those whose plans to graduate early might be messed up by this: those of us who rely on financial aid to graduate only get 10 semesters. Please let us graduate within that time frame. No one should have to worry about whether one of their last few semesters of aid will have to be used on filler courses while other people are coming in with enough credit to take those same upperlevel classes.

I'm a double major. I have a minor. Very little overlap between them. I'm now in a position where I have to take 18 credits my last three semesters because of all the filler I had to take.

If people are in a position where they don't get financial aid, then you'd be correct, but disadvantaged individuals that often couldn't afford / didn't have the option to take AP courses in high school now heavily rely on financial aid to get their degrees, and it's incredibly unfair to them to have to wait on classes that people who can still have 10 semesters of aid get into easy peas, perhaps using up their aid to take filler classes.

I come from a family of 5 on an annual income ok 30k, having only taken 2 AP classes and getting credit for 1. It was very stressful watching as all the classes I wanted every semester filled up, obsessively checking the course guide just to have to make up a filler schedule the night before registration and an entirely different one in my 8am class the next morning. And I was taking on average 17 credits a semester, with spring/summer courses. That's my experience, though. I'm sure my feelings would be different if I'd been fortunate enough to take more classes for credit in high school, however, and if I didn't have to rely on financial aid.

"There are some classes that underclassmen with AP/IB credit and underclassmen without AP/IB credit will want to register for. The underclassmen with the AP/IB credit will get more of a priority to sign up for those classes in the old system.

The main problems seem to be 
a. Paying for upper level tuition when you're not able to take upper level classes.
b. Not being able to graduate earlier.

Point a is the one that screws students over the most and has the easiest fix. The University should charge upper level tuition based on the number of classes taken after a student enrolls at UofM. However, I have no faith that the institution will be generous enough to do that.

Point b is kind of iffy to me. Many students without AP/IB credit have a much harder time graduating in 3 to 3.5 years compared to students with AP/IB credit. A student's high school classes plays an unnecessarily large role in how easy it is for a student to graduate early, which shows how students aren't coming into college at a level playing field.

"What are your other options?

I think Ross is on-par with many of the other top business schools/undergrad programs in terms of IB placement, (eg. Wharton, Harvard, Stern, etc.). There are a lot of solid alumni networks at bulge bracket (and also PE/VC) at Ross, and a lot of recruiting opportunities.

I would say that in general the top few dozen students get these opportunities each year, but I think that's still pretty good considering that 1) not everyone is interesting in IB and 2) the class size is only like 500-600 people.

When you say ""extremely competetive"" this is true for all top business schools, and often even worse at the Ivy League schools. For example, most of these business schools have grad curves designed to hurt students, and classses require a lot of active participation where you need to compete against your peers. They pretty much all have investing clubs with excellent alumni networks but have multiple rounds of interviews and are very difficult to get into.

Contrary to what the other person said though:

&gt; There are very few people who I‚Äôve met in the school who are laid back and not trying to outcompete everyone they come across. 

IMO this is false. Most people who are aiming for IB/finance will probably be like this. But the majority of people at Ross (&gt;50%) are nice/friendly and willing to help. Although they probably aren't laid back, they won't constantly be trying to outcompete people.

If you actually want to be working on the math/statistics of data/ML models most jobs will require a PhD (and sometimes only masters will suffice). In this case, I actually suggest you consider a math major, since the undergrad statistics major at Umich is not that strong. Also, a lot of statistics (and computer science/data science) PhD and masters programs look for solid experience with proof-based mathematics.

Next semester I'm planning on taking a similar courseload, actually (physics 360, 351, math 451), so hopefully it's not too bad!

Some clinicians work better for some people than others. If you find somebody you like, remember their name and you can ask for them if you're doing any routine care (since it sounds like you're using UHS as your primary care physician). You can also ask for them for same day appointments but with those it's kind of a beggars can't be choosers kind of deal.

Don't discount that state school based on prestige alone. I told myself going into undergrad that I was going to get my degree paid for and spend the money at someplace prestigious for my Master's.

Also, I found that there's an unimaginable piece of mind going through undergrad without the weight of 'I need to make sure I'm getting the most out of my student loans in this class.'

"First of all the upper level tuition thing sucks.  I get that.  But at the same time I am glad that they are taking steps toward addressing the inequalities in the registration system.  As a student who came in with no extra credits I spent most registration periods registering *days* behind people in my year.  I frequently had to adjust my schedule to fit the classes in that I needed, and even then I often only managed to get one of the last seats.  It wasn't until my final year here that I finally got the schedule I planned for thanks to spring classes that elevated my registration priority.  

To put this in perspective, I recently asked my boyfriend (who came in with a bunch of credits and graduated early) if he had these same issues and he looked confused.  For him, getting into a class had never been a problem (pre-med; I realize this varies by program).  Students from rich high schools don't have these issues apparently.  But I guess I shouldn't have been surprised.  After having to fight my high school administration to stop them from cutting advanced courses to save money I have grown used to rural students just accepting the short end of the stick. Why would college be any different?

Long story short, as other people have stated the problem with the new policy isn't registration.  That problem has been plaguing students from disadvantaged school districts for years and you're just beginning to understand the frustration.  The real problem is with the seats available in classes, and until that is solved there is always going to be a group of people that is unhappy.",1617990112,1,0

I'm not convinced the mask is related to why they called police, but it's certainly a plausible theory. It sounds like it could also be someone who was just legitimately paranoid about a man apparently standing around looking at a playground, or standing around apparently aimlessly a bit away from them.

UM Dorm with Meal Plan: $12,034 per year 

Purdue Dorm with Meal Plan: $10,030 per year 

Ann Arbor Apartment plus Groceries: $850 rent for 12 months (assume you can‚Äôt find someone to sublet in the summers) + $150 in monthly groceries for 9 months = $11,550 per year

"If I‚Äôm not wrong, said Coursera class is very applied. Reading the syllabus, it also seems to proceed slower than EECS 445 and 545 do. 

I don‚Äôt think you can compare this to an upper level CS class here. Sure, you may see the same algorithms being used, but one class‚Äôd likely tell you to implement a basic version of the algorithm, while the other has a decent amount of math homework in it on top of a programming assignment. One‚Äôd give you the general idea of how the algorithm works (and tbh I prefer StatQuest for this, they have great opening jingles), while the other may go into the weeds with matrix calculus. 

That‚Äôs not to say the Coursera class isn‚Äôt useful. I think it‚Äôs great for getting intuition, and would help you not miss the random forest for the trees. I do, however, think that taking either EECS 445 or 545 would still very challenging. Often people have a very surface-level understanding of ML algorithms. You can decide to stop there, or you can learn about how and why it all works. And often, learning how and (a bit of) why the algorithms you learn about in class work involves calculating gradients of log-likelihood functions, implementing convolutional layers from scratch with NumPy black magic, or showing that the primal and dual formulation of SVM are equivalent. (This is just the surface, there‚Äôs a lot more you won‚Äôt learn about in a first ML class). 

How much probability, statistics and linear algebra have you done, and do you have calc 3? If so, maybe Stanford‚Äôs CS229 ~may~ be somewhat accessible to you, and you could do that over the Coursera class. Lectures are available online, and so are the problem sets ‚Äî just google them. If you can deal with that, then you could consider going ahead and taking EECS 545. A good number (dare I say half?) of the problems in that class are taken from CS229 anyway (there‚Äôs a good reason for that, the current 545 professor used to be Andrew Ng‚Äôs PhD student and taught the class at Stanford), so you wouldn‚Äôt be doing the CS229 assignments for nothing. 

Full disclosure: I took neither of EECS 445 or the Coursera class, did 545 instead. I did, however, look up a 445 problem set, read a few 445 slides, watched a couple of Andrew Ng‚Äôs videos, and looked at the Coursera assignments to make sure I wasn‚Äôt talking out of my ass completely.",1617956288,1,0

I don't object to your use of disciplinary terminology in any sense. I do object to how in your responses you've shifted the goal posts about what you seem to be personally considering a public good (starting from your first reply as being just police and fire and immediate needs to other things like farm subsidies). More on this at the end of my response. 

I would add that you do consent to those tax rates and to being goverened by your local, state, and national leaders when you purchase property or move somewhere. Unless you are a ""sovereign citizen,"" I'm not sure what seems to be so controversial about it. In fact, you choosing not to do research on local, state, and federal tax laws before purchasing property or moving somewhere and then claiming you don't agree to those laws is like signing a contract you haven't read. Many of the arguments you are making seem very libertarian, so I'm a bit confused about why there seems to be confusion here. If you don't like the laws of this town or country, find another one or work within the democratic system to change the laws.

Lastly, to get back to my initial point, as you admit at the end of your recent reply that public schools are a public good that do not exclude individuals given the criteria you provide, and paying taxes for public schools was what started this whole discussion wherein you seemed to believe your money goinf to schools was/is theft, I think our conversation about whether or not it is reasonable or fair for property taxes to fund public schools (i.e. not theft) is finished.",1620244651,3,0

"Ann Arbor is a very desirable place to live due to great public schools, liberal mindset (compared to much of the midwest), and a lot of major employers in close proximity (UofM, Domino's, Duo, etc.), and safety to name a few.

That and an aging group of townie NIMBYs work tooth and nail to block all development. Thankfully the AA city council flipped majority in the last election and with Jeff Hayner on his way out hopefully there will be some more developments.

Another factor is that the median household income of UofM students is $154,000 (as of 2019) so while rent is outrageous there are a lot of affluent students who will pay whatever places charge for rent. So these luxury buildings can stay full and keep rent high",1620237191,40,0

"High demand: 30k+ students along with numerous researchers.

Low Supply: Townies don't want their property value going down so they restrict supply of affordable housing units. 

High Income students: A decent amount of UofM students come from high income households and can afford high prices. Some who don't take additional loans just to live with their friends even when they cannot afford it.

College Town: There are no alternatives. In a city like Chicago or LA you can move away 15-20 minutes from campus, have public transit to your university, and pay pennies compared to near campus housing. On the other hand there is no reliable transportation from 20+ minutes away from AA to take you to classes. We are a college town not a city and the prices reflect that

Location Premia: Students pay a premium to be walking distance from Ross or other Central Campus locations, driving prices on high rises even when their amenities and/or services are sh\*t.

Oligopoly: There are a few landlords with lots of property spread around AA. Helps restrict price competition",1620236802,334,0

"I think at this point general supply is just barely keeping pace with demand as it is, which might explain why housing prices are consistently increasing year over year even with new developments.

For instance, my old apartment‚Äôs rent dropped something like 5% this year due to Covid, while the rent on my current house went up 8%.

"They have group therapy workshops specifically for social anxiety at CAPS!

And especially for a case like mine where I wouldn‚Äôt be able to attend therapy outside the university, it‚Äôs more valuable than people give it credit for. Any help at all is better than none.

Here‚Äôs the link to that specific group for social anxiety ([CAPS - Conquering Social Anxiety](https://caps.umich.edu/content/conquering-social-anxiety)) which I think is holding workshops that focus on building practical ways to manage and decrease social anxiety.

"Hi! I'm so sorry you're going through this. I've had social anxiety my entire life (I was a mute kindergartner!) and I've only recently started to suspect it might be more a coping mechanism for neurodivergence (trying to get tested rn, but my psychiatrist is almost certain I at least had adhd).

It's definitely impacted my experience here at UMich. I feel like I wasted my first few years here and now that I actually wanted to do something about that,,, that chance was taken from me by Covid. (also, I definitely feel you when you say quarantine has made your SAD worse--I'm almost entirely defunct if there's just a regular amount of people at the grocery store and god help me if there's someone in my same aisle).

My freshman year I was fortunate enough to live in a suite on North campus and I made really good friends with my roommates. We still talk regularly today and they've helped me learn and grow a lot. I also studied abroad, which brought me further out of my shell.

My advice to you is to try CAPS. Though it didn't work for me and my best friend (we come from a poor area and have A LOT of problems including c-ptsd, SAD, depression, GAD, attachment disorders, etc. as well as likely neurodivergence so we need a lot more than CAPS can really offer), it could very well work for you! In my experience CAPS is like, for minor counseling instead of major rework in your life.

Second piece of advice, don't let the anxiety win. Your worst enemy is also your best friend here--exposure. The more we isolate the worse it gets (not much of a choice rn though) and the more we socialize the easier it gets. I was put on Buspar recently for my own anxiety and it's been helpful for this. Just don't be like me my freshman year and cocoon yourself in comfort. Try new things. Go out from time to time, assuming we'll be able to next year. Have game and movie nights with your cohabitors. But also don't be afraid of taking time to re-energize yourself and your social battery too!

"There really is no replacement for in person classes in college. I met so many friends just in my classes, and that simply cannot happen in a virtual environment. In engineering you will get your ass handed to you, but as many have said, in a normal semester you would be with your peers getting your asses handed to you together. Especially in such a collaborative field like engineering, face to face interaction is very important",1614877709,13,0

"I'd recommend joining a group in the [Wolverine Support Network](https://www.umichwsn.org/). I just joined a group for the first time this semester. You meet up once a week for one hour with other students at the university. They have a lot of time slots to accompany your schedule, and there isn't any pressure to attend regularly. There are 2-3 seniors who lead the group, and they maintain a safe and comfortable environment. I really like it because it is a very low-stakes time where you can just relax and talk about whatever you want.",1614877467,12,0
"Hey! I'm sorry you're not feeling well these days. I've struggled with anxiety for the past few years as well and know how debilitating it can be. This past summer i had the worst anxiety I've ever experienced (I would wake up and immediately start feeling chest pain/heart palpitations), and what helped me get through it was a combination of taking an antidepressant and meditation. I feel like there's a sort of stigma around taking meds for anxiety but it seriously helped me so much, and I also started using Headspace for meditation. Obviously different things work for different people and social anxiety is a bit different, but that is what worked for me :) If you wanna talk about anything PM me! Just know that things will get better, you got this!",1614877281,6,0

"No matter what if you are in a difficult major (like engineering) the ""college experience"" at a university like Michigan is going to be mostly related to work. That is to say that between classes, clubs, research, job search, etc. you will frequently be working the majority of the day and half of the night .

However, while you will be working quite hard, the friends you make during this time, whom you can both do work and hang out with are what really define your college experience. College is basically putting similarly intelligent people in close contact with each other to make connections for life, both professionally and personally. And unfortunately due to Covid it has been difficult this year to do so, so the majority of the ""college experience"" of this year has been quite a let down for all of us. Hopefully next year is better.",1614876756,27,0
"My favorite thing was when the city proposed to counter the NIMBYs was... we build a high rise or we do affordable housing. The NIMBYs had a field day. Ultimately the high rise won, but it was awesome to see the city stand up to these people and change will happen weather you like it or not.  More people will get out next year, and more change in I'll happen!",1614876602,5,0
"I've considered it, but finding a spot to park on the street is a crap shoot in the morning. Public parking structures would most likely have spots available most mornings, but then you run into the issue of cost; an orange permit is significantly more affordable, even when you consider a monthly Republic parking pass.

I just can't justify the extra expense after budgeting for ridiculous insurance rates and the weekly fill-up.",1614876555,1,0
"A lot of it has been said before, but I'll condense it to a few points that I believe are the main reasons:

1. NIMBYism is rampant.  It is so tough to build new housing units.
2. The University buys up so much property, and takes it out of the property tax pool, because it is tax exempt.  This results in the City having to levy much higher property taxes on everyone else to raise similar or higher levels of revenue.
3. A lot of the off-campus student housing is owned by a few large landlords.
4. Tenant protections in Ann Arbor are weak as fuck, for being such a tenant-heavy city.
5. It is hard to vote out NIMBYs  and pro-landlord reps
6. in the City Council if elections happen in the summer (when most students are away and won't vote).
7. Building new  on-campus student housing has not been a priority for the  University.

What's the result?  A lot of you apparently pay more for rent in a college town that you would in America's Second City, Chicago:  [2021 Compare Cities Housing: Ann Arbor, MI vs Chicago, IL (bestplaces.net)](https://www.bestplaces.net/compare-cities/ann_arbor_mi/chicago_il/housing)",1614876185,6,0

"As an engineering alum I can say that 90% of college is gonna really suck. However, that other 10% is really really great. You're right that most of what you do will be classes, it's just how getting a degree from a prestigious university works. I honestly really hated most of my classes, but misery loves company, and you form some incredible bonds with people through your collective suffering. Being all online means you don't really get to meet all the people that make college more bearable through. Hopefully that'll change soon. Best of luck with everything and remember to take breaks from studying, your mental health will thank you",1614875098,24,0
