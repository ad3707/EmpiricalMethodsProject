"Ah. Okay well it still depends on what you’ll be allowed to do, you can’t just take a quarter off. You’d have to get approved. And if going into Fall 2020 will be 5th year for you that takes approval too. I got approved for a 5th year because I had to take like 10 more courses, if you only have to take one more I’m sorry but I really can’t see them approving you for one more year. The counselor will probably ask if you’ve applied to every field study site and you haven’t. There’s people in my field study class that are at a placement site nowhere near what they want to do, they’re just there because it was the most convenient one.

Good luck but just remember it’s gonna take counselor approval for you to get a quarter off and to get to be a fifth year if that will be your case.

math 9 uses a decent amount of the computational techniques that you learn in 3a, but if you already know how to do matrix multiplication and are comfortable with row and column indexing you should be fine.

personally, I have found that math 13 ranges from easy to hard depending on the student and the professor (but I guess that’s the case for any class).

i think that you should definitely give math 13 a shot next quarter. you’re gonna learn pretty quickly if you enjoy that stuff or not. just remember that you ability to do math (I.e. your grade) does not determine whether or not you should be in the math major. as long as you enjoy it and have fun you’ll be well off!

"Ok how’s this for constructive criticism.

Do not organise an event if you’re incapable of doing so in an ORGANISED MANNER. This was my first time attempting to go to one of these events, but it seems they have a reputation for consistently letting students down. It not only makes the org look bad, but it’s an insult to the students and to person who decided to grace us with their time. Additionally, admit you messed up instead of just saying something as ridiculous as “the RSVP form was only to get an idea of how many people are planning on coming”. 

I’ve been to many events where an rsvp form is filled out prior to attendance, want to know what every single one has in common? An RSVP LIST. What is the point in asking for our names and saying “bring your ID” if they aren’t going to check jack shit. It’s pathetic organisation by what is seemingly a readily accepted joke of an organisation. Next time, charge money for tickets, and put that money into paying people to do things properly. I’m fairly sure anyone who’s a fan of Vsauce would gladly pay $5-$10 to see him, at 96 max capacity (which is also pathetic when you consider there are much larger rooms to host a YouTuber with 15.4 million subscribers) that would give you $480-$960 dollars to go into staff.

"If you want to talk about your skin color being a factor in whether or not you get assaulted, we can talk about that more in-depth another time. In short, black people and other people of color are disproportionately affected by police brutality and are wrongfully detained, stopped, and killed more often (per capita) than white people are. I know you're really grateful to be in the country, but it's important that you know you get extra privilege from being white that allows you to pass the eye test in the eyes of police. I'm glad you don't break the law and that you maintain peace. You have the wealth, skin, and income security to be able to do that, I'm sure. Unfortunately, that's not always the case here in the states. Due to centuries of racial discrimination against blacks, black families have been set back hundreds of years in terms of economic and political success. That's why you don't see many minority billionaires compared to white ones. In fact, you don't even see many black middle-class families relative to their population compared to their white counterparts. This is why protests are important. Obviously, that's not what this protest in particular is about, but they cover a similar topic, and the perpetrators of it are the same. Rich administrative workers like Howard Gillman and other UC chancellors make money out of their ass, never having to worry about housing, food, or job security. The grad students who work for their organization do not have the same luxury. Why is that? Corporate greed has led to such a deep divide in income inequality in the UC system that people who you might even consider fairly high up in the educational ladder cannot reliably sustain themselves in a job that they need to move up, leading to dropouts and loss of work that develops a cycle of poverty and no upward mobility. Who profits from this? Who experiences no change in success or income as a result of other people's suffering? The chancellor, white millionaires and billionaires who have never had to experience the struggles of debt, poverty, food and housing insecurity. They get to live in University Hills, where the chancellor hosts house parties twice a week with his valet drivers, catered foods, and servants. I hope you understand, it's not just about your skin color. It's about the other people who share your skin color who have been allowed to benefit from this American system of discrimination that works to continuously keep them down while lifting whites back up.",1582275494,1,0

"Ok I understand the fact that yes he is this big powerful dude who undertakes massive responsibilities, but the amount of money he gets is absurd especially considering the quality and success of students. I can honestly say, our tuition is not nearly worth the education we receive seeing as the quality of education hasn't improved with rising costs of receiving the education, it seems questionable exactly as to why the costs have gone up, except for greed. UCI has a number of big issues, with main issues being workers rights and compensation, parking, housing (yes I know Gillman aint responsible for housing, but lets be real to he probably has a share in the housing company or is a main stakeholder) and those are just things that are vividly apparent. For what our tuition pays, the education we receive does not seem worth it especially with a number of us having to take loans out which take upwards of 5-10 years of working in the industry to pay off. You say 500k is not a lot for someone who is the ""CEO"" of UCI but lets put it this way, we don't want UCI to be a business for Gillman, we as a university should never been seen as a BUSINESS because that devalues everything we students do. UCI is not a business venture for Gillman to exploit for returns, if that is the point of Gillman's job to make UCI a profitable business, then the necessity of a university level education is pointless. Our tuition should be lowered, our book fees should be ZERO, our parking should be free, everything that Gillman can give us if he simply undertakes a 10% salary decrease. People say 500k is not a lot, lets be real, Gillman probably makes more than a million a year at least, if not from UCI, from his share in the housing, rentals, and other businesses and properties near UCI. If Gillman truly cared for UCI, he would take a pay cut to help the university he ""cares"" about.",1582273689,1,0

We wanted to make you aware of an incident that occurred today in Aldrich Hall.

A woman arrived at the building’s entrance earlier this afternoon, identifying herself as an alumna on her way to the Office of the Registrar. At the time, Aldrich Hall was locked and only employees were being admitted. However, the woman forcibly entered the building. She was subsequently arrested for assaulting a police officer and was transported to Orange County Jail.

An investigation was opened immediately. Those with information are encouraged to contact the UCI Police Department at (949) 824-5223 or police@uci.edu.

The safety and security of our campus community is always our primary concern and we are working diligently to learn all the facts. Please feel free to share this information with members of the community who may have questions or concerns.

"Whether the government saved money isn’t my point at all. In fact that is a point you brought up so I don’t know where you’re still going with that argument. I never disagreed that Irvine saved money because of Irvine company. Doesn’t change the fact that IC fundamental goal is profit. Which is fine. I don’t fault them for trying to get money from students in this situation because like I explained IC is probably dealing with tenants not paying rent all over OC. They are in full damage control and losing 100% income from student housing is probably very bad. But that doesn’t mean it’s okay to take advantage of students and hassle them for fees associated with breaking a lease. It is the role of governments and institutions like UCI to reel in businesses from taking advantage of people during times like these. So yes, UCI has no excuse to not aggressively lobby on students behalves to IC. And if that does not work the local giver emend should provide guidance.

I agree with you, and I may not have read too much into, on ACCs handling of housing. But the fact remains that they did it. And also IC openly advertises their apartments exclusively to UCI students. I was doing apartment hunting in Irvine with IC and until I mentioned I was a UCI student not once did they offer me any housing options for students. So don’t act like any body is moving into UTC. Also the ACC apartments are cheaper for a reason. From what I’ve seen the quality of the housing is adequate for the price you pay.


As far as financial aid is concerned yes the school can, and does change fanatical aid amounts based on where you live. Did you not fill that out when you applied for financial aid whether you lived on or off campus? And using the argument that people wouldn’t pay it back isn’t sound either. Why? Because lying about financial aid and misused of it is illegal. You can’t make an argument against something because there’s a potential people will break the law to not follow it. If people are blowing aid money they are not entitled to them yes, they will have a problem.

Also I like how you included that homelessness is an option for housing during college. Are sure you don’t work for the Irvine Company? Because, respectfully, your argument is completely fallacious and has no backing. Please pay attention in your critical thinking and writing class.

Edit: You are intentionally framing this problem out of context by the way. This is about simply breaking a lease early. You have brought in many red herrings into this argument to try and distract from the fact the this problem is incredibly simple. Students were asked to go home, they shouldn’t be forced to pay for apartments they don’t need unless they choose to stay in Irvine. There are MANY reason why people can break leases early without penalty.",1586558307,2,0

"No I know IC is only in it for the money but you can’t deny that the government saved a lot of money when IC sold them the land for super cheap.

And that’s not true, a lot of students work PT and can file for unemployment benefits. Furthermore, those unemployment benefits aren’t significant and don’t equate to the income an individual was making beforehand. 

In terms of financial aid I agree with you if students aren’t using it for housing they should give it back but I doubt anyone will. The federal government is the one that decided aid wouldn’t be decreased if students chose to move back home, prob thinking about how some students are in legally binding agreements and can’t just drop their leases with private companies When people broke their lease with UCI or ACC their cost of living should’ve significantly decreased since most of those students chose to go back home but it didn’t. And furthermore ACC is hands in hand with UCI, that’s why housing is only for students and I think staff from what I’ve heard unlike IC housing which is open to anyone. We simply don’t know the extent of ACC’s agreements with UCI but I bet they get some money from the school or something, why else would rent be so much cheaper than the IC apartments? I don’t think ACC really had a choice in breaking the student leases. Furthermore, IC is still willing to rent out apartments right now unlike ACC which isn’t allowing any new students to move in until June. That doesn’t sound like ACC has full private control of the situation. 

You can’t just return an apartment and if housing was such a big requirement the school would have enough housing for all students. Keep in mind there’s homeless students too. No one required anyone to sign a lease or take out aid for housing but most of us chose to.",1586556611,1,0

"If you think IC is helping build a university only out of the goodness of its heart. And not to increase revenue streams and also increase it’s own property values around UCI then okay. 

But you’re creating a false equivalency between students and workers. The worker does not have those options you mentioned like students do. And workers are receiving significant unemployment and stimulus incentives to help them through this hardship. Students, in general, are still dependents of their parents and therefore should still have that safety net readily available to them. 

On you point about financial aid. Like I said I still live in here, and if people are receiving financial aid that is meant for housing in Irvine they should either use that to pay for housing or give it back. But saying that students should pay for housing on campus because there’s zoom classes isn’t a very good argument I think. 

Let me try and explain my argument using this example. When the bookstore sells you books for your classes there’s a return policy. If you don’t need the book anymore because the professor said so the bookstore can waive that policy and still return the book, no problem. This is a similar problem, albeit more expensive, in the that housing is a requirement for school, but the school now says you don’t need housing. Should the student still pay for something that is no longer needed for school? Based on the schools own actions with their own student housing the answer seems to be no.

Not like they made the decision to lose their job, and no one is suggesting their companies work with their leaseholders to allow them to cancel their lease.

Secondly I agree that student are adults and adults should be accountable to for decisions. But when students pay for this housing it is only because they need it for school. It is different than traditional residential housing. If I live in Irvine to work and choose not to pay rent. I still need to live in Irvine. But these students aren’t choosing not to live in Irvine. There is simply no reason for them to be here at the moment. In this unique event there is no need for the housing.

Like I said a lot of students can fall back on their financial aid it just sucks that their place will prob be empty during covid since they’ve gone back home. Other adults on the other hand should receive far more aid to help meet their monthly rents. If the students are getting headlined then so should all the other individuals who aren’t able to break their leases with no consequences. They don’t have anything to fall back on unfortunately.",1586546286,2,0

"I mean Irvine Company is probably dealing with people not paying rent in property (commercial and residential) all throughout OC. And this problem with student housing is simply not that big of a problem compared to that. I live in off campus apartment (not IC) so I haven’t kept up with any news surrounding the on campus/off campus housing situation. But it seems like UCI should be advocating for the students since they are so closely linked to the Irvine Company and do not provide adequate housing options themselves for students.

Students shouldn’t be having to deal with financials problems like this. Although it’s reasonable to expect payment if someone wants to break a lease early for an arbitrary reason. Which is why those clauses are in the lease. It’s not designed for an event like COVID. I’m sure Irvine Company will do just fine, and if anything will get more help from the government than us.",1586542766,1,0
"Yep, I did it a while ago and thought it was useful.",1586542384,1,0
"That’s easy to say and what about next year? Yes students can’t get evicted right now for not paying but when this is over they still can and this’ll affect whether they can get an apartment the coming school year, even on campus housing asks if a student has ever been evicted. I’m sure IC will file an eviction notice or at least put derogatory remarks on the individual’s credit history after all this is over if they choose not to pay. 

I’m a UCI student currently and what a lot of students have been doing is subleasing their IC apartments at a loss like let’s say their usual rent is 1100 for their room and they rent it out to someone else for 750. The other thing is a lot of students are upset that they can’t break the IC lease like on campus students were able to due to campus direction without consequences. Financial aid disbursements didn’t change. However, students that broke their on campus lease now have several thousand extra dollars to use when they’ve moved back home. That’s the biggest issue I think. A bunch of my friends have moved back home but the ones with off campus rooms are mainly leaving their rooms empty or subleasing and yes they’re losing out money but I think that’s expected they did sign a lease and this prepares them to be an adult. Probably millions of people in the US would prefer to break their lease cause they’ve lost a job and would like to move back in with family or a SO due to COVID but again they can’t without a fee just like my fellow students. I feel for my fellow students but I think off campus housing leases shouldn’t be allowed to be broken just because they’re students, this should be across the board in the US then for everyone in poor financial circumstances. A lot of students unlike adults have financial aid to fall back on to pay for their monthly rent.",1586542127,0,0

"&gt; **Status of the Special Recall Election**: Late in Winter Quarter, undergraduate students delivered to me the request to petition currently sitting Senators for recall. The [undergraduate students signed those petitions](https://petition.studentgov.uci.edu/) and achieved the necessary number of signatures to allow for a Special Recall Election. During Week 10 - through two Senators who were not petitioned for recall - I submitted [legislation](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/senate/legislation/print/?legislation_number=R55-54) to the Senate with a timeline, which would keep the Special Recall Election in line with the currently scheduled ASUCI Spring 2020 Elections during Week 3 of Spring Quarter for efficiency of the process. However, the Senate [did not pass the legislation](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/senate/minutes/print/?date=March%2012,%202020) and sent the legislation to the [Rules Committee](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/senate/senate-standing-committees/). Once Senate reconvened Spring Quarter this week, they [had not acted](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/senate/minutes/print/?date=March%2031,%202020) on the legislation as of Tuesday to begin the Special Recall Election. According to the [ASUCI Constitution](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/asuci_constitution_final.pdf), to which I am beholden, under Art. X Sec. 2 ""*Authority and Powers*"" Subsection (l) ""\[The Elections Commissioner has the power\] *to call, and set dates for, special elections, subject to approval by the Senate.*"" Based on the previous. the Senate must pass legislation approving the dates and times for when I call for a Special Recall Election. As stated, I was in agreement students and made the recommendation that the Special Recall Election should take place concurrent with the ASUCI Spring 2020 Elections, and that is what was proposed in the [legislation](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/senate/legislation/print/?legislation_number=R55-54). Until the Senate passes such legislation, I cannot begin the Special Recall Election and allow the undergraduate student body to vote on whether or not they would like to recall and replace those specific Senators. I am waiting for the Senate to allow the process to be completed, and once this is passed with a timeline, I will communicate the information for the Special Recall Election to the student body.

"Kinda! I would be exempt from some but not all. I took 10 AP classes and got 4 or 5 on all. If I hadn’t taken honors, I would be done with about half of GEs. On the other hand, honors takes care of all GE classes.

The math kinda evens out. Without honors, I would probably have to take like 10-12ish more classes to complete my GEs, even with all my AP credits. With honors, I have to go through 1 class each quarter for 3 years (=9 classes). You can learn more at UCI’s webreg page (once you are a student, there’s a super convenient student access tool).

The perk is that honors classes make it easier to get an A or a B, which helps GPA. Plus, it’s like a smaller community of people you take classes with for 3 years, so it’s easier for me to make friends compared to normal classes.

If you are still on the fence, I’d recommend going into honors because you can always leave but still get credit for the classes you take. Plus, priority registration and the councilors help A Lot.",1587624348,1,0

"I'm currently a senior in high school, so I've done tons of research about UCI and its nursing school, as well as other nursing schools. First of all, I think you'd really benefit if you post this question on r/chanceme If you've already done that then honestly I think that you should continue doing what you're doing in terms of EC. I agree with u/_StreetRules_ and believe you should still try your best to get your weighted up. If the UC's officially make the SAT/ACT optional, I definitely think you should still put it on your application, if it is a score that is exceptional. But frankly, you never really know with the UC system, so I suggest you just apply anyway, regardless of what anyone says about your chances. If you get rejected and you still make it a goal to attend UCI, then you can always go to community for a year or two, complete UCI nursing's prerequisites there, and reapply as an upper-level transfer student (junior)! UCI has an amazing nursing program, without a doubt, but I definitely think you should still open your heart to other nursing schools like Azusa Pacific University, CSUF, CSULB, UCLA, etc. I went through exactly what you're going through right now so if you have further questions that are far more personal to you, feel free to contact me @ [krystelconcepcion@gmail.com](mailto:krystelconcepcion@gmail.com) Good luck!",1587613937,1,0

It's a relatively easy switch because undeclared are allowed to take the four required classes that you need to switch without any school or major restrictions.

Fall: Econ 20A (microeconomics), Math 2A (Single Variable Calculus: Derivatives and Limits)

Winter: Econ 20B (macroeconomics), Math 2B (Single Variable Calculus: Integrals and Series)

You can take more credits in some GEs that you need, but you can't get a grade below a C in any of those four classes and you need a 2.50 average gpa which is between a C+ and B- average so don't overwork yourself.  A lot of people have a really hard time in Math 2B.

"I'm assuming you're an incoming freshman. If you can't change your major through your portal then there are prerequisites that you have to complete before being able to declare business economics: Math 2A, Math 2B, Econ 20A, and Econ 20B. Calculus ab or bc pretty much translates to Math 2A and Math 2B respectively, so to answer your question on "" do i take calc ab for one quarter then bc for the next or??"", yes you take two quarter of calculus. 

It is possible to change you major long as your GPA is above a 2.0 and you complete the prerequisites with no grade lower than a C. 

For advice, I recommend that you take Pluta for your Math 2B class, Econ 20a online with Branch, and Aggarwal for Econ 20B.  You can also google the school of social sciences website and get more information from there. Down below are basically just informational documents.

Weekly hw that takes about 3 hours, and no study guides so you really have to figure out what you're doing on your own. As for math 3D I have not taken it yet so I'm not sure, but I heard it is also a difficult class in general, so it's up to you really. I might suggest taking Math 13 however first in case the P/NP rule is extended through summer or even fall since it is such a hard class, P/NP is a nice option! Good luck",1589771436,1,0
Thanks for the tip! What quarter is cs122D being offered?,1589770764,1,0
"I'm taking 3A with Bob Pelayo. I'm really enjoying it! I took it with Peyam a while back and absolutely flopped, partially because I did not like his teaching style and partially because I simply was swamped with other things that quarter.

Bob includes visual examples in his teaching whereas Peyam kinda threw the visuals of Linear Algebra out the window, which left me really confused because I relied heavily on visuals to succeed in the Calc series. Bob is also accessible during office hours which is very nice because Linear Algebra is much more nuanced than it might initially seem. All in all, I am very satisfied with Pelayo for 3A, and it really shows in my grades.

I highly recommend that you watch 3blue1brown's ""Essence of Linear Algebra"" as a supplement to Math 3A, because it frames essential Linear Algebra topics in a very digestible manner.",1589770161,2,0

"1. Same as first comment. It depends on your year/major and if the class you want is a class that a lot of people take like chem or bio or some kind of GE. 

2. Im doing 3 years at UCI after transferring from a CC where I spent 2 years. 

This depends on your major also. If your major is more difficult and requires a lot of classes, you’ll most likely need to do 3 years when you transfer if you did 2 years at a CC. The people I’ve talked to that are doing 2 years after transferring typically did 3 years at a CC. But remember that anything is possible. 

Also, what I found out when I came here is that as a transfer you can only do three years here maximum. As a freshman you get five years maximum.",1589768110,1,0

"I mean ultimately speaking, ACC is different from other apartments in the sense that they house STUDENTS exclusively. ACC should have a greater compassion and attitude towards dealing with rent, sure they are an apartment company, but they are only success because their demand for housing will never die unless the school shuts down. In other cases, apartments are literally homes to families and friends, while for most people these apartments are literally just because of its convenience. Ultimately speaking, ACC knows that they can exploit students and HAVE exploited us, I mean considering they weren't going to let students out of their leases until UCI paid them off, they are sick mfs.",1589763596,2,0
"All the teacher's are knowledgeable about Electrical Engineering no doubt, it is just that they are not the greatest at being teachers. In addition, some of the professors, lack I'd say compassion and heart which is important for an engineer to have in order to be a good and ethical engineer as they don't seem to profess as a teacher of the subject. However this is more or less a problem with professors in all departments, I would just say that it matters a lot for Engineers because we need to have that compassionate side when we are in the field in order to be successful. Overall, there are a couple of really good professors in the EE department, 1 or 2 professors who are really bad and for the most part, the rest of the professors are pretty average leaning on the better side.",1589763345,1,0

"This is a problem that’s rampant across most engineering schools, not just UCI but even in schools that have much higher ranked engineering departments such as UCSD or UCLA. 

The chances of someone being competent enough to be able to lecture on engineering subjects and also be good at orally presenting materials are drastically low within the engineering industry, especially when you consider the majority of people who make up the engineering field. Along with that, you also have to consider the fact that most engineers who have the ability to do so would actually rather work for a private company which pays substantially higher than what most universities pay. Most of the professors here are here to focus on research, and teaching is sometimes the second priority for them.

Those statements mentioned plus the fact that engineering is considered a difficult subject is usually enough to push people to complain. From what I’ve seen and from what my ee friend has talked about, a good portion of the engineering faculty are great professors and are able to teach well. But there’s enough of the not-great professors to overshadow most of the talk about any of the good professors.",1589759670,3,0

I.e HP Lee 170B, Boyraz for 170A, Green for 170C, Smedly for 160A, etc. You can expect to see these professors, there is no avoiding them since they teach the upperdiv core classes.",1589759235,5,0

"imo............it's a\*\*........would not recommend.

but i know most people prefer that its online because they give us the data and we don't have to do anything physically. it sounds nice at first but they give you pics of data in such a way that you have no clue what to do with it and its very misleading because you usually have to do something with it or interpret it differently from what the lab manual says. and the TA's try not to help too much because they think we're too advantaged taking it online. lab manual is pretty useless even if you do the pre lab and read through the whole thing 3 times. id highly prefer taking it in person if possible, especially to actually learn the lab techniques if you care or are taking the mcat or any exam that lab technique knowledge is required. We get 1 day to turn it in which is nice but you'll spend hours and hours on it trying to figure out what to do, how to type math calculations, insert equations/weird symbols, format the report and data in a word doc, whereas in person everybody only gets 3 hrs, handwritten/graphed and you finish what you finish, nobody can spend more time on it than anybody else. originally it was stated that we were allowed to graph/write lab reports by hand like normal in person then they changed it to all electronic only. study up on your technology proficiency and have a high resolution computer because that is a significant portion of the battle (reading data zoomed at 500%, 5 different tabs open, trying to figure out how to do a log-log graph in excel with zero experience or guidance). 

yep and nobody has a single clue what is even going on or what the data we're using even means. just the fact that it takes endless hours to complete one e-lab makes it really not worth the fact that it's only a 1.5 unit class.

"Try swiping in only twice a day. I find that breakfast in a dining hall isn't really worth the swipe. So at night, sneak out a bagel and some fruit or whatever you think will sustain you for breakfast so you don't have to go in the morning. Also, breakfast is also probably the easiest/cheapest meal for you to buy ingredients/food items at trader joes if you really need to. Don't forget about any flexdine or zotbucks you might still have too.",1580550499,1,0

"side note though:
although it’s true that over 8000 died this season from the common flu, this occurrence has long been determined cyclical and was thus expected to a certain extent.
If this new cov is worse than the common flu, and if it ~so happens~ to make it’s way into the seasonal disease bank, then it would make sense that people would worry. But don’t worry, because probability is on your side",1580548595,1,0

"for reassurance: no one in the us died from sars.
even though this cov is more infectious than sars and has an incubation period of roughly twice as long, chances are by the end of this year, the deaths in the us will be (at most) only an insignificant dozen or less, consisting mostly of older and sicker people.
