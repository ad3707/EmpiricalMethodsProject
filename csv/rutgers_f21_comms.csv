"I graduated from New Brunswick in 2002.  You would not believe the flyers that were hanging up after 9/11.  The level of hatred and stupidity was shocking to me, considering it was all on campus.  It is amazing to me, however, how the media controls the public's perception.  Covid has not gone away, nor become less deadly.  Granted I am vaccinated, and in fairly good health, but we are not at a place where masks shouldn't be mandated.

"Well I guess a more apt word would’ve been just a fever or catching the flu instead of simply the common cold, but I didn’t expect someone to get triggered over something like that LOL. Not quite sure what you’re trying to say but I’m gonna assume that you believe having these various ailments are common and that I shouldn’t be bitching about it. However, if the dude not wearing a mask on the bus is coughing in my direction I’m not going to welcome his cough with open arms idk about you though. I prefer not falling sick over “it’s just part of school life deal with it.” Like cmon now we’re in college we should no better than to go out when we are sick.

Is this the first time you’ve been sick in your entire school career?  “No it’s not a cold my temperature is normal,” is implying a cold comes with a fever or at least an elevated temperature.  I didn’t think so.  Common cold, soar throat, stomach virus, strep throat, the flu, and bronchitis….

"I wish I could share updated information from this year directly from Rutgers... but like I said in a separate comment, Rutgers skews the data by mashing together demographics from all three campuses and presenting it as ""Rutgers"" which really means ""Rutgers New Brunswick.""

"I hear you. I was expecting invalidating comments like this, too (for the reasons you noted but also because Reddit is a cesspool full of racist, misogynistic assholes hiding behind anonymity). Also, Rutgers New Brunswick basically uses the multicultural diversity stats of Rutgers Newark for their skewed marketing campaigns. I had a shit ton of similar experiences throughout my undergraduate and graduate career at RU-NB (and yes, most of them would sound ""absurd"" and ""comedically made up"" to privileged white folks). Completely different experience working at Rutgers Newark. Didn't disappear (obviously) but I found that there were more students/faculty/staff/community members I engaged with at Rutgers Newark willing to have a dialogue and be accountable. 

Thank you for sharing your experience here. Despite the invalidating and condescending  comments, I'm sure there are folks lurking around that feel seen and less alone thanks to you. It is so wonderful that you felt empowered to report these concerns. Please also know that if you (or another BIPOC student reading this) chose not to report, that is also a valid response. I see others feeling the need to put a lot of pressure on you to ""change"" things through reporting. However, it's not *our* responsibility to do shit.

You can leave at any time if you find it's not for you. The schedule is pretty flexible, and the folks working there know it's not your dream job and aren't out to get you. As long as you do the bare minimum (stay productive and follow the script they give you), they can't write you up or fire you (and if they do, who cares?).

"I will never understand the logic behind people against masks and the vaccine. They aren’t 100% going to protect you from catching Covid, but it’s damn near 100% protection when you are vaccinated and practice social distancing. No chip or lethal dose of toxins are in the vaccine (how would a chip even fit through the needle, let alone be tracked once inside you? We don’t have some magic battery that is the size of a mitochondria to fit into some chip the size of a cell). Masks are meant to prevent the airborne transmission of Covid from our mouths and noses. Social distancing further helps prevent the transmission of the virus by keeping those who may have come in contact with Covid away from those who don’t have it. Just ask any general physician at your local urgent care. Why do people get so obsessed with the whole “Do your own research” thing when you have medical professionals who have the most up-to-date information about Covid-19? The extent to anti-vaxxers’ “research” are Facebook posts with no relevant or substantial evidence and obscure articles that have zero credibility. I just want the pandemic to end. I know Covid is here to stay and we’ll now have yearly shots available as we do for the flu.

"Hey dude, I was in a really similar situation with my roommate. I had to do a double take and check that you weren’t her ahaha. I know it can be agonizing because other people are best friends with their roommates and all of that jazz, but not everyone is like that. In fact, people usually recommend that you don’t room with a close friend because it usually doesn’t go the greatest after. I know it sucks to feel like this, but honestly, you’ve tried to have the conversation with her about this and nothing has changed. There’s no written rule book that says you HAVE to be friends with her. Let her act how she’s comfortable and however she wants. Once I started letting go of the connection I used to have with my roommate, it honestly made things easier on me. And I’m still learning to feel less awkward. This is a HUGE school. I’ve found people I talk to all the time, and others less so. When I let go of the idea that I absoluteLY HAD TO BE BEST FRIENDS with my roommate, I feel more at ease. I don’t need to impress her or convince her that I’m a good friend to have. And the same applies to you. You can’t force someone to want to be good friends with you. Let her go. If she wants to fix things later, and you’re down, then do it. But stop holding yourself back because you feel like she doesn’t want you around. Who gives a fuck? Unless she explicitly says something, it’s not your job to read between the lines. You’re both adults. I don’t think you’re overthinking the situation, because I don’t think I was either ( I also met her on Facebook 2020 and we talked every day constantly after that). Online vs in person can also be so different. Relationships change. People change. And that’s okay. You’ll find more friends and you’ll find that one or two close friends that’ll make you feel like you belong. But yeah, move on. Be cordial and all that, still be a good roommate. But you guys don’t have to be friend and I don’t think she really wants to be close anymore. And that’s on her. She made that decision, and you can’t do anything about that. Let people make their decisions for themselves, because you can’t will someone to stay in your life. Like if you had a romantic relationship… would you want to beg your SO to stay with you and love you if he was ghosting you for months and being weird? No. You’d wanna leave and get that shit over with. It’s the same here.",1638824164,4,0

"Senior advice! I’ve lived with roommates for a couple years now and the #1 thing I always tell myself if that “not everyone is going to like you or want to be your friend”. I was the same way as you freshman year wanted to be besties with my roomate and tried everything to be her friend but it never really worked out. Many people who work out as roommates don’t work out as friends there’s a misconception that you’ll be “besties” with them when it’s really never the case. What I would recommend is getting your own social group and stay on a roomate level. You can’t force a friendship and hey if you’re good roommates then just stay as roommates. All the best ☺️

Also I had no friends freshman year ☹️ but I found peace in being alone and found someone who I am BESTIES with! Now I’m pretty introverted but I do go out once in a while knowing who your people are can help you greatly but also don’t get down because people don’t include you as everyone does have their own lives",1638824098,15,0

"I did a random choice for my roommate and I emailed her to ask for her # so we can get to know each other. She emailed me back and we started texting but then she ghosted me lol. Of course, I was hurt because I’m a sophomore and didn’t have any Rutgers Friends. This was May so fast forward to August. We haven’t talked since so I moved in and after a few days she moves in as well. She talked to me like nothing happened and I thought we would become friends. Next day, she leaves without saying anything. Now, the only time we speak is saying “Hey” when coming back to the dorm. So, I started to think was there something wrong with me and why didn’t she want to be my friend but sometimes it just doesn’t work out. After awhile, you have to give up and just start worrying about yourself. Instead of putting effort into trying to be friends with your roommate. Try and find other people that you vibe with. You might be able to find someone that you are friends with and can room with for next year. I know it can be lonely especially seeing your roommate have friends so if you need someone to talk to or hang out with, pm me 😁",1638823752,5,0

College isn’t always what it’s hyped up to be... there’s an unrealistic and romantic notion that college is supposed to be the best 4 years of your life where your constantly surrounded by your friends and having fun. I guarantee you that even though it may seem like, from social media etc..., that some people are having that exact college experience, it’s not the case.

"Returning the favour from your kindness on my post. I actually dropped out of school for two years before coming to Rutgers. I was doing really bad mentally and, consequently, academically. Long story short, it was the best decision I ever made. 

I will say, shit got a lot worse before it got better. I worked a lot of jobs that were way too mentally taxing for my specific brand of fucked upedness, fell down a really bad depressive pit, gained a lot of weight, and had some pretty painful existential crises. But honestly, I wouldn’t have done it any other way, cause in doing what I couldn’t handle or enjoy, I realize what I could. I realized how much I missed working with my mind and learned to look at that work I love with a lot more humility. 

Now I’m back in school, I’m diligent about my school work because I love it because I know I wouldn’t want to be doing the alternative. I’m patient with myself cause I don’t have ego telling me I need to be the perfect best. And yeah, I’m still recovering from a lot of the spiral I went on in my time off (especially the weight), but I’m patient in that too because that time going through hell taught me a lot about how to cope, how to overcome, and how it’s better to embrace where you are in order to make steady progress towards improvement rather than rush to get there. The latter is not sustainable. 

All this to say, the TLDR, if you will, I highly recommend a leave of absence if you feel you need it. It may set you back a bit, sure, but there shouldn’t have to be a rush to the finish line, and anyone who says there is has not found a good set of priorities yet, y’know? Time away can teach so much, and if you are tired and need rest, I believe it’s best to take it. 

Life is too long to beat yourself down for other people’s expectations and too short to waste exhausted. I hope this helped somewhat, and whatever may happen, I hope things get better for you and life offers you some peace to balance out the bullshit. You’ve got this. It may take time, but so long as you’re still standing, there’s a chance to take on the things that are tough. Wishing you well 🙏🏽",1635697439,2,0

The only way I could see you negotiating it lower is if you were living in hazardous conditions or they were not repairing utilities you needed and requested to repair. If what I said doesn't apply, then you can try to convince the owners yourselves. Other than that, you're shit out of luck and just take the L for breaking contract.


Edit: Just to be clear, even if you weren't living there some contracts stipulate you most pay a certain amount of rent for month(s) in the case you leave before your contract expires and forfeit your deposit. If you signed off on anything like that youre fucked",1635696602,21,0

I 100% would recommend living at Rutgers rather than commuting. You’re already getting tuition for free , and what’s wrong with a loan here or there if you do dorm on campus?

I don't think it's a numbers game though. It's my first semester on campus and I've only made about two new friends. My goal by senior year is to have a few good, close friends. The type you still keep in touch with after you graduate and give a spare key to your apartment.

So, don't feel bad. I don't think it's a numbers game. Quality over quantity. And if you really don't have a good, close friend(s), now is the perfect time to make one. School of 30k+ students, I'm sure you can find someone.  Plus, you're in your senior year, surely you have some leads on a job, maybe your courseload isn't too bad, you have time to ask someone to hangout.

"There's a difference between IDE and Editor.

If you want to use an IDE, I don't see anything necessarily bad about using an IDE contrary to popular opinion.

For writing in C, I like to use CLion by JetBrains because I already use their IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm IDEs. They have a decent debugger, but CLion is a little buggy with some things. Either way, it's free for all college students. I love their products because it makes coding easier. 

That being said, always using an IDE is like using a calculator for basic calculations. Don't get too dependent on it. So, also get in the habit of being able to write code without code completion or an IDE; so get used to using an editor. 

A lot of people here have said VIM, and VIM is fine, but it has a pretty steep learning curve. It's easy to learn, but it takes a good amount of effort to learn. So, keep that in mind. 

Personally, I don't like to use VSCode. I prefer Sublime Text a little more. I was able to get it setup fairly easily on the Rutgers iLab machines for when I go to the Hill Center in person. That's what I prefer. Everyone is different.

I'd say, have an IDE you like to use. Whether it's CLion, or Eclipse, or something else.
Have an editor you like to use, whether it's VSCode, Sublime Text, or Atom.

And for all CS majors, I think learning VIM is a must. Seriously, when SSHing, when needing to take a quick note or writing a quick script or doing a quick edit, VIM is a very powerful tool. Nearly every Unix system has it and it's just a really nice tool to have. Every job requires a different tooll.

I like to use VIM when SSHing, Sublime Text on quick little projects, and CLion on big projects. So, I'd say get familiar with an IDE, editor, and VIM (or Emacs, but I've never used it, so I can't really comment on it).",1636742072,1,0

"so i’ve taken intro to hispanic lit and im taking intro to the study of language now. i think i’d only recommend it if you like reading. it requires a good portion of your time especially if you’re a bit slow with reading in spanish (like me 😭). But exam/assessment wise, I thought the class wasn’t too bad since they usually asked about things we went over in lecture, just make sure to take good notes during class and you should be fine. The stories themselves were really interesting too, there was a mix of modern lit and more “classic” lit, and we read poems, plays, and narrative stories.

Intro to the Study of Language is also an interesting class! It’s pretty laidback. And on top of that it’s really interesting learning about the different dialects of spanish and language acquisition.

"I'm not really sure what your strengths and weaknesses are.

If you have prior experience in coding, then Intro to CS is a joke. It's a really easy class if you already know how to code. Try doing a practice AP Comp Sci A exam. If you do well on it, that class will be easy.

Calc II was as hard class for me. Don't fall behind on that. If you're good at math and haven't found 151 too difficult, then you'll be okay. If math is something you know you struggle with, keep it in mind and maybe prepare a little over winter break. If not, then just do your homework aid understand every single question.

Analytical Physics was something I found hard. I think it had to do with my professor who would just read through slides with this complicated math on it and be like, ""So obviously, this would be the answer.""
It was really hard and I spent so much time doing their homework, it was horrible. That class took up a lot of my time.

Intro to Computers is Matlab. I'm not an engineering major, but everyone raves about how hard that class is. I've played around with Matlab myself and it's a nightmare.

So, yeah, take this for what you will. It'll be hard, but not impossible. If you haven't coded, learn some Java over break PM me and I'll give you some resources. Even if you have, go on the Introcs website, and do all the assignments. They change it a little each semester, but fundamentally it's all the same.

I'd maybe get rid of that English class to make things easier on yourself. Maybe take it later or over the summer. Your plate is already kinda full. It depends on what your skills are and how good you are at things like math, physics, and coding. If you struggle with at least one of those things, I'd recommend getting rid of one non important class...",1636735566,4,0

This is something that's more up to professors than anything. I have some this semester that do run zoom while in person lecture happens, and it's certainly something you can suggest to them.

It's nice to have options. That's all I'm saying. I left a couple of years ago to return home to take care of a family member, but was able to complete two A.S. degrees (one in CS and another in EE) and finished with a 3.7.

"Take this all with a grain of salt, but I would say as a first year, maybe not. Unless you're Mark Zuckerberg or something, I believe most freshmans do not typically get many opportunities because they lack a lot of knowledge before internships (plus some companies straight up don't hire 1st years).

For New Brunswick, you'll take Data Structures in your 2nd semester (assuming you never got credit for AP CS)  which is your bread and butter when it comes to interview questions. Usually after that is when you can start applying for stuff. I'm just bringing this up because your first year you probably won't be looking for internships until 2nd year hits. If you're learning in Newark though, at least as a first year, I'd suggest dabble in the more ""computer science"" aspects of, well, computer science, because you mainly learn programming like i mentioned in my thesis post above.

As for opportunities and stuff to do, that varies from person to person. I never was on Newark's campus because COVID hit and everything was online, but on the tour (back in HS) I thought it was quite a nice place. A friend of mine can also attest to that but he doesn't stay on campus long outside of classes. 

NB's campuses are quite nice too. Each of them has it's own charms and make for great hanging out spots, but your 90 minutes does make scheduling for stuff a bit rough. In my opinion, for your physical and mental life, the trip probably isn't worth it. Midway through semesters you'll definitely feel burned out and that could lead to disaster potentially. But ultimately it's your choice. It's a bit unfortunate your hometown is far from NB, but talk to a lot of people about it and ask for their opinion.",1640926756,1,0

The TA makes a big difference too. Pretty much learned all of the stuff I needed from the TA,1640925439,1,0
"I guess I might be able to answer this since I was in Newark for one year and NB for a semester.

From what I’ve seen or remember, Newarks curriculum varies more by professor. I had the same professor twice but other people told me their workload was way different. On the other hand, NB shares the same curriculum for CS111 and Data Structures. So no matter which professor you go to, they’ll teach the same thing and you have the same assignments and exams.

In Newark, the classes are definitely more condensed. NBs size is like 10x bigger and professors simply will not pay as much attention to you when it comes to after school times or extra help. The professor I took in Newark definitely cared about us but he didn’t really use methods that promotes learning. Everything he did could easily be searched online (you probably wouldn’t be caught unless you copied someone’s else’s code) and his tests were literally just quizlet questions. None of his test questions consisted of coding and were more basic general computer programming questions like “What’s a getter”.
The two classes I took were not really “Computer science”, but more “computer programming”. First was python later was java. I will say though, their data science branch is interesting. The people there are quite passionate in what they do and if you get Richardson, talk talk talk with her. She’s a great person and will provide you opportunities for internships. My main regret was I didn’t realize this until after finishing her course.

On the other hand, NB feels more organized since everyone learns the same thing. The homework’s take some time and while you could search them up, it would screw your exams in the long run because they change it every semester. Plus they give pasts exams so you literally have the same format and know what to expect. There’s no gimmick to anything in CS111. My one grip is that the professor I had didn’t talk with us whatsoever individually. He was very organized but it was obvious he just lectured and didn’t want to interact with students, hence why he emphasized hard ok using piazza (basically your CS forums for other students to answer questions).
If you’re going to NB, find someone or something and self learn. From the lecture I’ve paid attention to, they overcomplicate a lot and with other courses + it being 80 minutes worth of lectures ONLINE, it’s hard as hell to keep focus and learn. 

Now about opportunities, I haven’t really dove into internships myself but I would think NB has more. There are a lot of clubs and opportunities in them. Don’t take my word for it though, I’m not sure about Newark.

As for commuting, if you’re 90 minutes away I’d just say dorm if you can spare the money. 3 hours truly will exhaust you in the long run, really talk with your parents if they can dorm as much of a beggar as it sounds. If you got any questions I’m still here",1640925419,1,0

To answer your question about good skates, a lot of beginners go for impalas or the roller derby skates. I have candy girls so that could be an option for you.",1640924895,1,0

i’m saying there’s no listings for any computer science related club or even any stem club for the manner. at new brunswick there’s a competitive programming, data science, mathematics, even a blockchain club, and some other cs clubs i’ve forgotten the names of.",1640924176,1,0
"I’m not familiar with Newark as I’m a New Brunswick student, but if you just think about it numbers-wise, there’s a lot fewer cs students at Newark than New Brunswick. Thus there probably aren’t gonna be as many clubs for anything.",1640924127,1,0

"I never said that you can't. Anyone can if they're determined to do well. But for a high school senior, you're WAY too ambitious at this point. College is a whole different ball game and the classes are fucking insane especially like Calculus 1 and 2 and Expository writing. It's good to have goals but realistic ones. You need to take it one step at a time. I was ambitious like you at one point and oh boy did I get a reality check at Rutgers. Anyways, gl though with that negative ass attitude",1640923832,1,0

"If you want the most opportunities and connections as well as research, New Brunswick will be better since it’s the flagship campus and the largest campus.
