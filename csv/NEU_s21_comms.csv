Also northeastern is one of the more restrictive colleges as far as i know, so they could ease up a little without taking too much heat.

"3rd-year ChemE (no combined major, no minor) currently on co-op with a large pharmaceutical manufacturer.

For ChemE classes, you'll get a background in chemistry (general chem plus two semesters of orgo), and the rest has to do with the production/manufacturing side (fluid dynamics, heat transfer, conservation principles, reaction kinetics, thermodynamics, process design, etc).

In my co-op, I would say most people don't physically build anything. It's more about designing/executing our process, the equipment to do so comes from outside vendors. You'll do some maintenance work and troubleshooting, but that's about it, I really doubt you would ever be building bioreactors. You'd like it.

Based on my co-op so far, if I knew I wanted to do pharma/biotech, I think it would've been nice to have a stronger background in biology. *You can't go wrong with any of the options you listed.* Combined major, minor, or just random biology class here and there will all get you into these industries. I bet the combined major or minor in BioE would qualify you for a greater variety of jobs, but even then, I've found that there are way more important variables in play. I almost got a position that's meant only for BioEs in large part because I had good SolidWorks experience from a previous co-op.

"There‚Äôs only ~6 weeks left of the semester, so I‚Äôd encourage you to try a couple things if you haven‚Äôt already to finish the course:

1) If there are office hours, go to the office hours with some specific questions and keep going for the rest of the semester. There might be others with the same questions you have and you can help each other out. 

2) Let the professor know how you‚Äôre feeling and that although you‚Äôll be at office hours you‚Äôre concerned you might need more help. They might be able to connect you to some helpful resources. 

3) Someone else here offered to help. Definitely reach out to them. 

If after trying those you still don‚Äôt feel like you can finish, but you feel that way because of burnout or time constraints, consider taking an ‚ÄúIncomplete‚Äù for the course and finishing over the summer. This will be easier than starting a new course from scratch since you‚Äôre already most of the way through this one.

"Short answer: no, Northeastern isn‚Äôt a traditional American college. Most students are working hard towards their careers and there‚Äôs a strong focus on professionalism (for the most part).

With that said, by being with the right people, you can definitely experience elements of a traditional school. But keep in mind you‚Äôre gonna have to seek these experiences out. If you want parties, I‚Äôd highly consider looking into Greek life. If you‚Äôre excited about big sports games - join the right club(s) ( I think it‚Äôs called the Doghouse?) where people are seeking this sort of experience as well. You‚Äôre not gonna hear everyone on campus talking about the ‚Äúbig game‚Äù or see any sort of tailgate/pregame type of thing. Really it‚Äôs what you make of it. My best piece of advice is understand what sort of extracurriculars and really go for it - it‚Äôs up to you to make your experience that of a traditional school, but also know that everything has trade-offs. Everybody is on their own path/timeline here and I can guarantee there‚Äôs a place for whatever interests you",1613862411,1,0
"Short answer is yes, you need to be in a frat to go to ‚Äútraditional‚Äù college parties, especially your first couple of years when still making new friends/joining clubs. However you can join different clubs and make friends that way or just make friends from classes/random events and have smaller parties with people you are friends with in that club. You can expect small dorm or apartment parties for small friend groups. In general it‚Äôs difficult to get into frat parties from schools in the area as they usually only let in kids from their school.

"In general, I think the Align program is worth it because most of the courses have some application to the industry as NEU is focused on experiential learning. You'll also have access to NEU's resources when trying to go for co-op/internship. In addition, you'll end up with an MS degree, which opens up more opportunities to interview.

However, just because an MS degree opens opportunities, nothing guarantees you a great job. There people who are very successful and end up at FANG company or something similar and there are those who weren't as proactive and struggle to find co-ops or jobs. 

So as much of an opportunity as it is, there is risk of losing time and money. For time, you're still very young so there's that, but if you debt and are going to take on more debt, then I would recommend looking yourself in the mirror and ask yourself why you want an MSCS. Do you want to learn CS from an academic perspective? Or do you just want a job as fast as possible?

If the latter, then maybe an engineering boot-camp with some side projects/self-learning would be a better use of your time and money.

There are questions that I won't be able to answer for you since they're dependent on your financial and personal situation, but all in all, I've had a good experience in the program.",1613855777,1,0

D'Amore-McKim has outstanding professors, but just like any school, you will have hardo professors who think that they are the best thing since sliced bread and go above and beyond to make your life as challenging as possible. I highly advise anyone choosing classes to check out rate my professor to hear other students feedback on their experience with the class and professor. Take everything with a grain of salt though, some students are wizards in the class and make it sound like it was a breeze, while other students may shit on a professor cause they weren't ever engaged with the class, and were looking for a handout. All in all, D'Amore-McKim is regarded as one of the top business schools in the country, and I surely can agree that it should be up there with the best of the best. But, it isn't perfect, and you will have certain professors that are harder than others, making classes more stressful and difficult than they have to be. Even with some of the harder professors, they are all very knowledgeable in their field, and if you can get through their class, it might toughen you up for a much easier class/real world.",1613844350,1,0

Generally though of course there are parties, it's not some barren social wasteland (no school is). making friends can be easier at some schools, but during non-COVID it's not some crazy challenge. Especially if you're making explicit effort to go out and be social, you'll have no problems. I wasn't dissimilar in ""coming out of my shell"" going into college. It wasn't immediate of course, but I have a nice deal of friends even today postgrad from college!

The question is: what do you really mean by this? Northeastern is nontraditional in many ways, but if it's just ""lots of opportunities to have fun"" and lots of clubs then Northeastern will be sufficient.

Ask your recruiter if they can connect you with other incoming co-ops/interns.

Sometimes there are public fb groups you can just search up. ""Bay Area Summer Interns 2021"" is an example group you can search up on fb that might be useful to join. Even if your co-op isn't perfectly aligned with that period of time, have a mindset that anything with overlap is applicable and potentially useful to you.

"Housing:

1. Try to find other people that will be co-oping at your co-op/in the bay area/etc and talk to them about their plans for housing. This should probably be a good first step. You can also ask your recruiter if the company is hiring anyone else that will be interning there during the time period and if it would be possible to connect you with them.

2. There are also a fair number of colleges in area and depending on where your co-op will be located, you can try checking some various off-campus student housing facebook groups (Northeastern co-ops tend to line up at least partially with school semesters). You can see if anyone wants a roommate or someone to take over their lease, etc. Living near a college can also be helpful for making friends in the area, but it is definitely not necessary.

3. You can try apartment hunting online for leases that fit the time period as well, but sometimes it can be difficult.

4. You can also ask previous bay area co-ops and interns how they found housing; some might be able to have some leads that might be helpful.

5. Long-term Airbnbs can also be an option, though depending on what you're looking for (and your luck) may get a bit pricey.

6. I knew someone that lived out of a car for ~4 months. The office building their work was in had showers, and they would leave some of their luggage under their desk at work.

NUStart is asynchronous so the lectures are prerecorded, the exception for this is the required 1-credit seminar done through Zoom and, if you were to sign up for an NUFlex class, that would be live as well. I did forget though that NEU is planning on doing everything in-person in the fall, so they probably won't be offering the NUFlex option. They'll probably keep it around, just because even with everyone vaccinated, I highly doubt they'll be able to fully get rid of isolation/quarantine housing in the fall and therefore NUFlex will be necessary, but it's probably not something people are going to be able to opt into.

Homework grading is going to depend on the class. Fundies and Discrete was based on correctness, I'd assume most classes are that way to make sure you're on track with getting stuff done. First-Year Writing discussion board posts were basically completion provided you put effort into it, but if you didn't answer everything asked then you'd get points off. Really depends on the class, which is not unique to NUStart. NUStart grading is similar to their on-campus counterparts, so the work expected of you won't be much different from if you were in person. 

There are tests as well but how they're done depends on the class. For two of my classes, if the exam was 2 hours for instance, you basically decided when to start it within a 24-hour window and had 2 hours to do it. They can enforce the time limit if they give it through Canvas. For my NUFlex class, the test would be assigned and we basically had as much time as we wanted to do it, but it had a due date. So it was really more of a problem set than a test, and while I didn't take a math class through NUStart, that seems like a plausible form of assessment to me.  All my stuff was open-note (it's hard to enforce closed-note online). There might've been closed-note stuff given in other classes, but everything was open-note for all my classes so that's all I can speak from.",1617995810,2,0

Was that because covid already had professors doing zoom calls? Should I expect real time zoom lectures when I do it this fall or was that just specific to your year. 

You get homework and I assume test so How are thing graded? Is the homework grade effort based or how many questions you get right.

"(Didn't realize how long this was going to be, oops).

I enjoyed it. It was pretty chill and not that stressful for me, but mileage can vary depending on how well you learn on your own / have the motivation to basically watch Khan Academy videos. My first semester was Fundies 1, Calc 3 (I did this live through NUFlex because they didn't offer it through NUStart. I had to email my advisor a few times about it though because they hadn't fleshed out yet whether NUStart people could take NUFlex classes. Some people's advisors said they could and others said they couldn't but mine let me do it), Discrete Structures (which was async for in-person people as well in the fall), and First-Year Writing. You still have access to office hours and whatnot, so you aren't completely on your own, and it was really nice doing class when I wanted to basically. In fact, for Fundies, the lectures would go up on Sundays, so I'd power through them on Sunday afternoons and then I'd have the entire week for completing the work for the class. First-Year Writing was super chill, a couple short readings + discussion posts a week, and a paper every few weeks. I didn't want to take it and was upset about failing the challenge exam to get out of it, but it ended up being an easy A so I can't really complain.

For socialization, they make you attend a weekly one-credit seminar that's live and at a certain time. On-campus people do seminars too, but the NUStart seminars were about global topics while the on-campus seminars actually relate to your major somewhat. I didn't really enjoy the seminar, but I don't think anyone really enjoys their first-semester seminar so that's not unique to the program. I also didn't have the best project group (we had to do presentations on global issues at the end of the semester, but basically as long as you work on it throughout the semester and have something that looks somewhat-polished at the end, you're fine. Nothing to stress about) so that probably also contributed to my experience. They also had us go to a couple virtual alumni events and interact with alumni, which were annoying to go to. One of them I could just show up with my camera off and zone out, but the other one I actually had to talk to an alum for like a half hour, but at least we were from the same general area in western Mass so we had something to talk about. At least last year, there was an NUStart GroupMe chat as well and people would frequently start Zoom calls in there, so you can socialize that way if that's your thing.

They gave us the option to do NUStart spring semester too, but I opted out because they would've made us take another one-credit seminar that isn't required if you don't do NUStart. One freshman seminar is enough, I didn't want to do another. Also, because of the AP credits I came in with, along with the fact that I'm doing a combined major, two of my classes would've needed to be NUFlex, and I think the max is 1 (assuming your advisor knows that NUStart people can take an NUFlex class, if this is the second year though then they'll probably be more aware of this stuff now, this past fall was the first year of it). That being said though, I cannot for the life of me focus during an hour-long Zoom lecture, so maybe the short lecture videos is more my style (though hopefully being in-person this summer/fall will solve that problem). 

Also, fair warning: if you're getting financial aid, then because your expected cost of attendance will be lower due to no housing, your financial aid will be reduced by the cost of housing, meaning you'll pay the same amount you would if you were on campus. I don't know how NUin costs compare to being on-campus, but something to think about as well, because that was my thinking too but I think in the end my cost was lower by maybe $800.

Overall, I don't regret doing it. Between not having to worry about Covid restrictions, being able to easily work a job and do classes, and just straight up having more time to mature a little bit before going to campus (because I was a really immature HS senior), I think it was the right decision for me.

How can it be something to just overlook when so many things we use are FDA approved such as toothpaste, other vaccines, food, medical supplies, I can go on.

Furthermore, I have said nothing about getting tested. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with healthy or asymptotic people getting tested. Also, herd immunity doesn‚Äôt require everyone to be immune. You only need the amount of people vaccinated in order to make the spread of the virus and chances of getting it very slim.

"Hey! I'm a first-year in poli sci business and I love it! I can't speak to co-op opportunities as I have yet to explore them, but I can speak to other parts of the major...

**Pros:**

\- Lots of interesting classes

\- Fantastic professors on both sides

\- Tons of overlap between the two fields, feels like every class I take either business finds a way into a poli sci discussion or vice versa

\- Tons of concentrations to choose from

**Cons:**

\- The number of electives the poli sci department offers each semester is limited. It's my impression this has to do with funding differences between DMSB and CSSH. For the poli sci requirements you will be fine, but trying to get a poli sci concentration seems like it's more difficult once you get into the electives part of your poli sci studies

\- As with any combined major, there are a lot of classes you have to take to fulfil both sides. You might find doing two business concentrations is difficult, but it can happen if you plan it out early. Personally, I'm trying to do two business concentrations and a poli sci concentration and it requires looking for some overlap in classes. Btw, DMSB only allows 1 course to double count for concentrations. 

\- Tons of reading, at least for the intro classes I've done

It was slow to start and then all kind of hit at once. It's also important to note that LinkedIn is important to maintain, update, and have a presence on, as that is where I got recruited from.

"Roxbury isn't a city so Roxbury couldn't do anything. I'm no lawyer but I think they would struggle with something like that because LV is new and therefore doesn't meet any of the definitions of ""blight"" which is usually the standard for destroying residential buildings, and is far from being a nature reserve. 

And politically, the City of Boston likes Northeastern developing (minus a few city councillors). Former Mayor Walsh was a big proponent of LightView, he was the one who set the goal of how many new on campus beds universities needed to build and he was at the various groundbreakings and opening ceremonies to celebrate. LightView pays city taxes, unlike the rest of campus housing, so even more reason why it would be politically unpopular to eminent domain it. Boston is entirely dependent on property tax and they love new development that brings new tax revenue.",1621255324,3,0

"Hi! üëãüèº An international one speaking here, got accepted for the MS in Project Management. As I managed to read and understand so far, most of the international students , myself including, do not get financial aid. What I got pointed to were the co-op and the CPT/OPT opportunities for F-1's. 

Since I don't have rich parents haha , my question is, could a person really rely on the co-op and the opt( maybe a fellow international could answer this one better) as a mean of gaining financial resources and practically returning at least some of the investment for the scholarship and the living costs ? Also, in case you know someone I could book a session with and get better informed, do not hesitate to share. I still haven't formally accepted, I'm trying t gather as much info as I possibly can.

That‚Äôs such a relief because the ED agreement made it seem like you can‚Äôt get any Cs or an equivalent grade (I‚Äôm assuming below a 3) on ‚Äúnational exams‚Äù but I‚Äôm beginning to think that only applies to international students who have bigger exams for graduation or something,1621231481,5,0
I might have misinterpreted this but they made me sign an agreement since I applied ED that said I have to finish the year strong and that I cant have any grade below a C in a class or an ‚Äúequivalent grade‚Äù on any ‚Äúnational exam‚Äù. I think that probably only applies to international students and not aps because everyone‚Äôs saying they don‚Äôt rescind for that.

"T-20, no, not in the near-term. There are too many school with more established reputations than NU to ever be that elite. While NU is extremely competitive on the undergrad level, its PhD programs are a bit behind the rest of the university. Academic reputation is heavily tied to this and you need to be firing on all cylinders. NU has a few PhD programs that are top tier and many that are not in the top 50 of their field.

T-30, NU certainly has the potential. I think it will be ranked regularly in the low 30s in the next 10 years. Whether it can get to 30 will be based on how the university invests in improvements relative to other universities. To be clear, those improvements are not typically one that undergrad students regard as important to them. That said, as the US News rankings have started to take student debt into account, I see NU struggling to turn the ship on this regard.

Regardless of if NU makes T-30, I think NU will rise in the rankings. The university has top tier leadership and a lot of resources to make this a reality. All jokes aside, Aoun is possibly the most effective university president in the US.",1621225400,2,0
