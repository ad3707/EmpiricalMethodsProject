BME major pros and cons/questions,"Hey! I was recently accepted to Georgia Tech for a BS in Biomedical Engineering. I'm not committed yet so I have some general GT questions and some specific to BME at GT:

General questions:

1. Are the professors accommodating and understanding?
2. How competitive is the environment? Are students trying to bring each other down or is everyone doing their own thing?
3. !TW! I'm sorry to be so blunt but are depression and suicide big problems on campus?

BME questions:

1. How rigorous is the BME program? Are the courses extremely overwhelming or will I have time to socialize or at the very least relax?
2. How easy is it to find research/career opportunities?
3. What are some pros and cons of BME at GT that my questions may not have already covered?

I apologize if some of my questions are redundant but I couldn't find much about them on this sub-- especially anything about BME.",1611653672,1,0

Spring career fair experience?,"I'm just curious what yalls experience was today in the virtual All-Majors career fair. For me, the platform itself seemed to work pretty well and was smooth, but the exorbitantly long waiting times for some of the major companies was a killer. Waiting times were upwards of 3+ hours in some cases, which was discouraging. I also ran into the problem of waiting for 2+ hours, only to speak with the recruiter to find out they weren't hiring full-time roles or weren't hiring for my given area of interest (seems that companies weren't required to detail what kinds of roles or departments they were hiring for). Overall I feel like I wasted a bunch of time today sitting at my computer waiting or doing company research with nothing really to show for it.

Is arts and sciences pathway worth it?,"I‚Äôm a freshman engineering student right now at UGA and was offered arts and sciences conditional pathway after being put on the waitlist for an eternity. Tech has always been my dream school but I‚Äôm recently doubting if transferring would benefit me the most as my pathway excludes engineering majors. I‚Äôd have to wait for a semester to change my major, and it would be tedious and hard as most pre req classes are reserved for current engr students. I‚Äôm also scared to be thrown at a new environment again and going out of my way to make friends as a transfer student. I do want to apply for grad programs at tech but I‚Äôm just unsure if undergrad at tech would be the best choice considering my transfer option and engineering major. I also want to keep my Zell and I‚Äôve seen some people losing their Zell because of the grade deflation at Tech.

TL;DR will transferring to tech from uga be worth it?",1611603691,1,0
Has anyone ever seen a positive number appear under financial aid on Pay Now?,"In short, normally in Pay Now, if I go into the details of the financial aid portion, whatever financial aid I receive usually appears as a negative number (which makes sense). This semester, I see the financial aid I expected to see in its expected form and amount, but then there are two additional line items. The two additional line items are titled the exact same as my grants except their amounts are positive, meaning I now owe the school money for financial aid. Neither of them are a loan.

I checked both grants and I'm pretty certain I'm eligible for both. I've contacted the school several times to see what's going on but haven't heard back from them. I'm really stressed out - the payment deadline is today, and I want to say that this is just a mistake on the school's part. But is it?? Or do I have to scrounge up $1600 today?",1611602079,1,0

Can Tech actually fix broken washing machines?,"Rant ahead:

Last week when I went to wash clothes, there were a couple of machines with handwritten post-it notes saying that the machines were broken. Today, when I went to wash clothes, the only machine available was one of those noted machines, but the post-it had been removed. Naively, I assumed that meant that someone had fixed the machine. 

I set my clothes to wash, but when I came back 40 minutes later, my clothes were locked in the machine, and the display said ""IE"". I managed to get my clothes out by unplugging the machine. My clothes were soaking wet because they hadn't been through the spin cycle, so it took 1.5 hours to dry them.

Vaccine Questions Answered,"With the vaccine starting to roll out at Tech, we wanted to answer any questions y'all have about it. Comment below any questions you guys have and I will answer as many as I have answers to! 

Some fast facts from questions we got on Instagram to hopefully preemptively answer some questions:

* General students will be in phase 2 (very good news), and we don't know exactly when this will be because we are at the direction of the Georgia Department of Public Health telling us when to move between phases. 
* GT's goal is to get every student vaccinated by the end of the semester but hopefully GA DPH will let us move more quickly between the phases because we have the infrastructure to get it done sooner
* We are currently in phase 1A+
* Phase 1B will include every person who is employed by GT (including RAs, TAs, researchers, anyone who is in the GT HR system)
* We advocated for unpaid TAs to be included in phase 1B so they will be included as well!!
* Students with preexisting conditions will be in phase 1C (they are still exploring options for validating preexisting conditions)
* International students will face no additional barriers to getting the vaccine
* The vaccine is not required
* The vaccine is free
* If you have already gotten covid and finished your isolation period, you can get the vaccine
* You should still get surveillance tested after you get the vaccine

Hope this helps, and comment below any other questions!",1611584148,1,0

Challenge or Ignite Summer Program (Prospective freshman),"I was accepted to GT during EA as an in-state student for the fall semester, but I am considering doing Ignite or Challenge in the summer since I have nothing planned.

1. It is cheaper than Ignite, only $500
2. It looks more fun with the different activities like whitewater rafting.
3. I am low income, so the chance to earn a scholarship if I perform well enough is really attractive. How much is the scholarship?

The only pro of Ignite that I am considering is getting ahead with classes.

All residence halls (ResNet), greek houses (EastNet), two networks used by *eduroam* (across campus, not isolated to ResNet/EastNet), and one network serving ATDC tenants will be affected. Users in these areas will have no wired or wireless network connectivity during the reboot.

We do not expect the reboot to take the entire hour. If all goes as planned, everything should be back within about 35 minutes.

Connectivity should be automatically restored once the reboot is complete, but some users may need to disconnect and reconnect their wired/wireless connection to restore network access.

Further updates as the maintenance progresses will be posted to [status.gatech.edu](http://status.gatech.edu). You can also subscribe there for email updates for this and future maintenances/incidents.",1612398711,3,0

I was recently accepted to Georgia Tech (and my state school, UT Austin). I was looking at some rankings, and I was wondering why GT's rank seemed to fluctuate quite a lot based on the source.

UT Austin had very similar rankings on both sources, so I was wondering if there was any particular reason for the big difference in the rankings.",1612382414,10,0

Hello fellow redditors! I am a graduate student working on a ground project with my team centered around more passionate health monitoring.

.........

We‚Äôre a group of graduate students at Georgia Tech interested in integrating self-compassion into health products. Research shows that activities such as weighing yourself are not all about the numbers. Psychology, body image, and mental health play a large role as well. We‚Äôre interested in speaking with individuals who are frustrated with existing health monitoring tools and have a unique point of view regarding personal health monitoring.¬†

Please help us by filling out this short (2-3min) survey. If you‚Äôre interested, we will reach out for an interview (30 min.) to discuss your approach to personal health monitoring and explore ideas for new products. Thank you!

Would any CS students be interested in forming a GT CS Careers Club?,"Hey all, I wanted to gauge interest for an idea I have had for a bit. 
I know when I first came to GT, I had no idea how important internships were and I wish I'd had someone to guide me through how to apply, make a quality resume, keep track of open internship applications, etc. After spending wayyyy to much time last semester applying and interviewing, I feel as though I have a much better understanding of the entire CS intern system and I wish I was able to share my experiences and knowledge with other students so they won't make the same mistakes I did/enjoy the same successes.            


Therefore, I am considering creating a club (would probably start it out as a Discord group until enough people joined) for CS students to work on improving their career prospects. Key features of the club would be resume workshops, interview prep, Leetcode discussion, referral trading, and mentoring. We would focus on intern applications, but probably expand to new grad once enough interest was raised.          

While the summer 2021 intern season is coming to a close, I wanted to see if there was enough interest to starting laying out the groundwork for the club in time for next year's application season. I would be looking for two main ""types"" of members: those with significant career/intern experience who would be willing to aid in mentoring, and those with students who are new to the game but hungry to learn the ropes. If this club sounds like something you would be interested in, please let me know below! If something like this already exists or you think the idea could use some tweaking, I would also be interested to hear your thoughts.",1613627743,1,0

Don't Do the Oxford Program,"(A lot of this is opinionated, but I feel like it should be said. If you want to do the program, go for it. As far as their ethics, questionable.)

Tl;dr: Oxford program screwed the 2020 class over. Watch out if you sign up.

So, like many of you in the Summer of 2020, I had signed up for a study abroad. I was incredibly excited to be spending my summer in Europe as part of the Oxford program. But then March came and slammed my trips, as well as everyone else's, into a brick wall. It's fine. We were assured that they'd ""do everything in their power"" to get our over $5,000 back (more for others who had gone ahead and put down the second payment). 

Fast forward through the summer, and we watch EVERY other study abroad get their cash back as we go from weekly updates to monthly to silence. Until finally, we get our saving grace of an email: how much we're receiving back from the program. Of the almost $5,000 we'd paid, we'd only receive somewhere around $1,200. The group of us were angry, of course, but it got worse. The caveat for receiving this missing cash: the 2021 program had to run IN FULL. 

Well friends, guess what? The 2021 program isn't running, and our payment has now been delayed all the way to Summer 2022. 

Look, I get it. COVID hit everyone hard. And I can hear you typing ""but it's not their fault"" in the comments. No, it's not. A global pandemic isn't planned for. But for students who used their own college money to do this type of experience, it's a kick in the face. We need that money to get through school here in Atlanta, let alone Europe. It felt like it was time to scrape together something, pull loose change out of pockets. But while every other program recovered, we were left with effectively nothing. 

I think study abroad is an amazing experience if you can go. I don't think this one set out to be malicious, but at the end of the day, what they've done cannot let me recommend this program to you.",1613411311,1,0

**Where can I find more information about the proposed** **increases?**

Currently, the Georgia Tech SHIP is external to the USG SHIP provided to all institutions, specifically negotiated through¬†the¬†advocacy of Graduate Students and the support of GT administration for the campus to reduce costs and increase services. Although this plan has been approved by the USG for many years, the USG is proposing to dissolve the independent Georgia Tech SHIP and consolidate to a single plan available for all institutions in the 2021-2022 year.  The concerns regarding these proposals are wide, but here are some primary points:

* all unified plans **remove Georgia Tech‚Äôs included** **dental and vision coverage** and replace¬†it with an optional USG dental plan that costs $360 per year
* all proposed options increase Georgia Tech premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums for this **overall** **lower service coverage**.
* worst-case proposals include **increases** **of** **$224** **to the Premium,** **$250** **to Deductible, and $2600** **to** **Out-of-Pocket** **Maximum**

Other repercussions regarding the impacts on the on-campus health centers such as Stamps, DePoe, and Tech Dentistry are possible, but Grad SGA and the Georgia Tech administration have been advocating fervently to the USG stakeholders for Georgia Tech to remain on its own plan. We fear these changes could result in the closure or reduced services at these on-campus providers.The Grad SGA Graduate Student Senate (GSS) passed a resolution on March 2nd in opposition to the proposed SHIP consolidation, which can be seen [here](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com%2Fsites.gatech.edu%2Fdist%2F9%2F988%2Ffiles%2F2021%2F03%2FResolution_Opposition-Proposed-SHIP-Changes.pdf&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cgswift6%40gatech.edu%7C45ca8555340f42e320e708d8df4ccd28%7C482198bbae7b4b258b7a6d7f32faa083%7C0%7C0%7C637504868256496852%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=QMw47Zp%2BR1nMURpxmCNgxBgSZBOrtZsfsub5EzIdVrE%3D&amp;reserved=0), to ensure that the USG understands the magnitude of the impact of changes on Georgia Tech Graduate Students.

Proposed student health insurance changes: update &amp; call to action,"Below is an email that graduate students received today from Lea Harris (grad SGA pres) regarding the proposed SHIP changes. Not sure if undergrads received it one too. Please sign the formal petition and email/call USG representatives about this if you have a second today or tomorrow!

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good Afternoon¬†Fellow Grad Yellow Jackets,

I write to you today to inform you of the proposed changes by the University System of Georgia to the Georgia Tech student health insurance plan (SHIP) which over 4000 of us grad students are a part of. The USG is considering a proposal that could **increase** **our** **student health insurance costs by as much as 30% ($660/ year), reduces** **insurance benefits, and take** **the embedded dental and vision coverage** **out of** **the mandatory** **plan.** This is being done at no benefit to Georgia Tech students, but to reduce the insurance costs for students at other institutions within the USG, by combining the Georgia Tech SHIP with the USG SHIP. If implemented, this plan severely threatens the healthcare finances of over 6500 Georgia Tech students and their dependents **f**or the foreseeable future. As your graduate student body president, I have been fiercely advocating against these changes at the university system level. The institute leadership is also advocating on behalf of all Tech students. The proposal is set to be **reviewed by the USG leadership as early** **as the** **week of March 8th.**

**How can you** **make your voices heard?**

1. **Sign this** **formal** [**petition**](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgatech.co1.qualtrics.com%2Fjfe%2Fform%2FSV_9HreIA95MEQoWSa&amp;data=04%7C01%7Clmoran9%40gatech.edu%7C29697bd97626433ad9e808d8df47e921%7C482198bbae7b4b258b7a6d7f32faa083%7C0%7C0%7C637504847266297815%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=8ct%2BcFO%2FglQ2HwcpPLAgAG7Hf12ptFFCTupNeufF13o%3D&amp;reserved=0)¬†**by Sunday March 7th -**¬†directed towards USG Chancellor Wrigley and the Board of Regents\*\*:\*\* This time the USG leadership needs to hear directly from every single one of us who will be affected by these changes.

2. **Email** **the USG chancellor and call the Board of Regents by tomorrow or first thing Monday,¬†March 8th:** A petition alone may not be enough to convince the USG otherwise.

You owe it to yourself to stand up for yourself and your classmates,"Yesterday, we got our homework grades back in one of my classes. I personally, was absolutely crushed. I failed after pouring over 30 hours into what was honestly a rather small assignment, one that was a decent chunk of my grade. I thought I was pretty alone. Checking the class groupchat, I found out I was wrong. I spoke with my classmates, we all shared our grievences and wondered what to do. Couple hours passed, and now there's an open letter on our piazza addressing the Professor and the TAs about harsh grading rubrics, with nearly 30 people chiming in and still growing. The professor is now reviewing grading policies and reassessing the assignment. All because we simply communicated with eachother.

I was overjoyed, but all I can think of is all the bad grades i've tanked in the past that I thought were a bit unfair just because ""the rubric said so"" and didn't communicate. It honestly changed my entire mood yesterday and gave me some hope for the class going forward. If you think a grading scheme is unfair, talk to your classmates people. Go beyond a regrade if it gets to that, **we all need every break we can while we're having to take classes through a screen.** 

It takes some courage, but plant your feet and fight for your grades and *you.* This is a tough semester, fight it as hard as it's fighting you.",1614872869,228,2

1. Is the pre-requisite chain absolute? Is it possible to get an exception? I haven't taken Linear Algebra and some courses at my current university, and it looks like it will affect my class choices, graduation a lot.
2. Is it stressful to take 12 credits in the summer?

What'd you do to help you improve in a course in which you were struggling?,"Hi everyone, 

I had to drop a course (Diffy EQ) after talking with my professor and learning that I basically needed to get 47/66 remaining points to get a C. I was already at the cusp of C, 71%. Not missing 19 points would've been like trying to avoid stepping on concrete. I averaged less than 70 on quizzes and got exactly 70 on the first exam. For me, the next logic step was to withdraw.

I was struggling pretty badly in the course despite doing the usual: office hours, plus sessions, tutoring, paid tutoring, practicing problems....

I'm trying to figure out why I struggled so much. Have any of you been in this situation at GT? What'd you do that helped? What didn't help?

I‚Äôm currently majoring in Interactive Intelligence and need one more class to graduate. I really want to take Case Based Reasoning because I‚Äôm a stronger writer than programmer but it wasn‚Äôt offered this semester or the summer semester. So, my two options are: 

CS 6601 Artificial Intelligence
CS 7641 Machine Learning 

From my reading, both are pretty time consuming and probably not ideal for a summer course. Anyone have any input on which to take if I want to minimize the amount of coding I have to do? I‚Äôm wondering if I should just bite the bullet and wait until fall semester to finish everything.

Thanks in advance for any advice!",1614775739,5,0

Upzoning Home Park?,"Sorry if this is long and rambling lolüòì; it‚Äôs stream-of-consciousness. I‚Äôve been thinking about this for a while, probably since I started here. 

What does the Gatech community think of upzoning home park? I‚Äôve always wondered why that area was only for single-family homes. I have a feeling it might just be zoned that way like a large portion of the Northern part of Atlanta ITP. I feel like it would be a good place for more housing+commercial development and it would take some pressure off of rents in Midtown and West Midtown. I often feel like rent near campus may just be unsustainably high, for students, yeah, but also for people who already live and work in this area. I also remember reading on this very subreddit about this landlord who owned several properties in home park wasn‚Äôt a very good steward of his own property and wasn‚Äôt respectful of tenants because there would always be a demand for the limited housing supply in home park, where students don‚Äôt have to cross an interstate highway or a railroad track to get to class. 

Home park just seems like the type of area where there is a massive new housing shortage and the type of place that is ripe for gentrification, spiraling real estate prices, unsustainable rents, displacement, etc for several different reasons (despite the housing development that is currently going on in Midtown and West Midtown). Why don‚Äôt we advocate for the upzoning of home park? Ideally we could advocate for units for Gatech campus staff. I always imagine many of the people who work on campus don‚Äôt get paid enough to live anywhere near here. I don‚Äôt have enough money to live here. The only reason I could afford to live on campus was HOPE, but then I couldn‚Äôt use my HOPE money for books or supplies. 

I feel like rents are unsustainable for both students and Atlantans who live in close proximity to the campus, AND Atlantans in general who work in this area. My fear is that if Home Park isn‚Äôt upzoned, students and people in general who earn a lot or have a lot of assets will just price people out of not only home park, but other parts of Atlanta. I would love to (at the very least) see more midrise buildings like GLC or 10th and home, or duplexes or triplexes, at the very least (like you‚Äôd see in older Northeastern cities), and more third places and places of business instead of just single-family homes. 

I admit that I don‚Äôt know very much about the history or significance of home park or its residents outside of Gatech discourse and biking through there, and I would love to know more about who currently lives there in general, and what opinions on housing in Midtown are at Gatech in general and what perspectives might inform those opinions :) I acknowledge that I might be incorrect in my assumptions or observations, and that I might be uninformed.",1614706067,1,0

Basketball Game Tonight - Airball Chant,"Hello friends and fellow gt basketball game attendees,

As we go into our biggest GT basketball game in about a decade, there is one thing that as a basketball fan and Jackets supporter, we, as a student section and pep band, have been doing wrong that has brought bad mojo to our team in spots where we don't need it. The [infamous airball chant](https://slate.com/culture/2016/03/the-air-ball-chant-is-the-greatest-taunt-in-sports-who-invented-it.html), the greatest taunt in sports from a crowd, the most potent way to get into one poor player's head. We have been doing a wonderful job at starting the chant, reminding the player of their past failure, and hopefully helping them continue to struggle the rest of the game. Combined with our seat drumming for every other player, it becomes an even better contrast and distraction. But, we have been failing in one key aspect. **If the player that originally airballed proceeds to score any points, (i.e. makes any shot, even a free throw), they have discovered the key, and have broken free of the airball jail.** Continuing the airball chant after a player has scored, it becomes more akin to motivation than a distraction, and brings bad mojo to our team instead. The recent key example is Kihei Clark at the end of the game against Virginia at the Thrillerdome earlier this year. So please, students, pep band members, cheerleaders, gold rush, alumni, President Cabrera, or anyone else who happens to be at the game, **stop the chant if a player scores after their original airball.** We are not savages, and it is within the sportsmanship of the chant to be fair to the other team's player.

Thank you for listening, I'll get off my soap box, lets get rowdy and loud for this game tonight, and lets send dook back to Durham with their tails between their legs. Go mf Jackets

ps: If anyone knows someone in the pep band and can refer them to this, they are the most coordinated students in the stadium, thus they lead many of the chants and drumming, and their lead on continuing the air ball chant after its expiration generally leads the rest of the student section astray, so I think if they can fix this it will be a big help in the issue. Let's not hurt our own chances tonight.",1614702982,1,0

President Cabrera: Complete Return to In-Person this Fall,"Members of the Georgia Tech Community: 
 
I would like to share with you our plans to return to campus with full operations and a complete residential experience for our students this fall.  
 
This year hasn‚Äôt been easy on any count, but thanks to the dedication, ingenuity, compassion, and commitment of every member of our community, we were able to deliver a successful semester this past fall, and we are well on our way to doing the same this spring. As Covid-19 vaccines continue to roll out to members of our community over the coming months, fewer public health restrictions will likely be needed for universities and workplaces, and we anticipate, by the beginning of the fall semester, being able to once again have full dorms and classrooms, fully productive labs, and the rich campus experiences that students have come to expect of us.  
 
Like we have done in the past 12 months, we will continue to observe public health guidance from the University System of Georgia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Georgia Department of Public Health, and we will leverage the unique scientific knowledge of our faculty and the expertise of our staff to make sure everyone is safe while we deliver on our important mission.  
 
For the time being, it is critical that we continue to test, mask, distance, and socialize outdoors. Georgia Tech‚Äôs comprehensive approach is working. Evidence from the fall semester indicates the virus did not spread in classrooms or labs, and that workplace transmission was very limited. These encouraging trends have held through the spring. We continue to sustain a positivity rate below 1% in our surveillance tests, and we have not detected any transmission in classrooms or other academic environments.  
 
Our vaccine rollout also continues, and, as an official state distribution point, we will release information about the timing of future phases so more members of this community can be vaccinated. The new vaccines have demonstrated to be safe and extraordinarily effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death. And there‚Äôs growing evidence that they may reduce transmission of the disease to others too. I am planning to take whatever vaccine is offered to me, and I encourage you to do the same. 
 
This past year has tested us in countless ways. But this community has stepped up time and time again and has showed its eagerness to solve problems and find a path forward. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to all of you ‚Äî students, faculty, and staff, but also alumni and friends who‚Äôve supported us. I know it hasn‚Äôt been easy, but the lessons we‚Äôve learned over the past year mean that we know more than ever about what we‚Äôre up against and how we can safely push forward. Innovation, collaboration, reliance on science, care for one another, transparent communications, and a focus on well-being have been our most effective weapons and will continue to be critical.  
 
As we prepare for a return to full campus operations, please know that we will continue to listen to and engage all constituencies. We want to hear from you. I encourage you to participate in the [listening sessions](https://news.gatech.edu/2021/02/17/faculty-and-students-invited-listening-sessions-classroom-experiences) and [surveys](https://www.news.gatech.edu/2021/02/19/students-asked-provide-feedback-classroom-experiences-new-survey) now open for feedback. More details will be available in the coming weeks.

Switching Major/Psychology at Tech/Grad School and Withdrawals?,"TLDR: I think I want to switch my major to psychology to becomr a therapist. Anyone have thoughts on this major at Tech? Is it better to have less withdrawals or a higher GPA for grad school/possibly med school?

Hello! Im currently in a bit of a crisis. Im a Computational Media Major and I think I dont really enjoy CS. Graphic design/media are cool but they dont feel as fulfilling as I thought they would. 

I am very indecisive (Ive switched majors twice since getting here!), but have always been interested in psychology and therapy. I think this is my true career path, Ive just been ignoring it to align with strictly STEM things. 

I figure I should switch to psychology here at Tech (though I hear mixed reviews and know that I will need to go to grad school to get full use of this major), but I need to figure out if withdrawing from some of the classes Im taking would be my best option for grad school. I already have three withdrawals on my transcript (pandemic stress + another major switch), and am doing poorly in Math 1554 and Math 2550. I think I *could* end with a B in both of these, which would give me a GPA of about 3.6 (Im in my sophomore year), or I could withdraw and keep my GPA closer to a 3.7.

More vaccine appointments 6:30,"(from task force email) 

To the Georgia Tech Community,  


Georgia Tech has begun to schedule Covid-19 vaccination appointments for those ages 55 and older, those with physical disabilities, and those ages 16 and older with underlying medical conditions that make them susceptible to severe illness. In addition to the newly eligible, we also continue to schedule vaccinations for those who are due for their second dose.  
There has been a strong response from the community. To meet this additional demand, we are scaling up our operations and working with the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH), which manages the allocation of vaccines, to procure a larger supply.  
Earlier today, Georgia Tech received an additional shipment of vaccine, which will enable us to offer an additional 900 appointments between March 16-22. If you are eligible, **visit** [**mytest.gatech.edu**](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmytest.gatech.edu%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cakazmi30%40gatech.edu%7Ca95530b672b64b77d00808d8e7ece70c%7C482198bbae7b4b258b7a6d7f32faa083%7C0%7C0%7C637514353126740883%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=Wmhq9JwIrXRIrDmpKayJk0jvlXcNlOqrJwyJr%2F2QNFs%3D&amp;reserved=0) **beginning today at 6:30 p.m. to schedule your vaccination appointment**. We will accept vaccination appointments until all slots are taken.

We will add more appointments in the coming days as we receive further shipments of vaccine. We appreciate your patience as we distribute our existing supply within this large group of newly eligible individuals. In addition to the Georgia Tech vaccination clinic, the DPH provides a list of [alternative Covid-19 vaccination sites](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdph.georgia.gov%2Flocations%2Fcovid-vaccination-site&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cakazmi30%40gatech.edu%7Ca95530b672b64b77d00808d8e7ece70c%7C482198bbae7b4b258b7a6d7f32faa083%7C0%7C0%7C637514353126750879%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=wdT%2BRvtuEgth6PyjNZd2SqxGQDi7s4aOGOmVHBKh4LE%3D&amp;reserved=0).  
These are exciting times and we know that many of you are anxious to receive a vaccine. Georgia Tech is committed to working to ensure that everyone in our community who is eligible for a vaccine has the opportunity to receive it.  
Georgia Tech¬†community¬†members¬†are expected to¬†register for vaccination¬†appointments¬†only if¬†they meet eligibility requirements.¬†Acting ethically is¬†one of¬†Georgia Tech‚Äôs core values, and we expect our community to demonstrate that value during this process.

How does this work? Follow these steps:

1. Go [here](http://fantasy.espn.com/tournament-challenge-bracket/2021/en/) and fill out your bracket. It doesn't have to have Tech winning it all, but that'd be fun, wouldn't it be?
2. If you would like to, join the /r/GaTech bracket group using [this link](https://fantasy.espn.com/tournament-challenge-bracket/2021/en/group?groupID=3948682). You can submit your main bracket to the group or you can make a brand new one just for this group, it's up to you.
3. Go to [http://brackets.qxlp.net/](http://brackets.qxlp.net/) click ""log in"". You'll be redirected to reddit to authorize the site to see to see your reddit account's age (this + what subreddits you subscribe to is all the information it gathers about your reddit account, so don't worry about it stealing your info). Your account must be at least 1 month old to participate.
4. After you log in, go to [https://brackets.qxlp.net/settings](https://brackets.qxlp.net/settings) and fill in ""gatech"" at the top. Make sure you are subscribed to /r/GaTech before doing this! Then, follow the instructions on the page to grab the entryID for your ESPN bracket, submit it, then press ""Save Settings.""

Congratulations! You are now a part of the /r/CollegeBasketball Bracket challenge! /r/CollegeBasketball gives out prizes for the top 10 overall brackets in the competition, and the best bracket in each subreddit with at least 10 entries will win reddit gold - so if we get at least 10 signups (and I'm confident we will), the best /r/GaTech bracket will win reddit gold.

It's a fun way to keep involved with everyone's favorite pastime, and if you're already filling out a bracket anyways, you might as well do it for Ma Tech. Enjoy March Madness, and Go Jackets!",1615836682,1,0

UMD Full Ride vs GA Tech OOS for CS,"I'm from PA and I plan on majoring in CS. I got a full ride to UMD so the net cost is $0. GA Tech would be $50k/yr, but my parents will pay half, so my contribution would be $25k/yr. It seems that in some subfields of CS like Computer Vision that I'm interested in, UMD might offer the same or even more academic opportunities than GA Tech. With my AP credits, I should be able to complete UMD in 3 years easily, but graduating early might be more difficult at GA Tech. It also looks like a lot of Computer Vision jobs prefer Masters/PhD holders, so grad school is not off the table right now. I know GA Tech has a 5-year master's program (UMD does too), but I'm not sure if I would want to do that at GA Tech (or even UMD for that matter). I also have some interests in cybersecurity and I got into a smaller living-learning community at UMD that specializes in it, so I should be able to make friends easily. Will GA Tech offer more opportunities in terms of internships and job opportunities than UMD, or will I get the same if I work hard and be proactive at UMD?",1617974716,1,0

Research(MS) at Tech,"Hi y'all! 
This might be a long shot but does anybody have any suggestions how to look for a 'good' PI for a master's thesis (in CS) ? 
I know the process that I look at the prof's research and reach out to them, etc.. But my main concern is how do I actually find a prof who would support me even if I am a bit slow at research initially. 

I had a horrible RA experience during the first year of my grad school and that has left me feeling extremely under-confident at doing any kind of research. I am a bit inexperienced when it comes to research, but i have finished all my coursework now and I am ready to dedicate all the time of the upcoming semesters into my research. I am so traumatized by my last research experience that at this point of time, I am just looking for profs who are supportive in the initial stage even if their research is not my primary field of interest. I am not even trying to look for a funding at this point. All I want to do is some good research before I leave Tech.

Arts and Sciences Transfer Pathway Question,"Hey guys I got offered the Arts and Sciences Transfer Pathway for Fall 2022. I applied for Econ and now want to major in IE (specifically interested in the Economic and Financial Systems concentration since that leads to the job opportunities that I'm looking for). I am aware that my pathway doesn't allow me to apply to the College of Engineering. My question is: What is the best major to do for 1st year, assuming I want to switch to IE after transferring in? Any specific school (College of Sciences, College of Design, or Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts)?

I understand that the Arts and Sciences Transfer Pathway is designed to restrict me from switching to College of Engineering, CS, etc. but I have heard stories of people transferring to GT (through regular transfer admissions) as psychology majors who were able to switch to CS after they got in. Just curious if I can do a similar thing, but though the Arts and Sciences Pathway.

appreciation post,"i did a [rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/lfvmz0/rant_about_an_inconsiderate_instructor/) sometime back about one of my professor only fair that we recognize goodness too. he deserves a nobel peace prize regardless tbh.

this is what he did:

Hi all.

A bit more than a year ago Georgia Tech closed campus due to COVID-19. We are about to conclude our second (or third if you did summer) semester of remote instruction. We are all exhausted. A bit more than a year ago when campus closed, I truncated the assignments, making a bunch of regular assignments into extra credit or canceled assignments outright. There are no surprises this year, we knew going into this semester what to expect. But now that we are here, I can sense the tiredness in the class. I can sense the tiredness in myself. So here is what we are going to do about it.

1. I will give you until Friday to complete take-home exam 2

2. I will extend homework 5 until April 23rd.

3. Exam 3 will be canceled.

4. Homework 6 will be shortened and made optional (submit for extra credit). It will be due on April 30, essentially replacing exam 3.

\*\*

the email goes on in logistical details but some highlights:

\- I had not prepared you sufficiently and exam 2 is turning into a major assignment. I have put a lot of my personal focus into answering questions on Piazza. I have found it worthwhile to help you all work through the exercise. The fact that it as turned into a major undertaking for some is my fault and I take responsibility for it. If this exercise is going to become a major assignment, then you all don't need another official homework assignment or another exam.

\- My compromise is to do what I did a year ago, which is make the assignment extra credit. It is really good, and a really practical assignment for anyone who might want to work in AI after graduation. I strongly encourage you to do the extra credit assignment. I would totally understand why you didn't.

\- Why did I cancel the exam 3? Because we are tired.

\- You are doing an admirable job if you are even just getting along. It is not my job to create unnecessary stress. While I think it is essential to pull back on some of the educational goals on this class, the important learning opportunities are still available to those who can partake.",1617817947,1,0

Appreciation Post for Great Professors,"I know that this subreddit typically contains people venting about various classes and professors who aren't understanding. I just wanted to take a second and share my experiences with a couple of my professors this semester and give them some recognition for how amazing they've been. If anyone has other stories about good professors, feel free to share. I understand that not everyone has been lucky enough to have professors who are understanding, so also feel free to shame too.

First up is Daniel Molzahn who teaches ECE 4320/4321. He's an awesome lecturer but has really made an effort to make sure that the class is not stressing students out during an already stressful time. He has hosted various outdoor in-person meetups for test reviews to try and meet with students face-to-face. But, if students were not comfortable with this, or just couldn't attend, he then hosted a virtual review session the day after. In addition, he has made tests take-home over a period of three days. He made the tests more comprehensive since we had more time for the exam, but he didn't make them unfair. After every exam, he always makes sure to get student feedback and will make sure that he isn't putting too much stress on us during this time.

Another professor I've had this semester is Nivedita Bhattacharya who teaches ECE 3150. I don't know her as personally as I do Daniel Molzahn, but her class notes are very well written for students who can't attend live lectures and she does a great job answering student questions during lectures. But she has been super understanding about the stress we're under. Here's a recent note she sent out to the class. ""As we move into the final month of instruction for Spring‚Äô21, I wanted to drop a quick note. I know many of you are feeling a lot of pressure with all the homeworks, exams and projects piling up. If you feel overwhelmed at any point, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me. I will try my best to make sure you don‚Äôt feel as stressed about our assignments and deadlines and feel more confident with the material. Learning should be fun and I want to keep it that way without making you feel burdened with the work load. Take care and best of luck!!""
When I needed a homework extension because of a hell week, she gave it to me quickly and offered to set up extra office hours if I needed help.

Finally, I've seen Benjamin Yang on here a couple of times, but he really is the GOAT. I'm taking him for ECE 3025. Again, he is an amazing lecturer and professor, but he's also just a great human being. He has been super flexible with assignment due-dates, made tests take home so we could complete them on our own time, and has reached out to students individually to make sure they're doing okay. He has been super understanding both in-class and out-of-class. If you have an opportunity to take him, don't hesitate to do it.

Again, I know not everyone has good professors this semester so if you wanted to vent about that, feel free. But I was also hoping to hear from some other people about their experiences with awesome professors. As much as we like to shit on everything bad at Tech (which there is a lot), I think the people who make Tech great could use a little recognition.",1617814562,1,0
"Double Charged for a Semester, anyone to contact besides Bursar?"," Hi all looks like GaTech charged me for classes I didn't take and put a hold on my account. I paid half, before realizing something didn't add up about the debits/credits.

Georgia Tech for pre-med,"I've been admitted to Georgia Tech for BME and am really looking forward to studying there.

The Junior Design series of classes in CS is horribly designed [vent],"(Throwaway to avoid ruffling feathers)

**Background**: I will be graduating in a few weeks. I was a co-op student and  did all my rotations (and more). I have worked in group projects before and have put up with typical Tech stuff before, been put through the ringer, etc. But I took junior design my last two semesters and it was probably my least favorite experience with a class at Tech. I think the whole CS 2350 through Project Implementation series of classes really need to be re-thought by whoever sets the course objectives.

I'm sure some people enjoy the classes - I think it really depends on who teaches it and who your client is. But my issue with it is that Tech does absolutely nothing to prepare students for Junior Design which either makes the project really hard for some team members to contribute well, or means that older students have to pull more weight because the younger ones don't have as much experience (my experience). Now, I am more than happy to teach people how to do certain things, and I really am not a fan of shitting on team members for not knowing things. Everyone has to start somewhere and that is what college is for- older students taught me a lot when I was an underclassman. But because the class is so fast-paced and comes with so much busy work, it just feels like it's asking for a stupid amount of work from students with absolutely no explanation or support from instructors. Whenever people in my class have voiced concerns, it feels like the instructors basically just say ""that's life, pull yourself up by your bootstraps"". No problem, client issue, etc is a good enough reason to actually get some advice or support. The feedback they've given my team in particular doesn't even feel like they know what our project is or have been reading what we turn in. Sometimes we've even asked for feedback or clarification on assignment details and just been ghosted by the professors.

2340 is supposed to teach students the basics of object oriented projects, but the project and programming it uses are something different every semester. People can go into junior design knowing only Java and be expected to contribute meaningfully to a full JavaScript project within weeks. It just seems like its not really designed to teach students anything but to tread water, manage crises, and hope for the best. We already know how to do that - we're tech students. It's like it's marketed as a challenge for students to ""learn"" something about industry, but it kind of just feels like we've been set up to fail. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to learn from that besides that Tech hates my guts.

In the real world, if it's a choice between doing good work or completing a lot of features badly, most people choose to lessen the scope of the project and hire more engineers if they need more labor. I have done lots of ""real world"" work and have never been asked to jump into a critical project without at least a little training, project documentation, or time to adjust to the work setting/meet with coworkers who know more about the technical background.

These classes also literally never touched on user-centered design or tech ethics (at least in my sections), and I feel like that is a huge oversight. How are you going to send engineers into the world with absolutely no concept of how to take an adequate amount of time to test designs, think about how the technology would impact a user base, or negotiate features the client thinks they want (but probably doesn't actually for usability reasons) with the client. Why does this series of classes champion ""writing good code"" more than ""building good/usable/accessible technology""? A lot of the time our client had no idea what he wanted and expected us to tie together our current project with past junior design projects that had no documentation and were only half done. And we couldn't tell him ""no that won't work"" or ""I don't think that design is very usable"" because the instructors want us to do whatever the client says. It just seems like such a silly and outdated curriculum, and not at all how things worked in any of my industry jobs.

That's my rant.

TL;DR CS Junior Design classes are kind of worthless. If you can plan ahead and do the research option or any of the other options... do it",1619106351,1,0

I hate room swaps with a burning passion,"Soon to be graduate here. Last year of housing. Wanted to live with my friends. Two had financial trouble, had to register late. So, all through phase 1 of housing, I emailed pairs who joined and they were always courteous enough to take other spots.

Now phase two. Our pair missed the room by 2 hours. Two people who swap in barely respond to emails. One of them is super nice and swaps (Thank you so much dude, it's so cool also that you're from Africa I had never heard of your home city before!). Other dude decides to give us the run around forever, never responds to us offering rooms in buildings right next door. ""Oh I'm going to swap with someone else"" comes out of nowhere and now there's ANOTHER person we gonna have to talk to. Who hasn't responded to days of texts, emails, etc. So dude's ignoring us. 

Like holy hell if dude says ""I don't really want to swap"" then fine, but could you please like, at least say that? Instead of ghost me? Like dude we gonna be sharing a bathroom n shit.

A more positive post,"So I have seen a lot of rants and vents around here lately (in their own right) and I wanted to provide my experience to you all.

I'm one of the few weirdos that actually enjoys online school. There are just so many advantages to it that it always baffles me how people say they are not learning. Maybe I have just gotten lucky these past two semesters with my professors, I definitely have had some amazing ones, but the main thing that I really like is the recorded lectures. One professor in particular did this thing where he broke down his lectures into 5-10 minute videos and put them into units. For some odd reason, I can't sit through a 75 minute lecture but I can watch his little videos for upwards of 4 hours and I feel relatively normal. It's not content I particularly enjoy either and don't get me wrong, his class is definitely stressful, but I feel like it would be 10x worse if it was in person. Additionally, as someone that has a lot of trouble listening, the subtitles in the pre recorded lectures (even though they tend to suck) make it so that I only have to guess 20% of what the professors say rather than 50%. Not to mention, I can always rewind and rewatch as many times as I need to for my ears to pick up that one word that makes the entire sentence logical. 

Another huge advantage is examination. I definitely feel much much much much much much more calm taking an exam in my room than in a classroom, and my grades reflect that. Not to mention, professors are more slack about making them open notes which is always nice (although rarely useful). Yes, honorlock sucks, lockdown browser sucks, I also don't want my data all over the place, but honestly it's really not that bad. My data is already all over the place anyways due to social media and the occasional GT leak. Quite frankly, most of the people I have met that complain about honorlock due it with the ulterior motive of wanting to cheat. That is a very limited sample of people and I like to think most GT students stick to the honor code, but I definitely don't think my human rights have been attacked by these apps. I personally prefer online examination infinitely over in person examination. 

Lastly, and probably more of a niche advantage: I don't have to drive to campus. I live about 30 mins away and I am more than happy I don't have to sit through that drive every day. I do have one in person class (that I actually like) and drive there twice a week (and a couple more times for extracurriculars) but at least when I do drive to campus it's for something I enjoy, so I'm not associating that commute with things that annoy me. Not to mention, my attendance has 100% improved since (a) I can wake up 5 minutes before my online classes and mostly pay attention and (b) even if I miss the class, there is usually a recording somewhere or pdf of the notes I can reference when I'm feeling up to it. 

I'd like to end this post acknowledging that my experience seems to be very different from those of others on this sub, and maybe I'm just very lucky, but I was hoping to give you guys a different perspective. I hope GT allows professors to continue the hybrid format next semester if they want to and doesn't force them to have in person classes. I think there are definitely benefits in autonomous learning for some classes and they should stay that way, and I also think there are benefits to in person classes (especially lab classes) and I can't wait for those to come back. I really hope GT learns from this semester and manages to include the systems that have been developed in future semesters. Thank you for reading if you made it this far.

Tldr; I enjoy online school and I hope GT sticks to a hybrid format and doesn't force professors to do all in person in future semesters.",1618968384,1,0

This semester has been an absolute drag. [Vent],"Sorry for venting. College so far has been the worst experience in my life. I have had no friends since July because I don't know anybody at Tech, and my high school friends are off at college elsewhere. Last semester was quite a challenge between school and mental health. I was studying for way too much each day and being depressed way too much each night, so I decreased my my expected work for this semester.

Well, this semester was a different beast. My mind has been completely out of it since the beginning of March. Our supposed-to-be spring break was a period of the greatest mental difficulty I have ever experienced due to the combination of burnout, loneliness, and and wishing I were on a beach somewhere with friends. That week was easily the busiest of the entire semester, and I still haven't recovered.

No matter how hard I try to study, I still end up far below my desired grades. I am talking about studying all day for 5 days and still barely making a B on an exam. The worst part is that my grades are tanking as we head into finals. I was once on the border of all A's, but it is now basically guaranteed that I make at least one B.

I don't see how this semester is fair. They can't just give everyone A's, but I wish the professors would help out a little so that I don't have to split my time between studying and attempting to fix emotions.

Tech was once a place that I looked up to. Heck, it was something I dreamed of since 5th grade. It is slowly becoming something I dread each day. I went from having flags and football posters around my room to taking that all down and having blank walls because I don't really care anymore. I feel like there is no help or care for the students, and my experience has really tainted my view of the school.

 / / / / / / / / / / / / /

*TL:DR-*
Tech has been far below what I expected it to be throughout high school, and my mental health is as big of a challenge as my classes.

*Note to current high school seniors*: Don't take my perspective as what you should expect. You will have a different (and more positive) experience, and I will be alongside you trying to redo my own freshman experience.",1618930652,1,0

"Scared of possibly failing out, please help!","So I got some pretty bad/okay grades last semester, 2 Bs 3 Cs and 1 D. This semester feels even worse. I am having alot of internet/technical difficulties. I am waaaayyy behind on studying because I have been moving houses/getting used to living in a whole new country. And I am suffering from burn out, really bad. My overall GPA is currently a 2.5. I was a transfer, so I only have 2 semesters finished here at tech (my first, I got all Bs). I had a 3.9 at the last school, with 58 credits. 

There is still a chance that I can pass all of my classes, and i am defenitely going to do my best to do so. But I of course want to get good grades as well. Should I talk to my advisor? Should I try to contact the dean? What can I do? I want to bring my gpa up so that I keep my hope scholarship, but I am terrified that I have already blown it. I'm not going to lie, I am on the verge of tears. It just feels like I am not cut out to be at this school, or that I should have taken a break before coming back. Is it too late?",1617056803,1,0
High-Resolution Printers on Campus,Hello everyone. My professor is allowing us to have a one-sided one-page crib sheet and on our exams and in the future.

Are there high-resolution printers on campus that would be able to accurately and clearly print such small font sizes? Thanks,1617056649,1,0

ECE Senior Design Question,"Hey mods feel free to remove my post if needed, but I couldn't find any post similar to mine or felt it belonged on a megathread. Honestly feel little stupid right now. I just became aware that 4011 and 4012 no longer exist and now I'm a little confused how Senior Design is set up for ECE seniors now. I see that there are 3871/2 which are essentially 4011/12 in that they're two semesters of senior design. Then I see 3873 which is just one? So does this mean I can just take one Senior Design class in Spring 2022 instead of breaking it up into two semesters? Also apparently we were all told this?  I check my email frequently so I think I missed the memo somehow. I'm just trying to sign up for Senior Design 1 in the fall and I recently met up with my advisor and she kept talking about 4011 as if it was still happening. Googling hasn't helped either. Just a little confused and any insight is much appreciated. Thanks y'all!",1616875196,1,0

To those who know about the CS field - last one,"Hi all, 

I am sorry to keep asking questions...this will be my last post about this, I just really need help. To succeed in CS and make it past that worker bee 80k salary, how much of entrepreneurial and street smart skills do you need? Because I'm not great at that stuff...I am a very hard worker and do my best in every task, but I don't know if I have that networking or street-smart sort of thing. I just like to do my work, and go home...I'm not good at doing extra projects and extra things to market myself or impress people. How likely is it that I will be stuck at a max of 100k for my whole life? 

Moving on from money, how many of you find your job meaningful or fun? Are there enough options out there that I can find something meant for me?

Also, how much stability is really there? Like some people I know in CS are constantly moving around with new jobs, and I would personally just like to stay put in one city that I like and keep working there happily. How realistic is that in this field? 

Also, I wouldn't want to be forced to work from home ALL the time, because I'd prefer some face to face social interaction. But of course with a lot of remote jobs that's how it is. 

These are some of my main concerns, and would SO appreciate any and all insight from you guys on some or all these factors. Thank you SO SO much!!!",1621259487,1,0

Does anyone have any suggestions for worthwhile classes that won't be extremely difficult to do online?

I just worry that I am not searching hard enough. I worry that it is too good to be true. But from what I've read, most apartments in Atlanta are crap (unless you have lots of money).

Updated Guidance for Summer and Fall (E-mail from the Georgia Tech Coronavirus Task Force),"To the Georgia Tech Community:  


You‚Äôve likely seen the guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) yesterday relaxing use of face coverings inside and outside for vaccinated individuals. Yesterday, we also received guidance for fall planning from the University System of Georgia. It encourages us to review the plans for return to campus for Fall 2021, keeping in mind guidance from the Georgia Department of Public Health, CDC, and state.   
‚ÄúThe CDC has said that fully vaccinated individuals are safe to return to normal activities,‚Äù said Dr. Benjamin Holton, senior director, Stamps Health Services. ‚ÄúOutside of healthcare facilities and public transportation settings, it is safe for those fully vaccinated to interact normally and without face coverings. The best thing you can do for your health and safety is to get vaccinated.‚Äù  
Georgia Tech‚Äôs vaccine distribution clinic is still available on campus, and we‚Äôll also continue surveillance testing throughout the summer. ¬†  
The summer semester starts next week. Plans had included social distancing, and we will continue that practice inside classrooms to honor the schedules and classroom assignments that have already been set. Individuals who are vaccinated do not have to wear a face covering. Individuals who are not vaccinated are strongly encouraged to wear a face covering while inside campus facilities.   
Covid-19 Alternative Work Arrangements or accommodations granted to employees through July 31, 2021, for Summer 2021 due to increased risk for severe illness will end no later than June 30, 2021. All employees are expected to return to their previous work arrangement at that time. Current summer teaching assignments are excluded from this transition deadline.   
With limited exceptions, employees with current Covid-19-related telework assignments should begin transitioning back to their pre-Covid-19 work arrangements no later than June 30, 2021. ¬†Department heads or their designees have the authority to establish teleworking arrangements. All telework requests and designations are based upon management discretion and in accordance with a determination of what best serves the Institute and students.   
Human Resources will be communicating with managers next week to guide them through the summer alternative work arrangements.   
At this time, we plan for a return to a fully residential experience for Fall 2021. In the coming weeks, the Institute‚Äôs Covid-19 Task Force will be working through detailed plans that address fall campus health and safety guidelines, event planning, athletics planning, additional work arrangements, and travel requirements. ¬†  
We understand there are still a lot of questions. All detailed fall plans will be communicated widely once finalized. They will be adapted as needed based on guidance from the Georgia Department of Public Health. ¬†  
We also understand changes like these, after a year of managing through the pandemic, might cause stress and anxiety. Please know we have resources available to help students, faculty, and staff navigate personal stress and anxiety.

First Generation Pathway program help,"Hey all. I posted on this subreddit about a month or two ago regarding this topic. I've tried getting help from the Registrar's office at Georgia Tech, but keep getting automated messages.

I've been looking into the program for what courses I need to take, how to take them, etc. and have chosen to get the work done at KSU. Thing is, I don't plan on actually attending KSU's campus to take the classes. My sister offered me the opportunity to come and stay with her in Athens to help facilitate the transition from high school to ""the real world"". The plan is to move in with her and take the required classes through an online format. In reality, I'd be nearly 2 hours away from KSU.

My issue is the transfer credit policy. It was recently updated to include a change for Fall 2021 and Spring 2022. Now, if a college offers only online courses, they will count for in-class credits and be valid for Tech credit. After checking the equivalency table on the Georgia Tech's site, I found out that all the courses I need (Precal, Intro to Computing, and Lab Sciences) EXCEPT for Calc. 1. No credit awarded for transfer. 

Does this mean attending in-person classes is the only option? I remember the First Gen. Webinar mentioning that applicants can list extenuating circumstances on their forms, but I don't know if this falls under that. Should I call the Registrar's office about this?",1621012161,1,0

"I feel useless, lost and worthless","Hi, 
Sorry this is gonna be something I wanna get off my chest. I‚Äôm a third year international student at tech. I‚Äôve come to the point in my life where I feel like I have ruined my entire career. My GPA is not great to start with, it‚Äôs pretty average. I spent my freshman summer back home, interning, and my last summer at home taking classes. I‚Äôve tried really hard to bag an internship this summer and received nothing but rejections. Capital one, Koch industries, Coca-cola, Home Depot, NCR, and a list of other companies that I‚Äôve been applying to since winter break last year have all turned me down. I‚Äôve had my resume reviewed by friends and faculty and implemented all the feedback received, and they say it looks good. My career buzz shows no opportunities available for this upcoming summer. I really wanna do something in life but I think my past experiences just make me seem like a worthless candidate at this point. And don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs not the interviews that I‚Äôm bombing, because I only received interviews from 2 companies I applied to. I always have the opportunity to return home, but not interning in the United States just seems like a dumb thing to do, or very unconventional for a third year student. It gives me immense joy to see my friends from all different majors receive offers, it‚Äôs just I wish I had that experience too. I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I just feel useless. My parents are spending a fortune on my education and I really want to be able to be financially independent but I do not know how to. I‚Äôve been using LinkedIn to reach out to people but it seems like it‚Äôs the end of the recruiting season now. I don‚Äôt know what is causing this. Some say it‚Äôs because of sponsorship requirement in the future, others it‚Äôs because of my academics, some say it‚Äôs because of my major.

"In solidarity about the COVID-19 situation around the world, especially India and Brazil","(We sent this message from the School of IC to all our students and faculty, and Dr. Kumar asked me to share it here as well.  So for everyone--not just IC.)

Dear students and colleagues,¬†¬†

The loss and devastation on account of COVID-19 continues to be heart-breaking, and we stand in solidarity with our students, faculty, and staff who have been impacted by recent waves that have struck parts of the world particularly vigorously, notably India and Brazil, but also many others.¬†

In this time, we aim to extend full support to those affected, also recognizing how difficult this time of year is for students in general, and particularly so after the year we have had. We encourage all faculty to reach out and let our students know that they are supported, and to provide as much flexibility and compassion as possible with end-of-semester and upcoming commitments.¬†

We are organizing virtual, hour-long, solidarity sessions through this month for those who would like to connect with others experiencing a similar sense of loss, helplessness around being separated from loved ones in other parts of the world, or anxiety about the future. If you would like to be informed of these sessions, be part of a community for sharing information about relevant initiatives, or make new suggestions for connecting further, please reach out to Dr. Neha Kumar ([neha.kumar@gatech.edu](mailto:neha.kumar@gatech.edu)).¬†

SGA Letter to USG Board of Regents About Chancellor Search,"Hi y'all, please read our joint letter with UGA to the USG Board of Regents about their ongoing search for a new Chancellor! Please let us know if you have any further questions about it!

""Dear Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia,

The Student Government Associations of the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Georgia urge the Board of Regents to conduct a merit-based search for the new Chancellor of the University System of Georgia (USG) that is free from politicization. We commend the Board of Regents for electing to pause the ongoing search for Chancellor to reflect and determine your next steps. As representatives of USG students, we advocate for students‚Äô concerns to be at the center of your reflection. 

Because the Chancellor presides over all 26 USG schools and directly impacts students and faculty alike, we understand the gravity of this decision. As USG schools continue to rise in rank as the nation's best public universities, the leader of the USG must be an individual who has experience in higher education, and is prepared to address challenges facing USG schools. Echoing the words of our accrediting agency, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), we implore the Board of Regents to elect candidates with ‚Äúappropriate experience and qualification.‚Äù 

We are deeply troubled that a politicized search could tarnish the reputations of our respective schools and jeopardize the accreditation of our universities. As students, we worry about potential consequences from a loss of accreditation, such as a decrease in competitiveness relative to near-peer institutions, decreasing federal financial aid, alienating alumni and other potential donors, and the devaluing of a USG degree. We ask that the Board of Regents follows the SACSCOC standards to ensure that USG schools preserve their accreditation.

We appreciate the Board of Regents‚Äô statement about valuing the input from USG faculty, staff, students, and the community, and would like to see actions taken to facilitate student input. As students whose lives center around our attendance at USG institutions, our perspective on this decision would be valuable to the Chancellor search committee. We request that a student representative from a USG school be placed on the Chancellor search committee moving forward. Regarding this year‚Äôs appointment, we request the Board of Regents to be transparent in their search process, and would appreciate the list of potential candidates be publicized before one is selected and public listening sessions be incorporated into the selection process. We recognize the challenges involved in the Chancellor search process, and we urge the Board of Regents to conduct a merit-based search without politicization. 

Sincerely,

Samuel Ellis (GT Undergraduate Student Body President)

GRA Stipend Amount,"Hi everyone, I've been searching all over for an answer to this question and I can't figure it out. I'm an incoming MS QCF (Quantitative and Computational Finance) student. From what I understand, this is considered a ""professional master's program"" and not an ""academic master's program,"" meaning that a graduate assistantship does not cover the full tuition amount (see [https://www.bursar.gatech.edu/student/tuition/fy20\_gra.pdf](https://www.bursar.gatech.edu/student/tuition/fy20_gra.pdf)). However, I'm not sure if that only applies to GTA/GRA positions within Scheller (where QCF is housed). For instance, if I'm a GRA for GTRI or a GTA for ISYE (I'm currently an undergrad TA for an ISYE class), will I receive the full tuition waiver plus the stipend? Or, since I'm a QCF student, will I only receive the reduced amount of tuition and not the full waiver no matter which position I take? Additionally, I know some GRA positions are only for 1/3 time instead of 1/2 time (13 hours versus 20 hours per week). Does that impact only the stipend or the tuition waiver as well?

Please be more respectful and open minded about different parts of Atlanta.,"This is a mild rant post but it‚Äôs just something I wanted to get off of my chest from different experiences I‚Äôve had speaking to people on and around GaTech.

I grew up in southwest Atlanta, near where 20 meets 285. I love my home and my community but i feel a gross elitism coming from people around midtown regarding the area. 

I hear people talk about south and southwest Atlanta is the absolute worst terms a lot. Sure, it‚Äôs more poor, it‚Äôs less well maintained compared to the manicured campus or midtown area. To say the quiet part out loud, it‚Äôs majority black and if you aren‚Äôt a part of that community, it can come off as other and be easy to look as somewhere ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt go‚Äù. But I‚Äôve heard it described as horrifically dangerous, when it‚Äôs not much worse than home park and half of it is nice little HOA suburbs. I once had someone say that anything west of northside was a ‚Äúbombed out wasteland‚Äù.

Think about how it feels being from there and hearing people who‚Äôve never set foot in your area talk like that. I felt ashamed of my home. And consider, that‚Äôs where many of the service and maintenance people who keep our campus beautiful live and call home. But also professors, students, admins, and plenty others too. There‚Äôs a reason the campus is less than 10% black in a city where that number is over 50%, it‚Äôs because a lot of people from my home feel more welcome at the big HBCUs or GSU than here.

It‚Äôs not perfect and we don‚Äôt need to pretend that Bankhead and buckhead are the same, but just be respectful when you are talking about someone else‚Äôs home and community.",1620148461,1,0

"Will I be dismissed Immediately? Please help, I am freaking out","So, I am on good standing currently. I have a 2.5 GPA and I am a junior. This is only my third semester at tech (I'm a transfer). My first semester, I got all Bs (12 credits). Last semester I got 2 Bs (6 credits), 1 C (3 credits), and 2 Ds (5 credits). 

Last semester was a pretty big blow for me, I had never gotten below a B in college before. I am perfectly fine with getting Cs now, especially due to the fact that I am at tech. But the most worrying thing is that I have none of the classes that I took at my last school to fall back on. 

This semester I took 17 credits... which was very very stupid of me. To add to that, I moved countries, my parents got a divorce, COVID happend, andmy mental health is at a very low point. So, I am now probably looking at 3 Cs (9 credits) and 2 Fs (8 credits). This would give me a semester GPA of 1.06 and an overall GPA of 1.93. I have already emailed my advisor, asking her if I will be dismissed automatically. But I wanted to ask all of you as well. 

So the question is, is there any possibility that I could be dismissed outright? Or would I have to be on probation, before getting dismissed? I dont mind academic warning or probation at all. I am truly only worried about being dismissed, and it is making me panic to the max. I can pick up my act, and bring my GPA up, but I dont know what I would do if I were dismissed.",1620053773,1,0

"I would like 1 full week to prepare for my finals, please.","Seriously, I am still doing homework assignments that were released during/immediately before the Final Instructional Days, and grades are due in less than 7 days. 

This is not a matter of time management, rather I (and many of my peers) are being, intentionally or not, blocked from studying for final exams due to impossible demands.

I really struggle to make a case for how this is conducive to my learning. 

Is there any student advocacy group trying to build support for just 1 protected week of studying for students? What exactly is the harm in having this? What is the reasoning in not?",1620048402,1,0

"To the girl who was hit in front of UHouse on Jan 13,2019","I was going through some old videos and came across my dash cam footage of a female Georgia Tech student being struck by a vehicle at the intersection of 8th and Spring on January 13,2019. I remember her saying she was a Georgia Tech student while waiting for the ambulance but never got her name. I just wanted to see if anyone knew her and could say if she was okay.

PSA: A Review of Paloma/Signature/Theory West Midtown,"This is a bit of a rant, but I hope it also serves as a warning for students who are considering off-campus housing near Georgia Tech. I've been staying at Paloma Midtown (formerly known as Theory West, then Signature Midtown) which is located at 800/808 Marietta St. NW. I can say with confidence that this is probably one of my worst experiences with leasing an apartment. Don't be misled by the glowy reviews on their Google Page. They provide incentives to residents to write positive reviews. I've listed some of the problems I've had with Paloma Midtown over the last year, in the hope that new students will be able make better decisions than I did.

Costs and Fees

* Fees get added to your monthly bill throughout the year without your consent
* Not a 12 month lease, but you will be paying 12 full installments
* Extremely high subletting fee: 85% of the monthly rent + $250 application fee for the new resident. 
* They are constantly mischarging people. I've had to call so many times to get the balance corrected and each time, ""the manager is not in ''. It takes at least two or three calls to get a simple mistake fixed.
* It‚Äôs actually quite difficult to find a summer sublease (granted it‚Äôs a pandemic year) despite what the leasing office will tell you when you first sign. You often will have to settle extremely discounted prices and cover most of the subleasing fees. 
* Overall cost break down from 8.15.20 - 4.30.21 in a standard 4x4 apartment assuming you are subleasing over the summer:: 9\*1200 (regular rent, yes, you pay 9 full months) + 250 (initial application/ background check) + 1020 (85% rent, subletting fee)  + 250 (application fee for your new resident) + \~ 3\* 300 (the amount you would cover for your subleaser if you rent out at 900/month, about the market average from what I can tell) = $13220. This is $1468/month for the 9 months that you will actually live there, significantly higher than the off-campus places in midtown and definitely more expensive than on-campus housing. If you need parking, that‚Äôs another 125/month and ,oh wait, electric surcharges happen pretty often too.

Communication

* There is no way to communicate with management besides calling, if they pick up. Front desk usually cannot resolve any issues, and when the manager is in, they never immediately help, always saying they‚Äôll ‚Äòcall back‚Äô with no response after. 
* Got rid of the community forum, so now any suggestion to management is weak without community support
* Change management twice in the same year, with no warning, and despite saying there would be no impact, they charge us a random service fee due to the switch to a new service provider, WITH NO WARNING FROM MANAGEMENT

Student Life

* Internet also goes out often and the fix time is slow. Pretty inconvenient for students who have work. Calling management will not resolve, as they close at 7, and every outage is late at night when assignments are due.
* The printer/gym/roof are inaccessible after 7 pm. For those who need to print after 7, you'll need to walk to campus
* Constant ear ringing beep in the lobby of the building that they haven't bothered to fix the entire year
* No sound-proofing for windows that are facing the street. I could not go through a meeting without the incessant noises of trucks and cars
* They advertise themselves as a secure location but I would strongly disagree. Half the time, the doors leading to the main stairwell are broken allowing for those who aren't staying in the apartments to walk in with no resistance.
* Even in the so-called secure bike room, there have been incidents of theft. My roommate had his bike stolen from the room and the apartment provided little support and investigating the crime

This is just the tip of the iceberg. For those who don't want to be a victim of student exploitation, I would strongly recommend against staying at Paloma Midtown till they get their act straight. Don't be misled by their fancy tours and showy attitudes. Once you live here, it's a completely different story.

I recognize that people have probably had legitimately positive experiences here, and I'm not discounting those. I just think that the overwhelming negatives of Paloma(Signature/Theory) Midtown make it one of the worst choices for student residence in Atlanta. If you are considering Paloma Midtown, make sure you thoroughly read through the contract so you don't make the same mistakes so many other students have done.

Feel free to comment any positives or negatives about the place. I think making people aware of predatory companies is crucial to ensuring a positive student life.",1620011598,1,0
Secret Menu at Blue Donkey??,"Hey everyone, I've been asking people all semester about this. I remember at some point vaguely being told there is a secret menu at blue donkey, but no one I ask seems to know anything about it. 

I'm 90% sure there is a secret menu, but I can't figure out how to go about figuring out what is on it. Is there some kind of cult ritual I got to go through?

"Need help! Might have to Withdraw from a course with a W, will it hurt me in any way??","1. So, the deadline to drop one of my classes was 4:00pm today. I had alot of difficulty getting into the system this morning, so I wasnt able to. I emailed a bunch of people to try and see if dropping a class without a W was still possible, so we will see what happens there. If anyone had any luck dropping a course after the deadline, please let me know how to do it.

.

2. More importantly though, I am wondering what would happen to my Hope scholarship if I withdrew from a course. I have not seen anything other than the fact that it will subtract from my allotted 120 credit hours. Are there any other repercutuons that I should worry about? I will still be full time. I currently have 17 hours, and plan on dropping a 4 credit hour course.

.

3. I am also worried about any other side effect there may be, due to me possibly withdrawing from this course with a W. I only have one other W on my transcript (a 2 credit course). Will this be an issue in the future? I am an Environmental Engineering major, and am not currently looking to go to graduate school (but it is still a possibility).

.

4. Is 17 credit hours (5 classes) too hard? I kind of struggled last semester, and I only had 14 credit hours. I feel like I might be more prepared now, but I'm not sure. I have survey of chem, oceanography, statistics and applications, differential equations and multivariable calculus.  If I drop/withdraw from any if these, it will be multivariable. So, do you recommend dropping this class at all? If push comes to shove, and I cannot drop this class without a W, then I will try to see if I can keep up with it.",1611353905,1,0
