Yeah, I don’t think it would go well in spicy ramen at all.  I can’t think of any time I ever saw sweet corn in spicy ramen.

&gt;	In japan they dont use carrots or sweet corn so I guess it makes sense that different countries add stuff to make it more palatable for the people in each country. Just never knew Americans put corn in ramen.

I’m pretty sure you’re right about the carrots, but as far as the corn is concerned, it’s very common in Japan, depending on the region.  You can check out places in NYC such as Tabata and Ippudo which make it in the traditional Japanese style, and both places have some bowls with corn.

"1. Go to lecture and think with the professor. Don't just passively hear what the professor is saying, think about the examples, try to go through the proofs and derivations yourself, etc. Take good notes, but don't focus on taking notes. Nobody cares about your notes. Focus on following the lecture. 

2. Actively think during study time. It's easy to trick yourself into thinking that you're ""studying"" when you're wasting time just staring at the homework (or even worse: relying on notes instead of your own mind for homework), mindlessly ""reading"" through text or notes, etc. You should spend as much time as possible actually testing and challenging your understanding, and as little time as possible ""reading"" or ""writing"" or highlighting, etc. 

3. Do as many practice problems as possible. I think there are some extra worksheets for calc 2? If so, work on those. Look through the textbook and find a problem that seems challenging to you. Work on it, then check your solution. If you mess up, great! Review the concepts and correct your misunderstandings. Do practice problems regularly-- don't wait until the exams to begin practicing. 

4. Notation matters. Something like ""x+2=0"" is a complete, English sentence. Namely, it states that ""The sum of some unknown value, named 'x', and two is equal to zero."" Mathematical symbols are just short-hands for English words or phrases, and we only use them because writing things out like I just did makes math even harder to understand (in fact, much of the notation we associate with math is actually relatively recent! The equals sign ('=') was introduced in the late 16th century). Don't use bad notation, it's just as bad as using the incorrect word to describe something or using terrible grammar. You will also get points off for it.",1568347012,1,0

"I've heard we're the biggest university this is rolling out to, and for some reason these issues were just never considered. I also have heard it is campus blind, which sounds good on paper, but totally fucks things up for places like the English department which is heavily resided on College Ave (specifically Murray hall). Seems a total disaster for everybody but the folks leading the effort to sell Infosilem. As a SWE, it's absolutely insane to me that a product like this could be so flawed. The automative needs are obvious -- having humans do this resolution is a disaster, and usually results in large delays. But to just cast a blind eye to these obvious use cases -- not even small, minute, hard-to-envision cases -- is just staggering. 

As for expanding the bus system -- until new roads are implemented (see 2030 master plan), additional busses will almost certainly just congest Route 18 more. I read a paper on it a few years back.

"Yikes, that all sounds awful. I'd heard negative things about Infosilem from my other professors but I appreciate the extensive detail you went to here to talk about stuff.

As for the specific plans, is there anything in the Rutgers 2030 plan to those lines? I remember skimming it and there was [a document](https://masterplan.rutgers.edu/files/rutgers-2030-volume-1-rutgers-university-new-brunswick-planning-contextpdf) in which problems were laid out, although I don't know of any specific goals per se.",1574590442,1,0
"The union filed an unfair labor practice lawsuit against the university. New Jersey state law mandates that scheduling is a subject that unions can bargain on and the union claims that the university has been unwilling to negotiate. So we shall see.

Infosilem is supposed to be rolled out for next fall. I can say that the initial Fall 2020 simulation for the Math Department was impossible to work with. For instance, 11 of the 29 lectures for Math 135 were scheduled in the same time slot, which means we would need to find 11 different full-time faculty who were both willing and able to teach in that specific time slot.

FYI, there are only 19 faculty members who teach the Math 135 lectures this semester. So 11 of those 19 would need to be willing and able to work during that time slot. I think it was an early morning time slot as well. Students would have loved that. One-third of the lectures in an early morning time slot.

There are other aspects of Infosilem that really just make you scratch your head. For instance, there are only three time blocks for each day: morning, afternoon, evening. Right now faculty typically give their preferences to their department based on periods. That is, I will fill out a survey that tells my boss ""I most prefer periods 2 -- 5, but cannot work periods 1 or 8."" With Infosilem, I would just have to give ""morning"", ""afternoon"", or ""evening"", and I think ""afternoon"" actually extended from 12:00pm to 6:00pm.

Basically Infosilem just moves around all of the courses and classrooms like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle and tries to make the ""most efficient"" fit, completely ignoring important considerations like faculty availability, faculty preferences, or student preferences. Some PTL's (part-time lecturers) teach at multiple universities, and would not be able to teach here with some of the schedules Infosilem was cranking out.

Infosilem also has no way of forcing some classes to stay in a block. For instance, this semester and next semester I teach two lectures, which are in back-to-back time slots, in the same classroom. Several other faculty have similar arrangements. The department purposely schedules such blocks of 2 lectures to make schedules easier and more appealing. Infosilem doesn't do that.

What is really ridiculous is that Infosilem can't even keep the recitations in blocks. For instance, for a particular Math 135 lecture, Infosilem would schedule the 3 associated recitations not in 3 back-to-back periods in the same classroom (or almost the same classroom) like we do now. Rather Infosilem would just place the 3 recitations in 3 random places throughout the week. So not only would the lecturer have 3 different PTL's or TA's to manage, but the 3 recitations would need to have different quizzes, different homework due dates, and possibly even cover different material since they all meet differently, relative to the main lecture. PTL's in the Math Department are also given blocks of 3 recitations because one block is 3 credits, and per their contract, they essentially work in blocks of 3 credits (there are exceptions). So with this scheduling where recitations are all over the place, a PTL may have to teach a block of 3 recitations, each on 3 different days and times. That simply does not work for PTL's who often have to teach at other institutions as well.

So yeah. I'm not really sure what will happen. The supposed ultimate reason for using Infosilem was to get more classes that are commonly taken together on the same campus, in an effort to reduce the demand for the overcrowded campus buses. I'm not sure the extent to which expanding the bus system was considered instead. I also don't know of any benchmarks they want to hit or what their goal is for how the buses are used. In fact, as far as I know, there are no such benchmarks.",1574588986,1,0

"What I realized about looking for jobs is that no one looks at your resume closely to decide whether you'd be a good fit for the job or not.

Companies don't care if you know 10+ programming languages because when they are recruiting for a certain position, they are probably looking for about 1-3 programming languages with multiple tools and frameworks, so you have to group different things onto your resume so that the keyword-search will bring up your resume.",1574581735,1,0

"Vitamin D deficiency may lead to symptoms of depression. This is important to know for the winter, because we are not exposed to a lot of sunlight, a lot of the time a factor to seasonal affective disorder. In the summer, my doctor told me that I have a vitamin D deficiency and now I take supplements for it. I recommend getting vitamin D from any store and taking it daily and in general it’s just good for you. If you’re not for medication or anything (if it is severe), i know there are a lot of herbs and natural supplements that people take instead that are known to help with depression, anxiety, even focus though I am not very knowledgeable of them. However, thought patterns are very important in terms of mental health. I don’t know what kind of therapy you go to, but I benefitted from DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) which focuses on teaching  skills to cope with problems and emotions and to acquire positive experiences, not just venting issues. Starting your morning fresh is always important. The simplest things count. Make your bed, eat a good breakfast, etc. Starting off your day right will help you create positive momentum to have a good rest of the day. Instead of scrolling through social media or using my phone, sometimes I like to sit in the moment and be mindful of my surroundings and myself, noting how I am feeling, how my body physically feels, and what is happening around me. Doing this grounds me and is a time where you are not thinking of any stress or responsibilities. Mindfulness, meditation, and breathing might seem trivial at first but if you do it consistently you will eventually feel how powerful it can be with grounding you. Write in a journal if you have negative or unhealthy thoughts, then write words that contradict these thoughts and are more rational, positive, and healthy. Having music on puts me in a good mood a lot too. Making it a point to always be kind to people in general made me realize the amount of beauty and good in the world and that there is no time for hate. I also highly recommend yoga.",1576719341,1,0

This was my first semester not doing a meal plan and it's honestly not that bad. You're way better off buying food from Panera or something on campus - you can easily get a full meal for half the price per swipe. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/cjk982/rutgers_dining_price_breakdown_20192020/) has a really good breakdown on the cost of each meal plan and how much each meal would be if you were to pay just to get in without a plan (spoiler alert: you're severly overpaying).,1576709805,1,0
Thank you I’m really nervous,1576709755,1,0
"For most people, if you’re not going to be eating dinner at the dining hall, it makes more sense to pay out of pocket. When you buy a small meal plan (as I imagine most commuters do), the price per meal is higher than the guest price (except for dinner). The only benefit to using ru express rather than a credit/debit card to pay for food is that it’s faster at the dining hall. When you pay with a credit card at the dining hall, it takes a lot longer and people may get annoyed behind you. When you use RU express at the dining hall, it’s as fast as if you are using a meal swipe.

If you will be eating mostly outside of the dining hall, you might as well just use a credit card and not tie the money up in RU express.",1576709752,1,0

maybe but that only helps if you can understand the notes. from my experience I learned mostly through the textbook which was good but time consuming and I didn't do enough practice problems or proofs.

"It's my understanding that calc 5 is more of a computational class as compared to 423, so grilling problems sounds ideal to me. 

Review every HW problem (and then some) until you can pretty much replicate the solutions. If there is a small peturbation in the problem, then you should be capable of adapting. This is how I got through 423, which was - by far - the hardest class I've taken at Rutgers. If you're serious about it, then get supplementary materials. We used Strauss and I think Habermann(?). 

Between the two books, I felt very comfortable with all things heat/wave equation, Fourier, and orthogonality after committing a lot of time to reading and problems.",1573583935,1,0

1st paragraph:
Introduce the background/context of the topic; come up with your thesis.

2nd &amp; 3rd &amp; 4rd...:
Transition sentence or phrase, along with argument to be the first sentence.
Followed by supporting materials such as analysis, citation....
Transition sentence for the next paragraph.

Last paragraph: summarize what I put in the paper, and circle back to the thesis.

When I have no idea of the topic, I normally search Google Scholar and cite more papers. Then say something based on those citations. But I only cite sentence in article’s abstract (I don’t want to read the paper and abstract is informative enough), so that I can easily put the page number of the first page in the citation.
