Differences between Bio and Chem majors,"Hi, I am currently a transfer applying to UCI. But I was just wondering, what are the differences between 2 majors in terms of workload and difficulty. I am trying to be a PA in the future, so will 1 major help me more in the long run? On a slightly different note, what's the difference between the School of Biological Sciences and School of Physical Sciences? Like does one school provide more help and opportunities for research/internships than the other?",1602050977,1,0
Does anyone know where I can print something on Campus?,"I’m taking a foreign language class and my teacher wants us to print out pages to practice our alphabet writing skills so we need to print out pages and do the work then scan and upload to canvas. I don’t have a printer and nobody else I knows has one, I would usually go to soar but I’m pretty sure they’re closed. I don’t need a scanner because I have an app that does that on my phone. So does anyone know where I can print on campus currently? Tbh an ipad with an Apple Pencil would be really helpful right now lol so that’s something I need to look into possibly.",1602049537,1,0
Does residing Internationally affect FinAid?,"I receive Financial Aid at UCI for 2020-2021. In summer, my family and I went to China. And now because of coronavirus, my parents do not want me to go back to the U.S. for this academic year unless the school requires in-person learning in Winter.

How do you do the readings?,"Hi! A frustrated freshman anteater here.

I'm taking a (supposedly) very easy intro class right now, but it took 6 hrs today to just do the readings before the class tomorrow and yet I wasn't able to finish it today.

It was a typical textbook-sized textbook, and I was supposed to read only 40 pages, but I don't know why it took me so long and why it's so hard to take good notes. I think I'm writing too much from the textbook, but then I'm also not sure what is the key point and what is not, or what the prof is gonna put on the quiz or not. Or else I'm just terribly inefficient when taking notes -- or maybe I am a terribly slow reader.

Especially those who are in Humanities or Social Sciences, how do you do the readings? How long are your usual notes? How long do you take on readings and what do you usually write down? 

I really thought I would like my major and the ways of thinking involved in it, but even the first day reading makes me feel too frustrated that I actually maybe can't comprehend anything from the major. Any advice would help me a lot. Thanks in advance!

(Some will say not to do the readings because the grade is managable without readings, but I just want to make sure to have a good, efficient study habit before jumping into other classes.)",1601968318,1,0

UCI for Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering: is it worth it? (Read description),"CCC student here, trying to transfer out by 2022.

Cal Poly and the CSU wants me to take a Speech class which doesn’t fulfill general ed for the UC. I’m pretty much taking the maximum amount of credits allowed per semester and I really don’t want to have to take it.

I’m thinking of just applying to UCI, UCSD, and USC because they don’t have many requirements to transfer for Mech. So how is the Mech program at UCI? Do they give good opportunities in terms of like career fairs and internship and research opportunities? Is it at all hands-on or does it tend to be more theoretical?

Ignorance at UCI,"
I’ve been reading a lot of stuff online that students at UCI are posting and I feel it’s very ignorant. Hear me out, I keep seeing activism posts on a lot of stories on instagram which is awesome but then there are some people who post stuff like “All cops are bastards” and “if you’re not going to protests, you’re the oppressor” and while I can vaguely understand the sentiment, i feel it’s very harsh to say that without understanding people’s circumstances. These people, in my opinion, are privileged to even say something like that without thinking about people who can’t afford expensive covid treatments or have family problems/ members who are of old age or other problems in their lives that are more important to deal with such as housing/food insecurity etc.

Being a liberal myself, I feel that some people are overdoing it to an extent that they’re coming off as very intolerant and aggressive. The language they use is meant to hurt people and not to stimulate intellectually stimulating conversations. What I have seen in my friends, who can be very ignorant at times, is that they don’t really know much about the economic and political repercussions of what they’re saying rather they’re just saying it to virtue signal. For example, some people were saying during the rapid attention to BLM that burning buildings and supermarkets is the right thing to do and peaceful protests are useless or saying that the police needs to be abolished but when asking them how we’re going to deal with that and what the plan is moving forward, they don’t have an answer. 

Don’t get me wrong, a lot of people are willing to listen to the other point of view, are willing to have a proper discussion and are actually informed about the matter they’re talking about but then there are a lot of people who don’t necessarily want to learn or have a conversation, don’t have any facts, and want to create more divide ( which is what the politicians want you to do btw). What upsets me is the lack of information people have compared to the big ideas they’re throwing around.

At the end of the day, I have respect for most of them as well since what they’re doing makes sense to me but I don’t appreciate HOW they’re doing it. Thank you for reading all my stuff, If you want to reply to me, you’re more than welcome to. I’m willing to get more input on this and maybe understand the other side as well!",1601858894,1,0

For example, some people were saying during the rapid attention to BLM that burning buildings and supermarkets is the right thing to do or saying that the police needs to be abolished but when asking them how we’re going to deal with that, they don’t have an answer. 

Don’t get me wrong, a lot of people are willing to listen to the other point of view, are willing to have a proper discussion and are actually informed about the matter they’re talking about but then there are a lot of people who don’t necessarily want to learn or have a conversation, don’t have any facts, and want to create more divide ( which is what the politicians want you to do btw). 

At the end of the day, I have respect for most of them as well since what they’re doing makes sense to me but I don’t appreciate HOW they’re doing it.

Ignorant people at UCI,"I’ve been reading a lot of stuff online that students at UCI are posting and I feel it’s very ignorant. Hear me out, I keep seeing activism posts on a lot of stories on instagram which is awesome but then there are some people who post stuff like “All cops are bastards” and “if you’re not going to protests, you’re the oppressor” and while I can vaguely understand the sentiment, i feel it’s very harsh to say that without understanding people’s circumstances. These people, in my opinion, are privileged to even say something like that without thinking about people who can’t afford expensive covid treatments or have family problems/ members who are of old age or other problems in their lives that are more important to deal with such as housing/food insecurity etc.

Being a liberal myself, I feel that some people are overdoing it to an extent that they’re coming off as very intolerant and aggressive. The language they use is meant to hurt people and not to stimulate intellectually stimulating conversations. What I have seen in my friends, who can be very ignorant at times, is that they don’t really know much about the economic and political repercussions of what they’re saying rather they’re just saying it to virtue signal.

Best way to make rice in dorm? Other easy meals to make?,"I don’t eat rice that much so I don’t really see the need to buy a rice cooker (we only have a big one at home so I’d have to buy a smaller one if I wanted one). We have this microwaveable rice cooker but it takes 20 minutes, which I think is an insane amount of time to be hogging the shared microwave. I’m bringing a pot for other food so I was just thinking of making rice on the stove when I want to, but I’m scared I’ll take up too much time since I know contact in common areas should be restricted and I want other people to be able to use the kitchen.

So... what should I do? Even those “ready rice” packs that you stick in the microwave can take a while.

"(PSA, I guess) Some thoughts on parties","In light of the ""[Parties near campus](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/ir5flx/parties_near_campus/)"" post, I thought I'd share some thoughts on the matter.

To start, I'm going to skip the obvious ""think of your peers and community"" point, because if you're throwing a party, you probably don't really care whether or not your actions affect your community. I will drop [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/us/college-campus-outbreak-covid.html) though (use the UCI VPN to make an NYT account and view NYT articles, if you didn't already know. This particular article might be open to all, as I just realized I'm not on the VPN). There are several colleges who test regularly and require masks on-campus and all, but they're still having outbreaks that spread out of the campus community and into the general town community.

To the topic at hand now. Over Labor Day weekend, a group of Miami University students held a [presumably all-COVID house party](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/11/us/miami-university-student-party-covid-trnd/index.html). It seems like it'd fine, right? Everyone has COVID, thus no one is in danger. Except that might not be the case. I want to bring [viral load](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/sars-cov-2-viral-load-and-the-severity-of-covid-19/) to your attention. Basically, there's preliminary evidence that suggests that the more virus you have in your system, the more severe your symptoms will be. There's also evidence to suggest this isn't the case: we need more analysis and data. [Evidence suggests that many who test positive using a PCR test (what we'll be using at UCI) have very little virus in them](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html). Could this be why people are asymptomatic? I'm not sure. Since we don't test enough people and focus testing on people with symptoms, we'll probably never know. And if you do develop symptoms, you probably won't die. But the [potential side effects](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351) read out like a TV prescription medicine ad: permanent/long-lasting heart, liver, brain (!), lung, kidney damage. Do you want to take that chance?

In short, if you're not going to be considerate of the people in your community, be selfish and protect yourself.

EDIT: With regards to the house party article: ""The police report indicates that the sixth person identified himself as a student who had moved in with his parents and was visiting for the  weekend."" Take this stuff seriously, people. We don't know all the context, BUT IT DOESN'T matter. Even *if* the student's parents had COVID before, [immunity doesn't last forever](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-long-does-immunity-last-after-covid-19-what-we-know) and lingers for varying amounts of time: we have even confirmed that one can be re-infected with [our own stateside reinfection case](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-reinfection-case-confirmed-us.html).",1599928825,123,1

"I've somehow will manage to fulfill ""requirements"" for FOUR majors in four years","\* Preface this by saying I am a business economics and psychology major with a minor in statistics\*

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so hear me out, not saying I will graduate with quad majors. BUT if I take an upper div econ writing class, then I will have fulfilled major requirements for economics, business, economics, quantitative economics, and psychology. Business economics major reqs covers all of economics major reqs. And business economics major plus a statistics minor covers quantitative econ major.

Because a lot of the classes overlap. The reason why this won't work out is that there are a few classes that are specialized for the major (such as econ 123a for quant. econ majors vs 122a for bus econ majors) that although OVERLAP with one another according to the catalog, I'm sure UCI won't recognize them as substitutions for one another. Even though they technically overlap, the actual course material is a little BIT different. Other ones are the 100 (bus econ/ econ) and the 105 (quant econ) series. They ""overlap"". 

But yeah, thought this was pretty cool. Just telling your grandkids you should've gotten four majors but UCI wouldn't let you.",1599903618,1,0

So I know personally I was anxious because I heard the deep nasal swab test hurts a lot and we have to get tested often so I was kinda scared. The person I spoke to said that the deep nasal swab will not be the test UCI housing residents will be taking. She explained that we will get swabs and have fo swab our nostrils not the back of the throat. Personally I thought this was kinda a relief because a nostril swab doesn’t sound that bad but the deep nasal swab scared me. So if you were wondering like me then here’s the answer :)),1599819640,1,0

I am also thinking to go into the Statistics-related field but not necessarily a Stats major. I know both Cog Sci and Data Sci provides statistics courses as well, and I was wondering how both majors differ in terms of using Stats and learning about Stats-related works.

So i am a Business info major and i was looking at the double major restrictions and one of is bussiness administration, which sort of makes sense since they are nearly identical in both their lower and uppder divison requirment, the business info mngmt and bus admin with informatics emphasis are nearly identical

But if i finished my business info major, could i apply the following semster for business admin and get in? It be nice to get an extra degree with more indepth knowledge with business admin and it would literally be a free degree bascially since id only have like half a semster there.

OR is it that after you complete one of the restircted majors you cannot complete the other major.

Surfer Dama Guy Update,"Just wanted to give everyone that is affiliated with UCI, an update about that Surfer Dama Guy, because people who attend the school deserve to know. His name is Ahmad Abassi and he is an absolute danger to the community. He was recently arrested for assault with a deadly weapon, as he fired multiple shots at a man in Dana Point. Before this, he would stalk women around Irvine (even goes to admit that much on his instagram). Even before this he had assaulted someone and apparently was arrested for having a loaded gun at UC San Diego. This is not someone you want around your friends, your children and fellow students at UC Irvine. Please warn your community and be vigilant of this individual if/when he is released back into society. It blows my mind that UCI officials let this man prey upon their students.

"Former community college students, I need your advice."," Hey guys. I'm a community college student (diablo valley college) looking to transfer to UC Irvine for fall 2021.  I emailed UCI admissions two weeks ago about this same question and they still haven't gotten back to me :/ so i'm asking here. 

The major that I will be applying for is Informatics. For the major prep (according to assist.org) they require 4 programming classes. I have 2 completed, but I had to drop the 3rd programming class this semester for various reasons (leaving a 'W' in transcript). This is leaving me to retake and take the last 2 programming classes together during the spring semester 2021. 

That being said, do you think UCI would still give me a chance given that I dropped a major prep class in the fall? (I heard UC's only look at grades until fall  semester prior  to transfer so I'm pretty worried). I would like some advice from anyone especially those of you who have transferred from a community college. Thank you!",1603849895,1,0

Planning a Petr drop!,"Hey guys! I've decided to do a sticker drop sometime in the coming weeks.

There are a lot of things to work out still, but so far the preliminary plan is to distribute stickers in-person on campus **as well as online** where you can send your mailing info and I'll hand-mail each sticker individually. I've ordered a little under 50 stickers in total for this first round. Unfortunately, mailing them individually more than doubles the cost per sticker, so I plan on distributing more of them in person.

To keep in line with health precautions for in-person distribution, I was thinking of doing something like **4-8 smaller separate drops** at different locations on campus at different times. Maybe I'll pump everyone hand sanitizer or something before I hand them the sticker. A friend suggested doing them near [monitored student testing sites](https://uci.edu/coronavirus/students/testing.php) to deter large crowds from gathering, but I'm not sure if that'd be allowed.

Lastly, I'm hoping to get some availability data from people so I can make more informed decisions on when to do in-person drops. If you're willing, I'd like to ask that you please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNNYjGsFWzbYoyxHGT6oFVw2uNTZqKa1b4nqkrqbVRYrq2zw/viewform?usp=sf_link) sometime to help me with this.

Laptop Recommendations (Bio Major),"Hi everyone. As the title states, I'm a 2nd year Bio Sci major looking for laptop recommendations. I currently have an HP Pavilion x360, and its honestly been one of my favorite laptops yet because of the touch screen ability and 2-in-1 tablet mode feature.

I have had it for almost 4 years now, but just recently, have been having a lot of battery problems. I have already exchanged the battery twice, once in January of this year, and again in September, largely due to the fact that I use it twice as much as before because of online classes. As it has been more financially affordable on my end to just exchange the battery, it seems like I am going to have battery problems again among other things, as I noticed my computer acting weird again over the weekend. 

Although its still in good shape and functions normally except for some instances, I wanted to start some preliminary research by looking into laptops in case mine stops working for any reason. I just thought I would ask here, as I am not the most tech savvy person. If worst comes to worst, I would ideally go to a tech store and ask someone there lol.

Schoodule,"Hey Anteaters!

I've been working on a small project, Schoodule, to help with my workflow for classes and coursework. 

It's a desktop website that serves as a scheduling tool specifically made for students.

This tool provides one location to view all bits of information regarding any course or event that you decide to schedule. You can store and find any:

* Links
* Emails
* Professors/TAs
* Office Hours
* Discussion/Labs
* Important Exam Dates

Each course/event also comes with an included to-do list for those who like to stay extra organized!

I've been using this tool for the last couple of weeks and I've found it very useful-- especially since classes are all online anyway. So, I decided to launch a small beta version for anyone who might be interested in Schoodule.

You can access it at myschoodule.com!Also, if you have any feedback or ideas for improvement, feel free to send it through the feedback section of the website! :)

And lastly another question that I had was where can I find info on classes and what GEs the fulfill.

Math 2 series and Physics 7 series review,"Hi all, I am a second year student and have finished Math 2B/D/E and Physics 7(L)C/(L)D/E and wanted to leave a moderately in depth review of these courses to help anyone planning on taking these classes. A small disclaimer: I am not that smart, but I do work really hard and have always had a strong foundation in math which is largely attributed to by successes in these courses. I will list professors with first name followed by last initial and keep them as neutral as possible. I will also list the YouTube resources I used at the bottom as well. TLDR at bottom too.  

Labs: Physics 7LC/LD  are super easy courses, just show up, try to *understand* the tutorials rather than just go through them and you should be fine. The final exam was just recycled questions from the lab workbook so if you are comfortable with those the class should be a breeze (90% lab participation-not correctness or completion-10% final) **Grade for both: A+** 

&amp;#x200B;

Physics 7C: Professor Juan O.  

So I took AP Physics 1 (4) and AP Physics C Mechanics (5) in high school and had good knowledge in the concepts. The class was a mechanics course and covered kinematics, rotational motion, momentum, energy, gravitation. Tbh, I attended lectures maybe once or twice since I was comfortable with the material and got an A on the midterm and then I got cocky and absolutely bombed the final (73%, average was around 85%). The few times I attended lecture, the professor was excellent and very receptive. He lead some interesting in-class experiments and was always accessible to answer questions. As with all physics classes, it is math intensive, but even moreso you should know when to apply each formula. DO AS MANY PROBLEMS AS YOU CAN. The difficulty of midterm and final questions are very similar to discussion questions, but being comfortable with a large variety of textbook problems will be your best friend. Very small curve because of high averages but I don't really know if it helped me or not. **Grade: B+ (88%)** 

&amp;#x200B;

Physics 7D: Professor (?) Arianna B. (SS1)

The instructor was a grad student and was very nice. I'd say this was the easiest of the physics series (at least for me) because the concepts connected with each other in a way the others did not. The course focused on electricity and magnetism and each and every topic built up on the last. If you struggled with understanding electricity, you will for sure struggle with magnetism since they are so linked. In my experience, the lab for this course helped a lot more than the lab with 7C because a visual representation of the equations made much more sense than seeing them presented. We needed to know a bit of calculus-specifically line integrals for deriving equations for Gauss' Law. I think the biggest challenge people faced was recognizing the different types of circuits, and when to use which equation as they were extremely easy to mix up.  The other thing was the integration part, I personally struggled a lot with this too as I found it pretty hard to visualize what area or line I was integrating over. Our exams were both very fair and I got A's on both. We had a 1% curve (92 was an A instead of 93.5).  **Grade: A (94%)**

&amp;#x200B;

Physics 7E: Professor Phil C. (SS2)

So this class is in online format by nature, I don't think COVID affected it much save for maybe the Respondus exams instead of in person. The course covers fluid mechanics, transversal and longitudinal waves, optics, diffraction, interference. While I did well, I found this kinda hard because the topics were pretty disconnected. DO NOT TAKE THIS SPECIFIC CLASS IF YOU CAN'T MANAGE YOUR TIME. He warns you early on that this will eat up like 20-30 hours of time every week but you really don't understand as you go through the grind. Every day, there is WebAssign due (5-10 questions with parts), textbook lesson (length varies), and a mandatory 40 minute lecture meant to supplement the reading. I'll be honest, I didn't really watch the lectures and just played them muted, but I don't recommend this because there is relevant content and I was just lazy. At the end of each week, there is a weekly 30 minute quiz (5 total 1 per week, lowest score dropped). Grade breakdown was: 30% quiz, 30% final, 20% lecture, 20% WebAssign. Communication was primarily done through Piazza forums. The reason this class was so hard was because of the sheer amount of work that caused unnecessary stress. I didn't find the quizzes too difficult, but there's no partial credit and only 3 questions so if you fuck up once, it's a significant chunk of your grade. I was fortunate to have done well, which I attribute to doing hundreds of textbook problems every week. Seriously, there is no amount of problems that are enough for practice. Each quiz had the chance of having a challenge question, which was stupid because it was pretty unfair if you got stuck with it and didn't know how to answer it. However, the Professor does provide a number of resources so you can prepare well, just really get your equation management down and understand the physical situation you're in. Always draw your picture as well. There is no exam curve at all, but the grades are curved such that an A- is an 85%, B- 75% etc. I found the final very fair and had plenty of time to finish. General tips for 7E are to read each question thoroughly and check your units; seriously it's amazing how many people just skim and ignore the small parts, it will cost you. Also understand the situation of each equation because they do differ. **Grade: A (94%)** 

Math 2A/B: Professor Nathan K. 

I didn't take 2A since I got a 5 on AP Calc AB, but I did take 2B. 2B starts off with a lot of different and situational integration techniques so really focus on recognizing the situations, in fact this is a common theme throughout all math. I heard that this class is one of the most failed classes at UCI, but I don't really know why. The back half of the course goes a bit more into conceptual math with stuff about sequences. Overall a very integration heavy course. The exams were extremely fair and there are tons of external resources to practice with. This one's kinda short because there's not much to say, but as always: practice practice practice. I'm sure there was a curve but I don't know how it affected me. **Grade: A+ (97%) (pre-curve)**

&amp;#x200B;

Math 2D: Professor Yimin Z.

The first COVID Math course I took. This is multivariable calculus part 1, and is by far the hardest math class I have taken at UCI. The first half covers the basics of vectors as well as lines and planes (dot product, cross product, etc.) and also polar coordinate systems and the related derivative and integral techniques. The second half was about partial derivatives and started on double integrals and a little bit of triple integrals. I found the second half way easier than the first. There are a list of suggested problems with each class, but I binged all of the textbook problems and I think this helped me a lot in doing well. The lectures we had were a bit long but definitely in depth and covered all of the necessary material and the professor and TA were ready to answer any questions quickly. The 2 midterms were extremely difficult since they were open notes and had a strict time constraint so referring to your notes was very difficult without sacrificing a lot of time. The final was a bit easier but made optional due to the riots and I took it anyways just in case. The averages were poor across the board, but I did relatively well thanks to good preparation (75% compared to 50%, 85% to 70%, and 94% to 50%). I didn't miss a point on the quizzes since I was well prepared, even though they were open notes there was a strict time crunch of 30 minutes. In all, I think that this class made me put in the most work, especially because of the disconnect between the front and back halves of the class. **Grade: A- (92%) pre-curve, A+ (???) post-curve**

Math 2E: Professor Lingrui G. 

Multivariable part 2. This is the easiest math course I've taken at UCI. I think my classmates would also agree that the professor was extremely reasonable in his policies and exam difficulties and time constraints. As for content, it's basically situational integration (different integration techniques) as well a few of the nuances of math, and covered 2 chapters. The discussion was absolutely useless and I felt like I knew more than the TA. Lectures were great, taught all that we needed to know. Quizzes and exams were both easy as well. Honestly, I feel like I got lucky with this course since we went over the bare minimum of cases and didn't have to have ridiculously in depth knowledge of each concept. **Grade: A+ (99%)** 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: In case it wasn't clear: PRACTICE YOUR ASS OFF. THE MORE PROBLEMS THE BETTER, THERE IS NEVER ENOUGH. This is the key to success in every math and physics class as they will help you gain an understanding the of the situation you are working with. For physics specifically: DRAW THE FUCKING PICTURE AND READ THE QUESTION. As I mentioned, so many people don't read the whole question and just assume they know what's being asked, but this often leads to missing out on simple things like the units (cm instead vs m) or medium (air vs water). Seriously, it'll take like 2 or 3 seconds max, and its for your understanding. 

Resources: 

For math, I didn't use a lot, but Professor Leonard is really good, Professor Peyam (also has a great public UCI website with plenty of practice exams). Peyam's YouTube is also catered for UCI classes and are short and easy to follow. 

For physics, Organic Chemistry Tutor is excellent, Bozeman Science, Khan Academy. 

Finally, you can go to the old eee website and search for a class, click on all quarters, and there is a treasure trove of practice exams and shit. 

If you made it to the end, thanks for reading! I hope this helped someone at least a little bit. Good luck on the upcoming quarter!",1600838602,1,0

question about CARES grant substantiation,"So the CARES tech grant says we should be able to prove where the money from this grant went to: (https://i.imgur.com/fuk47s8.png) including travel, housing, medical expense, tech, etc.

Bank statements, receipts and the like, not really a big issue. But does this mean that if they do ask us to substantiate our purchases, that if someone buys a scooter or something during the quarter, that they'd be breaking the grant's clause? In other words, would it mean anyone who gets the grant needs to make zero unnecessary purchases? Since you can't really distinguish your own money and money from the grant once it goes into a bank account.",1600834873,1,0

CS to Data Sci,"I'm a 4th year cs student at UCI and I want to switch my major to data sci cause I just can't do cs anymore.

What are the chances of me being denied into data sci major?? If I get denied into the major I have no idea what I'm gonna do.. 

Also I already took stats 67 because it was required for cs and I found out data sci majors have to take stats 7. But on the schedule of classes page it says ""No credit is given for Stats 7 if taken concurrently with or after Stats 8, Stats 67, or Mgmt 7"". Does this mean I'm not gonna get credit if I switch my major to data sci and take stats 7? But I would still have to take the class because stats 7 is a pre-req for most of the upper div classes right? Does anyone know how this works??

COVID beat any remaining hope or motivation I had out of me,"I’m a transfer student entering my senior year this quarter. I worked hard and maintained a high GPA consistently since I’ve started, and am currently working on an ongoing project for honors. I was never a good student so being able to make this much progress meant a lot to me, but the financial and social stressors that have emerged from this country’s response to COVID have left me unable to focus. I can’t get myself to do any of the work anymore, and it sucks knowing everything I put in can be ruined because of this quarter. 

My mother lost her job and my dad is at retirement age but working at a company that treats him awfully just to help us get by. I feel really guilty continuing school and have debated taking a quarter off to work. If I did it would set me back, and I’m not sure if I would be able to complete the honors program. I see a lot of people applying for graduate school, and I’ve been told I need to plan for next year. I don’t want to plan anything, I’m tired. Prior to COVID I worked weekends, summers and holiday breaks in addition to a full course load. Now that I’m unemployed, I have less of a workload but my parents ask me to help them handle unemployment, mortgage, insurance etc. I’m pretty much on call and it’s adding even more stress.

Easy GE 2 classes for Winter 2021,"Hi so I am a sociology major.

I am planning on taking Humanities Core 1BES (taking this instead of 1B only bc i like the teacher) and Soc 3 with Polletta. 

I was originally thinking Chem1A but uhh you need like some pre-requisites which I don't have... but I would need to take chem now so I can be on track for med school. Again, still unsure if pre-med is feasible for my future in academia.

Also, my advisor recommended I take another sociology course next quarter so what are some easy and interesting ones?

This happened a while ago I believed and I did as it stated to do under Preferences in my Settings as there was an ""Allow"" button to click. But now there is no button in my Preferences and this pop-up is becoming annoying and repetitive. I'm just worried that by next quarter I'll need to fix this and won't be able to access the VPN for homework and such.

My question is: for those of you that have taken these courses, separately or together, do you think taking these at the same time is going to make either grade suffer due to the nature of the class?

"A Detailed Response to ""ASUCIWatchDog's"" Post","[The post I'm referencing](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/k6xqr9/asuci_senate_raises_their_own_pay_by_366/)

Good evening (morning?) everyone! As promised, I am posting a response to the ""corruption"" allegation brought forth in a previous Reddit post. I'll start by saying my name is Yoseph Ghazal, and I am one of this year's At Large Senators and ran with Anteaters United. I will try to respond to all the arguments made in the mentioned post, however if I miss anything or if you have more questions, you can: respond to this post, send me a direct message to this Reddit account, or come to my office hours which are from 7:30-9pm every Tuesday.

**Disclaimer:** The information and opinions I'm posting reflects my views alone. I am not speaking on behalf of other Senators, although I'm sure many others hold similar sentiments that I have.

**Point 1:** Differentiating all the budgets

Lots of budgets and timelines are being thrown around, so I will clarify which budget applies to what.

* [2019-2020 Budget](https://internal.studentgov.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/formidable/35/final-proposed-budget-19-20.pdf): Last school year's budget, created by the infamous Friends of Peter Senate
* [Proposed 2020-2021 Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1847ov3A0yjcwA9e4oumuq2fMxqXN1hKJCS3lu80oMXg/edit#gid=0): Created on May 26th, 2020 and was proposed by the Friends of Peter during last school year's senate with slashed salaries
* [Current Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jlPjeSH1355QSeXn1J0Cs_FlyziItYFDwClJiWIOFas/edit#gid=0): This is the one criticized in the previous post and passed on December 3rd, 2020

The post kept referring to the Proposed 2020-2021 Budget as ""old budget"", which is dishonest because the user makes it seem like this ""old budget"" was how things always were in ASUCI. In reality, that referenced budget had many pay cuts to all positions. Just compare 2019-2020 Budget to Proposed 2020-2021 Budget.

**Point 2:** Questioning the intentions of the ""ASUCIWatchDog"" account

This point is somewhat irrelevant so you can skip this part if you like, as it is a bit of a stretch. The account has been around for at least 18 days, and has failed to report anything from ASUCI until today. To be blunt, I believe the account was created by the [**recently impeached**](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/senate/legislation/print/?legislation_number=R56-51) Chief Justice of the Judicial Board (the website says the legislation has failed but that isn't actually the case). I will not say their name, but it is easy to look them up. The reason I say this is because they have not called out the Judicial Board's obstructions (explained more below) at all despite supposedly being a watchdog account in its 18 day presence. In addition, they left a quote at the end of their post stating, ""***Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely"" - Lord Acton*** . Leaving quotes in italics unprompted is something the former Chief Justice does often as can be seen on the [ASUCI website.](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/judicial/judicial-board/) Lastly, the post failed to mention how the old 2020-2021 budget gave the Judicial Board an increase of $11924 from the 2019-2020 budget. Again, this is a bit of a stretch but the fact that the user never mentions the most controversial group (Judicial Board) in ASUCI this school year leads me to believe that the former Chief Justice is ""ASUCIWatchDog."" Nonetheless, they still bring up points that need to be addressed regardless of who made the original post.

**Point 3:** The Actual Numbers for Stipend Increases

I want to start by saying my personal opinion: I am not a fan of any stipend increases at all. I also plan to withdraw from receiving a stipend for the remaining two quarters (we as Senators have only received $33 for Fall Quarter). It is true that the new current budget has some pay increases, although the ASUCIWatchDog makes the increase more drastic than it actually is. In the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/k6xqr9/asuci_senate_raises_their_own_pay_by_366/), the user makes a chart in attempt to make a claim that the salaries were drastically increased. Below is the actual chart, for context I included the 2013-2014 Budget so everyone can see how the budget has always been for years.

I am registering for my classes on December 8, and I was wondering for winter quarter, if anyone has any suggestions for classes to take.

"Kicked from CogSci, am I screwed question mark","I was kicked from cogsci after getting a C in PSYCH 9A the first quarter :| (up-divs all A tho :|). I was told it's impossible to get back and was transferred to PSYCH BA. Now I'm a sophomore, a quarter away from finishing the major, and a year from finishing the degree, presumably. 

So I'm reevaluating my career options and concluded that I'm still most likely interested in the brain-tech field, either in companies like Neuralink or strong AI research. However, to my knowledge these are some really hardcore fields so PSYCH16@series with basic coding are most likely not gonna make me competitive enough.

It'd be really really helpful if someone currently in the similar field or on the similar path can share their insights on how people are presenting themselves in the area, and how to actually bridge on to specific career options. 

I'm also curious if there's any minor that could be an effective plus? Participating in research is also a thing I heard about a lot but I have no idea where to begin, especially now that I'm unable to be on campus.",1607057295,1,0

a little rant,"first off, i hope that everyone is doing well during quarantine and taking care of themselves! the lack of socialization is really rough, and to be honest, im still adjusting. 

ANYWAYS..... i kind of just wanted to express my disappointment with how some fellow anteaters are handling covid, particularly g\*\*\*k communities. one of my new housemates recently rushed a sorority and has being going out to meet other girls, and posting all these sorority related ""small"" hangouts/get-togethers on snapchat and instagram. mind you, there are usually &gt;5 people, no masks, no social distancing, and consist of people from different households. even though ppl living on campus are regularly getting tested, ppl living off campus are not required to (i.e ppl living in utc, newport, etc). mixing different households together is not very safe, especially when, \*not everyone\* is being tested regularly :( these same small hangouts are one of the most common ways covid outbreaks begin!

i totally understand the need to want to socialize, and i believe with proper social distancing, mask usage, and trying to stay outside instead of an indoor area, socializing with other people is great! as long as the proper precautions are being taken! but i came back to my apt one time and had like 5? ppl i didnt know in my living room, and was so shocked that 1. my housemate was willing to invite them over, and 2. the ppl invited over did not see an issue with it. in her defense, she is a transfer, and so i understand how lonely it is to be in a new community during a pandemic! i am non-confrontational, and so in the moment that i realized there were other ppl in my apt, i didnt confront/say anything to her about it (but if it happens again ill def bring it up). 

i just cant help feeling like im the only person going paranoid? its just hard for me to comprehend how some people dont understand that these same actions and mindsets are one of the many reasons why we are still in a pandemic. its just sad to see peers that are acting recklessly during covid in that ignorance is bliss mindset :/

if you made it down here, thanks for reading!!!! i hope you all are staying safe during this odd period in our lives. we are all in this together, and hopefully this will all be over soon. happy week 3, and take care &lt;3333",1602985514,1,0

I’m writing this because I need to sublease my spot in a 2b/1b ASAP due to my financial situation. hopefully I can help someone who needs a place to stay :)

it’s an all womxn apartment, 2 people are living here right now (all full time UCI students). you and one person will share a double and the other one has their own room, and there is plenty of space within the apartment surprisingly. It’s located on 2nd floor so no loud stomping from upstairs neighbors. Next door neighbor is a working professional so it’s always quiet. Trash and laundry room is less than 10 secs of walking away. Anteater Express bus stop is right next to the apartment complex, and across the street is Wholesome choice, Class 302, Subway, Rite Aid, Carl’s... 

-

because reddit is lil sketchy I’ll not post my info publicly but if anyone is interested please shoot me a message and I’ll reply ASAP. I have photos of the apartment and floor plan available. We’re looking for a third roomie (preferably womxn) to move in ASAP. 

Monthly rent + utilities should not go over 620/month :O (which is p good imo wao) 

Rent for October is paid already :) 

Lease ends 9/2021.

Lost,"Hi guys I just need to vent.

I am currently a senior as CS major at UCI. However, I don't think CS is the right major for me. I've had this thought for quite a while now, but I've been just grinding it out because I'm afraid of letting my parents down. However, I think I'm at a point where I can't do this anymore. Just the thought of coding makes me depressed and idk how I would code for the rest of my life without having bad thoughts. I am already 2-3 years older than my friends from my class, and I feel like I've accomplished nothing. Basically all my friends from hs graduated, all my friends from college is on track and going to graduate on time and have their life planned and I'm over here just lost in life not knowing what to do with my life.

I'm thinking of just changing my major to math, but how do I tell my parents?? Or do I even tell them? My parents are asian and they wanted me to be a cs major, because they want me to be ""successful"" and earn a lot of money and I don't wanna be their disappointment when they find out I'm not going to be a cs major anymore.

How to Navigate Online Discussions?,"Title.

Context: So I'm a freshman at UCI and today I was in my math discussion. I had a question on a homework problem that I wasn't able to do, and I realized I wouldn't be able to go to my TA's office hours because I have another discussion at that time...so I kinda put my question in the main chat, and some peers tried to help me but I was lowkey still confused and then my TA was like ""I'll stay in the zoom for a few minutes in case anyone has questions"" BUT I CHICKENED OUT BECAUSE I WAS EMBARASSED AND IDK WHY AND I JUST LEFT THE ZOOM.

Anyways, I guess what I'm really trying to ask is: was it ok to put that in the main chat? Or is that viewed as interrupting the flow of the discussion? Should I have emailed the TA about my question on how to do that problem or like,, because I can't make it to the office hours, just give up for that week? 

On the whole, I just feel like I don't know what the culture of the discussion sections are like and I guess how to conduct myself (I don't want to make things hard for the TA or anyone else because of my question if that makes sense)? And also what's the difference between discussion sections and office hours -- so far they kind of feel the same to me?

Should I drop Psych 177D with Professor Brandon Golob???,"Seeing how great Professor Golob's reviews were on Ratemyprof, I assumed that his class would be my favorite. However, his assignments for Psych 177D are more than all of my three other Psych classes worth of assignments combined.. Every Thursday he expects us to do a group discussion (which consists of 3 different prompts) by 9 PM (NOT EVEN MIDNIGHT), then watch a whole movie AND do a reading in order to do another discussion post by Sunday (also due at 9 PM), and make comments by Tuesday. This does not include the big assignments he has on the syllabus yet which include the essays and final project. 

I feel like I might not be able to keep up with this especially because I have three other classes that I have to do work for as well. Does anybody have experience taking Professor Golob's class? The drop deadline is tomorrow and I'm seriously considering dropping his class... Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.

TLDR: Professor Golob's class has a workload more than all of my three other classes combined. Contemplating whether I should drop. If anybody's taken this class, please let me know your experience.",1602785756,1,0

in need of advice from bio upperclassmen,"Hey yall, 

So this quarter was very tough on me and I got a D in chem 51A. I'm now scrambling to put together a schedule for winter quarter. Since fall was so rough I want to take it easy for winter and what I have so far is bio E179 and math 5A and i'm between taking soc 1 or bio E109 to make the 12 units. I'm stuck between these two because I finished my GEs this quarter and taking soc 1 would kinda be a waste but bio E109 is one of the bio elective requirements that I can check off while I try to get back on track. I'm just scared of this particular class since it's an upper div and from the RMP reviews its pretty difficult. 

Any advice would be very appreciated!",1609222563,1,0

Can you double dip classes for informatics BS?,"I just finished my first quarter here as a transfer majoring in bus admin. After doing some prospective planning for future quarters I saw that if I keep taking 16-20 units I'd be done with the degree by this coming spring so I figured I could add a minor in in4matx to close the gap for the 180 unit graduation requirement. 

Then I also took a look at double majoring in in4matx as well and felt like that would probably be more worth doing and it would justify being at uci for another year with a full course load rather than part time. The problem is that if I were to double major there is a fair amount of prereqs that are required for a majority of the in4matx classes and would probably force me to stay at uci till fall 2022 instead of graduating in spring 2022.

My main questions could I double dip MGMT courses like 107, 173, and 178 for both my bus admin BA and in4matx BS, or would I have to take different electives in the OIT specialization?",1609136407,1,0

How can they only send one email and just leave it at that? I know I shouldn’t have come home now, but it’s too late for that.

Alumni Alliances - Possibly Illegal False Light of Digital Identities Scraped from LinkedIn,"I recently received an email from a start up (scam?) called Alumni Alliances. It would appear that they took the liberty of scraping the LinkedIn profiles of UCI alumni (along with alumni from other universities) to populate profiles on their social media network (which looks to be utter garbage). Once they have your profile data, they then email you telling you to login to claim your profile.

While this feels like a privacy issue, I don't believe it is – it is legal to scrape public LinkedIn data and in many cases that is not a bad thing. Rather the issue, in my view, is one of autonomy  – I did not sign up nor do I have any interest in being affiliated with Alumni Alliances. That they have generated a digital representation of my identity *without my knowledge or permission* and then attempted to *coerce* me into joining their platform so I can maintain control over my digital identity is abusive. I'm left with two unpalatable options; either I sign up and engage with their 'service' against my will or I have a digital identity floating around that may be out of date, inaccurate, and unauthorized by me that could have untoward consequences. So now, to my questions:

\- Has anyone else received emails from Alumni Alliances?

\- Has anyone 'claimed' their account?

\- Are their any individuals with legal expertise in this space who can provide some indication as to whether this is legal or not and whether it is grounds for a class action – could this be a false light?

I have attempted to contact them requesting that they remove all data related to me. Will report back if I hear anything.",1608331428,7,0

Some words from a TA,"As an grad student that has to TA for a class where the professor seems to be inflexible with attendance and requirements, I want to say sorry. I know things are really tough and I see you guys. Unfortunately as TAs sometimes we have to follow and enforce what the professor sets even if we know as students it's very challenging. Many of us are trying to take classes online too while juggling research, TA and everything else related to COVID so we know how it feels to be exhausted as students right now. 

The class I TA for has added a lot more prep work and set up onto TAs than normal and it has been really time consuming and draining. On top of dealing with a death in the family and also taking my own classes online, it's been a tough quarter.  However, I feel like I need to get up and be enthusiastic when teaching because of my position and I know some of my students are probably dealing with worse. I totally feel you guys when classes pose an unreasonable challenge amongst all of this. It's a weird in-between of wishing things could be easier for all of us and needing to enforce the requirements of a class...not sure if my other fellow TAs feel this way but I wanted to put what I felt out there.",1608299417,111,0

Debating on taking Math 5A...,"I'm a first year Bio Sci major and thought about taking Math 5A during the winter. My schedule so far consists of Bio 94, Bio 2B, Writing 39B, and Chem 1B (13 units total).

I've had my doubts since I never took Precal during high school and I don't have a graphing calculator, so I haven't familiarized myself with one yet. The Bio Sci ""pathway"" also doesn't recommend taking math during the winter due to the heavy workload with Bio.

However, peers around me are stacking up on units this winter since they got a feeling of how things roll, and I feel 13 units may be really low (ugh I know I shouldn't compare but I couldn't help but notice). I also thought if I took Math 5A in the spring, I may forget the content for Math 5B the next year. I've already cleared the Stats requirement from AP Stats, so one less math class to worry about fortunately. I've been debating for a while, but I just do not know what to expect.
