"I’m honestly enjoying it. I find it hard to focus in class live, but with online, everything is recorded so I’m able to go through and watch everything at my own pace. Lots of classes have break-out rooms and group work and other opportunities to converse with classmates. There are still office hours, there are still TAs. Professors have really gotten the hang of Zoom and have learned to incorporate other virtual tools into their teaching, so it’s all been smooth sailing for me. On top of it all, most exams are flexible with their timing, and I really love all the general flexibility that online classes give me. Academics-wise, it’s been a real good semester for me. 

Social life isn’t the same obviously, but if we’re genuinely talking about academics and GPA, things are great (granted that you have a suitable learning environment — I can’t speak for the students who have other troubles going on in their lives).",1603115718,1,0

"Sitting on a screen gets old for sure but it's not impossible. I do wish the people who wanted to go back on campus would be honest though, it makes them hard to take seriously. Who really wants to go back to in person to sit in a lecture hall, they want to go back to fuck around and do college things. Some people I see complaining on other social media about online classes are the same people that I know worry more about socializing than classes. Or people I've been in group projects with that didn't pull their weight, but are suddenly worried about their academic experience.

Aside from that, the online part of school is mildly annoying but you are being taught by the same professors, same quality of TA etc., maybe tutoring is different online than in person? Aside from that, how do you expect your GPA to be affected by online classes? In my experience it's more manageable now that I can go back to a recorded lecture and watch it again. Also professors being more familiar with zoom is so much better than it was in spring and things are smoother in that regard.

The biggest problem I think are the rumors of cheating, where GPA is artificially higher for those students who cheat. I remember reading a post where the Midterm average in a class was much higher than it normally is this semester. This is irritating because it threatens to cast doubt on student performance because a select group of students find it easier to cheat than study.",1603064500,1,0

Anecdotally, it seems that grading is pretty much entirely based on how nice your instructor is. Mine was really quite wonderful.

A good friend of mine, who is just as good a writer as me if not better, and who otherwise got similar grades to me throughout school, got a C+, seemingly because his instructor was a hardass with something to prove.

IRAs and 401(k)s, and retirement assets generally, are not counted in your EFC for FAFSA and I believe and I know aren’t counted by Columbia in consideration of parents’ incomes so I assume the same would be true for students.

Also, though it just doesn’t really matter. All normal classes have the same sections, including other core classes. UW sucks, and that’s just one class. In the past GS students didn’t have to take Lit Hum or CC at all (I’m not going to). I think there is a requirement to take a semester of Lit Hum now?

The novels/poems in LitHum are genuinely fun to read, and CC gave me a renewed appreciation for political philosophy.  As a STEM major, I also appreciated the variety that Core classes brought to my courseload.

I also happen to like Western art and music, so ArtHum and MusicHum were enjoyable as well.  Especially MusicHum--who doesn't like listening to symphonies/operas/fugues/Gregorian chants? (I know I worded that in a way that can be taken sarcastically, but I'm dead serious)

UWriting wasn't great, but it did help calibrate for me what the expectations were writing-wise at Columbia.  I was fortunate to have been a decently good writer going in, so for me it wasn't the baptism by fire that some people experience.

Frontiers is the only truly awful one, because it doesn't serve any meaningful population.  The STEM students are bored out of their minds because it's all stuff that they either already know or it's new material that is so superficial that they can learn it immediately just from listening to lecture.

"If you’re going to go into it, be fully committed. Make sure you do it because you actually want to be a doctor. 

Seriously, I can’t emphasize this enough. If you walk into pursuing medicine with a mindset like “oh... well it REALLY does sound like a good career... pays alot... wholesome...”, those are bullshit reasons. You’re going to burn out. If you can potentially picture yourself at an investment bank, or some other industry, or maybe you’re just lost and relying on what parents or role models have told you, you’re going to be miserable and fail.

You need to really do a lot of reflection and feel like this is the only path you can ever imagine going on... nowhere else. You need to turn every stone around you and see if there’s a possibility you can go for something else. You need to do research on your free time—look at videos online of others describing their careers. Reflect on what classes you enjoyed/hated and why you felt that way towards them. You need to empty everything in your arsenal and attack the belief of becoming a doctor... and when every other option just feels wrong or miserable, when you look back on your childhood experiences and think of what made you happy and what type of personality you have... the kinds of people you’re fine dealing with...here comes the last step. You’ll have to turn back to medicine, think about it, and say “this is the only thing I can ever imagine doing”. Then, you’ll eventually have to do the same thing with specialties.

Otherwise, you will be absolutely miserable trudging through Mowsh Bio... the Chem requirements... the labs... The moment you walk into any INTRODUCTORY premed course, it’s meant to be a weed-out course. So you better start figuring out if this is your birthright or not.

Premed at Columbia is NOT about memorization. It’s about learning a concept and applying it like a tool. It’s not a means to an end... it’s the journey itself of thinking “outside the box” as you’ll read in Mowsh Bio reviews where MANY students have struggled thinking in this way. 

It’s about waking up every day and feeling like there’s no better job than smelling or seeing blood, pus, organs, nasty infections, people trying to sue you, dealing with annoying patients occasionally, crying babies in the waiting room, the emotional pain of morbidity, the paperwork, the LONG hours, the lack of family time (depending on specialty), the emotionally stressed out patients, the $100,000’s of debt...

It’s also about waking up to the beauty of being a caretaker, a provider, a giver of life and a giver of health. It can be ethical, it can be about the good feeling you get when you see patients healing up after an illness or injury. It can be about the smell of disinfectants or finding the cure for a disease. It can be about ongoing research... it can be about having the knowledge to take care of yourself. 

You have to live and breathe wanting to be a doctor, because that is going to BE your life after you graduate from medical school. 

Take it from someone who made the mistake of going premed and never feeling too sure about what I wanted to do in my life. I was pretty aimless in college for my first 3 years, having entered in for Mechanical Engineering but only doing so because it was something my parents suggested from a young age, and I really couldn’t think of anything else for my life. 

I trudged through almost all my requirements leaving Orgo and Biochem out for the end, only to realize I only valued Medicine for the comfortable lifestyle and prestige, and sipping cocktails on a beach in Miami. I didn’t care about the human body too much at all—I was just really good at memorizing things in high school and regurgitating them on a test. 

As a result, I BARELY made it to finishing my requirements for graduation as a result of burnout and time wasted on those courses. Every class I took at Columbia was a REQUIRED class, either for my major or meeting the premed requirements. Keep in mind that I’m in SEAS and we have a bit more of a strict timeline of courses to take than CC, but basically I never had ANY free time to take a random class I wanted. I only had the opportunity to reflect and consider my values after I burned out and nearly failed my classes, only with COVID P/F coming to save the day. 

Please, do yourself a favor. If you’re just start at Columbia, drop the games. Drop the competition. Drop the ego. You might not see the kids around you ever again in your life—think about your values. 

You can’t change other people, but you can only check yourself. Pursue responsibility. Live a meaningful life. Do everything you can to figure out if this is your path. 

I’m happy to say I eventually did find what’s best for me after attacking it with the process I just described to you above, but I wish I had done so sooner to live a more free and adventurous college life. Time to go to parties and actually enjoy them instead of going because I have nothing better to do... time to make true and meaningful friendships instead of doing it just to compare myself to them or get ideas from them... I wish I could take back time and prevent this from having happened. 

You only get undergrad once. Make the best of it. Figure out what you want for sure, go for it till the end, and the rest of your life can be free time to pursue other hobbies, enjoyments and responsibilities.",1606144800,1,0

I’m not sure what other classes are like but when I took CC 5 years ago, my instructor seemed a lot more focused on a few key passages and attempted to help us understand the arguments presented in them.  In contrast, Lit Hum, while kind of focused on a few passages, felt a bit like a discordant mess.  While the readings were less difficult, the lack of a coherent focus made it a bit harder to understand and appreciate the value of the texts we had to read.

I called the admissions office to see if I could submit this and they gave me a strict NO because it was not from a mentor/person I conducted research with. 

Unfortunately, that seems to be a policy they aren’t willing to budge on. 

A possible solution is that you could try to get your councilor to submit the coach’s LOR attached to theirs, to kind of have a two in one deal, or you can have your councilor quote specific aspects of your coach’s letter. This is the route my school took in order for my to have the input of a third letter without actually submitting one, because it wasn’t possible to do so in this case.

"Great work! My advice is to apply for as many well-suited scholarships as you possibly can. Columbia doesn't offer as much financial aid as other universities, but there are a ton of sector-specific scholarships that are only available to students in their first and second years, and the deadlines run from now until December to February. Especially if you're doing work in stem or want a federal job, a lot of those scholarships have their closing dates starting from now until the beginning of next year.

My personal opinion, having been through all of that, is to flat out avoid those scammy sounding instant scholarship websites that have you input all your personal data for a random chance to win $1,000 or whatever. You have a way better shot at applying for industry specific scholarships or internship programs related to your interests and skills. The best part is that you can usually use your college application essays, test scores, transcripts and statements of interest that you've already submitted to Columbia in your scholarship applications, and even if you don't get into columbia, that money can go towards any School of your choice.

"Hey! Great job! Keep this post up - it could be encouraging and valuable to others. 

My advice on what to do in the meantime is standard: READ! Read great books, fun books, heavy and light. Practice your reading muscle. When you [ :) ] get to Columbia there will be a lot of reading and the way to get through it is to read consistently every day. So, grab a textbook you’ve been wanting to dig into or find the syllabus for a course you’d like to take and set out for a chapter a day. Build that muscle up and enjoy it. 

Best of luck!",1604081599,1,0

"If a work/life balance is important to you, you may very well not want to be an MD/DO, and that's just fine.  Ask yourself why you want to be a doctor.  If prestige or what others will think is playing into that, those aren't valid reasons and you'll probably burn out from what I hear.

I've been considering PA, but unlikely.  I want to become an expert on something, I love diagnosis and research, I enjoy teaching, and want to be able to work up courses of treatment and enjoy managing a team.  All things a PA/nurse does not typically get to do.  And the possibility of surgery excites me.

"Hmmmm I'm taking AP currently and based on your description it is not what you are looking for. 

Instead, let me suggest Computer Science theory (COMSW3261). Why? Because the difficulty scales as far as you want. I'm currently taking it with Prof Tal Malkin, and while the core material of the class isn't extremely hard (quite doable), Malkin will often give problems in class that won't be collected or graded, or even tested on, but that are very hard and if you're interested you can do them. 

Couple that with the fact that if you go deep enough into the material you will encounter UNSOLVED / OPEN problems dealing with complexity and computability, you won't run out of things to think about. Unless you can self study the solution to P ?= NP. 

AP will not satiate you if you're looking for something you can't learn elsewhere. Certainly, it's a great class, you can read Jae's paper on the class structure:

[http://www.cs.columbia.edu/\~jae/papers/3157-paper-v2.2-camera-final.pdf](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/papers/3157-paper-v2.2-camera-final.pdf)",1604036862,1,0

"Whenever I’m feeling like this(especially this semester) I first try to calculate my grade in all my classes. This allows me to figure out how much my grade can change in a class based on different final grades(basically do a sensitivity analysis with the information I have and some assumptions). With this I can make an informed decision on how well I need to do in a class to get the grade I want. 

Idk if this would work for anyone else, but this really helps put things in perspective and really helps bring my expectations of my workload down to reality. It can certainly feel overwhelming, but after doing those quick back of the envelope calculations I am able to really see what’s happening and figure out how much work I have(usually it’s not as bad as I thought it was)


Often this alone helps me get the motivation to study when I’m truly burnt out. 

With that out of the way the second thing I would say is trying to negotiate with yourself to get work done. For example, I will usually make a deal with myself to work for 20 min studying or reading a chapter and usually find myself doing far beyond that initial goal. For me it’s all a matter of starting. 


I think Louis Rossman explains this really well

"Keep pushing with financial aid. When I got in off the waitlist, my financial aid was lower than expected. They also had my EFC listed to be much higher than other schools I got into, and the net price calculator said I should have gotten more financial aid. I told them all of this, they did an appeal. Appeal showed everything was fine. Then we had an in-person meeting (maybe try to schedule a virtual one) where we insisted something must be wrong because it was so different from other schools. They said no, the appeal looked fine, we had our most detail oriented guy look at it. They also refused to go through the calculation so we could find the mistake, because it's proprietary info. At this point, I asked for a few day extension to decide if I would enroll or not. That's when someone from financial aid called my dad, went through all the details, and found the mistake. A $15,000 mistake. (They had my sibling listed as attending a public college, but since he's out of state, they should have put that in the private tuition category.) Anyways, the point is keep pushing, even when they tell you no, if you know something is up. Pushing just cause you want more fin aid doesn't do anything, but if you have actual reason to believe it's wrong (like it's very far off from the thorough net price calculator), please keep pushing them and let them know you might not be able to attend.

I certainly hope Columbia lowers tuition but to defund the public safety office seems like that should be its own separate discussion,1608284132,1,0

"Although I don't have any personal experience with this, it's obvious that your past experience with academic integrity is playing into your fear. Plus, I'm assuming that in your interaction with the people who enforce academic integrity can show you that these people take that responsibility seriously. Because of this, no professor would just accuse you of cheating without any evidence. I wouldn't be surprised if 99.99% of people accused of cheating are actually guilty of cheating in colleges across the US.

Also, it is so easy to cheat in these classes that you can assume someone has already done it blatantly. That takes the heat off other students who are honest like yourself because your professors have so many places to look when they find cheaters. If you haven't cheated you're good.

"Heya, I'll take your word that you are not trying to be snarky, but I feel your intuition is correct in that your response does sound irritated and a bit passive-aggressive.

I'm working through it the best I can. I moved a long way from home last semester and when the pandemic hit I felt depressed, scrambled, and claustrophobic at best. It was my first semester at Columbia (I'm GS) and the move to online was tough considering I needed to get As to be a part of an honors program so that I can pursue my dream of research. So, not to correct you, but I did have to adjust with my first semester at Columbia being the pandemic semester.

It isn't fair, sure. But there will be great pros and cons to any new implementation. For a few here, myself included, the grad school monster needs to be fed a good GPA.

My post - to which I'm sorry if I gave *you* offense - was to make the point that there will be pros and cons either way. And on a personal note, I'm tired of others using the examples of under-privileged communities to complain about their own situations. Even if you are from such a background, that doesn't mean everyone is the same in how they'd like to be treated or made an example of.

Something I don't understand: When did struggling through life become a social-currency? If only the homeless guy on the corner could get in on that, but it seems reserved for and utilized by those higher up in life. Everyone has to struggle in life - that's life. Maybe those who make it a currency are the ones who never expected for life to be a struggle at all.

This is not leveled at you or anyone of particular in this thread; this is just something I've been mulling over for a while and trying to get down in words. I've noticed this pattern over the last five or six years.

My personal perspective is this: I've had to fight for my chance to get to a place like Columbia. I never thought I'd even get a second chance at an education or a real career, but I fought like hell to get here, and I intend to have the right to keep fighting for grades which reflect my efforts - good or bad.

BTW CU doesn't do class rankings... and curves end up with the average grade for most classes being A-/B+... CU already drastically inflates gpa's as it is, combine that with a lack of class rankings? You're only kinda sorta graded relative to other people's performance, and even that depends on classes.

"I personally would not care if it went to optional p/f or even mandatory p/f, etc etc because quite frankly i don't care that much. I do pretty well in school and think part of it is because I don't stress small stuff. 

What would moving to optional p/f accomplish for you as a hard working and caring student? It'll still reflect as a P on your transcript, which is functionally a C for everything other than gpa calculation. You'll still have learned the same amount. If a C is the end of your world... idk what to tell you. I wish I could impart onto you some relief. It's not really a big deal. Try your hardest, get either a good grade or a bad one. life moves on

I think pdf one class per semester is a good policy because it can encourage students to take classes that they'd otherwise be super uncomfortable taking. Having an option to completely p/f in my eyes doesn't accomplish anything more and gives the dgaf students a way to dgaf even harder, so it seems to me there are only cons

If that is seen as “too much to ask” on the student, the grad schools would pick the lesser of evils and go with the letter grades if not doing a 50/50 split to save face - I’m speculating they would skim off the top of the ivys for their pool of non-letter graded students.

I would strongly recommend you to take a leave if you believe it will benefit you in a long run. Personally, I had a mandatory military service I had to do anyway which made taking leave of absence much easier than other reasons.

However, one thing you would need to consider is a chance of losing guaranteed housing. As far as I’m aware, Columbia takes your guaranteed housing away when you return which may financially/psychologically impact you. I know there are some exceptions to this since military service was one of them.

"I've taken two leaves of absence for different reasons, one for mental health and the other for a death in my family. Different leaves have slightly different procedures but both are pretty easy to go through with, you just have to talk to your academic advisor about your options. As far as deadlines, leaves are much more flexible than you think. My first leave for mental health I took in late November, with the semester almost completely over, and remained on that leave at home for a year and a half. 

In my case there was zero pushback during the whole process of taking each leave; every step of the way was easily outlined by my academic advisor and it didn't feel difficult to do at all. Coming back after a leave can be a bit rough because Columbia is very disorganized in that regard (my id card wouldn't work for weeks, my student account wouldn't update so I couldn't register for classes until it was too late for some). But the overall boon to my mental well being was worth a couple weeks of a disorganized return.

"I disagree, it's just not nearly enough information to make a definite recommendation.

Taking a gap year would go a long way to solving the problem of being this lonely. Yes it can be hard to make friends at Columbia but not this hard.

And what about the issues caused by having a terrible semester/year?

Plus, why did you assume OP is male?

I think your idea that it's a good life lesson to start college in this terrible way with no friends, alone and miserable makes no sense. Given what OP said, I can completely understand what they're thinking of taking a leave. There's a lot to be said for continuing too, of course, provided they can come up with some ideas to improve the situation.

It falsely implies that the student is proficient at thermodynamics, but it accurately implies that the student was the strongest student in the course. The inverse applies as well - if I stick medical students into an intro bio course and the course average is 98, the student with a 92 might get a B- (some professors adamantly refuse to ""curve downwards"" so to speak, so this is just an example).

I don't like hard limits like only 1/3 of the class could possibly get an A (what if everyone in the class gets &gt;90%?) but combating grade inflation does help retain the value of an A grade. If everyone got an A, how do you distinguish between the brightest students, the strong-ish students, the average students, and the weak students?

There's no ""police and jails are the true root of evil"" and ""my privileged life is absolutely unfair because I have student loans after choosing an expensive private school"" crowd that will drown you out if you disagree or the hyper-partisanship that you see at Columbia. It's nice to go to the store or wherever and not feel like you have to be dressed to the 9s to do so. And to buy groceries for your whole family for less than it cost you individually back in NYC.",1601923569,1,0
"As someone slogging through the premed curriculum here right now, I don’t think there’s one clear answer to this. 

The pros of doing premed here are: 
1. You have the Columbia name behind you, in my experience this has helped with opening doors to shadowing opportunities, etc. 
2. The research opportunities here are probably better than most state, local schools, etc. 
3. If you (like a fair amount of people do) decide to not do premed at some point, having a degree from Columbia will give you a decent leg up in most any other career that you choose. 

The cons I would say are:
1. The core takes up a huge part of your time here. If you were planning on majoring in something that doesn’t have a lot of overlap with premed requirements, the core makes it much more difficult because you end up having to balance core, major, and premed requirements. Definitely not impossible, but more difficult than it would be elsewhere. 
2. You’re competing against students who are already performing at a super high level. Obviously if you get in you’re probably more than capable of performing at a similar level but it does add to the stress. 
3. To that end, several courses here that are premed requirements are almost ridiculously difficult. The most infamous being intro bio, which weeds out pretty substantial amounts of students. 

So hopefully that gives you somewhat of a better idea of what it’s like here. In my opinion it would probably be easier to be a premed elsewhere, but it’s also not ALL bad at Columbia. Whether you would like it or not would probably depend on how much of a challenge you want.",1601919811,1,0

"All the time. It is an absolute pressure cooker and I ended up really disliking NYC for a variety of reasons. I deeply regret not choosing somewhere with a more laidback atmosphere, but that's my own fault. I will say I would be a lot less unhappy with my experience if I was studying something that I was more interested in and that wasn't so hard. I also feel like, as hard as its been, I do think I'll come out of here better equipped to handle 'real life' than I would have if I'd gone somewhere else.

I also really dislike how the average person here is very economically privileged. If you're not from a similar background, it can be challenging.",1601916658,1,0

I'm taking a handful of intro classes right now. One of them is intro to java,1599975002,1,0
"I took an introductory compsci class during last semester of my sophomore year, since it fulfilled the science requirement for CC. I'd never coded before; I always was better with humanities than math, so I was surprised how much I really enjoyed it.
After that class, I ended up redeclaring my major to compsci (previously economics). I don't recommend doing a switch like that so late into college: my last 2 years were insane in terms of workload and I had only 1 summer internship in the field. But ultimately it was the right major for me and I'll always be proud I managed to finish it.
My biggest recommendation to incoming students is to take a compsci class their first year to see if they enjoy it.",1599974672,1,0
"It's not exactly accurate, although 17 credits is a *major* load that Columbia often forces on students. When I told an interviewer that I (occasionally) tried to spend 3 hours per week per credit on classes they thought I was insane.",1599973994,1,0
"Really depends person to person. I came to Columbia thinking I would do one major and after my first semester I changed to a different one. The main thing you want to focus on is getting your core classes out of the way early which would apply to a few different majors you’re interested in. Take your time with it, and speak with your advisor or the professors you’re interested in learning more from. It cannot be stated enough: office hours are your best friend. I see you’re in GS and most of the time GS students know that better than others (I was in GS too before joining grad school at Columbia).",1599973801,1,0
I think most people decide after taking the intro class to the degree. I committed to computer science after taking intro to java and data structures.,1599973493,1,0
No it's not accurate. The credit number doesn't really tell you a lot because difficulty varies so hugely. I was ok my first semester taking 17 credits but all of my classes were pretty easy. Another semester I struggled taking 13 credits because one of the classes was very difficult (to me).,1599973111,1,0
"I think the question should be very high on your priorities, I would defer until you figure out what you're going to do.",1599972384,1,0
No it will vary depending on the class and your comfort in the subject. Classes like UWriting or Lithum on average took me more than 12 hours but something like FroSci didn’t get close.

"Yeah -- right now we're using a pricing model that discounts heavily as the rental period increases. This is to account for the fact that the margin from a single day rental is a lot tighter than for a multiple month rental. But the way we had it displayed is not clear, especially if we'd want people to see the true value even after just a quick pass over the inventory page. 

Any opinion on the price point once you can see the real adjusted total? Though some people might use Hubbub for the sustainability aspect, the prices and value will be what would likely bring in the most users.",1599923793,1,0
"Fair question - Yea having people list weights that cost more than a gym pass wouldn't be very popular. For longer rental periods, the total price is increasingly discounted. For example, a recent listing for 20lbs dumbbells for a 3-month semester ended up costing \~$40. That discount function wasn't obvious though. 

Also you're right $40 is still a bunch more expensive than that gym pass but we were anticipating that there would be some people who wouldn't want to be going to a gym right now and others who might not want to have hold on to the weights when they move between places. We'll keep an eye on that though to make sure the value is actually there.",1599923311,1,0
"Hi! Okay for sure I totally see your point. That ""per day"" price is intended to be the starting price for a single day period. When you put in a longer time frame - weeks, months, etc. - the pricing function discounts the total so for instance, a 30 day rental costs a lot less than 30 \* per day price. That definitely isn't clear. And yeah, I agree that the prices must be significantly less than what it costs to actually buy the item for anyone to consider it a good value.",1599922799,1,0

"I took this course with Andoni my sophomore year. I can say that it is definitely one of the most rewarding classes I have taken at Columbia, but also one of the most challenging. That being said, Andoni is a great Professor. I really have nothing but positive things to say about him. However, I would advise against taking this course in a 7-week span, unless you are already familiar with the material or at least 2 of your 4 other classes are very easy / low effort. Even when taking this course as a full-semester course, it felt like I was doing the work and reading for 1.5-2 classes. Maybe that was because I did all the readings or maybe I just found the material more challenging than others (or maybe both). Regardless, it’s a tough course, so definitely don’t underestimate it. But I do highly suggest taking it while at Columbia. If you have time though, I’d say wait until it’s offered as a full length course. 

Also, I know a lot of people like taking the course with Cliff Stein, but I can say that from the one lecture he was a sub for my course, Andoni is a much more clear and organized lecturer. Unfamiliar with Drinea, however.",1599888072,1,0

"&gt;but we are an extraordinarily replaceable one

Lol no we aren't. There's a reason that Columbia has so many privileged students. I know people who rejected Columbia because it was too expensive, and they didn't feel the cost was justified. There are only so many people who are willing to pay a premium for Columbia - *especially* when it's not even on campus. Many of those people hypothetically ""replacing"" us would inevitably bring up the issues we're discussing here as well. We're definitely a finite group. There isn't an endless number of people who a) meet the academic criteria to get accepted to an Ivy League and b) are willing and able to pay for it. At the end of the day, the consumer holds the power. That's why you see all these billion-dollar companies bending over backwards to appear more ""woke"". Consumer demands *matter*.",1602450713,1,0

I’ve visited almost all of the ivies and unless you like small town/wilderness, there is no comparison as far as good food and entertainment in the immediate area around campus. Harvard square would be the closest thing but in my opinion, it’s no match for Morningside.

"Usually B school wants you to have full time working experience before attending. Look at Harvard’s 2+2 program, which accepts undergrads— even they require you to get 2 years of experience under your belt before formally matriculating.


So, even if you want to go to business school, you’re still going to face the same problem of landing a job before you matriculate. What are you trying to do? If you want to do consulting or banking or something, yeah go for the AI track, won’t really matter. But if you’re trying to land a tech job (which you should— will diversify your b school app more), I would optimize for that. Yeah, the ideal tech job for your app would be to be some AI developer at an AI-focused team or firm, but I’m a strong advocate for reducing risk and optimizing the bottom line, which you’d do by focusing on SWE breadth and then just taking two AI courses on the side (maybe ML and computer vision). 

Also: since B school is so dang expensive and is becoming less and less worth it, you’ve got to consider the possibility that once you’re out of school and at a solid tech firm, you might decide you don’t want to do it anymore ;) so land an elite tech job first, IMO.",1605112509,1,0

"I don’t think the interview plays a huge rule in the admissions process, so don’t stress about it too much regardless of how it goes. Nonetheless, I do have some pointers:

- Dress business casual, leaning towards business professional (unless told otherwise)

- Have questions prepared. These could be about anything: social life, academics, etc. You can ask these to avoid silences, but have a couple saved for the end.

- The ‘interview’ is more of a conversation than it is an interview most of the time. To relax your nerves, sometimes it helps to go in thinking the person already likes you. It can also help to go in thinking you are the one meeting the alum, not the other way around (after all, they are your closest thing to Columbia. Be excited!).

- Have some answers to possible questions ready. You should know the answers to questions like “Why Columbia?”, “Tell me about yourself.”, and “Why do you want to study ______?”  by heart. 

- avoid negatives. If at any point you feel compelled to tell your interviewer you don’t like something (be it about Columbia, food, people, etc), it is best to follow the rule of thumb of speaking only about positives. This doesn’t apply 100% of the time, but keep it on mind.

- try to communicate that you are passionate for what you do (be that sports, learning in school or out of school, community service, being with friends and family, etc.) 

- gratefulness is an attractive personality trait. Show your interviewer you’re grateful for the opportunity to apply and be interviewed.

- SEND A FOLLOW UP EMAIL. During your conversation, make note of an interesting topic you spoke about. Later in the day, send your interviewer an email thanking them for their time and mention how you loved learning more about said topic.

Overall, I think that the best piece of advice anyone could’ve given me is to relax and try to enjoy the conversation. You will do great! Also, just a side note, make sure you actually read the books you said you read in your application. I’m not even sure they’d ask about it, but I heard horror stories (which were brought upon by the person who lied on their app, anyway).",1605075624,1,0

"I'll go against the other comment in this thread and say that living off campus in NYC has been relatively rewarding, if only because of the social aspect. Living with my parents for ~5 months was okay, but got pretty tiring towards the end, especially because I couldn't see any friends for the entirety and pretty much only left my house once every couple weeks. (I also definitely was not planning on spending my entire summer in my hometown, so quarantine was kind of a shock against prior expectations in that regard.)

On the other hand quarantining with roommates has been more enjoyable–there's something different about actually getting to hang out with people in person. I'm living w friends I was planning on rooming with anyway so there's not really any issues, and it's a nice dose of independence overall.

If you're coming to NYC solely for academic reasons, I'd say there's basically no point, and you might as well stay home (as long as you can study well at home and in person classes don't matter to you). I technically could have an in-person class which is pretty much the reason I'm in NYC instead of somewhere else, but considering I haven't been to it a single time, Zoom is pretty much good enough for me personally.",1603951102,1,0

I'm a second year now and I still do not have any internships/research/etc. There's certainly a lot of people who are very club and career focused and that's totally valid as well, but you don't need to compare yourself to them if that's not what you're into because everyone has different goals etc. Don't worry about not having a concrete major either, you still have a couple semesters before you declare and can change majors even after that.

You are definitely not behind, and getting wrapped up in the stress culture works for some people, but doesn't work for a whole lot of others like me!!",1603908585,1,0
Yeah same. Let's just survive this year and hopefully it will get better,1603906836,1,0
"Oh, mine is too. I put ""hybrid"" in quotes because none of my classes offer in-person instruction. I heard it was left up to the professors and very few professors decided to host students IRL.",1603906709,1,0

"Oh okay that's great information. Seems very similar to us, but I think we have way less than 10% of students back on campus housing. A good chunk is in off campus housing tho.",1603906367,1,0
"Hey, it's completely okay to be feeling that way right now. I'm in a similar boat that I'm new to the university (transfer) and haven't been on campus yet and it feels incredibly lonely. As a first year it's okay not to have clubs/internships/research etc, but I'd say joining clubs has honestly been the only thing helping the loneliness for me. And it's certainly not to late to join if you do want to, tons of clubs have open meetings, and a lot are gonna recruit again at the start of spring. 

Don't subscribe to stress culture though if you can help it. If you're on top of your work and you're doing okay, don't worry.",1603904865,1,0
"Not having fun sucks. Not being in any clubs isn't a big deal, but you might have some fun joining a casual one (PM me to join the chess club!). You just started, it's normal to not have your major figured out. Better than pretending you know your major and having to switch like a lot of people. 

Being into stress culture isn't a good thing. Of course you don't have an internship or research position yet lol. Relax, if you get your first research or internship by sophomore summer it's all good, even if it's not until junior summer it's probably fine. I know how you feel but sounds like you're doing just fine.",1603904686,1,0
"Depends on the behavioral violation I'd guess. I know that last year I had a disciplinary hearing for smoking indoors and they gave me conditional probation, which is just a year period where you can't get in trouble again with the disciplinary hearing office (forgot the actual name). Had I gotten in trouble again, they would have put me on academic probation, where Columbia can use a whole bunch of punishments (like putting stops on signing up for classes, club signups, etc.). 

From what I gathered from the experience, as long as you're not a clear and present danger to other students, they don't want to kick you out, they just want to make sure you don't do it again. I'm not sure what your violation was, but those hearings usually don't warrant suspension or expulsion from my experience.",1603903021,1,0

"Yea, I would say Columbia is operating at 10% (18%?). Buildings are locked down with entry only for Columbia affiliates. Only I work in one of our heavily trafficed ones as no one is coming this fall. Graduate schools are ostensibly hybrid, however out of four classes none of mine are in person. You're allowed to sit in the libraries but you have to fill out the COVID-check app, book ahead of time, and then when you finally find your designated seat and check in with a QR code, you're permitted 2 hours in the. Enough time to browse Reddit, queue up your music, and then read 6 pages. That two-hour window was just extended to 4 hours, and I think that's the extent of our reopening.

I also managed one of the buildings that is open for classes, and about half of those classes designated as in-person have professors or students showing up.",1603900240,1,0
"Students who went back to campus aren’t doing much to stop the spread. Columbia is only successful because their strategy is to operate at 20% capacity; NYU, on the other hand, allowed all students to come back. They haven’t had a huge spike in cases yet, so I believe they’re the better subject of research.",1603898832,1,0
"All SIPA students can take either the 6400/6401 series or 6300/6301. You can mix and match. I actually considered taking 6301 because I didn't have as firm of a grounding in macro as in micro, but I decided to persevere. With EE, I don't think any of your courses would have either econ as a prereq, so it wouldn't matter. There are some international trade and central banking classes that have macro 6401 as a prereq, so IFEP students can need to take macro during first year in order to make sure they have time to take those courses. I don't think any of those courses are listed under EE so you wouldn't have that issue unless you wanted to take one as an elective before your final semester.

I personally switched out of EE due to how awful ESF was, but YMMV. The professor had no respect for his students, kept posting assignments late, expected us to work from an image when there was easily available Excel (this was a last straw for me as I knew and had worked with the exact chart before, so I asked myself what would I really get out of the class). He was playing on his phone during my presentation to the class and then asked a question that clearly demonstrated he'd not been listening. I asked a classmate if maybe I'd misspoke during the presentation or was unclear, and that classmate agreed that the professor wasn't listening to me. Meanwhile, he wouldn't let us even take notes on our laptops iirc. A lot of the materials were dated...we were reading some antivaxxer book on systems thinking from the 90s, and I was coming from having been in the negotiation room for NY's CLCPA, one of the most advanced and ambitious pieces of legislation in the energy/climate sphere out there. It was also US-focused and I went back to school to get a more global focus as I'm extremely familiar with US energy workings. I switched concentrations and so far have done papers on Venezuela energy + development, India trafficking law, and Russia-Germany energy relations focusing on Nordstream 2.

Maybe you will have a different experience. If you don't have much energy experience, and are interested in a US-focused class, you may find it enjoyable. Do take what you learn with a grain of salt, as EJ and just transitions are very much an important part of modern energy policy discussions. Systems thinking is a tool you can use, and is very important when considering the energy system as a whole, but you need to be able to go bigger than that unless you're only looking to be an analyst for a utility or something rather than a policymaker.

I come from having another grad degree as well and I strongly believe that professors of graduate students should respect their students and allow open discussion. I've made great use of the 2 week shopping period since ESF to find professors who are looking for those inquisitive minds rather than someone ready to listen to every word, memorize it, and regurgitate it on exams.

ESF is, however, fall-only and TA/readerships for spring come out over the previous summer anyways. Those of us with spring 2021 TA/readerships got our assignments months ago and already had training. The application was due sometime last April. Quant, accounting, and management courses all have TAs and/or readers.",1603897453,1,0
Are students even supposed to be back on campus now? I thought they basically went to remote learning for the fall semester but on social media I see so many frosh living on campus and exploring the city.,1603896337,1,0
I haven't seen any practical reopening strategy. Living on campus means never hearing or seeing my neighbors right now.,1603895967,1,0
"Awesome, thanks a ton for the guidance. I'm in the EE concentration, not IFEP, so that's not an option unfortunately (unless I can take an IFEP class to fulfill an EE/core requirement? Still unsure on the specifics of how requirements interact.) Language is not a requirement for my track. 

My plan for this spring is to take Quant I, Accounting for Int &amp; Public Affairs (Fin. Management req), Sustainability Management (Management req), and 1-2 electives totaling not more than 4.5 units. 

As for TAing, I've heard many people gush about the Energy Systems Fundamentals course, which is right up my alley. Planning on taking that in the fall &amp; hoping to TA for it next spring. 

Thanks again, you've been very helpful.",1603894610,1,0
"No, micro isn't offered in spring. J-termers usually take the micro/macro sequence during their 2nd and 3rd semesters. I have heard of IFEP students taking macro first anyways since so many of their classes have macro as a prereq. I took the 64 series and we didn't have much that required micro. The head of the IFEP program teaches 6401 macro and I imagine he will either have guidance for the J-termers or there will be special sessions to review the micro knowledge needed. If you are considering IFEP, I'd recommend emailing someone in the program. 

Unless you're IFEP and they let you take 6401 this spring, I would take other core courses (quant, management, financial management) plus a concentration/specialization class or 2 that sounds fun. If you need language then fit that in. Then in fall, take micro, PoP/CF, and other classes. I've personally interspersed core SIPA, language, and core concentration courses so that I have at least 1-2 electives towards my non-core concentration/specialization requirements each semester. 

You can TA starting your third semester, so you may want to choose core classes you think you'll do well in during your first 2 semesters. For example, one of the core classes I'm currently taking is a difficult class for me so I didn't bother taking it first year. The other one is one where I would have no interest in TA-ing because I hate the subject and I think you need to be excited about a subject in order to successfully teach it to others. Core classes often require more time, between recitations and problem sets, so you want to try to get those done before capstone if you can.",1603894017,1,0
"Perhaps by ""reopening"" they're referring to the fact that there are some students on campus?  If so, then any perceived success is probably because Columbia never had a super bopping party/Greek life scene in the first place.  Most social gatherings were on the relatively small side anyway (at least, that's my recollection from my days at Columbia).",1603892034,1,0

"Phew, that makes me feel better! I also have a few conflicts, so glad to hear these might not be final. Thanks for the info.

Do you know if they typically offer the first course in the micro/macroecon series during the spring semester? It's currently on Vergil for just the fall semester. I haven't touched econ since undergrad 5 years ago &amp; I was hoping to use that course as a refresher.",1603891334,1,0
