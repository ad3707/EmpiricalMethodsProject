Now that everyone is using Zoom (or whatever) to meet virtually, it's likely even easier.

"As someone else said, the next exam you take is harder. If I had to rank them, and I think most people can agree with me on this, the second midterm was the hardest, and the first midterm was the easiest. The final exam lies right in between.

"What the others have said about the return to research rules would be correct, only upperclassmen (and technically those who are required to complete their research for their degree/will delay graduation otherwise) are allowed to be in labs. This may change over the summer, I think there’s a decent chance, but don’t keep your hopes up. 

That said, I’d recommend looking into doing literature research or bioinformatics works if you’re comfortable with that. The way academia is now and the direction it’s rapidly moving in, coding and statistics are a prerequisite in any science field, include the life sciences. If you’re interested in grad school, and would like to be doing meaningful research over the course of your undergrad career, would be worth doing this now and getting some experience in it. It’ll come in handy for you with every future step you take. There’s a bunch of professors in MBB/microbio/CBN doing informatics work.",1613865059,1,0

"Yup! Well sort of, I'm definitely more of a car guy but I have an appreciation for trucks, buses, and planes too. Wow, I didn't know NJT finally replaced those old Neoplan artic buses, its about time though they were definitely approaching the end of their life span. Those new Xcelsiors are really nice buses and I'm happy those replaced the old Neoplans. I've been in the XD40s but not in the XD60s. Also, First Transit retired the D60LFs?? Thats a shame, I liked those, but also they really were reaching the end of their life span, and I remember noticing that they would break down pretty often. From what I know of them they had an interesting service life, starting in Canada with OC Transpo then ending up at Rutgers. Buses have a hard service life in general but those D60LFs probably had it a little bit harder, since they had to put up with Canadian winters. I guess there aren't plans to replace them at the moment, considering campus is pretty much empty? 

The Eldorados are pretty cool buses too, but I like the XD40s better. Knowing how Rutgers operates, they like to change vendors/contractors often. I wouldn't be surprised if they switch to another company for the bus fleet after 2023. Maybe then we would see the XD40s?  If they stay with First Transit I bet they would stick with Eldorado, and maybe they would look at the hybrid diesel version (if Eldorado has a 40 footer hybrid diesel?).  

Also, do you work for First Transit? Thats pretty cool! (lol I'm a bus nerd). What do you do for them?",1613852588,1,0

Your car's parked illegally, they catch you, you get a ticket. That's the way the world works.

If they relaxed on those policies, then no one would buy permits and all the lots would be overflowing, and no one would be able to park. That wouldn't be desirable either.",1613846099,1,0

"Wow surprised that you know Xcelsior!(bus fan also?) I love Xcelsiors. NJ Transit’s new XD60 in Newark soooo cool I really hope First Transit can buy those new artic buses! All our ten D60LFs are retired now. 

However, First Transit default 40ft bus model for universities is ElDorado. When D40LF retire, old ElDorados from CSI (2014 model) are the top choice of replacement. They currently sit in our yard and dispatcher said they may join our fleet in the future. 

The entire fleet upgrade should depend on how many years of contract First Transit still have with Rutgers. Normally it’s 12 years same as the lifespan of a bus, so 2011-2023, then we have to see how the next contract require about bus models. XD40 is much expensive than ElDorado, XDE40 will be even more. First Transit won’t purchase those unless in the contract Rutgers specify the model of buses or Rutgers purchase those buses. 

A complete electrify fleet will take more years unless we change the bus company, since the whole base needs to rebuild for charging stations and we have such large number of buses. Sadly, First Transit lost the contract with Princeton University in January 2021 (just my random guess it may because Princeton wants electrical buses but First Transit don’t want extra cost), the new bus company for Princeton University agreed to bring electrical buses (highly possible Proterras, saw them testing last year) in Fall 2022, since Princeton doesn’t rely on buses that much like us and they only need roughly 15 buses, so entire fleet electrify is much easier.",1613834839,1,0

"Speaking as an MBB major myself, it's a tough but very rewarding program!  I think it's wonderful that you're already looking for research opportunities, though you might be at a disadvantage in gaining in-person experience until at least the fall semester.  According to the current Return to Research guidelines, underclassmen (with a few exceptions) are not being allowed to conduct wet lab-based research.  This might change the nature of your search if you want to get involved over this semester and the summer, as you will be limited to labs that focus on computational work that can be performed virtually.  Within the MBB department, Dr. Bhanot is a very interesting prof- his research centers around linking disease types to particular phenotypes using computational methods, cancer bioinformatics, etc.- and   I think he may be open to accepting a freshman.  This is the MBB faculty link for you to explore the research goals of other PIs, though you can also reach out to Genetics and CBN faculty, who will likely be equally as accepting.

For bio, i got a 76 on the first exam but managed to get an A in the class by 1) keeping up with the lectures, like watching them/ taking notes the day they came out and 2) actually reviewing material everyday. In bio 115 they give u A LOT of information and it’s not a hard class to do good in, you just can’t procrastinate and let yourself get behind 

For chem 161, on the other hand, it’s not nearly as much information as bio 115. However, the material can get tricky and basically if you can’t leave it to the day before to study. (unless you’re good at taking tests when u study last minute, i know i wasnt) I got an A by doing tons of practice problems and understanding the ones i got wrong. The tests were not hard if you did the practice and quizzes thoroughly. Basically both of these classes DO require a lot of work, but they’re very doable.

In terms of overlap, the CE track of ECE might interest you since it can have a lot of overlap with CS.

"Pro: affordable (somewhat); AAU school; many opportunities for research; access to world class professors; good facilities overall; a lot of sports to watch; many clubs, affordable ability to sail, power lift, etc that cost a lot in the real world.

Immediate access to a lot of big companies (internships), hospitals in the area. 

Cons: absolutely big school in physical size, students, and administration. Particular professors are difficult to deal with, and can’t be bothered with, or are unbending (true of most big schools I bet). Traffic and the bus system.

"&gt;So why would we do antibody tests, when natural immunity is just not as good as being vaccinated? It makes no sense.

I would contest this point because I find it untrue for several reasons. First, natural immunity provides mucosal immunity, and vaccines are not proven to provide that. Meaning, you can spread through coughing, sneezing, etc. even with the vaccine, but not through natural infection

You also say, ""In regards to our conversation, it is also mentioned in the article that up to 5% of people lose their immunity within a few months"", but as we know the vaccines also only have 95% efficacy, meaning they also have 5% of people who lose their immunity not just in months, but right away. I am also wondering if you can cite the study where you claim, ""There was also a study mentioned in which people who had taken the vaccine had higher levels of antibodies than people who had recovered from infection"", so I can evaluate that further and respond to that

&gt;I’m not trying to decide the best route for someone medically. There is a reason why the vaccines were tested on their ability to protect the individual during clinical trials. We are trying to ensure that less people become sick so they’re not in our hospitals or dying. If you want to take your chances with the virus then by all means go ahead, but medical professionals actively discourage this, and instead are encouraging everyone who can to get vaccinated.

You aren't just encouraging everyone, you are essentially forcing them to if they want to have the same quality of education and experience as others, even those who cannot get vaccinated. If it was just ""Hey students, please get the vaccine, but other wise welcome back to everyone!"" then yeah, that is encouraging; saying ""Either get the vaccine or don't come back to campus"" is essentially forcing them to, especially if they do better with in person learning. It's kind of like saying, ""oh the vaccine isn't mandatory, but in order to travel, shop, go to events, go to school, go to participate in anything in society, then it is""; sure, government agents aren't going to go door to door and hold you down and inject you, but it's looking like either you get the vaccine or are a social outcast that will have to move out into a cabin in the woods and live off the land and do everything remotely

&gt;And while we don’t “enforce” what people eat, at least in the United States tons of money has been spent on ads and campaigns to stop smoking, because smoking affects everyone around you

That's fine, and I support all of that! Blast us with ads promoting the vaccine, that's great! But don't make it a requirement, especially if there is not a logical scientific reason to (i.e. doesn't prevent spread), and it's not FDA approved

&gt;Similarly, if you have covid, you are affecting everyone around you. There are literally places in which you’re not allowed to smoke. So it only makes sense that Rutgers would not want unvaccinated people on campus.

That is a bad analogy because again it's not proven that people with the vaccine don't spread the virus too! If we plug it into your analogy, it would be like if humans all exhaled cigarette smoke when they breathe, regardless of if they smoke or not, if we use the analogy: transmitting virus = exhaling smoke. Basically, the vaccine is only proven to protect the individual, not others around you... Don't know how many times I have to say this to you

&gt;On to your next point, instead of ensuring people don’t become ill and, possibly, do not spread the virus, we’re going to test people and hope nothing bad happens to them or anyone around them if they’re positive? I’m not understanding your argument. There is no chance that you won’t transmit the virus if you’re unvaccinated and become infected. There is a possibility that you are less able to transmit the virus if you’re vaccinated. So why are we taking our chances with the former option? How is vaccinating not the safest possible route?

I am suggesting: Why not give an option for daily covid tests. If your test comes back positive, you are immediately quarantined and go into online class until you pass a negative test. This would be safer, since it would prevent any transmission, since they would catch the infected people right away and quarantine them, compared to allowing vaccinated people who might have the virus to spread it to others on campus

&gt;Also I might add that common side effects of the vaccine are hardly “damaging”, if you compare them to some of the things people have endured after contracting covid. Yes there is a possibility of some rare side effect, but people take that risk all the time whenever they take any medication. You would also be taking the risk that you are unlucky and are killed by the virus if you choose not to vaccinate and then are exposed to covid. So once again, I don’t understand how it makes more sense for people to run around unvaccinated.

This is about personal choice though. Some people may prefer to take the risk of being unvaccinated and either being part of the \~50% of people who are asymptomatic or having a 1% chance of dying (or lower for college student aged individuals), compared to the very high chance of a common vaccine side effect, or the also \~1% chance of rare vaccine side effect. We also don't know what the long term side effects are of the vaccine, so some people might choose 'the devil they know, rather than the devil they don't know', to use a common colloquial analogy",1617057229,1,0

"Waitlist can start coming off in May. Rutgers like other schools usually wait until they have their commitments on May 1st and then see if they have any remaining space in their incoming classes before extending more offers to those on the waitlist. They can’t do much without knowing how many of the admission offers they put out will be accepted. 
Most people end up committing to a back up school in the event they don’t ultimately get rejected from Rutgers. But if they do get off the waitlist, they eat the cost of whatever deposit they made to their other school/let them know you’ll no longer be attending and accept Rutgers/make a deposit to Rutgers.",1617053051,1,0

"Been awhile since I've been on campus, but keep in mind the amount of time it takes to go between classes (Rutgers has 4 campuses, which are separated). You need to walk between buildings (like 5-10 minutes depending on your walking speed and distance), and you need to take the buses between campuses if needed.

[I wrote a bit about the buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/gckhi4/how_bad_is_the_bus_system_at_rutgers/fpc8cq6/) before, but:

- From Livingston to Busch is about 5-10 minutes
- From Busch or Livingston to College Ave is 10-15 minutes
- From Cook/Douglass to any other campus is 20-30 minutes.

This can increase during rush hour, and you also need to account for time spent waiting for a bus to pick you up, etc.

Try to get your classes on the same/preferred campus if it doesn't cause issues, but otherwise keep in mind the commuting time. I've never really paid too much attention to it though, and I was fine during in-person times; webreg doesn't allow you to schedule classes closer than like 20 or 30 minutes between each other anyway.",1617047450,1,0

6. Don’t compare yourself with others, someone will always have a better internship, grades, etc than you. As long as if you are doing better than before you are going in the right direction.

"You're approaching this from the wrong angle, the point of college is to learn more about something you'd like to do for a living (or maybe if you're rich, the point is to just learn more of something you enjoy regardless of the job potential lol) 

Don't look at your major choice as ""what's an easy major that pays"", look at it like ""what do I enjoy doing, what are my strengths, and how can I transfer those skills into something that does pay"".  

You've tried biochem, math, and CS &amp; have been struggling, maybe your strengths don't lie in computation. If you're still interested in technology you can go the ITI route but that would still be a lot of coding, so other options could be tangential majors like cognitive science, communications, or BAIT (although this would require transferring into RBS and dealing with the business core). For all I know you could even have a passion in the humanities or something else and maybe you're just forcing yourself to do STEM for the money, but I'm just going off what you wrote in the post. 

There's also the possibility that you just haven't been studying right (you mention studying all the time but clearly it's not serving you well enough) and you just need to learn how to study smarter, not harder, but if you're on your 3rd major and still struggling then I think it's your major choice that's doing this to you",1612801135,1,0

"I can relate to this so much. It really does suck. I try to push myself everyday despite how hard it is. It sucks because in this school we have such a heavy workload sometimes and with the struggle to be motivated just makes things even harder. I rarely went outside last semester. I’m that type of person who stresses easily and worry about my GPA but for this semester, the best way I stay calm and on top of my work is getting up early and just get started. I turn off my phone and I just try my best to stay on task. But after a few hours, I take a break to play video games or just lay on my bed and relax. It helps more than you think. It’s hard to not worry as you do nothing but by getting up early to work on stuff really stretches out the day and you’ll be able to have time to have breaks. I also make it a goal of mine to stop all school work by a certain time that way I’m not exhausting myself. 

It sucks not seeing friends but it’s been a while for me too. I try using discord to get in a voice call and talk to them, even if it’s only for an hour because it makes you still feel connected.

However, if you don't recognize that with this pandemic it's not just about you (collective), that you also need to care about others then I don't know what else I can say.

"*""Mr. gooseHatet0, what you have just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.""*

For real though -- I'm not entirely sure how increasing the frequency of testing will reduce cheating. Is this working under the assumption that there exists some kind of a risk-reward proposition? *ie. people cheat less on quizzes that mean 2% of your grade and instead focus their efforts on mid-term / finals that may mean 15-20% of their grades* 

But if you move more towards frequent quizzes and less mid-terms / finals, doesn't the value of those quizzes increase? So wouldn't people just start cheating on quizzes that now mean 5% of their grades?

Assuming that cheaters are ""rational actors"" who understand the risk implications is absurd. Colleges and Universities go to such great lengths to punish cheaters that it's literally life changing. It isn't a simple slap-on-the-wrist with a promise to not do it again -- you get **expelled**. That means all the time, money and effort you've put in is wiped clean. To be honest, I don't even know if you can transfer credits from a school you've been kicked out of to another college (if someone wants to look that up and let me know; I'm actually interested in knowing if you can). Literally the best case scenario is hoping that you only fail the course and have to retake it.

As someone in the workforce now, I can tell you that the core skills you develop by **not** cheating are much more important in the long run. There's truth to the fact that I've never had to use half the theories or equations I learned at Rutgers. But what I did get from Rutgers was:

- The ability to **learn**; knowing how I best react to different learning styles (hint: YouTube 2 minute video tutorials aren't always the best answer)
- Confidence in my ability to learn, comprehend, and integrate things I dont know
- Confidence that my work; making sure the end result is done correctly

Cheaters never learn these skills and it will always show. There are people who spend 120% of their time to do 60% of their job. If you think life is tough after college already, just try it when you're starting 3 steps behind everyone else.

Under Modi: 500 million covered under Ayushman Bharat, 350 million have access to bank accounts for the first time, toilet coverage has increased from 40 to 99%, rural electrification has been completed, absolute poverty has gone from 20% in 2014 to 3% today (according to World Poverty Clock/IMF data), DBT (transfers subsidies directly into bank account of farmers - saving an estimated 200 crore in leaks), demonetisation helped file an extra 70 million tax returns.

"**Islamic Destruction of Hindu Temples**


&gt;Name Of The Book: Hindustan Islami Ahad Mein (India under Islamic Rule)

          

&gt;Name Of The Historian: Maulana Abdul Hai.

          

&gt;About The Author: He is a highly respected scholar and taken as an authority on Islamic history. Because of his scholarship and his services to Islam, Maulana Abdul Hai was appointed as the Rector of the Darul Nadwa Ullum Nadwatal-Ulama. He continued in that post till his death in February 1923.


&gt;The following section is taken from the chapter Hindustan ki Masjidein (The mosques of India) of the above mentioned book. Here we can see a brief description of few important mosques in India and how each one of them was built upon plundered Hindu temples.


&gt;a. Qawwat al-Islam Mosque at Delhi: ""According to my findings the first mosque of Delhi is Qubbat al-Islam or Quwwat al-Islam which, Qutubud-Din Aibak constructed in H. 587 after demolishing the Hindu temple built by Prithvi Raj and leaving certain parts of the temple outside the mosque proper; and when he returned from Ghazni in H. 592 he started building, under orders from Shihabud-Din Ghori, a huge mosque of inimitable red stones, and certain parts of the temple were included in the mosque...""


&gt;b. The Mosque at Jaunpur: ""This was built by Sultan Ibrahim Sharqi with chiseled stones. Originally it was a Hindu temple after demolishing which he constructed the mosque. It is known as the Atala Masjid.""


&gt;c. The Mosque at Qanauj: ""It is well known that this mosque was built on the foundations of some Hindu temple that stood here. The mosque was built by Ibrahim Sharqi in H. 809 as is recorded in Gharbat Nigar.""


&gt;d. Jami Masjid at Etwah: ""This mosque stands on the bank of the Jamuna at Etawah. There was a Hindu temple at this place, on the site of which this mosque was constructed. .""

&gt;

e. Babri Masjid at Ayodhya: ""This mosque was constructed by Babar at Ayodhya which Hindus call the birth place of Ramchandraji... Sita had a temple here in which she lived and cooked for her husband. On that very site Babar constructed this mosque in H.963 ""


&gt;f. Mosque at Benaras: ""Mosque of Benares was built by Alamgir Aurangzeb on the site of Bisheshwar Temple. That temple was very tall and held as holy among Hindus. On this very site and with those very stones he constructed a lofty mosque, and its ancient stones were rearranged after being embedded in the walls of the mosque. It is one of the renowned mosques of Hindustan.""


&gt;g. Mosque at Mathura: ""Alamgir Aurangzeb built a mosque at Mathura. This mosque was built on site of the Govind Dev Temple which was very strong and beautiful as well as exquisite.""


These are examples from just one book. There are 21 such books mentioned [here](http://www.stephen-knapp.com/islamic_destruction_of_hindu_temples.htm)",1615959540,1,0
"&gt;Aurangzeb employed a number of means to encourage conversions to Islam.[82] In a Mughal-Sikh war in 1715, **700 followers of Banda Singh Bahadur were beheaded.[83] Every day, 100 Sikhs were executed and not even one of them apostatized from Sikhism.[84] Banda Singh Bahadur was offered a pardon if he converted to Islam.[85] Upon refusal, he was tortured,[86][87] and was killed with his 5 year old son**.[84] Following the execution of Banda, the emperor ordered to apprehend Sikhs anywhere they were found.[85]

If you wanna quote wikipedia, here's what it has to say:

. 

&gt; The other quote

Yes, he was not perfect, far from it. He was ruthless for sure, but nothing points to genocidal or even bad for the time he lived in. The quote you got even says he targeted only a specific sect of Hinduism and most of the temples he destroyed related to establishing his power(removing rebels or putting down political leaders).

Aurangzeb is a controversial figure in modern India, often remembered as a “vile oppressor of Hindus”.[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#cite_note-59) During his rule Aurangzeb expanded the Mughal Empire, conquering much of southern India through long bloody campaigns against non-Muslims. He forcibly converted Hindus to Islam and destroyed Hindu temples.[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAyalon1986271-60)[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#cite_note-61) He also re-introduced the [*jizya*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya), a tax on non-Muslims,[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#cite_note-62) which had been suspended for the previous 100 years.[\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#cite_note-63)

&gt;The number of Hindu temples destroyed or desecrated under Aurangzeb's rule is unclear.[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAvari2013115-65) Aurangzeb issued orders in 1669 to all his governors of provinces to ""destroy with a willing hand the schools and temples of the infidels, and that they were strictly enjoined to put an entire stop to the teaching and practice of idolatrous forms of worship"".[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#cite_note-smith437-66) However, these orders appear to have been directed not toward Hindu temples in general, but towards a more narrowly defined “deviant group”.[\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#cite_note-67) Despite uncertainty regarding the number, Aurangzeb oversaw more desecration of temples than any other Mughal emperor, mostly occurring in the context of conquering new lands and putting down rebellions, punishing political leaders by destroying the temples that symbolized their power.[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#cite_note-68)[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#cite_note-69) Some temples were destroyed entirely; in other cases mosques were built on their foundations, sometimes using the same stones. Idols in temples were smashed, and the city of Mathura was temporarily renamed as Islamabad in local official documents.[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#cite_note-smith437-66)[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#cite_note-70)  
&gt;  
&gt;In some cases, such as towards the end of Mughal era, the violence and persecution was mutual. Hindus too attacked and damaged Muslim tombs, even when the troops had orders not to harm religious refuges of Muslims. These ""few examples of disrespect for Islamic sites"", states Indologist Nicholas Gier, ""pale in comparison to the great destruction of temples and general persecution of Hindus by Muslims for 500 years"".[\[71\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#cite_note-Gier2014p18-71) Sources document brutal episodes of persecution. Sikh texts, for example, document their ""Guru Teg Bahadur accompanying sixteen Hindu Brahmins on a quest to stop Mughal persecution of Hindus; they were arrested and commanded to convert to Islam on pain of torture and death"", states Gier, ""they all refused, and in November 1675, Mati Das was sawed in half, Dayal Das was boiled alive, Sati Das was burned alive, and Teg Bahadar was beheaded.”[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#cite_note-72)

Hindus were actually favourites of Aurangzeb. He used to come celebrate Holi with us and do dance routines during Diwali. He was a borderline drag queen. /S

So what if he stopped us from celebrating our gods and so what if we had to pay Jiaza (taxes) to pray to our gods? So what if he considered himself as a turk rather than a mongol descendant? So what if he managed to destroy our temples and kill off Hindus? So what if his soldiers killed some kids and raped hindu/shia women?

These are the recorded ""so whats"" to tell us throughout history how my great country was being ruled by a Sunni warlord who didn't care about his fellow Muslim Shia brothers let alone care about Hindus.

Some of the stuff that happens on campus will happen at almost every university. Most of it is theft and not to victim blame but youll be surprised how many people just leave their laptops unattended or leave their dorm rooms unlocked. A lot is avoidable if u take the proper precautions. Off campus is more common and esp this year since landlords rented apts to just anyone but its not as common when its mostly students. There isn’t really ever going to be a reason to go into the shadier areas of nb and closer to campus where its mostly students that live there is fine.,1615945092,1,0

"I’d say study the proofs of the theorems before the exam. When I mean study the proof, look for the key idea, instead of memorizing it line by line.

To get a better sense of what’s the main idea, try to change the hypothesis of the theorem. Does the proof still work? Where does the proof go wrong? If you can do this, you will not only get a better feel of the theorem and its proof, but you’ll become a better math student. 

Additionally, make sure to review your homework, when you study. Look at the mistakes you made and see what you could have done better. I’d say for most upper level math classes, the homework is harder than the exams. So if you can do the homework, the exam will be light work. 

So far this has been strictly general math advice. If you want to prep for 311 in particular I’d say start with Abbott’s book. And here are some topics you could brush up on during the summer to prep for the class 

- countability
- induction

For example, you should know why Q is countable but R is uncountable. Here is an exercise:

- Is the set of all finite sequences of integers countable or uncountable? 
- What about the set of all infinite sequences of integers?",1620237116,2,0

However, I do know she was very kind when I asked her any questions and was always willing to help. In your case, I don’t know if the professor can do much because they also have an obligation to many other students.

"Knew people in the 60s that passed this one class.  

After a miscommunication about the exam time length (was told by my proctor i had x, i really had a much smaller amount of time so my pacing ended being so fucked), and an unmoving professor, my grade dropped from a A to a C+ (legitimately a 79). 

I expected since 60s was a C, I’d be fine and get least a B, so I didn’t fight it. I got a C+.

Curving is so fucked.

But last semester, I took my final late because I had Covid. I knew he curved the final by 2 questions (15 points) because of typos. He refused to curve mine even tho he didn’t change anything.

Online lectures might be recorded or asynchronous, that makes it easier to put off a lecture.
