Seeking Medical Professionals/Pre-Med,"Hello, I'm a local student at UNC/NCSU for the joint biomedical program. Due to the extended break, I have free time on my hands and am looking to make as much of a difference as possible in that short amount of time. I could do my orgo assignments but fuck that. 

If you are a medical profession in any way, and have access to pictures/videos of the equipment being used, please contact me. 

I have ample experience in 3D design software, and I recently saw an article about someone 3D printing valves used in resuscitation machines as hospitals in Italy are running low. 

If you have a blueprint even better but a simple ruler by a mask/tube/valve, videos are preferred but multiple angle pictures can work as well. If no ruler is available, estimate the dimension and I will do my best to make it work. 

I want to get as many models up and running before I run out of free time myself, **anything that I make will be made publicly available once I'm finished with it**, if sizing and specification is off I will adjust it immediately. 

If you know anyone, who might have access to any devices as well, **please contact them** and contact me. 3D printed devices do not have to be hard plastic, flexible PLA composites exist too so tubing is possible, so are masks (think CPAP). I've tried searching online but can't find specifications easily, and I don't want to go down the hell hole that is google patent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you, DM me for my email, if necessary I can give out my phone number as well. Lets all get through this together.",1584375764,1,0

Stats Major Class Advice,"So my fall 2020 schedule:

STOR 475 - Fredrick Kelly

STOR 471 - Charles Dunn

ECON 400 - Kevin Allen

Ideally if the schedule turns out too much my plan would be to drop Stor 471 or Econ 420 if I can't manage. I've considered trying to replace Stor 471 with Stor 555 with Carlstein. 

Context for Stor 471 is I'm interested in pursuing actuarial science after I graduate and I'm taking exam P this summer. I'm a 2019 Junior transfer student and signed up for 471 because I thought fall 2020 would be my last chance to take it, but adding the whole COVID craziness/possible fall semester online I've decided I'll definitely be adding an extra semester, maybe two, so I'll have Fall 2021. I'm just worried that taking it so soon will be pointless because obviously I'm not taking LTAM after Exam P, and I've heard the class is brutal.

Also, did anyone take Fredrick Kelly for the actuarial class Fall 2019? Apparently it's the same class, just a different number. The 3:30 - 6:30pm Tuesday class.

Any information regarding deferral for PhD (CS) fall 2020 admits?,"Hi. So, I'm not a UNC student but am hopeful to be one next year as I plan to apply for the CS PhD program this year.

As many people know, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing a lot of crap and many schools are offering newly admitted students the option to defer.

I've been looking around the Web but couldn't find any information regarding PhD degrees (or MS degrees) being granted deferral for UNC, even though I've found information for undergrad.

Does anyone know if the option's been given? I'm just a little anxious as I've been wanting to attend UNC for a while and the rumors of competition spiking are getting to me. :( Thanks!",1588342624,1,0
HELP! I need to decide between UNC and a local school in a few hours,"I literally have a few hours to decide between UNC-CH and Saint Louis University (close to home). I'm premed, out-of-state, an international student (although I've lived in the US for several years), and plan to major in Biology while doing research. I have to pay full tuition to attend UNC, but since my goal is to get into an MD/PhD or PhD program as an international student, I was wondering if UNC's prestige and research opportunities make up for the high cost. Where do you think I should attend? Here is a pro/con list:

**UNC:**

Pros:

1. Literally amazing research opportunities
2. Lots of volunteering/shadowing opportunities
3. Prestige (huge for me because I'm an international student applying to MD/PhD and PhD programs which prefer us to be graduates of high ranked institutions)
4. Great campus and community spirit

Cons:

1. Grade deflation (bio major)
2. Competitive? (especially for pre meds)
3. Lack of personalized premed advising
4. Very expensive (I would have to take out 20k (total) in loans, granted I won't have to pay for MD/PhD and PhD programs after undergrad)

**SLU:**

Pros:

1. I can save a lot of money (about 90k) (Do you think UNC's prestige is worth this?)
2. Lots of volunteering and clinical experience opportunities
3. Lots of personalized attention as I'm in the Medical Scholars Program and the Honors program so I'll have a lot of advising
4. Freedom to spend money on medical service trips and other opportunities
5. Easier to get a high GPA

Cons:

1. Very low prestige (I've emailed lots of MD/PhD admission directors and a lot of them told me some programs might ""perceive the experiences of UNC to be that of higher caliber"" than SLU
2. Mediocre research opportunities (professors may not be well known in their fields which might make it difficult for MD/PhD admissions)
3. Very low campus spirit and sense of community
4. Very close to home (might not be able to get the full college experience even though I will be living on campus)

Please let me know what you opinion is and what you think of UNC's prestige factor, grade deflation, pre med advising etc.

I greatly appreciate any help!!!",1588331307,1,0

**CURRENT NC STATS**

* 10k+ cases
* 384 deaths
* 5,700 tests done yesterday

**SOME OF THE LARGEST LAYOFFS IN THE STATE**

* HMSHost (a catering company for Charlotte airport) - 815
* Great Wolf Lodge (an indoor water park my family enjoys) - 626
* Hooters - 416
* Cheesecake Factory - 376
* Walmart - 285
* Kanki Japanese Steakhouse - 220

**""SUSTAINED LEVELING"" IS THE NEW ""PEAK""**

The basic idea had been to reopen once we were about two weeks past the peak. And that's still the official guidance from the White House.

But the problem is the more we've flattened the curve the more we've pushed out the peak. Different models show different peaks, but some of them now take us out to late June (at least for Mecklenburg).

So we readjusted. We want to keep people safe AND provide a pathway to successfully reopening. The new position is, ""Ok, as long as we've basically flattened the curve for a couple weeks, we'll start to carefully reopen.""

That means that the new goal is ""sustained leveling."" We're looking for leveling in a handful of [metrics](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/covid19/covid-19-nc-case-count), not just infections. (The truth is, we're still strictly rationing our tests due to multiple bottlenecks and material shortages, so we really can't base policy just on infection rates.)

One of those key metrics is hospitalizations. Here's where we are:

[Data source: NC DHHS](https://preview.redd.it/3ymqq6oot0w41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ef556a85e0714ca3d4e4060086680b3f51a1ca0)

Except for a small uptick yesterday, you can see some decent leveling here. That's positive - and it's also why hospitals have slowly resumed elective surgeries. The sudden halt in almost all elective surgeries cost our state's health care system nearly $1b last month, with rural hospitals getting hit the hardest.

Another key metric is testing. NC DHHS says they want to see testing average of 5,000 - 7,000 people per day. As you can see from this chart, we've only gotten into that range five times in the last month.

[Data source: NC DHHS](https://preview.redd.it/e3zfl24qt0w41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b585baf9d5a9091b5e82f416535849bf1d47bc0)

There's also some cautious optimism around LabCorp's new at-home COVID test, which just received FDA approval. They FedEX you the material you need to collect a nasal swab, you mail it back to them, and you check your results online. Initially, these tests will only be available to health care and front-line workers, but LabCorp believes it will be able to go wider in the next few weeks. (They may also do at-home antibody tests to determine if you've already had COVID, but this test is a molecular test to determine if you're currently infected).

**BIPARTISAN COVID RELIEF BILL PASSES SENATE UNANIMOUSLY**

Yesterday was our second day back in session. We passed a $1.4B COVID relief bill that was constructed in a very bipartisan way. A lot of input was given and taken from different groups.

This bill is essentially our first round of spending the $3.5b we just got from the federal government to help fund our COVID response. We aren't spending it all at once, but this first round will be the single biggest piece.

Here's the summary:

https://preview.redd.it/lzibgcort0w41.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8b090b6cdfe9cbbf84e4ab9b299030b47f1071e

Important note: This is not final. This is just the senate bill. The house has their own version, which is broadly similar but contains a few major differences. When we pass a final, combined bill I'll do a post that lays out the details.

**Quick items**

* Both the house and senate bill will have funding for small business loans. These loans will be administered by the Golden Leaf Fund. The original fund of $15m has been depleted, which is why we are going to re-fund and significantly expand it. I expect that within the next ten days or so you'll be able to go [here](https://www.goldenleaf.org/news/golden-leaf-deploys-15m-for-nc-covid-19-rapid-recovery-loan-program/) to apply. Many people are rightfully concerned about making sure these loans actually go to small businesses, unlike what we saw with the federal program. We included restrictions to make sure that happens.
* There is [some talk](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article242374691.html) among the majority party of a partial, temporary expansion of Medicaid specifically for the testing and treatment of COVID patients. Full-scale medicaid expansion will not occur this year due to opposition by senate leadership.
* We are [reopening](https://www.wbtv.com/2020/04/08/nc-hospital-reopening-alleviate-expected-surge-covid-patients/) a hospital in Richmond County that was closed three years ago and prepping it as a COVID surge facility.
* Over 900 members of our National Guard are helping to transport PPE and food across the state.
* We haven't addressed car inspections yet but I believe we will soon. N.C. Highway Patrol is [not prioritizing](https://www.journalnow.com/news/local/vehicle-inspections-continue-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic-state-legislators-will-soon-consider-extending-deadlines/article_acbe8122-844b-58be-9ef3-89eccdd4af81.html) the enforcement of inspections right now.
* Under current law, schools can’t start earlier than the Monday closest to August 26. The senate bill passed yesterday [moves](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article242368971.html) the allowable starting date up to August 17. By contrast, the Governor would rather give school districts the ability to make their own decisions about start dates. This is a perennial issue in the General Assembly, but it's taken on more urgency now.
* We've hired 250 contact tracers with plans to hire another 250.
* An early version of the senate's COVID bill included a section that said teachers needed to prove that their online instruction would get the same outcomes as in-person instruction. Teachers rightfully called that unrealistic and the section was [amended](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article242368971.html) to say that remote learning plans must have “work measurement guidelines appropriate to each grade level."" There is also discussion about waiving the required K-3 class size reduction next year, as this is essentially an unfunded mandate handed down by the state and counties are going to be resource-starved.
* A [new drug](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article242379241.html) that is showing promise at treating COVID patients was created at the labs at UNC-CH. Dr. Fauci said the new drug ""has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect."" It's still being tested.

You're going to see a lot of activity from the state legislature over the next two weeks. I hope we can keep the bipartisanship going. I'll keep you posted.

More soon,

Sen. Jeff Jackson",1588281179,1,0

401/402 Language Classes,"Hey y’all, I’m thinking about taking a 401 level language class next year and would like some advice on it if anyone has taken these classes (for those who aren’t familiar, these classes teach two semesters of language in one).

In regards to these classes, I don’t want to do too much, so maybe a max of 1 hour of hw per session, obviously more for projects, and I’d like to take something that would be an easy A, but also fun.

Right now, I'm looking at a bachelor's in computer science. Do you have any suggestions or events to look out for, or any other tips on internships and classes and prereqs? What are some cool extracurriculars to join? Are CS students generally busy / is the work manageable?

What are some of the nice places on campus to check out for getting work done?

I'm also trying to build my schedule now in Coursicle - how many credits/classes do you suggest taking per semester? My classes right now are looking like I have five courses on Tuesdays and Thursdays and none on the others. Is that sustainable or should I try for a better balance?

UNC vs CMC,"Hello - this is my first post on here. I applied EA to UNC OOS and got accepted into the Honors program. I was waitlisted at CMC, but I was just taken off of the waitlist and accepted.

I love sports and would be able to try out for the UNC club soccer team, but I could run on the varsity track team at CMC. Any help is appreciated.

What I want: Major in Econ, school spirit, great academics, able to make friends, good athletics, professors know me (feel like I matter), enthusiastic students, nice dorms.

What I don't want: Get ""lost"" in the crowd and become just a number, have to be a ""frat boy"" to be cool and make friends, cyclical day and nothing to do, boring students / students don't care.

UNC:

\-Positives: 1) Amazing spirit 2) Probably play club soccer 3) Great sports 4) Lots of stuff to do

\-Negatives: 1) Lots of grad students, so the undergrads might be a second priority 2) Classes might be a lot larger 3) I might get ""lost"" and become a number

CMC

\-Positives: 1) 3rd best Econ school in the country 2) Can run varsity track 3) Athenaeum 4) Small classes 5) great weather

\-Negatives: 1) Drinking culture? 2) Becoming bored / too stressed with work 3) Not enough people to meet?

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I am very lucky that cost does not factor into my decision.

Thank you so much for the advice (I'm really stressing haha).

TLDR: I got accepted into UNC honors OOS and had my heart set on it for years. I was called yesterday by CMC telling me I got off of the waitlist and am accepted. I have to make the decision by Monday.

I literally can't enroll in any classes!?!??,"I only got into 1 class, which doesn't count for my gen eds or major. There's an error for nearly all my classes in the shopping cart saying ""You are unable to enroll in this class at this time. Available seats are reserved"" and I don't know why or how to figure out what classes I CAN enroll in.

I tried the online chat for advising and they told me to go to drop in hours which starts in an hour but I'm really concerned I won't be able to get into any classes that count towards my major.

I'm a CS major that's taking COMP 110 over the summer, and will be manually enrolled by my advisor into COMP 210. I don't think there are any COMP classes I can take fall semester. I'm also a INLS major but I haven't applied to the school yet, so I have to waitlist, even then they're all full or they won't' let me waitlist. I'm almost done with my gen eds, I only have like 3 left (I'm freshman rn) but even then, I can't enroll in like classes in the 100's or 200's because of that error.

Questions from an OOS and Entrepreneurial Admitted Student,"Hello! I don't want to bother y'all, but I think this is a great place to ask questions. I am an admitted student into UNC from Wisconsin and I am currently trying to figure out where I should attend college next year. I have many great options, including my home state school, UW-Madison, and two amazing private schools in WashU and Notre Dame. This is a grueling decision because all of the schools are different costs, so It's hard to just compare apples to apples. My parents are supporting me financially in college, but for example, UNC is still 20k more a year than UW-Madison. I am looking to go into business, but I definitely am looking for a school where interdisciplinary pursuits are possible, as I am interested in more creative studies and have a lot of AP credits. I am into the business schools at my other choices, but I am not direct admit into Kenan-Flagler, so it scares me a little bit that Kenan-Flagler is so competitive and a whole new application. Here are some overall questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How much consideration should I put into the idea of not getting into the Kenan-Flagler?
2. What is Kenan-Flagler's national job placement? Is it more national or regional? For example, If I want to work in California, does UNC and Kenan-Flagler have the connections to help me get a job out there?
3. Do you think UNC is worth the extra 20k compared to a still great, but slightly lesser UW-Madison?
4. Is there an entrepreneurship presence on campus and if so, how does that manifest?

All Summer Courses moving to Online: P/F policy extended through Summer,"As the University continues to respond to the Coronavirus pandemic, based on guidance provided by the UNC System Office, we are reaching out to update you regarding [Summer School](https://summer.unc.edu/). In order to continue to mitigate the spread of the virus and keep our campus safe, we have determined that all Summer 2020 courses (Maymester, Summer I and Summer II) will be delivered only through remote instruction. To allow greater opportunity for students to progress to degree, we will allow them to enroll in 9 credits in Summer I and 9 credits in Summer II, without requiring approval from their dean.

Please note that the College of Arts &amp; Sciences will suspend the regular “no pass/fail” Summer School grading policy and will extend the Spring 2020 [Emergency Grading Accommodation](https://registrar.unc.edu/files/2020/03/emergency-grading-accomodation.pdf) through the Summer 2020 terms.

**CURRENT STATS (as of 4/1 at 2:00 p.m.)**

1,600+ cases

26,000+ tests completed

200+ hospitalizations

10 deaths

NC has roughly 2,800 ventilators (more on the way) with 2,100 currently available

[You see that bend at the top? Can't call it a trend yet but it's certainly encouraging.](https://preview.redd.it/suuhv7xq29q41.png?width=1365&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1dfb33104caeb7aa856484d637b9c2d6a35b2f8)

**HOW BAD WILL THIS BE IN NC?**

There’s a new estimate of how bad this is likely to get in NC and I want to share it with you - not because I’m certain it’s completely accurate, but because it’s the best effort that’s been made public and it gives us at least a sense of what we’re in for.

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://preview.redd.it/fv13trms29q41.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3808bf75cc9e2642fc2edb03034688562dd36207)

This is a chart of the expected demand for ICU beds in North Carolina and it basically says that if we keep doing what we’re doing - keep schools and non-essential businesses closed and keep our stay home order in place - then we’re going to hit peak infection in late April.

The dotted line shows that we may be on course to exceed our ICU bed capacity (which is actually a little bit higher than this chart depicts - we've got about 800 currently available). But the shaded area is essentially the margin of error for the prediction, so we’ve got a wide range between not exceeding capacity and dramatically exceeding it - which would mean a spike in the mortality rate.

What does this tell us? It tells us **we still have the time and ability** to minimize the loss of life in our state.

To be blunt: We are not going to have widespread testing. There are lots of reasons for that - none of which have to do with our state and all of which have to do with the federal response - but it’s a reality. We’re still using tests and they're very important, but we're not going to test our way out of this like South Korea did. We just didn't get enough test kits fast enough.

But - despite that major setback - it’s still possible to minimize the loss of life in our state by making sure we don’t max out the ICU beds. We just have to take social distancing very seriously for the next several weeks. In this model, OUR BEHAVIOR is the biggest variable. How seriously WE take this will ultimately determine the mortality rate.

**Quick List**

* We’ve only received 17% of the PPE that we requested from the federal government. That’s not good, and it’s why we’re sourcing from everywhere we can find and working with North Carolina manufacturers to switch production to PPE if at all possible.
* The state’s unemployment insurance website and call center are still facing a nightmarish traffic jam as they get slammed with 50x the normal traffic, but we are adding servers and contracted with an additional call center to help field calls. If you’re having serious trouble, please fill out this customer contact form: [https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form](https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form).
* Regarding the federal unemployment benefit that just passed, it will be administered by the state. We’re still waiting on implementation guidance from the federal Department of Labor, at which point benefits will be paid in about two weeks. Independent contractors and people who are self-employed will qualify for the federal benefit - they do not currently qualify for the state benefit. I know the state website isn’t set up to receive applications from people who are contractors or self-employed and that’s part of what we need to fix. If you fall into this category, just file the application as best you can.
* Gov. Cooper’s new executive order means no one can shut off your electricity, gas, or water for at least the next 60 days.
* The U.S. Corps of Engineers is helping us scout for places that could be used as hospital expansions.
* We've launched a hotline to help critical workers connect with child care (888-600-1685).

Chances of Getting Into Grad School As Transfer?,"Hi everyone! I'm currently a junior at App State majoring in PR and would really like to go to UNC for grad school.

I currently have a 3.81 GPA, am the president of a mental health organization on campus along with being in the Popular Programming Society and am trying to get a nice PR-related internship for the summer to make my resume look wonderful. I already have multiple letters of recommendation lined up and am trying (this is somewhat unlikely though) to get published so I can have the best possible application ready for when next semester rolls around!

"Update: New testing rules, mitigation phase, hospitals gearing up, National Guard - Sen. Jeff Jackson"," 

https://preview.redd.it/esne972ug2p41.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab386f48e363aa5c2210bf9930cc75275f7b63ae

**CURRENT STATS (as of 3/26 at 1:00 p.m.)**

690 cases (182 more than yesterday)

50+ hospitalizations

1 death

**NEW TESTING RULES**

There has been a major change in who qualifies to get a coronavirus test in North Carolina and it means a broad strategic shift in how we're waging this public health battle.

When it comes to testing, our state - along with the rest of the country - has three critical shortages:

1. the test kits
2. necessary components, like extraction kits and swabs (believe it or not, the main manufacturer for the swabs is in Lombardy, Italy...), and
3. the masks/gowns/gloves necessary to perform the tests.

The good news is we've made real strides in the last ten days with private labs coming online. 90% of the testing in our state is now being done by private labs and we're doing more testing per capita than most states.

Here's the bad news. Even with this added capacity, the CDC anticipates that the demand for testing will continue to outpace supply. So the CDC has put out new guidance on criteria for testing, and NC has adopted that new criteria.

And the short version is this, direct from [DHHS](https://files.nc.gov/ncdhhs/documents/files/covid-19/COVID-19-Provider-Guidance-03-23-20-Final.pdf): ""In general, patients with mild illness (defined as fever and cough without shortness of breath or difficulty breathing) do not need testing.""

So the old qualification was: fever + negative flu test + cough OR shortness of breath.

The new qualification is: fever + negative flu test + cough AND shortness of breath (or other serious symptom).

That means if you're a middle-aged, reasonably healthy person and you develop mild, flu-like symptoms and think you may be infected, the new guidance is to call your doctor, at which point your doctor will likely tell you to assume you're infected and self-quarantine until you've been fever-free for three days (unless your condition worsens, in which case call your doctor again).

That's a major shift in combating this virus, and it dramatically increases the importance of social distancing. As DHHS says, ""We are moving to a different phase of our response efforts \[and are now focused on\] mitigation strategies"" in which a big part of the goal is ""to conserve supplies and capacity so our health care workers can care for people who need medical attention even during the peak of the outbreak.""

Let's be honest about what that means: It means we are not going to have the type of widespread testing we would ideally have because we just don't have the supplies, nor - at this point - the time. It's not good news, but it is a realistic assessment of where things stand.

If we're not going to beat this the way South Korea did (test -&gt; trace -&gt; isolate) then we have no choice but to beat this by not getting sick in the first place - or at least not all at once - which means social distancing is our only real, scalable strategy at this point. It's the only lever big enough that - if we pull it really hard - will actually flatten the curve and keep our hospitals from being overwhelmed, as we're starting to see in NYC. We're on to Plan B, and there is no Plan C. So we have to make this work.

**STAY AT HOME ORDERS**

That's why you're starting to see stay at home orders on the county and city level (Mecklenburg + Wake + Orange + Durham + Pitt + Madison + Buncombe + Winston-Salem + Clemmons + Beaufort), and why you're going to see more, and why we may see similar statewide action soon. In response to whether there would be a statewide shelter in place, the Governor recently said, ""We will be issuing additional restrictions soon.""

**GEARING UP - HOSPITAL BEDS**

* Hospitals are looking at sites for possible rapid expansion, if necessary.
* They are stressing telehealth as much as possible to free up space.
* They are canceling elective surgeries - some more quickly than others. Our hospitals are typically 85% full, so getting that number down really matters. Progress on that front has been mixed. We're not where we need to be yet, but that's because we have many hospitals - especially in rural areas - that are barely getting by. They are essentially waiting until the last minute to cancel procedures that help them bring in revenue and keep the doors open. However understandable that may be, we're reaching the point where we really need to make sure we have maximum bed availability, so more formal (i.e., mandatory) guidance may be coming to instruct a more rapid transition.

**GEARING UP - PPE**

The bottom-line here is we're doing everything we can to get our hands on more PPE (personal protective equipment = masks/gloves/gowns).

1. We're getting it from the federal government. We've received two shipments already, with more coming.
2. We're buying it ($66m worth of orders, but much is back-ordered due to demand).
3. We're working with North Carolina manufacturers to start making what we need.
4. We're asking citizens to donate any PPE they may have (email [BEOC@ncdps.gov](mailto:BEOC@ncdps.gov) if you've got some, or if you're near a Novant hospital you can also email [donatesupplies@NovantHealth.org](mailto:donatesupplies@NovantHealth.org)).
5. [UNC Health](https://www.unchealthcare.org/coronavirus/ways-to-help/) is accepting homemade masks made of tightly woven cotton. 

**UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE**

The economic piece of this crisis is starting to come into view, and it's incredibly serious. Over the last ten days, North Carolina has received over 150,000 unemployment claims. We're used to seeing about 3k per week.

And check out the historical comparison (and that last bar is actually 50% higher now due to new data...):

https://preview.redd.it/k34icd3vg2p41.jpg?width=1257&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11e9afc5eef1f72fd3fc56e21a6d8feeea01cf94

That means there are three things about our state's unemployment insurance we need to fix immediately:

**1) The website/call center**

We are adding capacity quickly but I'm still getting reports (as recently as while I was writing this) that folks can't get through. This is a known problem and we're working on it. If you need to file a claim, it's [des.nc.gov](http://des.nc.gov/) or (888) 737-0259. They encourage you to apply online if possible, and the process usually takes about 20 minutes. The earliest you will receive benefits is two weeks.

**2) The size/duration of the benefits**

Most states offer up to 26 weeks of unemployment insurance. North Carolina caps it at 12 weeks - 49th in the nation.

Nationally, the average weekly benefit is $378/week. North Carolina's average payment is $277/week - 41st in the nation.

That means right now the average North Carolinian on unemployment gets just under $2,300, spread out over two months. Looking at the chart above, you can tell that's not going to be enough.

**3) Who qualifies for benefits**

In North Carolina, only 10% of unemployed people qualify for unemployment insurance - again, 49th in the nation.

That's going to have to change. For starters, we are certainly going to have to include independent contractors, the self-employed, and nonprofit workers, which we currently don't.

The good news is that the federal stimulus that looks like it's about to pass in D.C. has a major UI component that does a lot of what we need to do. But it's still up to the state legislature to do some real work to make sure we maximize our eligibility for new federal funds for those who are now out of work. Fortunately, at this point, there appears to be a strong bipartisan interest in doing that, so I'm optimistic on this front.

**NATIONAL GUARD**

They've been activated, but only to supply logistical and transportation support. I happen to be in the National Guard, and I was given a heads up that I might be called in. If I am, I'll let you know.

**NEAR-TERM GOALS**

This is all about buying time for our hospitals to gear up. Every day we stay healthy is another day we give them to prepare to take care of those of us who will become seriously ill. It's rare that our country so rapidly shifts to a single point of focus, but we're there. Flattening the curve is what we do now, it's who we are for this moment in time. We still have time to get this right in North Carolina.

More updates soon,

UNC Frat ranks with description Fall 2020,"
Big Four
All are pretty rich, with brothers mostly from private schools up north or around Charlotte. DKE and Beta party a lot more than the others do. Fiji is known to be the handsomest fraternity but throw very few parties. Supposed to have good tailgates though. DKE also has a stigma around it with some girls, but they still pull a lot though so it’s whatever. Probably the richest of the four and a pretty sweet basement. Coke is very prevalent here. The brotherhoods in phi delt and beta is rumored to be kinda questionable. Beta is also known to engage in some pretty fruity stuff during pledging but no way to be sure. Phi Delt is on probation currently but should be off before long. If you aren't willing to pay 10k+ per year for dues then don't bother pledging here. Probably wont be able to get in without knowing at least one brother already. Also almost entirely white (I think there’s one indian in all of big 4)

Sig Nu and Sig Chi
Very similar in terms of status. Sig Nu guys seem a lot douchier though. Sig chi also has a larger jewish membership. Both throw good parties frequently and have good sorority relations. Sig Chi’s pledging is also known to be very hard. Sig Nu’s brotherhood isn’t that great as a lot of the brothers don’t like each other. Both nice and large houses on BFC. Sig nu is probably historically better and a little richer but sig chi has definitely caught up. They get along nicely for some reason (prolly because they are so close to PiKA) 

Chi Psi
They Don’t party that often. The smartest frat by far with the most moreheads. However, this makes some of them kinda awkward. Still have good sorority relations (mixed with tri delt) Their dues are up there with the big four though. Really nice house/lodge with a huge parking lot for tailgates. Rush is kinda different from most of the other frats

Kappa Sig
Not the nicest house but it’s had some recent renovations. Party very frequently, only rivaled by Pika in terms of frequency. The late nights are known to be pretty solid. In LFC so sometimes collaborates with the others for a courtyard party for Halloween and LDOC. These are known to be some of the best parties of the year. Sorority relations are not very good compared to the ones above but they have improved a lot in the last year. They had a strong spring pledge class and seem to be on the up. 

ATO
Might be on probation in the fall for hazing (someone snitched). Nice house, it looks like a castle. Near the sororities and because of this they have better sorority relations than they probably would otherwise (just like Pi Kapp) . They make relatively good grades, don’t party too often, and their pledging is known to be tough. 

Pi Kapp
Another house that lives close to the sororities back on rosemary. They are similar to ATO but with a less nice house (still pretty nice). Their parties aren’t like the other frat parties, instead of a club/rave type party it’s more of a relaxed environment. They are one of the smartest  frats and have a good balance goin on. Good sorority relations but not as good as ATO.

PiKA
These pika studs are known to party frequently. They have a huge rivalry with Sig Chi with lots of hate on both sides. On BFC. They don’t have as good of sorority relations as sig chi. Their guys are kinda douchey but not as much as sig nu. They have more of a skater vibe. Not really respected by other frats and also kinda hated by them. Lack of respect isn't because they aren’t good (like pi lam) but more because of pika's general attitude. Probably could be labeled as party animals. They also had a monopoly over the basketball players this year for some reason. They were always hanging out at their house. (Luck Forenzo btw)

Zete 
It’s an alright frat, their late nights sometimes suck. They sort of have the elitist mentality that a lot of big 4 frats and Sig nu have yet they are middle tier. They don’t have as good of sorority relations as they used to (heard something happened at a cocktail, idk if it’s true) They are also known to be racist, spray painting the n word on pi lams house, having a confederate flag in the house. They don’t get along with the other houses on LFC. Both Kappa Sig and Pi Lam hate them. Strong alumni and history though. Call them zeta to piss them off. 

Pi Lam
They throw decent parties. On LFC and the most diverse frat as well. The guys are really friendly. Some of them are pretty weird though. Not bad guys or anything, just not classy at all. Pretty much no other frat respects them but they have kind of a little brother dynamic with kappa sig. They have almost no sorority relations and are the least respected frat besides the bottom tier.  

AEPi
I honestly do not know much about this frat. It’s on BFC, it’s a Jewish fraternity. The saying is that AEPi is for Jews and Sig chi is for Jews who fuuuuuuck. So I guess AEPi doesn’t fuuuuuck. I heard their parties are fun sometimes I guess idk lol. 

SAE/ Chi Phi
SAE has a huge stigma around it, worse than DKE. Sororities can’t go there at all (Sexual Assault Expected). On BFC. They are no longer affiliated with the university. I heard their probation is being slowly lifted though and they can throw darties again. Idk about actual parties though. Used to be high tier right below big 4. 
Chi Phi is a dead fraternity, they also used to be high tier until an accident happened that allegedly killed a pledge. They still have brothers and might still mix with sororities, I am not sure. Pretty much only have events during fall rush. Cool house though and right next to Phi Delt. 

Bottom: Every other frat isn’t worth even making a description of. DU, Lamda, Alpha Sig, Delta Chi. I heard Delta Chi is getting the Sig Ep house which is a good location and one of the nicest houses so maybe in a couple years there will be a new player on the block. 


This was made for people thinking of rushing in the future and these descriptions won’t be relevant in a couple years. But the tier and respect of the frat isn’t important, it’s all about whether or not you get along with the other brothers. I’m sure there are a lot of Pi Lam brothers that are happier than the Sig Nu brothers because they are surrounded with people they actually like. Just rush at several frats and see where you fit in the best.",1585187989,1,0

"UPDATE: Testing numbers, shelter in place, hospital capacity, unemployment numbers, protective equipment - Sen. Jeff Jackson"," 

https://preview.redd.it/u8s80jpxy2o41.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=772600234ac0542ff882e4cb392211ce5b92fb22

**Testing update**

As of 3/21 at 2:00 p.m., we have 239 positive cases in NC - that's an increase of 102 cases from yesterday.

That's a nearly 60% increase in one day.

**BUT** we also had a 60% increase in testing yesterday, from 3242 to 5,276 tests conducted (that includes our state lab and non-state sources like hospitals and commercial labs).

That tells us three things:

1. As many suspected, more testing is leading to a higher case count - but that's not reassuring. While the higher case count may not, by itself, indicate that the actual size of the total infected population is growing at the same rate as the confirmed cases (i.e., a 60% daily increase in confirmed cases may not indicate a 60% increase in the total infected population), the sheer number of people who are being confirmed positive each day does suggest that rapid growth is nonetheless occurring. And that's what is driving concern about hospital capacity.
2. Our efforts to ramp up testing are working. We still have a shortage of extraction kits (which are needed to make the test kits work) and we have an even bigger shortage of the masks/gloves/gowns that medical workers need to do the tests, but test capacity has dramatically improved - and that's largely due to non-state sources expanding their capacity. Nearly 40% of all the testing we've done in North Carolina happened \*yesterday.\*
3. Even with this increase in testing capacity, it’s important to note that no one thinks we are going to see the kind of widespread testing they used in South Korea to help trace, isolate, and ultimately contain the spread. Because of how much time has gone by, we’re going to have to rely on a combination of testing and social distancing. That means if we don't - as individuals - heavily commit to social distancing, then we are essentially allowing our hospitals to be overwhelmed. There's no third option here. Testing won't be enough.

**There are so many other updates I'm just going to do the rest in bullet-point form:**

* Students are certainly not coming back to school on April 1st. There is a real possibility that the school year is now over. If that happens, I don't know what it would mean for summer camps. As a parent with three kids at home right now, believe me when I tell you I'm tracking this issue just as closely as any of you. I would expect an announcement relatively soon.
* At this time, there is no intent to issue a shelter in place order. It remains an option, but currently NC DHHS has not made that recommendation to the Governor and that's why it hasn't happened. That could very well change in a matter of days. It would be prudent to plan around that possibility.
* There is currently no intent to add more businesses to the closure list but there may be some guidance coming for hair/nail salons.
* It has been repeatedly emphasized to state leaders by our food industry folks that the food supply chain is good. Basically, folks who own grocery stores are telling us that there will not be a shortage and you don't need to hoard food. Just shop when you need to and try and keep your distance from folks. Act like the calm, reasonable people you normally are when you're in a grocery store.
* Many steps are being taken to surge our hospital capacity. Our hospital beds are usually 85% full. That needs to change very quickly. Hospitals have already started canceling non-elective procedures. The state hasn't issued a formal order to that effect, but may do so if needed. (By the way, an ""elective"" procedure is one that cannot wait four weeks without causing serious harm to the patient.) The state medical board is waiving certain licensure requirements to allow medical professionals to cross state lines to work here and re-activating retired doctors and nurses.
* Child care facilities are now considered an extension of our health care system. We need them to stay in operation so health care workers (and other front-line workers) can continue showing up to work. So we are mapping all child care facilities within five miles of every hospital so health care workers know they have that option. Important note: These facilities are not limited to health care and front-line workers, but those workers (and children who are homeless or in an otherwise unsafe environment) will be prioritized if a shortage arises. BUT right now we have the opposite problem. About half of our state's child care centers have voluntarily closed and of the half that are open they are only about half full because parents have pulled their kids out. So we are talking to the federal government about getting some funding to make sure these facilities can afford to stay open.
* Last week our state processed 41,000 unemployment claims - a record. (More to come from me on state and federal plans for getting money to people quickly. Many plans under discussion. I need to learn more before giving you a sense of what I think is likely.)
* We've had so many people call 911 with COVID questions that we decided to create a stand-alone number. So please call 211 with your COVID questions.
* Like the federal government, we are moving the due date for state taxes to July 15. However, right now the interest on what you may owe will still start accruing on April 15. Why? Because legally we can’t use an executive order to change the interest accrual piece. We need a new state law for that and that can’t happen without the General Assembly meeting. Which brings us to another point...
* The General Assembly isn’t scheduled to go back into session until April 28th. We could call a special session - and many of us think it would be appropriate - but there has been vocal concern among some of our members about all of us meeting together in the same room. Right now, there is no procedure for remote voting.
* We are working hard to procure masks/gloves/gowns for our health care workers. So far we have been able to fulfill the requests made by counties but we see this as a serious issue and it is a major focal point for DHHS.
* There is some discussion of bringing in some National Guard soldiers to help with warehousing and transporting supplies and equipment where it is needed. At this point, that's the extent of their involvement.

**Final thought**

When this is over, one of the things that will have changed in our society is our concept of who our heroes are. We're used to seeing doctors and nurses and teachers in that light - and they certainly deserve it. But we're also seeing that we are only as strong as our checkout clerks, our sanitation workers, our delivery drivers. Some of these people have never worked harder - or at greater personal risk - than right now. Without them, everything truly would come to a halt.

Pass/fail,"If I declared a course pass/fail before the deadline does it still count towards my major?

SPRING 2020 UPDATED PASS/FAIL POLICY,"As of March 23, 2020, UNC will expand the pass/fail option for undergraduate students. **Undergraduate students can choose the pass/fail option for undergraduate courses in which they are registered in the Spring 2020 semester.** Students, including undergraduates, enrolled in professional schools or programs in the Graduate School will follow the decisions of their professional school or of the Graduate School about which courses, if any, are eligible for pass/fail declaration.

How this Accommodation Applies to Undergraduate Students 

* All courses will be graded as normal (letter grades). Undergraduates can choose to make their courses pass/fail for the Spring 2020 semester with the exception of Graduate or professional school courses, which can be taken as pass/fail only when deemed appropriate by the program or school Dean.
   * Ex. An undergraduate in the School of Education would need to confer with their Dean or designee to validate whether or not an education course can be placed on pass/fail due to licensure concerns.   
* The current policies on courses that would be declared pass/fail will be suspended for the Spring 2020 semester.
*  **A grade of pass will not be factored into the GPA; however, these courses will count towards earned semester hours.**  
*  **Courses graded as pass/fail under this exception during Spring 2020 will count towards applicable curricular, major, continuation, and graduation requirements.**
*  Consistent with the current criteria for students who opted for pass/fail grading, **letter grades of A‐D would be converted to a pass.** F grades will be converted to a fail. 
* Consistent with the current criteria for students who opt for pass/fail grading, **faculty members will not be aware of students who elect the pass/fail grading option when entering final grades.** Grades will be entered in the format for which the course was approved (letter grades).   
* Students who previously elected to take a course on a pass/fail basis, will continue on a pass/fail basis. These students can elect to change their course from pass/fail to a letter grade.  
* **For the Spring 2020 semester, undergraduate students can elect to place a course on pass/fail or remove the course from pass/fail by no later than Friday, August 7th, 2020.**  
* For the Spring 2020 semester, students who elect to place a course on or remove a course from pass/fail will do so through the Office of the University Registrar. A form will be available on the University Registrar website for the student to confirm what courses to place on or off pass/fail through Friday, August 7th, 2020.
*  **Given this grading shift, we will suspend the Dean's List for the Spring 2020 semester.**
* UNC‐Chapel Hill will include a transcript note on all academic records, regardless of grading basis, indicating the extraordinary circumstances of the global public health emergency during Spring 2020.

UNC Switched to opt in pass/fail (will count for major req),"Dear Carolina Community,
Next week, we will begin an unprecedented and, until a few weeks ago, almost unimaginable undertaking: the launch of remote instruction for more than 95 percent of our classes to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Over the past week, we have been inspired by the enthusiasm and imagination that so many faculty and teaching staff have brought to this endeavor, and we are grateful for your continued commitment to fulfilling the University’s core mission of teaching and learning during these difficult times.  
Our faculty continue to show great compassion for their students, and that has never been more evident than the past week as we contemplate the challenges all of you are now facing in this new reality. We all understand the uncertainty and anxiety that moving to a remote teaching format may cause our students, and we want to offer as much flexibility as possible to support the academic goals of our community. With that in mind, we write today to share an Emergency Grading Accommodation regarding grading for this semester. Among the key changes: beginning March 23rd , we will expand the pass/fail grade option to undergraduate students. Undergraduate students can elect the pass/fail option on undergraduate courses registered in the Spring 2020 semester. Students, including undergraduates, enrolled in professional schools or programs in the Graduate School will follow the decisions of their professional school or of the Graduate School about which courses, if any, are eligible for the pass/fail declaration. Consideration for professional and graduate students will be made by their respective deans by March 27, 2020
We are making these changes in consultation with our deans, registrar, and the Faculty Executive Committee.  

Courses graded as pass/fail under this exception will count towards applicable curricular, major, continuation, and graduation requirements.

A grade of pass will not count toward a student’s GPA but will count toward earned semester hours.  

Students will have until Friday, August 7, 2020 to elect to put a course on or take a course off of pass/fail for the Spring 2020 semester.

The Dean’s list recognition for the spring semester will be suspended.

A note will be added to all academic transcripts indicating the major disruption this pandemic has caused to the academic experience.  

Further, for undergraduate students unable to complete their work because they are adversely affected by COVID-19, we will create a new grade of ‘CV’ as an alternative to the Incomplete (‘IN’) grade. Students with 'CV' grade designations will have an additional three months beyond the 'IN' guidelines to complete their work.
We are making all of these modifications understanding the extraordinary circumstances COVID-19 has created for us all. Even with these changes, we know our students may face unexpected challenges. We are working to create a Student Success Hub so they can access the resources they need and will share those details as soon as possible.  
In the meantime, we are grateful for the determination of our faculty and students to adapt and finish the next six weeks strong.
Sincerely,
Kevin M. Guskiewicz

For those concerned about refunds.,"Earlier this week, we were ""urged"" not to come back if we could stay away. This was very carefully worded so that they probably would not issue refunds since the option to come back was always open. Now that they are requiring most students to move out, there probably will be a partial refund since we paid for a full semester service and were given half. It's simple compensation math from this point on for semester-long services. I know we are all freaking out about wtf is going to happen, just wait for them to tell you the next steps. Starting petitions (yes I've had someone in a groupme send me one) about pass/failing courses this semester is just going to make you more on edge, dont email housing either, that just creates more work for them to deal with and will delay the answers you want.

1 Bedroom Apartment Recommendations in the area? Opinions about Estes Park?,"Hi all,

I’m open to being a reasonable distance away from campus in the Carrboro or Durham (or other??) areas, and my budget is $1000 although cheaper would be awesome! I’d really like to have a washer and dryer in the unit and am looking for a 1 BR.

* Faculty will confirm details for specific course remote instruction. If you have questions regarding specific course instruction, please contact your instructor.
* As part of the remote instruction commencing March 23, labs associated with coursework will no longer meet in person. Faculty will send students guidance on how that instruction will be delivered.

**Decisions on refunds will be made by the UNC System**

* Any decisions regarding potential refunds for housing or dining fees will be made by the UNC System after April 1, or after the universities are beyond the immediate challenges being faced regarding the spread of COVID-19.
* We will share more with you when we receive that guidance from the UNC System.  

**Information for Faculty**  


While there is still work to be done this week, we currently estimate that 95% of our courses will be ready to be taught remotely starting Monday, March 23.

* Faculty are encouraged to deliver this remote instruction from off campus, if at all possible.
* If you are concerned about adapting your lab or course to remote instruction, please contact your dean for further guidance.
* While there has been no decision regarding a potential extension of the academic calendar, we are working with the UNC System and SACSCOC for guidance to ensure faculty retain discretion for their specific courses.

**Information for Graduate Students and Post Docs**

* For graduate students and post docs whose work can be conducted remotely, telework options should be implemented, and work should begin away from campus immediately. See the below Employee section for teleworking and leave guidance.
* The Graduate School will provide guidance for thesis and dissertations.

**Information for Researchers**

* The University plans to keep critical research operations (as determined by the Vice Chancellor for Research), labs and related facilities operational until further notice.
* Vice Chancellor for Research, Terry Magnuson, will follow up with additional guidance.

**Information for Employees**

* For this COVID-19 issue, the UNC System has changed the definition of mandatory employee to: employees who are directed by their supervisor to report to work, at a designated university worksite other than their personal residence, at specific dates and times. It is possible that an employee will have a portion of duties that are on campus and can fulfill the remainder of their duties remotely.
* Effective immediately and until further notice, only mandatory employees under this new definition who need to report to work on campus should do so. All non-mandatory employees - including temporary employees and student workers - will continue to be assigned work and will be expected to work remotely to the fullest extent possible.
* Supervisors are responsible for designating mandatory employees, and for assigning and tracking their non-mandatory employees’ remote work. To be clear, these changes do not remove employee’s responsibilities to complete their work assignments. Supervisors should work with HR Representatives to ensure mandatory employee designations are logged in the ConnectCarolina system.
* Mandatory and non-mandatory employees - including temporary employees and student workers - who cannot work remotely for either of the following reasons will receive paid administrative leave until March 31, 2020, for the period of time they are unavailable to work.
   * Because of childcare or eldercare needs due to COVID-19-related school and facility closings; or
   * Because their position duties cannot be performed remotely and no alternate remote work is available or feasible.
* This guidance, which is provided by the UNC System, is effective immediately through March 31, 2020 and will be revisited as the situation evolves. Further updates will be provided.
* Employees who are sick due to symptoms of a cold, flu, or COVID-19 or who are caring for a dependent with such symptoms will receive paid administrative leave for any time lost through March 31, 2020.
* [More information](https://hr.unc.edu/covid19-faq/) about the new COVID-19 Leave Provisions, as well as additional guidance from the UNC System, is available.

**Campus Parking Guidance for Students, Faculty and Staff**

* Beginning Wednesday, March 18, on-campus parking is available in parking lots throughout campus for mandatory employees and students reporting to work.
* To ensure access in the event of an emergency and to maintain specific campus services, parking is not available in fire lanes or in accessibility and reserved spaces without the appropriate credential.
* The [Dogwood Deck](https://maps.unc.edu/parking/dogwood-deck/) and [Ambulatory Care](https://maps.unc.edu/parking/ambulatory-care-center-lot/) lot are expressly reserved for patients and visitors only. To accommodate the many health care providers with UNC Health and the School of Medicine, these employees will be directed to primarily utilize Craige, Dogwood, Jackson and S-11 decks due to the close proximity to the medical campus. With this information, please plan accordingly with daily shift changes.     

**Information regarding Commencement**  


We have not made a decision about our Spring Commencement ceremonies on May 10. We will be seeking input from our graduating seniors should we need to make a change to our current plans.

**Carolina is, at its heart, its people**  


As we mentioned earlier, this is an unprecedented time for our campus. We realize this update presents challenges for everyone. This is not the Carolina experience we wanted for this semester, especially for our graduating seniors and graduate students.

We appreciate your patience and flexibility as we make decisions for the health, safety and well-being of our community. Please stay safe and make it a point to stay informed on a daily basis. We will provide updates on a regular basis.

Carolina is, at its heart, its people. So many of you have come together to help our campus through the last few weeks, and together – even if remotely – we will work through these challenges and continue to thrive.

Sincerely,  
Kevin M. Guskiewicz

"UNC System orders students off campuses, reduces housing and dining options","The UNC System announced Tuesday that all universities across the state will make changes to keep students off campus for the Spring 2020 semester, including forcing students out of their dorms.

Students living in university housing will be instructed to “remain at, or return to, their permanent residences unless granted an exception by the institution,” according to a statement from the system.

The exceptions will be limited for students who have a “significant need” to stay on campus. Universities will also establish an exceptions process and health screening for those students.

Campuses will also reduce dining operations to takeout or similar options.

I miss campus and I hate COVID,"I feel like I complain on here a lot hah but seriously I just need to get it out of my chest. 

There are so many students in unusual situations where online learning is extremely inconvenient, from people struggling to pay rent to single moms who have to homeschool their child at the same time. I’m one of the luckier ones and I can be comfortable at home with stable wifi connection, plenty of food, and my immediate family members. 

My mental health hasn’t been the best. Growing up I attempted suicide multiple times and struggled with depression, an eating disorder, and anxiety. I was unlucky and got involved in an abusive relationship that continued through when I came in as a freshman here. I struggled a lot with being lonely and trying to find help and support - a lot of which I couldn’t afford (I tried CAPS but they would use my parents insurance and I didn’t want my parents finding out) because I was going through financial hardships. 

Then I got out of the relationship and things drastically improved for me. I was just ending first semester when I finally started to feel better. I was genuinely happy for the first time. And I finally started to get involved on campus and realized college is fucking amazing. I went out and I made friends and I got new hobbies and changed my major and just became this new entire self. 

I missed out on so much because of my mental health and toxic relationships. I didn’t go to prom, I didn’t go to my high school graduation, I didn’t have any friends. I went to 15 different schools as well which made it really hard for me to ever feel like I belong anywhere. But I felt like I belong at UNC. 

Then this whole pandemic happened and my safe space, my campus, was stripped away from me. And because of people NOT taking this seriously and protesting shit (I will never understand why they ever think it’s validated to do that) and making things harder, we might not return in the fall.

Being away from home is what also made me feel better. My household isn’t the greatest and it’s peaceful most of the time but shit goes down at unexpected times. Loud, aggressive arguments and hurtful words are thrown around without warning. And the fact that I can’t even go out to get out of my head makes it worse and my relationships with my friends has gotten distant and so I don’t have anyone to talk to. I decided to start tele therapy, which is fucking expensive and I don’t think I can afford it long term because I just lost both of my jobs. 

So please, if you see someone not social distancing or not being serious about this, please say something. I’m just so tired and sometimes I can’t even get out of bed for the entire day and I can’t eat and it scares me because I don’t want to relapse. And I know I’m not the only one in this situation. Motivation is really lacking during this time for everyone and it’s affecting our education and well being. 

I’m so tired, I just want the life I finally got back, back.

MATH 521?,"Hi,

**CURRENT STATS (as of 4/11 at 2:00 p.m.)**

* 4,300+ cases (although we are still rationing tests)
* 87 deaths
* 12th day since the first full day of the stay home order. Hopefully, we will see that reflected in case numbers within the next few days.

https://preview.redd.it/4upbsba0k8s41.jpg?width=853&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bf978d722e3cbcf5d55e97044a98ac46772d727

**“HEY JEFF - YOU KNOW WE CAN’T STAY HOME FOREVER, RIGHT?”**

Let’s talk about how North Carolina gets back to work.

And let’s skip the obvious stuff - like hand-washing and staying home if we’re sick.

To fully reopen, we’re going to need to know four things: Who’s sick, who’s not, who’s been sick, and who hasn’t.

(You don’t need multiple studies to know that, but if you want here are three: [1](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2020/04/03/482613/national-state-plan-end-coronavirus-crisis/), [2](https://ethics.harvard.edu/test-millions), [3](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/).)

That’s the information that will let us track and control future localized outbreaks (which are inevitable) without requiring wide-scale shutdowns.

It will also give the public confidence that it’s safe to become customers - not just employees - of restaurants, theaters, barber shops, airlines, hotels, sports arenas, food trucks, colleges and universities.

Having this information early is how South Korea was able to demolish the infection curve and reopen society much faster than any other country. And the way they got there was early, widespread testing - followed by aggressive contact tracing and isolation.

We missed the opportunity to get ahold of this on the front-end because we didn’t have that kind of widespread testing, and we didn’t have it for three reasons: a lack of test kits, a lack of related chemicals needed to use the test kits, and a lack of PPE needed to administer the tests.

But we can’t just call that a failure a move on. We actually have to solve the problem, only now it’s much bigger because the universe of those who are potentially infected has grown by several orders of magnitude.

One more factor: The testing can’t just be widespread - it also has to be rapid. Waiting ten days for a result isn’t particularly helpful when that person can easily infect dozens more while results are pending.

So let’s take a close look at what it will actually take to get rapid, widespread testing in North Carolina.

**MOLECULAR TESTING**

Broadly speaking, there are two types of tests: molecular and antibody.

The molecular tests are the ones we’ve been using. You take a swab from the back of someone’s nose or throat, you extract the RNA, then you see if it matches the COVID RNA.

We’ve done about 48,000 so far in North Carolina (that number includes private labs, which are currently doing the vast majority of the testing). We did about 5,000 yesterday.

https://preview.redd.it/jntgdj11k8s41.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd23321ff2e27d860726ed44066787ebf53b79e1

Molecular tests are highly accurate, but the global demand for them is so high that we’ve been plagued by a number of material shortages needed to perform them. The biggest shortage right now is the PPE needed to administer the test.

Our state has received three shipments from the National Strategic Stockpile totaling roughly 33% of our requested supply. Now the stockpile is nearly depleted and we’ve been told there will not be another shipment. In search for more, our state emergency management agency has submitted $125 million worth of bids on PPE to private manufacturers across the country but only a small fraction of those bids has been accepted. As has been widely reported, we are competing against other states and other hospital systems, and the competition is fierce. In better news, we have several manufacturers in North Carolina which have switched production to PPE for use by our front-line workers, so we hope that will help meet a growing share of the need.

That brings us to the molecular test kits (and related chemical supplies) themselves. We’ve seen a dramatic increase in private lab testing capacity in the last few weeks. But we’ve also seen real innovation. Most prominently, Abbott Labs now has a machine which will give a result in 15 minutes. It got FDA approval about ten days ago and is now probably the most in-demand medical device on earth.

Abbott says they can only make 400 of these machines per week for the foreseeable future. The federal government is in charge of allocating them to states. So far, most states - like North Carolina - have received 15 machines.

Let’s do some quick math. Over the next six weeks, Abbott should be able to make 2,400 of these machines. North Carolina has roughly 3% of the national population, so let’s say we get 3% of the machines (big assumption). That means we might get another 70 machines within the next six weeks, for a total of 85 machines. 85 machines working 24/7 at a rate of roughly 4 tests per hour = roughly 8,000 tests per day.

We tested 5,000 yesterday, so that would be a big jump for us. Even those assumptions are off by 25%, it would still double our current testing capacity. So getting more Abbott machines won't be the whole solution for us, but it’ll be a big piece.

And don't forget that other companies are also entering the space of rapid molecular testing. Just as no one was talking about the Abbott machine two weeks ago, the pace of innovation is such that two weeks from now we may have a new device to complement our Abbott machines.

Overall, it is very realistic to expect our state’s molecular testing capacity to grow significantly this month. HOWEVER, it may not be realistic to expect the kind of 10x growth in testing capacity which some say will be necessary to reopen without resurging the virus.

Which brings us to antibodies.

**ANTIBODY TESTING**

This is more controversial, in part because it started as an overly optimistic theory that tried to downplay the need for a strong response to the coronavirus.

The theory was this: What if it turns out that a massive share of the population has unknowingly been infected already, and has since recovered, and therefore we really don’t need to worry so much and we can go about our daily lives?

Ok… so how would you test that theory?

Here’s how: You would do widespread, random testing of the population to screen for antibodies that would indicate whether the virus had already been there and had been successfully fought off.

But in European cities that have been hit reasonably hard by COVID, random antibody testing hasn’t shown the type of widespread infection the theory posed - which frankly makes sense, given how new the virus itself is.

But there remains a case to make for the widespread use of antibody testing. Different companies report different rates of accuracy, but most report that their antibody tests can detect COVID over 90% of the time. The tests are at the lower end of the accuracy range in the early days of infection, before the body has had time to build up enough antibodies to register with the test. But any COVID test with an accuracy rate above 90% - *when the alternative may be no test at all* \- has to be seriously considered.

And while there is probably no chance that widespread, asymptomatic infection has already occurred, antibody testing at random across the state - or in certain vulnerable communities - might be helpful in identifying hot spots and letting us know where to focus our supply of molecular tests.

A notable concern is that antibody tests are more likely to error on the side of a false negative than a false positive. A false negative is worse, from a public health standpoint, than a false positive. The last thing we want is to tell someone they’re not infected and send them back into public only to find out later that they really were infected. Minimizing the risk of false negatives with antibody tests is an important piece of adopting them into regular use. (Note: A similar concern of false negatives also pertains to the Abbott test.)

The antibody test itself is very simple. It works by doing a finger prick and getting a blood sample. And you get the results in minutes.

Currently the FDA only recommends the use of antibody tests for broader screening purposes to determine who has already had COVID, but there’s an ongoing conversation about whether the test can also be accurate enough to also be used for diagnostic purposes - that is, to see if someone with symptoms is currently infected.

So let’s say we wanted to incorporate some form of widespread antibody testing into our state’s tool kit for virus detection. Now the question becomes, do we face the same shortages that we currently face with the molecular tests?

Right now, there are only a few companies which have FDA authorization to distribute antibody tests. These tests are not yet available in the tens of millions, which is what you would need to create a national supply from which North Carolina would stand to receive an amount big enough to make a dent. But things are evolving rapidly and there’s renewed interest in antibody testing at the national level so this situation could be very different in ten days. Yesterday, Dr. Fauci said, ""Within a period of a week or so, we're going to have a rather large number of \[antibody\] tests that are available.” He suggested that these antibody tests would be used in addition to the molecular tests.

**HOW MANY DAILY TESTS DO WE NEED TO PREVENT A RESURGENCE?**

No one knows. Estimates vary wildly. But certainly multiples of what we’re doing now.

Here are three pieces of good news to end on:

1. There’s a particular advantage to not being the first state to have a major outbreak. Several states - including New York, California, and Washington - are going to hit peak infection before we do. That means they’re going to be the first to experiment with how to reopen. They're going to be the first to decide how many tests, what kinds of tests, how to stagger the return to work, how to conduct effective monitoring, when to reopen schools. That means we'll have the opportunity to observe and learn some best practices before we’re in the same position. That's a big advantage for us - it's also a reason why you're not going to see a fully formed Grand Plan for reopening yet. We're not done learning from the experience of other states.
2. We know it’s going to be a heavy lift to get to the testing capacity we’re going to need in order to fully reopen, but the purpose of this post was to show you that there is a roadmap for getting there. Ramping up testing capacity doesn’t involve just pulling one lever - we have to do several different things simultaneously. But we've got a sense of what those things are and we're being realistic about what it's going to take.
3. **Most important:** There is a set of overwhelming incentives on the part of virtually everyone - state officials, politicians, business leaders, students, parents, workers - to reopen without causing a resurgence. Everyone is working toward the same goal. When that happens in our country - and it’s very, very rare - we tend to accomplish much more than we thought we could at the start.

UNC and NC State,"Hi!!

I applied as a junior transfer to UNC and I was accepted to the university (I WAS SHOOK) but unfortunately I didn’t get accepted into Kenan Flagler business school so I’m afraid that I wont get to pursue the major I want (Operations). Also, I was accepted into NC State and got into their business school and the major that I wanted. With that being said, I don’t know what to choose. UNC has always been my dream school but I dont know if I want to change my major for another one or if I’m even able to reapply to b school again. What should I do??

Parking on Campus,"Hey everyone. Incoming transfer. I plan on biking on campus but I’m not sure on the best method. 

1) If by some miracle I get a Stadium Drive spot in the lottery, does that guarantee I will always have somewhere to park there? And that same question goes for all lots. Am I guaranteed a spot or do they issue more permits than there are spots in each lot? 

2) If I get a spot in the lottery, but it’s a crappy lot would I be better off just getting an S11 spot and biking from there? I’m assuming S11 parking is pretty available 

3) How would it be to get a park and ride spot and bike from the lot on MLK? It’s about 1.5 miles from the bell tower, which is actually closer than the Estes lot. 

Last scenario 4) My apartment is like 5 miles from campus and right on the bus line. Does anyone bus to school everyday? I know they have bike racks on the buses. 

The problem is I don’t want to be restricted by the bus, because I know they only carry x bikes, so it would be nice if I could just throw my bike on my roof rack and have easy, guaranteed parking close enough to campus to ride from there. 

Sorry if this was unorganized. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated",1586564420,1,0

Vailable - scheduling app for student organizations (a better when2meet),"I’ve noticed that a lot of student orgs and communities use [when2meet.com](https://when2meet.com/) to schedule board meetings and campus events. However after using the app myself, I found that the frontend design is very unattractive and makes it really hard to schedule/enter availabilities on mobile.

I created a new version of when2meet called Vailable ([vailable.io](https://vailable.io/)) that keeps the best parts of when2meet but has a cleaner frontend and more functions. It's totally free and allows you to view people’s availabilities to choose the best meeting time. I've already migrated a lot of Yale students to the platform and it has been working great so far. I’m excited to see how it helps student orgs at UNC!

If any of you have any suggestions or features that you would like to see implemented. Please let me know!

Also, I'm not sure about other departments on campus but the CS department will give you a key card that allows you to access the building anytime of the day on any day of the year if you are a CS major or enrolled in a CS class.

Should Trump defund UNC because its researchers created the Covid-19 virus in a lab?,"Trump has recently defunded one researcher (Peter Daszak) who had ties to the Wuhan lab allegedly involved in the creation of Covid-19.

Department of Epidemiology, Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was involved in the creation of this pandemic too, as shown by research papers such as

#A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence

https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985

&gt;**In November 2015, a study was published outlining the capability of producing the virus we are dealing with now. Among the many involved was a lab in Wuhan, China.** It was listed from the beginning as one of the dozens, mostly American, working on this project.

&gt;COVID 19 was a US Army bio-weapons project to manufacture a pneumonia-causing disease that would be nearly impossible to vaccinate for in patients over 40 years old.

&gt;In October 2019, the US brought 172 (really 369) military athletes to Wuhan for the World Military Games. Despite having the largest military in the world, tenfold, the US came in 35th behind nations like Iran, Finland and Slovenia.

&gt;The US team did so badly that they were called “Soy Sauce Soldiers” by the Chinese. In fact, many never participated in any event and stayed near the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the disease is said to have originated only days after the US left the area.

&gt;The US team went home on October 28, 2019, and within 2 weeks, the first human contact cases of COVID 19 were seen in Wuhan. The Chinese have not been able to find “patient zero” and believe he was a member of the US team.

&gt;The Chinese claim, something censored in the US, that the inattentive attitude and disproportionately below average results of American athletes in the game indicates they might have been in for other purposes and they might actually be bio-warfare operatives.

I’m hoping that some of y’all know about some SSI courses that don’t take attendance, or even better yet, are designed to be completed without live lectures.

"Update: NC COVID trends, lottery winners, car inspections, dentists, getting married, teacher evaluations, the law banning wearing masks in public - Sen. Jeff Jackson","

**NC STATS**

* 14k cases
* 525 hospitalizations
* 529 deaths
* 7,300 tests done yesterday

**MAJOR TRENDS**

DHHS is looking at a number of metrics to make decisions about reopening.

Two of those metrics are hospitalizations and testing capacity.

Hospitalizations appear to be flattening:

[Data source: NC DHHS](https://preview.redd.it/zq3e0atmblx41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9941735dec9a934b83cf17a0d9edadc5408557f6)

Testing capacity is a little erratic, but it's trending up slightly:

[Data source: NC DHHS](https://preview.redd.it/8u1ucl4oblx41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23c6ea1cf0649c248c7166a2e262ba70a97c6e95)

Neither of these metrics shows clear victory or clear defeat. This is what being in the middle of a battle looks like. We are going to see some amount of reopening this week. That's going to bring a heightened level of risk. We genuinely don't know yet how much risk we're taking, so we're trying to start slow and get more data before we go bigger. The outcome is not determined. Things really could go either way.

**NEW LAWS**

In addition to a lot of obvious relief measures that are needed, there a lot of less-obvious fixes that have become necessary.

So after we passed the $1.5b relief bill, we passed another bill that changed a few dozen laws that needed modification to fit our current situation. (You can read the full bill [here](https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2019/Bills/Senate/PDF/S704v6.pdf).)

Here are 19 of those changes:

* If your car inspection or registration is due after March 1 and before August 1 you now get an extra five months from the expiration date.
* Driver's licenses are now good until 30 days after the date the Governor ends the state of emergency or the date the DMV reopens all of its offices, whichever is earlier.
* No interest on unpaid income tax will accrue until July 15.
* Notarizations can be done by video until August 1 (specific procedures for that).
* North Carolina will now develop its own strategic stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing supplies.
* Dentists are now authorized to conduct COVID diagnostic and antibody tests.
* Each school district must set an opening date for students of August 17, 2020 and a closing date no later than June 11, 2021.
* We directed all school districts to develop a Remote Instruction Plan for the 2020-2021 school year, in case the virus makes remote learning necessary again.
* Teachers get a one-year extension to meet licensure requirements.
* High school students will not be required to have instruction in CPR prior to graduation.
* Normally there are special rules that discourage social promotion out of third grade because of a concern for establishing fundamental literacy skills, but for next year principals can make third grade promotion decisions in the same manner as for other grades.
* When the fall semester begins, fourth graders must be given a reading assessment within 10 days to assess reading ability and identify remediation needs.
* Teacher evaluations will be based on observations completed prior to March 13, 2020.
* Schools normally get their own report cards based on the test scores of the student population. But they won’t this year, because we don’t have enough data.
* In North Carolina, it’s against the law to wear a mask on a public street or walkway. It’s a law that’s been around since the 1950’s and was originally intended to hamper the activities of the KKK. It has several exceptions, but one of them wasn’t “to ensure the physical health or safety of the wearer or others,” so we added that. Now you can wear a surgical mask on a public street or walkway.
* Marriage certificates can now be received via remote audio-video communication provided the register of deeds can “positively identify” each applicant. (Very important to marry the right people!). Expires August 1.
* Lottery winners now have extra time to claim their prize.
* DMV headquarters was supposed to move to a new location by October 1. That has been delayed.
* If a sheriff has to serve judicial notice on a resident of a senior living facility (it happens!) they can now leave a copy of the notice with the employee in charge of the office or who has authority to receive documents intended for residents. Expires August 1.

The next post will include an update on DES. The situation there is totally unacceptable and I am speaking with their leadership about changes that we need to see immediately.

More soon,

As we leave the dumpster fire otherwise known as the spring 2020 semester behind us...here's where UNC currently stands.

* Campus is still closed but is planning a phased reopening over the summer.  *(Details to come)*
* UNC administration is planning on having in person classes this fall. *(Details to come).*

**Grades hit you hard?**  
You may pass/fail any Spring or Summer course until August 7. They count for majors and gen eds.  P's do not affect your GPA.  An F is still an F.  

[Spring P/F](https://unc-ch.formstack.com/forms/spring_2020_semester_pass_fail?sso=5eb2b82e782b0)  
[Summer P/F](https://unc-ch.formstack.com/forms/summer_2020_semester_pass_fail?sso=5eb2bafae28dc)

If you straight up F'd a course and want a re-do, you can retroactively drop the course.  You still have to take the course (or an equivalent) in the future.   **You have until May 8th to drop the course**, which will show as a ""WCV"" on your transcript.  If you withdrew before the earlier March 8 deadline, it will remain a W.

Should I opt-in a pass for one of my classes?,"So, I'm a freshmen pre-medical student who really struggled their first year. I had a huge learning experience from just trial and error. I'm a first-generation African immigrant student and I never studied in my entire life so it was a big change for me. I would sort of say I understand the college rigorous course load now. However, at the beginning of January, early February, I struggled with taking 18 credits while also working 30+ hours a week. 

I had two huge panic attacks and I didn't know what was happening to me. As soon as I had to drop another class, for the second time in one year, I knew I had to get serious and actually take my freshmen GPA to the heart. But, for one class it was already too late to bring up my grade to an A. I got a B in a gen ed requirement course with a dick professor. He simply didn't take what I had to say.

S2: 3.93 (B (P), A-, A+, A+, A+) - dropped one class before the fail deadline 

S1: 3.35  (C+, B, B, A+, A+, A+) - dropped one class before the fail deadline

If I use pass option, my final first-year uGPA will be: 3.62 (3.55 w/o)

If I use pass option and take 3 summer courses (all A's): 3.71 (3.66 w/o)

UNC Critical Languages (Help me pick one?),"So I am a PWAD major planning to double major in Comp Sci starting next fall. I feel a tough, 'critical' language would be both interesting and be a great boost to my resume. I'm a freshman currently, with all gen eds knocked out and all but three classes in PWAD finished, so also intend to minor in the language. I've narrowed it down to three. Those being, with my pros and cons, below. I would like some insight on how the programs are at UNC and what y'all's recommendations would be?

Arabic (Levantine dialect option) 

Pros : Beautiful writing, art, culture, and poetry ; Highly sought after in both diplomatic and military capacities, few speakers within US at a capacity useful to the US government (boosts value of language in US), the Levantine dialect is tied to a region not known to be particularly dangerous for Americans (though it is rather volatile due to the containment of Jerusalem) 

Cons : Separate writing and speaking system (have to learn MSA plus a dialect to be useful) , very difficult writing system, and I personally am not drawn to it's sound outside of poetic usage (big con that is one of my biggest reasons for questioning if I should take it)

Bonus : UNC has a cool minor that let's you dabble in two middle eastern languages (one with at least six classes, and another with just two). Could either learn Farsi due to the similar alphabet, or Turkish (which sounds just amazing to the ears, like a more exotic french)


Mandarin Chinese 

Pros : A language of business, strong history of literature, unique writing system, a language of the internet, highly sought after in diplomatic, military, AND computer capacities, no conjugation though it is replaced by the tonal system (huge pro for an English speaker in my eyes), interesting politics tied to the host country, has a unique flow to how it is spoken due to tonal system

Cons : Tonal system is unique (doesn't seem too terrible based on the little practice I've done with it, but it could still be a hassle at times), unique writing system relies on memorization of at least a few thousand unique characters just to read a newspaper, large number of speakers outside of China (means I would be competing with fluent speakers in the job market that learned it in either families units or before immigration)

Bonus : The minor at UNC would be a little painful, requires more classes than any other language minor


Russian

Pros : The Cyrillic alphabet is similar to ours (I've even already learned it), sounds somewhat pleasant or at least cool to me, Russian literature is terrific in both a fairy tail and political capacity, highly valued in military capacities and useful as a language of the internet (still sought after diplomatically, but not as much as the above), few Russians learn English so it is essential for travel in Russia, Russians have one of the worst rates of English learning in the world (very good for those bilingual in both for the job market, especially in US), Just listen to a Russian lullaby sometime... It's horrifying and enchanting at the same time

Cons : A grammar so difficult that it is likened to how bad English is for other languages due to heavily irregular conjugations and sentence structure (the other above languages are far more constant once you understand their writing and pronunciation), not as widely spoken to some form as the other above languages (though Arabic breaks into dialects, MSA permeates through the whole Arab world), less of a foreign culture than the other above ones, not as sought after outside of the government as Mandarin (though I'd say it competes with Arabic outside of the government). 

Bonus : I apparently have Ukrainian heritage, so some of my ancestors may have been forced to speak Russian (thus it may be an ancestral language for me and it's highly likely they knew a good amount regardless due to language split in country)


Know that's a lot to read, so thank you so much for taking the time! I look forward to y'all's input!",1585550952,1,0
What happens if we can't get back to campus to get our shit?,"Title, basically. Out of state here. Move out's April 1st, but my parents *really* don't want me going back to get my shit from my dorm.

UNC Housing Fine,I recently found housing off campus that I really like. There's a fee to get out of housing. Does anyone know if there is a way to get out of it? I would really love to save some money.  I heard that you could get out of your CDS by saying you had dietary restrictions by being vegetarian.,1585518734,0,0
