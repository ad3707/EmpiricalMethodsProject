NYU vs Fordham vs University of Maryland?(computer science or information science)? Is it worth it?,"So I am currently thinking about going to these schools and which one should I transfer to? I live near Manhattan in a nice neighborhood and because I am instate, I would be getting some possible aid from NYU and Fordham. I would most likely get my own place like apartment near the schools and would want to major in computer science or information science. The reason I also applied to Maryland was only because of the ranking of its computer science program. I didn't like the campus, I am not the typical college student and don't really care about the traditional experience all I want to do is make friends and go to a good school to earn some money. I actually feel very uncomfortable going to Maryland and am attending it and it just seems weird for me. I didn't make any friends, most kids here are from maryland so its hard to actually find something common with them. Its like a culture shock like im in a different country. I am currently a sophomore and will be attending UMD for this spring to but as a junior I feel like I should go somewhere else. Since I transferred to UMD from a CC. I would be graduating about a year and a semester late so I feel like id rather go somewhere I feel comfortable and just keep working hard. I have heard the tandon at NYU for CS is not good and the main campus CS is part of the arts college at NYU. I was also thinking about information systems and dont know how that is ranked at NYU. Fordham I would go to the lincoln center campus not the bronx and I have heard its really bad for computer science so I would have to go into information science business. Now, I feel comfortable at NYU or Fordham due to it being close to home and I can connect better with the people. At maryland, I just don't like it at all and if it wasn't for the computer science program, I would have never applied. Now the cost is also changing my mind. I did not get aid at all and am paying 37k a year for tuition without room and board. I think I can lower my Fordham tuition or NYU. Is NYU as bad as they say for comp sci? Is Fordham as bad as they say? Should I suck it up and suffer and just graduate from Maryland? Being isolated here I barely talk to anyone and can't even get connections with people due to it being hard just to live here. I just don't know what to do? Any suggestions?",1579798198,1,0

Vailable - scheduling app for student organizations (a better when2meet),"I’ve noticed that a lot of student orgs and communities use [when2meet.com](https://when2meet.com/) to schedule board meetings and campus events.

I created a new version of when2meet called Vailable ([vailable.io](https://vailable.io/)) that keeps the best parts of when2meet but has a cleaner frontend and more functions. It's totally free and allows you to view people’s availabilities to choose the best meeting time. I've already migrated a lot of Yale students to the platform and it has been working great so far. I'm really excited to see it help student groups at NYU as well!

I am soo ecstatic I get to perform there, but I just have a few questions for how the audition process goes.

For those who have already performed at their audition for any vocalist majors (Specifically classical performance) Please state how your experience went. What happened in sequential order and what the judges have asked you to do after before and after performances. You don't have to be a student at NYU that made it in but I'd prefer the people who have been accepted into the school and their major. Also, do you think your audition has helped or supported you in any way to get in? If so, what talent and/or merit scholarships did they award you? Okay forreal here are the last questionss lolz...

Is it hard to change majors at NYU and can we extend our range outside of our majors? It says so on the website that Classical performance can join with the musical theatre people, but I'm so confused about that so if any current students can explain in detail what they meant please do!

Students of the Tisch Game Center - how do you like it?,"Hi! So, I am thinking of applying to NYU's Game Center, but I'd like to hear an opinion from actual students there. Do you like it? If no, why not? How are the professors? 

Is there actually any cons to mot apply for it? I myself am studying in BMCC for graphic design, but I always was interested in games (mostly videogames) consider myself a gamer. And the opportunity of studying by playing the games, or/and creating them seems to be very intriguing. 

On another hand, I've read that it is not so easy, one has to take a lot of motes, remembers a lot of things (names, dates, mechanics, etc) to pass. Is that true?

SPS/ Center for Publishing Info?,"I'm graduating from UCLA this year and recently got accepted into the M.S. in Publishing program at SPS — I'm wondering if any alumni or current students in the program could give me a better idea of the program and its reputation? When I was applying, the program seemed really great, and as far as the actual curriculum and faculty go it seems like a really solid program and a good way to get an edge career-wise (especially since there aren't a lot of great publishing opportunities here on the west coast; at least compared to New York).

That said, the more research I do on SPS as a whole, the less convinced I am — I'm seeing a lot of mixed reviews online about how SPS has a lower reputation than the rest of NYU's schools. One post I saw on here even said that it was like the ""Devry arm of NYU"" (lol). For what it's worth, most of this info is 5+ years old and it seems like most of the negative attention was geared more toward the school's bachelor's degrees. I also haven't really found much negative about the actual program I was accepted into — that said, I haven't found a lot about the publishing degree other than what's posted on the school's site.

While SPS's reputation obviously shouldn't be a deciding factor in whether I choose to attend, seeing posts like this do make me a little bit hesitant, so I'm wondering if anybody enrolled in the program (or any students/ alumni of SPS!) might be able to share their thoughts on the pros and cons of SPS/ the Center for Publishing?

Midyear report,"ok I need some advice real quick,

I did ED 2 to NYU and they require you to send the midyear report. However, my grades dropped significantly from my last 3 years of highschool. I had a cumulative avg of 97.77 from freshmen to junior year but recently I got my midyear report back and got a 92.29 avg for senior year. The reason my grades dropped so much was because I wasn't able to come to school for two weeks due to an emergency medical procedure. As a result, I got left back in all my classes, and had a difficult time catching up. I'm currently taking three AP Courses: Comp sci, Chemistry, and Calc AB, so all the workload I had to catch up on was difficult to manage. Mainly AP COMP sci - I took that class, not knowing a single thing about coding, and it's not my intended major at all.

My current Midyear report:

The study of drama(elective) - 80

AP Computer Science - 75

AP Chemistry - 97

English - 100

AP Calc AB - 80

American Government - 96

I applied for pre-med, and I'm hoping my high grades in science classes like AP Chem will back that up, but I'm worried about them seeing my low grades on Comp sci, Calc, and drama. I am getting back on track though, and improving a lot in Comp sci, got a 92 on the midterm, but since I failed the last two tests before that, my avg came out pretty low.

Should I contact the admissions office and explain to them why my grades dropped dramatically? Please give me some advice on what I should do. Thank you",1580933046,1,0

Stony Brook University vs NYU (Courant),"I have received admits for Masters in computer science from the above two universities for Fall 20. 

My interests lie mainly in the field AI/ML.

I know that the fee at SBU is almost half as that of NYU but I feel that NYU is really superior to SBU w.r.t quality of research and i feel i could really learn a lot here. 

Given that I'll most probably be taking a loan to pay my tuition - is it really worth choosing NYU? Also, how easy is it to get RA/TA at NYU? 

How do these universities compare against each other in terms of rankings, research and ROI? 

Also, given the current situation (covid) - does it make sense to defer the admit to next Spring/Fall?

It'll be really helpful if any alumni/student here can share their views.

MS in CS Grad Life: NYU Courant vs UMass Amherst,"[First of all hope y'all safe from this COVID-19 pandemic, never have been times so dark and unpredictable. Stay Safe and exhaust your social media feed XD ]

Hi Guys,
I'm an international student and have been accepted into the above mentioned programs WITHOUT any financial aids. I've done my research on the universities and have arrived at the following broad conclusions:

1. Both are Top 20 programs in AI/ML (which is my preferred concentration) (CSRankings says: UMass 11, NYU 20)
2. NYU is more than 1.5 times costlier than UMass
3. NYU is far more recognized by general masses but I'm sure that UMass is equally prestigious in the CS Community.

I will be taking a student loan for attending either of them but for NYU I will have to stretch a bit. So wanted to get an idea if the NYU experience would be worth the extra loan I will have to take.

Bottom line, would be great if you guys could help me see some subtle points that I might be missing in favour/against both of these awesome UNIs.

Because it’s not possible for staff to know which items belong to which resident within the room, items will be packed in boxes together.  You will receive notice when the current crisis ends, and the University, city, and state deem it safe for you to return to campus to retrieve your items.

Somehow I doubt they'll be providing us any assistance with shipping it after the crisis ends or help reimburse the cost of having to go retrieve it.

Pass/Fail should be mandatory,"This whole opt-in Pass/Fail thing NYU is doing is silly. It's trying to not let economic inequality heavily affect academic performance, but all it does is stop kids who are heavily affected by the Coronavirus from tanking their GPAs. Some kids will return to homes that are sitting on a lot of money and will be able to perform at the same or even better academic level as they did at NYU. However, others will return to homes in which both parents have been laid off due to Covid-19 and they don't know where their next meal will come from. Many of these less wealthy students will end up Pass/Failing their classes, and the wealthier kids will get the letter grades. The wealthier kids will be able to boost their GPAs, and the less wealthy kids will not. THIS IS NOT FAIR. We should not allow academic performance to be more a reflection of economic status rather than merit. Also, many employers will see that students pass/failed a class instead of getting a letter grade and assume they didn't do well or didn't try as hard as those who got a letter grade. One of the main purposes of pass/fail was to take the stress off of students. But it does barely anything, as many students will be just as stressed, as they would much rather have an 'A' than a 'P' and will work as hard as if we were under the regular grading scheme.   


Columbia, MIT, Smith, and many other colleges have implemented Mandatory Pass/Fail and NYU should follow suit.

&gt;Please note that for Spring 2020 only, **math majors will be permitted to pass/fail major requirements**. If you elect the pass/fail option for a course and receive a P, the course will be able to count towards your major and to satisfy math course prerequisites. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Does this mean that I (as a math/econ major in CAS) can P/F a Data Science course taken as a general elective and receive the 4 credits after passing the class? *Basically, despite not counting towards GPA, does passing a P/F course still award credit as usual?*
2. Will they be approving *any* P/F petitions this semester (within the limit of 2 courses P/F)? Or will they be as strict in asking for proof as before?

My pea-sized brain is having trouble understanding the changes to P/F policies right now... forgive me for this. Any clarification would be greatly appreciated.",1584992562,1,0

Older student; am I screwed?,"To make a long story short, I royally screwed up my first attempt at university, and now after some soul-searching, I’m coming to NYU as a sophomore transfer this fall.

Thing is, I’ll be 25 when I start here. I’m not worried about dorming, because I’m currently renting an apartment in Alphabet City the size of a shoebox.

What I am wondering however, is how socializing is gonna work out. Making friends, joining clubs, nightlife and frats. Will I even be allowed to pledge for a frat?😂

I know that I’m being neurotic and 25 is like still college-aged kinda, and I’m not exactly gonna be immediately identified as the “old guy” whenever I walk into a room, but I feel like I’ll already be starting at a disadvantage socially since I’m a transfer and I live off-campus.

Is there anyone else that can relate?",1584987249,1,0

I keep telling myself we're young and so we're not as affected but really, it's about transmitting it to someone that would be at risk, and that's what everyone's trying to avoid. I get that.

But this is still my last semester, and while I understand the need to pause the world for second, I'm still left wondering what that means for our education when this is all over. Tisch requires a lot of hands-on teaching, as I'm sure other majors revolving around the medical field do too.

Our hours and shifts haven’t been changed, but everyone is super flexible regarding our concerns and need to call out during this time. We’re “amping up our cleaning protocol”- we have to wear gloves when we handle IDs now and will be cleaning the equipment much more frequently. I’ve heard the same from folks who work at the Post Production Center in Tisch- as far as they know, the labs will remain open but classes will not be held. They’re still expected to show up to their next shifts.

Is it possible for a LS student to double major in Economics and Philosophy?,"I’m coming in as a freshmen with 16 (confirmed)- 32( assuming I do well on AP tests) credits. I have 5s in Ap French and Calc BC which fulfill the language and quantitative reasoning requirements, but no AP science to fulfill the science requirement. However, I’m unsure LS will let me use these credits to bypass the requirements. For example, since I will be spending my first year in Paris, I’ll still have to take a french class?

Once I transfer to CAS:

CAS Econ (policy) takes up a minimum of 13 courses and I can probably do well on AP Macro to cut it down to 12. 

Philosophy takes up 10 courses, and if I’m not mistaken, there aren’t any courses that can double count with Econ right? :-(

Is double majoring still plausible? I’m scared the additional core requirements in LS will prevent me from graduating in time. I think NYU’s Econ and Philosophy programs are top notch, and I really don’t want to end up minoring in one or the other.",1586344864,1,0

What are your options on actual using the pass/fail option this semester?,"Originally I was planning and hoping to do good in my classes and just keep my letter grades. But after a few weeks of these online classes I’m honestly considering pass/failing all of them. 

Firstly, most of my professors have been giving us more, harder and longer work then I had when I was actually at school since they think we just have all this extra time now. Some of the assignments have not been altered to accommodate being at home at all including a joint project I had to do with someone in a time zone 12 hours apart. 

My house generally has pretty good and consistent WiFi but with my whole family on and streaming I frequently have been losing connection and missing parts of lectures due to it. 

While I am interested in my classes and enjoy them, staring at a computer screen all day for lecture, homework, exams/quizzes etc. has been giving me massive headaches which on top of the issues mentioned previously is making me lose motivation.

I don’t even know how grading will work for most of my classes yet and in one class my final was changed to be almost 50% of my grade instead of the original 30%. Which makes the May 12 deadline seem like a joke since I will have no idea what my grade will be until after that.

In the end, I think I will pass/fail all my classes especially since it looks like a lot of other colleges are going for the mandatory pass/fail option anyway. 

I know others are dealing with much worse situation currently than I am but I just wanted to share my experience so far and maybe see what others think about actually using pass/fail.",1586327054,1,0

Honest opinion of Tandon CS?,"I really don't know what to think of Tandon CS. From the CS rankings on NYU, at least in US news, it seems as though it is only talking about CAS's CS and not Tandon's CS. But with Tandon climbing the rankings and becoming a more selective school recently, I believe that the CS department has improve significantly as well, so I believe that the posts that trash Tandon's CS may be outdated. Furthermore, I have seen a few articles saying that students who graduate from Tandon, not necessarily for CS, are able to earn pretty good starting salary. So, I just wanted to know how Tandon's CS and compares to CAS's, and how it prepares students for work (getting employed and actually working).",1586246541,1,0

NYU would benefit more by deferring the fall semester rather than going remote.,"This might be an unpopular opinion, but NYU would benefit from deferring the start of the fall semester rather than operating remotely.

\- If NYU is online in the fall, many students are going to take a semester off, and the class of 2024 is likely to defer. If they defer then classes are going to be small, and NYU won't receive the tuition funding they need to properly employ their professors and staff. Likewise, it will make admissions for the class of 2025 unnecessarily difficult.

\- Students should not be paying $55,000 in tuition to attend an online university. This is an elite institution, not ASU.

\- Many artistic majors such as music, drama, studio art, etc require equipment and levels of interaction that are not available virtually.

\- It would be possible to run two full-length semesters with short vacations starting in 2021 and be able to have a month off in the summer before beginning the 2021-2022 academic year as planned. Although, this would eliminate J-Term.

There is no reason why NYU should be ""fully operational"" in the fall if we are not getting the quality education that we have worked hard for, and are paying to receive. I would personally rather postpone the school year than have a mediocre fall semester online.

I would love to hear your thoughts, please let me know your opinions.",1587582891,5,0

Transfer NYU IMA vs UCSD Cog-Sci,"Looking for: advice, experiences, stories, etc.  especially in student life as an IMA student.  


I am still waiting to hear back from both schools, but I would be an incoming junior at NYU or UCSD next fall. I have a strong interest in a profession in interaction design, assistive technology with a research interest in the Ability Project, and a personal interest in immersive environments. My background is in computer science as a major but I have a lifelong passion for visual arts.   


I like that the IMA program is a BFA, but have hesitations regarding campus life (I simply know more about UCSD) and questioning whether NYU would be a good fit for me socially and for my mental health--both are reasons in part I am transferring. At UCSD--other than enjoying the radiant sun--I'd be a Cog Sci/HCI major. My instincts tell me I am sacrificing the opportunities of studio-based coursework to fuel creativity, gain skills, and build a portfolio, but I would develop a breadth of content from my current cs foundations, the cog sci core, and design + interaction electives. Another caveat, I have not found any faculty that does assistive-technology driven design research. However, the recreational center resources, location, student organizations, and culture seem more fitting to who I am and what I want as a college student. Of course, NYU does win in most food and entertainment categories--can't compete with the fresh avocado oasis that is San Diego. Another minus at NYU I foresee is the commute between the Manhattan and Brooklyn campus--I am already experienced with a 20-30ish minute commute to campus from my off-campus apartment at my current college and don't love it. It feels restricting especially someone who has a pet I try to return to once in the middle of the day. Well, there's my thought vomit. I appreciate all the help the reddit community can provide.",1587360270,1,0

Took a single accounting class a year later thinking I wanted to do accounting. Completely changed my mind. I assume I failed because i never went to that class after the first day and never took any tests.

Been taking some programming courses and studying math and I actually love it now. Taking Calc I and II this summer and following it up with a physics course.

Wonder what my chances are and if i should even both. I enlisted in the navy in 2016 and I'm about to finish my 5 year contract in July 2021. Got to do some cool things but computer science in a 3 letter agency is the most appealing thing to me. The GI bill and yellow ribbon program, if i get into this school, should cover it.

Should I do BPE?,"Hey everyone, I just got admitted to the BPE program at Stern. I was really unsure if this was something that I wanted to go through with the more I look at the program.



I was hoping someone might have some experience with it or heard anything about it. The two main things that dissuade me from the program are Studying Away for two semesters and the curriculum. 


I would be perfectly fine with Studying Abroad for a semester, and I'm sure that there are great experiences to be had, but by leaving for an entire year my sophomore year, I feel like I would be missing out a lot on different connections/opportunities/experiences/friends back in NYC. As someone who has traveled almost their entire life, I honestly am not a huge fan of it anymore, and would rather spend my time on 'campus.'



Also, I'm genuinely *not sure* if the curriculum is something I would enjoy. Its very broad, with cores into things like Social Impact and Politics, and I don't know if a typical Stern business major is something I would enjoy more.



If anyone has any experience with BPE, studying abroad, or courses in general I would love to hear any suggestions or anything at all.",1582207836,1,0

Broke International who was accepted to NYUSH....,"Hello everyone! Soooo the EDII decisions are out, and I was... accepted to NYU in Shanghai!!!!!!!

I applied for NYU in Abu Dhabi for the full grant opportunity and did not make it unfortunately, but still I got accepted at NYUSH since I set it as a second choice, and now honestly I have no idea what to do. NYU was my dream college,especially Abu Dhabi with its financial aid opportunities, and I really could not believe that I can get in with my stats and everything, but now when Im accepted to Shanghai there are more complications regarding the coronavirus situation ( which my parents are really afraid of) , and of course, the financing. I got about 35K in aid, but its still not enough because our family will be able to contribute 25K at maximum, so here is the thing:

1. Is there any opportunity to get more financial aid now after the decisions are out??
2. Am I able to request for the transfer to another Campus?
3. Since this is not my prior choice of campus, do I really have [to](https://to.do) make my final decision until march 1st? ( Cuz many other colleges have deadlines much later, and I might get better offers\_
4. Will the NYUSH experience be worth the money that I am expected to pay in terms of further opportunities with career/networking? 
5. What would the coronavirus situation be in Fall 2020??? This is a main concern for my parents ( other than money lol) 

I am really clueless about what to do now, since this is obviously going to be a financial burden and the Shanghai campus was not really what I was aiming for, but still I feel that I could miss such a wonderful opportunity.... So any advice/tip on what I could do in situation might help :)

Anyways, another important thing to consider is that I am an international applicant from a ""third world country"" so I really did not think that I could get SUCH an opportunity in my life with US colleges...",1582135310,1,0

Seeking advice about NYU Shanghai,"        I applied EDII to the NYU College of Arts and Sciences and while I was applying it gave me the option to also apply to NYU Shanghai by just checking a box.  Honestly I view the college application process as extremely tedious and stressful and try to get it done as fast as possible.  I quickly searched NYU acceptance rate and saw it was 2.8 percent and then average ACT score and saw a 34, a score 3 points above my score.  I assumed it was more selective because the NYC NYU campus has a lower average ACT.  I clicked the box because they made it so easy and I didn’t think I actually had a chance to get in due to what seemed like out of my league  academic requirements.
        A couple of days ago NYU released their EDII decisions and I was accepted to NYU Shanghai.  I was very shocked because at this point I had kind of forgotten that I even clicked that box.  I was also under the impression that NYU Shanghai was more prestigious than the NYC NYU so I didn’t understand how I could be rejected from from and accepted to NYU Shanghai.  The more I think about the prospect of going to NYU Shanghai the more I open up to the idea.  So I have some questions and am seeking some guidance from people with more knowledge than me.

I was offered 30k in financial aid per year bringing my cost to 41k.  My portal says the 30k comes from the NYU Shanghai Scholarship UG.  So my first question is what is this scholarship that they’ve given me?  Is it need bass or merit based?  Is 30k a competitive offer for NYU Shanghai, I it possible to get more and if so do you think I could get more?

My second question is how selective is NYU Shanghai compared to the other campuses, specifically the College of Arts and Sciences in NYC?  Are the acceptance rate and the average act/sat scores available online for NYU Shanghai misleading?  Is NYU Shanghai as prestigious as NYC NYU?

From the research that I’ve done it seems like I have to spend 2 semesters abroad. I would like to know if you can spend more than 2 semesters abroad and if so can it be at the same campus?  For instance would I be able to spend more than 2 semesters at NYC NYU.  

I am definitely not a STEM oriented person and from what I’ve read it seems like a STEM oriented program.  How is the academic life for student not looking to pursue something in the STEM?

I currently speak zero Mandarin.  How big of an disadvantage does this put me at in terms of learning it from complete scratch and life in Shanghai?  How much does the school encourage and help with exploring the city?

Do I have to live in University housing for my first two years or can I live off-campus?

My last question is how difficult is it to transfer to the College of Arts and Sciences from NYU Shanghai either freshmen or sophomore year?

Would It be tremendously difficult to maintain say, a 3.5 gpa or better? I am sure that schools such as wharton and other top undergrad business schools are all very rigorous. Would you say Stern is easier than wharton or other top undergrad business schools?

Class of 2024 Rant... are people seriously this immature and un-inclusive? Can some ‘24 explain?,"Hey, my close friend got into NYU through ed2. She is very reserved and she hoped to change that in college. In efforts for her to meet new, she joined the class of 2024 discord. The instant she joined, kids started talking about very toxic things that made my friend uncomfortable.

Intra-Campus transfer questions,"Hi all! I'm an incoming student for NYU Shanghai class of 2024. I'm really excited to go-to NYUSH but it was my second option since the NYC campus had my intended major of international relations and NYUSH doesn't. I called the admissions office and a counselor spoke to me and told me that inter-camphs transfers were not allowed at all yet on the website it states that ""The earliest you can apply for internal or intra-campus transfer admission is the second semester/term of consecutive full-time study at your current NYU school, college, or campus.

If accepted, you would begin your study at the new NYU school, college, or campus the following semester. The earliest you can begin your study at the new NYU school, college, or campus would be the first semester of your second year."". And also, if anyone could tell me how likely it would be for them to accept intra campus transfers that would be great aswell. Thank you so much for your time!",1582060498,1,0

Incoming freshman could someone help me with a question I have?,"Hi, I'm an incoming freshman for the class of 2024 at NYU Shanghai. NYC was my first choice, but I'm still incredibly excited to attend NYU in Shanghai, however I was just wondering, that if it doesn't work out or that I become too homesick or want to major in something not available at the Shanghai campus, how hard would it be to do an internal transfer? I know for certain schools there needs to be prior coursework completed and that you can only do transfers second semester of your first year and first semester of your second, but is it like re-admitting to NYU all over again? What are my chances of actually being transferred? I also saw online that your financial aid wouldn't be affected with an internal transfer, could somebody tell me more about that?

I'm a journalist based with a major network news company in NYC. 

We’re currently working on a story about students whose study abroad programs in China have been affected by the coronavirus outbreak both in this past semester and in the coming semester.  

I was to get in touch with students about actions which may have been taken by the university to protect students from the coronavirus, as well as measures that may have been taken anticipating future study by students.

If you were in China through a study program when the virus broke out- what were your experiences like? Did the school or program help you get home? If you're planning on leaving for China soon, what now?  thought I'd post here to get an idea of whether NYU students have had an issue with this.

Feeling lost in regards to Core Liberal Studies &amp; have tons of questions,"Hey! So I applied ED2 into CAS (Comparative Literature) for Fall ‘20 and was accepted into LS with the requirement of studying in Paris first year. I’m super, super lost and in need of a lot of guidance to know if I should enroll (the enroll deadline is super soon, March 1) and if anyone with experience with CLS could help me out it’d be greatly appreciated!!

To be honest I’d been caught between applying into CAS for Lit or Tandon for Mech-E, as I have a passion for both. Somewhere along the way I told myself I’d just try and double major, as hard as that is (at least it’s Comp Lit and not English - so it should be lighter). I know that’s not possible if I were to be at CAS (I think?) since CAS generally doesn’t allow double majoring in something outside the school, but it would be possible if I were at Tandon and decided to get a double major in Comp Lit from CAS. 

My only question then is - is internally transferring from CLS to Tandon common? Could I do it prior to the 2 year completion of CLS? And supposing I did successfully transfer, would I still be able to declare and complete a double major within four years, let alone complete the Mech E major within four years since CLS tends not to have too many STEM classes (in Paris at least)?

How does the College Core Curriculum work for transfers?,"Hi /r/nyu, I applied as a transfer for the Fall 2020 term as a data science major. I expect to get my decision this Friday, but before then, I'm trying to figure out how my whole credit situation will work and I have a few questions. I've already looked extensively on NYU's website (as well as CAS' website) to figure these things out, but either I'm blind or it just isn't clear enough from what I've seen.

&amp;#x200B;

To give some background, I'm worried about credits and how long I would have to spend at NYU because I am an international student, even though I go to university in the US and have gone to school here for like the last eight years (because H4 visa is a curse), so I'd be paying full tuition without any aid. So financially, it makes sense for me to attend NYU for two years, but if I have to drag it out more than that, it starts being a burden on my family and we'd likely have to start taking out loans.

&amp;#x200B;

I will have 68 credits after this summer, and I know NYU takes a maximum of 64. The [data science major is only 52 points](https://cas.nyu.edu/academic-programs/bulletin/departments-and-programs/data-science/program-of-study-cas-bulletin.html), but you have to have a minor, which I plan to make economics, [which is 24 points](https://cas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/cas/academic-programs/bulletin/departments-and-programs/department-of-economics/program-of-study-cas-bulletin.html). That makes a total of 76 points, but I already have credit for Calculus I, Macroeconomics, and Microeconomics, which are 4 points each, which brings the total down to 64. Does this mean that I will only have to do 64 points worth of courses at NYU? How does the College Core Curriculum work for transfers? I will have my associates by the time I enroll, but I don't know if that means anything. I'm just concerned because it seems too simple (or maybe even too good to be true). I think I'm missing something big, but if I only have to do 64 credits, then I'll be attending for sure (as long as I get in).

Thanks!

Underclassmen: stop giving career advice or commenting strong opinions about things,"tl;dr: Underclassmen stop giving career advice before you even have applied to a real internship/job and discouraging other people. This subreddit isn't the right place for career advice regardless of what anyone says. Period.

I've seen so many people post on here asking for career advice regarding whether a specific major would be right for them or not, school would be right for them or not, or even something like whether getting a job in a field of their interest is possible from NYU or not.

I get that now is a time when a lot of incoming freshman/some underclassmen have questions about career choices but with all respect, this subreddit isn't the right place to ask. Most of the people here seem to be people in the class of 23, class of 22, maybe even some highschool students who haven't even gotten into NYU. These people have barely had any real internship experience let alone a job experience but still here they are giving career advice or giving strong opinions on certain things.

I'm a graduating senior and decided to browse the subreddit because I'm bored before finals and saw at least a couple of posts from perhaps underclassmen interested in some field in finance. As someone fortunate to have had good guidance throughout the years at NYU which lead to landing a job I wanted and is highly desired, I know what kind of guidance made that possible. However, I still see some idiot from the class of 23/22 commenting ""No qUAnt isnN't PoSsible oUT oF underGraD tHis ISn't MIT"" or ""YeaH ThERE aRE 150 kinds dOinG IB oUT of STern"" like seriously? In what universe are both of those replies even remotely correct? The first one clearly doesn't know there are different areas one could do related to quant out of undergrad as someone pointed out in the thread and the second one seems to discount any other competitive applicant from other top schools applying for those positions. Most of you guys haven't had a real internship or are maybe a year or two away from even applying from one and you're going to give out career advice?

At least comment something remotely useful even if it's ""check out linkedin and reach out to almuni for informational interviews or ask people at wasserman to point you to right resources."" I can only speak for finance because I have experience with that but regardless of what you study at NYU, NYU is a good enough school to open doors at any career choice you want. Sure, NYU isn't wharton or something, but with the right guidance and by taking advantage of being in the city, you can do so much. Personally, I'm headed to a BB that many people desire to work at, I know of people who are headed to EBs that many people also desire to work at, HF/PE is rare out of undergrad but I know some people who still managed to land a role, some people even not in stern managed to land an amazing job that people in stern compete for, I've come across certain CAS students in my superdays at banks and the list goes on... You know what made that possible? **Proper guidance from people who could actually help and give proper, honest advice instead of just discouraging you. That is what will lead you to your dream job. Utilize the actual helpful resources you have, not Reddit.** Getting a job out of college is perhaps the most important thing, don't screw that up by listening to some bozo on reddit.

Stop acting like you know everything as an undergrad and grow out of the bubble you have attended school in so far.",1588620595,1,0

Since I am dorming, my costs for college is no longer negligible, and I will have to take out loans.

Given that NY has been more affected than California (and that the virus further apparently spreaded from there), my assumption is that all schools (public or private) in NY will be online come Fall. Perhaps it's wrong of me to assume this.. I'm not sure. So what do you guys think is going to happen?",1589678109,2,0

Cut-offs for Erik Dies' Discrete Math?,"Hello all,

I am taking Discrete Math with Professor Dies. Does anyone who has taken him before know what his cut-offs usually are for an A? I did well on the first two midterms in that I was well above average, but I made many silly errors in the finals(I had 4 midterms that day), and had to take Discrete Math final at 1am. I am really freaking out because I did really well in this course throughout the semester, and put in a lot of effort, but I feel I may have underperformed as compared to the other students in the final. Hoping I did not totally screw up my chances at an A.

&amp;#x200B;

I will give a little more context, since I realised this post might be ambiguous. I had a 100(average was around 85) on the first midterm, and 90(average was 65) on the second, full percentage in the quizzes, and homework. But I am not expecting more than 85 on the final. I worked very hard in this class to get an A, hence the concern about the cutoffs.  ",1589647475,2,0
Is NYU inherently a lonely school?,"I’ve been thinking a lot about NYU, and I wonder if it doesn’t feel like the right school for me because I’m not putting in enough effort. 

I’ve asked my friends in real life, and they do say NYU is isolating. But part of me wonders if it’s because there’s no campus, or because college kids are inherently busy, or because I’m not trying hard enough.

I find that I spend most of my day alone, despite having a large amount of friends here. It just seems like everyday is a repeat of go to class, study in a coffee shop, go back to the dorm. Party on the weekend or a dinner here and there. There just doesn’t seem to be common areas for people to hang around, whilst on a campus, I imagine you would run into your friends at the lobby of the arts building or whatever, or sitting on the lawn in front of the library. 

I wonder if it’s because I’m just not involved in clubs. But it really does not feel like there’s a lot of “violet pride” or love for this school. I actually even notice this in the NYU subreddit, as opposed to other schools’ subreddits, which are a lot more active. What do you guys think?",1589641263,0,0

2. i was recently diagnosed with adhd and will probably start taking meds for it. my grades were never terrible (gpa's about 3.6-3.7) so it was never checked out before, but it has definitely affected me academically and i feel like i couldve done better if i was diagnosed earlier. i dont want it to sound like an excuse for not doing super well but i think this could potentially help put things into context? it could be risky though so im not sure.",1589582297,1,0

I know some may have scholarships, aid, parents/family members who support you, took out loans, however I haven’t received my financial aid package yet (my mom’s income might not get me enough financial aid,) I don’t have anyone to help me pay, and I don’t think I’m competitive enough to receive scholarships.

Apporto Virtual Computer Lab (VCL),"Hey guys!

I'm a high school senior who will be coming to NYU in the fall (online or in-person). I was looking through all of the resources that came with my *shiny* new NYU ID, and saw that there was a virtual computer lab. I looked into it and it was hosted by Apporto, which is a multi-cloud platform VM platform. I was super excited, since my home computer struggles under multi-stream 4k videos, and takes hours to export longer videos. Though the wifi speed through the server was 2 GBps (which is insane) all Adobe apps ran HORRIBLY. The CPU was absolutely OP (it was a Xeon 24 core) but there was almost no GPU attached. Has anyone used the Apporto VCL, and did you have the same experience? Thanks so much.

Need Help with Stern Course Planning,"Hi!

My family is very new to this whole college experience, so we are all a bit worried about choosing which classes to select and they can't really help me since they don't know much about Business.

When I applied to NYU, I was kind of uninformed about the programs (which I admit is a 100% my fault) and I applied for Business and Political Economy. I realize that I 100% do not want to do this anymore, and would much prefer the Business program, as it allows me to choose from 13 concentrations.

I am aware that I am allowed to switch between the two after my freshman year. However, I want to plan my classes as carefully as possible so that I can limit the amount of extraneous classes I have to take as a result of this switch. I know it's a lot to ask, but if someone could help me navigate this over pm I would really appreciate this.

Also should I mention to my advisor before my freshman year that I would plan on switching?

For Freshman Already Looking for an Internship (NYU Alums Are Awesome!),"For those of you who are incoming freshman, congrats! 

Are you now interested in knowing more about (or even worrying about!) how to get your first part time internship? 

Here's a quick tip.

When I transferred into NYU, I got my first part time internship even before my first day. 

During the summer before my first semester, I started applying for internships on what was then called CareerNet (NYU's jobs platform, it's now called HandShake, I think). I wasn't too familiar with NYC back then and wanted a job that would allow me to explore the city. Heard back from a few employers, one of whom interviewed me remotely. That was how I, on my first day at NYU, found myself already preparing for my first internship at a non-profit!

So if you're looking for an internship already to get ahead, my tips would be for you to:

* Apply to part time internships (for freshman, that would be for the fall).
* Reach out to NYU alumni on LinkedIn, especially those who work in fields that are of interest to you. Ask for a phone call in your message. 

Do this for every single semester you're at NYU and you'll have 10+ internships by the time you graduate!",1589473427,3,0

Is NYU worth it?,"I'm in a really difficult situation, pls help guys.

I love NYU. It has always been my dream school since I got involved in the college admissions process and I was ecstatic after gotten off the waitlist for CAS. 

But the thing is, NYU costs nearly 57k/year, which is much more than what my family can afford without extra aid. 

Meanwhile, I'm still hanging on to UMass (paid the enrollment deposit) with 37k/year, still expensive but at least my family could still try and afford. 

Which the best choice to choose? I really don't want to ruin my life or miss any worthy opportunity. It is insanely difficult to decline NYU offer, as much as paying of it. I have been working dead hard on its application.

MS in CS from Tandon vs a mediocre job in London?,"Hi,

**My Background**

I'm a software developer from India (25 years) with about 2.5 years of experience. I was a CS major from a good university in India. I have worked in some really good asian startups over the years (think something like GRAB etc). Also for me personally, getting interviews at the top tier tech companies is easy. I'm in process with Facebook right now. I just need to practice more leetcode etc.

**My Situation**

I always wanted to move out of India for personal reasons. I am gay and wanted to experience a better life abroad, not sure if this is a good idea / dream to have ... but this is what I have always longed for since I was a teenager.

So to do this, I had applied for graduate schools last year. Since my application was not a strong one (mediocre GPA, no research experience, and no strong academic letters of recommendation, 165 in quant) I received all rejects from the top 30 CS programs last year. I applied again this year with little hope to some average CS programs, and simultaneously began my job hunt abroad.

***The result of this was*** : I got an offer from NYU Tandon for MS CS (I am waiting for UIUC MCS, Boston U MS CS, Wisconsin PMP). I also got an offer from a mid sized London startup who are offering me 60k pounds / year. I had said yes to the London gig 2 weeks ago (back then I did not have the NYU offer, I just received it last week).

**Cons of Both Options**

**1) London**

\&gt; Only 60k pounds /year. People are saying I have been lowballed a lot

\&gt; Another startup (I dont want another startup experience), not well received on glassdoor

\&gt; The hiring manager explicitly said that the job will be kind of boring (API integrations)

\&gt; The title is \`Ruby Developer\`

**1) NYU Tandon**

\&gt; Mediocore CS program

\&gt; I am from a prestigious CS program in India, but when I look at the admits group at NYU Tandon, I dont see my potential peers to be \`exceptional\`. I know this is kind of harsh, but I feel peers do matter a lot in graduate school

\&gt; I have to take loans to finance my education. I will be using up ALL my life savings till now, borrow some money from my parents AND take a loan of approx 40k USD. (I do have some scholarship from the school (8k per year))

\&gt; My dream is to work in companies like Netflix, Facebook, Google in the silicon valley, have a resume which I am proud of, live happily without fearing for my future etc. I have not seen many Tandon people going to many top tier companies. But I may be wrong as most Tandon people dont write ""Tandon"" on LinkedIN and hide behind ""NYU""

I feel that both my options currently arent very strong. I know I am desperate to get out of India because I am gay, but should I end up sacrificing my entire career over it? Or do you think I am overthinking to much?

To sum up, my questions are :

1. Is the investment in a Master's degree from NYU Tandon worth it?
2. Is it a better option to just move to London, and work in a mediocre startup and grind my way to the top (or switch to some other company)
3. NYU Tandon, offers a deferral policy. So I can work in London for a year and then go to NYU. The drawback for this is I will be too old when I graduate.

I know I have some companies like Facebook in the pipeline, I will be preparing hard for them as well. But I have to reply to that London firm soon hence the confusion.",1583130218,1,0

What are my chances at being admitted to NYU Courant's CS PhD program?,"Hello everyone. Just wanted to get some feedback regarding my profile. I actually didn't know about NYU Courant until I tracked down a professor that I wanted to do research with, and I'll admit that seeing the faculty (machine learning) scares me a bit. There's quite a few well-known names and it seems that I'm nowhere near the caliber of the students that may get admitted.

Anyway, I'll just post the stats right away and add any background info at the bottom for anyone's who's interested.

- GPA: 3.84/4.0 (master's - 1/4 semesters so far), 3.2ish/4.0 (undergrad)
- GRE: 163V/169Q/5.5AW
- Research: one publication in a domestic conference (Korea), submitted one paper to an int'l conference in January (second author - awaiting results), involved in three research projects right now but not sure if those will actually culminate into publications.

Any feedback is appreciated!
---

For some background info, I'm currently a master's student pursuing a CS degree at a school in Korea (Korea University in case anyone's curious) and just finished my first semester. I'm looking to apply this year so that if all goes as planned then I'll be starting my program right after graduation.

I've been trying to take as many math courses as I can (despite my peer's ridicule) because I felt that my mathematical background is way too weak to conduct meaningful research in my field of interest (geometric deep learning) and I know that Courant is a mathematics or theory-focused school.",1583030840,1,0

Wagner MPA Question,"Hello Reddit of NYU! Today I got my acceptance letter for the Wagner MPA program and I'm so so so happy!NYU was my #1 school and I'm just elated to have been admitted. I will be visiting for the admitted students' reception in a few weeks, but before then I wanted to see if anybody on here is/was a Wagner MPA student, and if so, you'd be willing to answer a couple questions I have.

Long story short, I'm basically deciding between NYU and Syracuse. Both are really great programs with Int'l Development concentrations that are structured, yet flexible enough to be tailored exactly to my interests. My long-term goal is to work in the Int'l Development/Governance realm (i.e. UN, USAID, etc) and obviously because it's in NYC, NYU is the perfect place to do that. I see that Wagner offers several ""study abroad"" courses over summer and winter breaks, which intrigues me a lot. In fact, I haven't seen a single MPA program other than Wagner that offers as many abroad opportunities that don't needlessly extend the time taken to get the degree. Has anyone done any of those and if so, did you find that studying abroad helped you career-wise? Additionally, I'm wondering if anyone could shed a little light on whether most students attend full time or part time; i.e. is Wagner flexible enough that if I wanted to work while going to school I'd be able to?

....which leads me main concern...money. Specifically the cost of living; how did you manage paying for rent on top of school (i.e. is it even doable to work at least part time while attending Wagner)? If I didn't have a job and attended as a full time student, I'd probably be looking at six figures in loans. Ouch.

I should hear about potential merit aid in the next couple days, but money aside, I am so thrilled at the prospect of going to NYU and can't wait to learn more in a few weeks while I visit. Cheers and thanks for taking the time to read/respond to this!",1582956797,1,0

Made an app to connect college students,"Hey guys, I made an app to connect students with each other to discuss classes, relationships, and anything else.

I felt that there wasn’t a good space for only college students to discuss topics that matter to them and get advice.

You signup with your college email to be verified, and then you and see posts and stuff like reddit, pretty simple.

Please let me know what you think of it and how I can make it better! Its called Poncho btw :)

Here it is,

NYU vs Fordham? Comp sci or Information systems or information science?,"Hello, I plan on going to one of each school and want to do either comp sci or information systems. I will a junior when I attend either school. I know fordham is not good at all for comp sci and was wondering if information science would be worth it at the Lincoln center campus or would information systems at the rose hill be worth it and would it be better to go there? I would be a commuter student as I am very close to the city and would most likley get into Fordham for it costing me 50k a year. As for NYU, I am not 100% sure if I would get in if I did, i would def go as it would still be 50k a year. Would it be better to do info sys or comp sci as I have also heard it isnt as good as other schools such a cornell and columbia. I would go to stony but they have limited enrollement and getting in the major is tough. Idk what to do. I would want to be be a commuter student and going upstate is not an option as I hate it up there. Out of state would be a waste of money and time and would be too much to handle with travel costs and it being far from home. These are my only options. What should I do?",1580170516,1,0
