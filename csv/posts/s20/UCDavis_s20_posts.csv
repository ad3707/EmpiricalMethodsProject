Switching majors after transferring,"Hello, I am wondering if it's possible to switch from any major to computer science AFTER transferring. 

I know, the search bar exists. I have looked at the similar questions and answers posted about this, and it seems like it is possible to do so, so long as you have a 3.0 UC GPA by 1 quarter, have less than 135 units, and finish the prereqs on this website:

 [https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/cs/change-of-major/](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/cs/change-of-major/) 

However, I want to be absolutely sure that it's possible for transfers. That site mentions nothing about transfers, so part of me thinks that it's for non-transfers only. Other UCs, like UCI or UCSB, are very strict and allow no major change into CS or some other engineering major. Also, even if Davis is lenient with this, it could/could've changed, so I'd like to know the most current policy on this. 

I have most of the ECS prereqs done with A's, and I would apply for CS, but I do not meet the transfer requirements. My math 21ABC GPA is not a 3.40 thanks to one mistake in my very first semester, so I kinda have to apply for a different major. 

I wonder if this issue would also prevent me from switching. When I submit a petition to switch, will they look at my CC transcript, see that I haven't fulfilled their official CC transfer requirements (3.40 in 21ABC), and deny me even if I have the 3.0?",1581722361,1,0

"An open letter to instructors who are holding finals this week,","  

An open letter to instructors who are holding finals this week, 

While I know that finals week is a stressful time for college students such as myself, this week will be inevitably even more difficult with all that is going on in the world today. I know that taking the final in any class is essential for showing that a student knows the material. Although I am not asking for an easy ‚ÄòA‚Äô in any of my classes, I am asking that professors keep in mind that a final exam and course materials are not all the students have in mind this week. In short, I am asking that professors lower the expectations of their students this coming week. We are all aware that the whole country is in a state of fear and it is affecting our mental state as well. This is not a normal final week, as these are not normal times we are living in. 

Thank you in advance for your consideration and your course of action, 

Sincerely, 

A college student.",1584380765,1,0

For those who are staying, do you have any plans in mind, because this might be a change to try something new or fit something into your schedule, and by not closing campus people who have on campus jobs can breathe as they can still work.

If you want to PELP,"What exactly is PELP? The Planned Educational Leave Program (PELP) allows continuing student to take one quarter off during their academic career. 

Here is a link with all the PELP information including info about financial aid and health insurance. Specifically the bottom of the page has a link to the PELP webform where you can submit your application. https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/registration/leave/pelp

The PELP Application is available each term starting with Pass One Appointments and closes on the 10th day of instruction.

A few key points from this page (verified 3/15/2020)
You can apply for PELP as late as the 10th day of Instruction (which is April 10th).  Depending on when you submit your application you will be refunded some or all of your fees.
100 % refund of your fees (less $10) if your PELP application is accepted on (or before) the first day of the quarter, March 30th  The refund is lower is you wait - see the website for details https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/registration/leave/refunds
There is a $70 fee when placed on PELP , but that fee is typically waived for EOP students.
When you return in the subsequent quarter you will register using schedule builder as normal, but must be sure to complete registration (Pass 1 is May 11th ‚Äì 22nd for continuing students) before the Registration Freeze (for Fall 2020 the date is September 15th).

[COVID-19 UPDATE 3/13/20] Spring Quarter classes will be held remotely. Here is what you need to know.,"We have updates for you about Spring Quarter and there is a lot of information. Here is what you need to know and where to go for more detailed answers:

* Lectures and discussion sections will be offered through remote means for the entire Spring Quarter.
* For courses with labs, studios, clinical and rehearsal activities, instructors should devise remote alternatives to help students make degree progress.
* Colleges and professional schools will determine, in accordance with social distancing guidelines, which graduate courses will move to remote instruction and which courses will require some in-person instruction.
* Campus remains open and operational to serve our community.
* Supervisors are empowered to make decisions concerning remote work arrangements for staff.
* Students can choose to remain in on-campus housing for the quarter and services will remain available. Student Housing and Dining Services will be contacting residents with contract options in the next few days.
* Events of 150 people or more are canceled or postponed through Spring Quarter. Unfortunately, that means Picnic Day is canceled, as recommended by ASUCD organizers.
* No decision has been made regarding spring commencements, but it will be communicated as soon as feasible. 
* Beginning next week, we will send weekly Friday updates on the developing situation and post them at [https://www.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/news/updates/](https://www.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/news/updates/).

Spring Quarter Officially Online,"This email just went out to faculty

**March 14, 2020**

**To the UC Davis community:**

As we reach the end of this very challenging quarter, we want to commend students, faculty and staff for their resilience in the face of the many disruptions brought on by the COVID-19 public health emergency. Our continued monitoring of the situation leads us to even more difficult decisions for spring quarter 2020.

First, campus remains open and operational, and we expect it to remain so, pursuant to directions by public health officials. Even though Yolo County reports only two known cases of coronavirus (as of this writing), neither on the UC Davis campus, we know from the public health experts whom we regularly consult that there will inevitably be more. There is an immediate, urgent need for [social distancing](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2020/03/covid19---social-distancing--in-seattle-and-beyond.html) to limit the spread of this global pandemic. This led to our previous decision to[ ](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/coronavirus-new-campus-directives)[cancel in-person final exams](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/coronavirus-new-campus-directives).

**Students:** **The campus is providing resources for those of you who need access to computers for your remote finals, including a number equipped with webcams for those who require them.** [***You will find all the information on Student Affairs‚Äô Coronavirus Update webpage.***](https://studentaffairs.ucdavis.edu/news/coronavirus-update)

We are announcing the following directives for spring quarter instruction, which begins March 30, 2020:

**Undergraduate instruction**

* For lectures and discussion sections, instruction will be offered through remote means, such as web conferencing (e.g., Zoom), lecture capture, Canvas tools and other methods. Instructors can continue to find resources for these alternative methods of instruction on the[ ](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/teach)[Keep Teaching](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/teach) website.
* For courses that have lab, studio, clinical, rehearsal and similar learning activities, we strongly encourage instructors to devise methods of remote instruction that make it possible for the courses to still be offered. We recognize that there may be some courses where remote components are simply not feasible. In these cases, departments should make every effort to offer alternative remote-instruction courses that still help students make degree progress, or in cases where alternatives are not possible, develop strategies to offer the students the courses at some future time.
* For upper-division laboratory, design or capstone courses that cannot be offered through remote delivery, departments should arrange alternatives, particularly as students might need such courses to graduate soon. Guidance needs to be communicated to students as expeditiously as possible.

We will continue to work with all our colleges and schools to develop alternative strategies where necessary. We thank everyone involved for the monumental efforts they will be making to ensure educational continuity for our students.

**Graduate education and training**

* Graduate education will also transition to remote delivery with some exceptions. Colleges and professional schools, working closely with department chairs and graduate group chairs, will determine, in accordance with [social distancing guidelines](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2020/03/covid19---social-distancing--in-seattle-and-beyond.html), which graduate courses will move to remote instruction and which courses may require some in-person instruction. Certain courses may need to be offered at a future time or remote-instruction alternatives may need to be provided to assist graduate students in making degree progress.
* The[ ](https://grad.ucdavis.edu/node/58475#overlay-context=)[COVID-19 Graduate Education Guidance](https://grad.ucdavis.edu/node/58475#overlay-context=) webpage lists current recommendations regarding qualifying, comprehensive and Ph.D. final examinations as well as degree filing and other provisional procedures.

With both individual and community health in mind, the goal is to continue graduate education ‚Äî including laboratory, research and scholarship components ‚Äî to the fullest extent possible. Some professional schools are on the semester system and will apply this guidance accordingly. In addition, health science schools operate in accordance with guidelines specifically applicable to them (for example, in clinical practice).

**Academic support**

Our [comprehensive educational and personal support services](https://studentaffairs.ucdavis.edu/student-life) will be available in both in-person (small groups with social distancing) and remote formats, to meet the widest possible range of student needs. This includes, for example, office hours, academic advising, tutoring, supplemental instruction, and library and mental health services.

Health remains our foremost priority. We hope these directives will help students continue progress toward their degree and reduce enrollment load for future courses.

As the spring quarter progresses, we will continue to monitor the coronavirus crisis and may reassess our directives. Nonetheless, the decision to allow for remote instruction will continue throughout spring quarter. Should the situation improve, instructors may be given the option to resume in-person classes but would not be required to do so. Students, however, would still be allowed to finish their spring courses remotely.

**Events**

* Our cancellation or postponement of events expected to draw more than 150 people will continue through spring quarter.
* **Picnic Day is canceled**, as recommended by the ASUCD student organizers.
* No decisions have been made regarding spring commencements but will be communicated as soon as feasible, both for the individual graduate and professional ceremonies as well as those for graduating seniors.

Organizers of events of any size are strongly encouraged to communicate to participants whether an event has been canceled or if alternate formats are being made available.

**Housing, dining and facilities**

We anticipate that residence halls, dining halls, recreation facilities and student support services will remain available throughout the quarter, while we work continuously to make these spaces as safe as possible. As noted previously, custodial teams are disinfecting student housing, administrative and teaching spaces daily, in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Dining services is disinfecting high-traffic areas hourly. Additionally, hand sanitizers are stocked and available at building entrances and exits across UC Davis, and bathroom soap dispensers are being filled regularly. [Contact Facilities Customer Support if you find an empty dispenser.](https://facilities.ucdavis.edu/operations-support/customer-experience)

Residents who hold current contracts with Student Housing and Dining Services will receive a communication about their options within the next few days.

**Health**

Now is the time for all of us to protect our health and the health of our community. Our[ ](https://www.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/news/health-well-being/)[health and well-being topic page](https://www.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/news/health-well-being/) has information on prevention and mitigation, and what to do if you feel sick (please stay home if you are). We are also grateful for words of comfort from Peter Yellowlees, chief wellness officer at UC Davis Health, a psychiatrist who[ ](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/wellness-officer-shares-strategies-cope-covid-19-uncertainty)shared [strategies to help cope with the crisis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/wellness-officer-shares-strategies-cope-covid-19-uncertainty), to help manage our anxiety and fear.

**Closing comments**

The COVID-19 public health emergency continues to evolve. We have a dedicated team working nonstop to inform our campus response. Beginning next week, we will send weekly Friday updates on this situation and post them[ ](https://www.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/news/updates/)[here](https://www.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/news/updates/). We also have a[ ](https://www.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/)[general information page](https://www.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/) addressing multiple topics, including instruction and research, workplace and travel, and operations and events.

Today‚Äôs message has focused on instruction, but we are working tirelessly to help all members of our community find ways to adapt to our current situation. Staff are critical members of the UC Davis community. Human Resources has prepared [guidance for supervisors and managers](https://hr.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus) on workplace concerns, such as employees who become sick or need to care for loved ones, and a[telework page](https://www.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/news/workplace/) that allows managers to make decisions concerning remote work arrangements. 

For our employees and students with young children who are impacted by the recent K-12 school closures, please know we will do our best to be flexible and understanding during these most unprecedented times.

We are optimistic for the future when campus operations and classes can return to normal. On a bright note, UC Davis this week sent approximately 32,000 admissions notices to potential new freshman students, and observed the recipients‚Äô joy on social media. And while we have canceled our April 4 Decision UC Davis event, an open house for our freshman admits and their families, we immediately shifted to our backup plan: Aggie Experience Live! ‚Äî a virtual open house.

Working together as a community, in accordance with our [Principles of Community](https://diversity.ucdavis.edu/principles-community), we will continue to adapt to these challenging times. Now more than ever, let us collectively confront and reject any and all manifestations of discrimination.

Our best regards and deepest appreciation for all you do for UC Davis.

We will get through this, together.

"My nightmare just happened, advice?","So. I was issued a PTD number today (late drop number) for one class bc of medical reasons/work overload. I went in to schedule builder to use the code, and I am RUSHED, the deadline is approaching. I scroll down, click the course and enter the number. I get kicked out. I go back in and again, use the number. I get a notice that it's already been used and I think that's wierd, maybe it hasn't updated. And then I saw it. The class right above it. Instead of registered, it says ""no longer waitlisted."" Wierd, I was waitlisted in the beginning of the quarter, than was enrolled. But then, I see I'm no longer registered at all. I think what must have happened it, the page was still scrolling down at the exact time I clicked the course. Because I swear I clicked the correct course! So it had to have moved a 2nd before I clicked, the course actually dropped, was the course above. 

I have not been going to that class in anticipation of dropping (I had already had permission, but had to wait on a medical form bc it was hard to get an appointment). Hence me getting the document at 6pm before the deadline and not getting the number until 15 mins before it expired. I am doing very well in the class I dropped. I just finished the lab portion with an A! I am honestly shocked and horrified!

Here's what I've come up with: emailing the professor of the course I wanted to drop, and ask for an incomplete, and deal with having to take chem all over again. But I am crying just thinking of that. So and? It's a repeat from last quarter! So it would be my 3rd fucking time, although my 2nd on paper. 

I ready emailed the dean. I am so embarrassed. She obviously won't be in until Monday. Get a form for dropping a course after the last day of instruction and use that new number. Retake the chem class. 

What I want to happen but is it possible?? She somehow reverses this, resets it?? Idk. Still wouldn't be able to use the PTD number. Then do as above and fill out the retroactive drop form, use the same medical doc. and she approves it. It's like it never happened. 

So I take the final on Monday for chem anyway correct? What if I can't get in, it's online now? If I have to retake it, will they at least take my lab even though I accidentally dropped it?? 

I. Am. Freaking. Out. And? The medical form was because of severe ADHD and medication issues, and an overload of courses. So the carelessness and lack of attention that resulted in the mistake was probably bc of ADHD. Has any ever heard of something so stupid happening??",1584152035,1,0

Housemate won't pay rent?,"I currently live in an apartment (not SHA) with another UCD student. She is currently refusing to pay rent because of the pandemic. She has cleared out her belongings and expected to be released from the lease, which is obviously not possible because it was a joint signed lease until September. We can be let off of the lease only if we find a complete lease takeover, but that is near impossible with the amount of vacancy in Davis. 

She hasn't paid her portion of April rent, but I have. She claims to have lost her income and can not pay rent. She also refuses to sign up for a payment plan with the apartment. 

We will be facing eviction at the end of May if all missing rent payments are not made in full. I can't afford to pay the rent for both of us, as I am currently picking up work shifts to barely pay my own rent. Is there anything I can do aside from taking this to small claims court?

    Bright in the April sun our portals wait‚Äî
    Doors that swing lightly to the eager hand
    And corridors down which the careless foot
    May bound unheeding. Here perhaps an eye
    Kindles with thought; and there a youthful voice
    Grows earnest mid the laughter of the throng.
    
    Onward they troop, the joyous and the grave‚Äî
    Endless the pageant as the years revolve;
    And many April suns must warm these walls
    And springtimes quicken in the veins of youth
    Before we know who loved our portals best
    And bore from them the richest gifts away.",1587597828,2,0

@ stats people! question about sta 131a,"i'm a first year statistics student so i don't really know much about the classes/profs in upper division stats, and i have some questions :o i read in the catalog that mat 21d is recommended for sta 131a, but not a requirement. for those of you who have taken this class, how much of mat 21d did you use? what concepts carried over to sta 131a? i think that i'd be able to take sta 131a and mat 21d concurrently, do you think that'd be fine?

also, if anyone has taken 130ab, how has that prepared you for the 141 series? is there a significant benefit to taking 131ab over 130ab?

I don't really have any pre med friends at Davis though, so I'd love some insight! I'm pretty committed to pre med LOL. Like very. 

For context, I attended a very competitive public school in California. And Other colleges I am considering, while wonderful in their own ways, have issues as a prospective pre med. Like Berkeley (grade deflation+ no clinical hospital), USC and Duke (cost). I'd really love to attend Davis, and I'd really appreciate insight that's personal and isn't skewed like US News rankings haha. 

I've heard science classes are averaged at a C? I'm not afraid of hard work, but I'd like 8 hours of sleep in a day. What was your experience in lower division science courses?

Are profs willing to get to know you as a person?  LETTERS OF REC BABY-- also I need mentors and friends. Mainly friends. Kinda. 

How were your research opportunities? I like being sheltered away from the blinding sun at all times of day. Gotta work on my albino tan. 

Are the people around you inspiring? And easy to befriend?

Off campus or on campus,"Im going to be an entering freshman next fall and was wondering whether to do on campus housing or off campus housing.

Pros of off:
-My own room which will be much more spacious than a dorm.
-Much easier access to my car (commuting to campus and opportunities in sac) but will still park a bike on campus.
-Save a healthy amount of money.

Cons of off: 
-Little inconvenient with commuting.
-No dining on campus in the commons?
-Can‚Äôt meet as many new people. 
-No ‚Äúfreshmen living experience‚Äù.

Anthropology Transfer,"Hey guys! 

I just got in to Davis as an anthro major (General BA but planning on going evolutionary) and am planning to transfer in the fall! I have a few question both about the anthro department and transferring to Davis in general. 

- For anthro majors: What has your experience in the department been like? Class size, faculty, fellow students, content, stuff like that. Also, if you transferred from a community college, did you have to take more lower division classes once you arrived. Finally, any specific courses or professors you recommend for a fun and relatively easy first quarter as I try to navigate the quarter system and living in a new town?
- How hard is it to declare an unrelated minor once enrolled? I‚Äôm hoping to minor in CS. 
- What can I expect from SHA? I‚Äôm going to live in transfer housing and it is kind of unclear what the options are and what the process is. Approximately when is the day people select rooms? 
- I‚Äôm not the most outgoing and have trouble making friends, especially female ones (I am female), but in the past I‚Äôve had success with on campus jobs. My community college had dorms and I worked as assistant RA and in the residence hall office. I made most of my friends through being involved in the dorms. Does anyone have any suggestions about part time on campus jobs to get involved or any other ways they found their group or friends? I‚Äôm interested in Greek life but I‚Äôm not a big partier.

Also, I am capable of managing a decent workload, I survived this [bad idea of a schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/dybd36/how_bad_of_an_idea_is_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and got out relatively unscathed, but I have heard upper divs it‚Äôs worth it to take it slower? (Versus of lower div mentality I‚Äôve felt of survival / not getting weeded out) 

Also, would anyone be willing to give quick summary of what upper divs cover? I know eng 105 is thermo and have a general idea for 103 in terms of fluids. Is 104 like statics on crack or is that 102? 106 is a combo of 103 and 105 yea? How‚Äôs 172? 165? 

Thanks friends hope you‚Äôre all safe, and don‚Äôt forget to stay 2m apart",1588634615,1,0

No motivation :((,"I‚Äôve never been much of a stem head, but at the end of fall quarter my freshman year I decided to change majors and enter the belly of the beast. The transition has not been easy from the very start (I‚Äôm still in the midst of changing), but I‚Äôve always persisted. I set goals from the starting and have been chasing them since.
Every quarter I always had a class I feared that I would fail, whether that be chem, calc, or Bis. Nonetheless, I dedicated a lot of time towards those classes(going to office hours, tutoring, and study jams) and actually ended up with decent grades that I was satisfied with. 
Going into this quarter, I knew that my biggest struggle would be physics. I‚Äôm not my normal self, this quarantine situation has really taken away my motivation to persevere through my toughest class. I sit on my laptop all day but get no work done. I‚Äôve never failed a class before but I worry that I‚Äôll fail this one. The first and only midterm is tomorrow morning and I‚Äôm not prepared at all.

Additionally, I appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of the major, I feel it might waste my time a bit. 

Therefore, I am considering switching to npd or psych w/ a biological emphasis and maybe a neuroscience minor? npd sounds cool because I am interested in neuroscience and it is essentially the ‚Äòunofficial‚Äô premed major of davis, but i‚Äôve been advised that the courses are very difficult to maintain a high gpa in and often kill your chances at med school.

Farewell UCD :(,"These past four years of my life have been life-changing. I've learned so much about the world, people, and most importantly, myself. I wish I could say that I had the best time during my college years, but the truth is, it was f\*cking insane. 

I dealt with the sh\*ttiest roommate during my freshman year who didn't know how to let me know when she was going to have a guy over at our dorms. The amount of times I've walked in on the bangbang was not cool. Was subject to dismissal in winter quarter. Really contemplated wtf I was going in college... they let me stay :)

Again, dealt with the 2nd sh\*ttiest housemate during my second year who put me in a situation that I think has traumatized/changed my life in so many ways. Was subject to dismissal again because of this situation, but ended my year making it onto the Dean's List.

My 3rd year of college was actually normal. This normalcy allowed me to reflect on my life in the past 2 years and in my life in general. I've gone through quite a few traumas in my life, stemming from childhood that I never addressed. I think the events of the past 2 years triggered something for me. I realized that I was not okay and it's scary watching your mental health deteriorate. It's even scarier being a psychology major and watching it happen lol. \*\*Side note, I changed my major 3 times (College of Ag has the nicest staff with College of BioSci having the least supportive imo. Didn't make it to College of Engineering unfortunately)\*\*. By the end of my 3rd year, I struggled with suicidal ideation which turned into darker things... but I sought out help from counseling on campus. At one point during all of this, I was juggling a part-time job and two internships (one being in Sacramento). Then those two internships became my part-time jobs and although it was rewarding, it left me burnt out asf. 

My 4th year has been a huge emotional roller coaster ride. My therapist helped me heal in ways that I didn't know one could be healed. I have a long ways to go, but it's a process. I have PTSD, and under that, depression and anxiety. I think this is the first time in a long time that I'm taking the time to listen to my body. This year, I only juggled a part-time job and school and it's one of the best decisions I've made for myself. I worked on my relationships with my friends, family, coworkers, and allowed myself to be vulnerable with them. Hell, I even put myself back into the dating world because I finally came to a consensus that I deserve happiness despite all the sh\*t I've endured (dating didn't work out, but it allows more room for self-love amirite? jk it's left me sad asf) I've learned that I'm actually quite a sensitive person, I wear my heart on my sleeves, my therapist even told me I got a big 'ole heart (I use to think I was emotionally detached asf), and most importantly, I learned to have self-compassion. Lots and lots of it (easier said than done).

COVID has changed so many lives. It's definitely changed mine. I'm sad that I won't get closure with my friends and my coworkers. I'm sad that I won't be a student here anymore after COVID ends just because I won't get proper closure when I graduate in a month. But I'm also so SO relieved that I've made it despite everything that has happened to me and I'm so ready to leave this part of my life behind and \*hopefully\* go on to bigger and better things for myself.",1588434348,1,0
hi im socrates,"I always thought that we as humans were flawed in the sense that we were misguided, some more than others, but now I can see that that is not the case; we just want a sense of belonging -- a sense of comfort, while still holding onto the pride that we can't let go because... as we resist the temptation of becoming our full potential self, our best self, we meet negative moments in our lives, yet we fear change, and we fear the fact that we cannot control certain situations against us which inturn create newer and more difficult situations and circumstances that make us feel obligated to deal with, yet at the same time... want to avoid but cannot for the sake of our own wellbeing. unironically, this is the driving force of our dark side -- our shadow side, and when we let that go, we also let our ego go, and when we do that, we see newer possibilities of growth, and truly start to uncover our true self -- our real self... our greatest potential!",1588420260,1,0

Question about Stats major and need advice,"Hi, I'm a community college student who plans to major in statistics and I will apply to  UCD next year. I already have all the perquisites done with all A's, and I just need to finish a few more GEs. I know UC Davis has many statistics major student, so I know I can get a sense of studying stats major in UCD from you guys. I hear UCD has many resources for statistics major and they even have a stats lounge? From what I hear, the community is very friendly, and I love to go there. Since I have 1 more year, I will take some programming classes such as Java, SQL, Python, Data Structure before I get here. Hopefully, it is useful for me. My gpa is 3.6, and the major GPA is 4.0 so far.  I will go UCD if I get accepted. I'm interested in going to graduate school, so I'm thinking I might apply as a stats general track. I have a few questions, and thanks for your answer.

&amp;#x200B;

1.  I notice there is an integrated degree program (IDP), and I wonder how is it easy to get accepted to the program. The requirement is 3.2 GPA and 3 recommendation. I might have 1 professor from CC willing to write me one, but I still need two more. Should I join some stats research lab and hope I might get 1 recommendation from there? Also, how likely can I get a recommendation just by going to office hours every week?
2. How hard is the stats upper-division courses compare to lower-division courses? I already finish the math, but I only took 1 stats course. I understand it won't be easy, but is the grade distribution harsh? I'm hoping to take get 3.3 to 3.5 GPA.
3. I'm hoping to get involved in undergraduate research for stats major, but I don't know what should I learn before some professor willing to take me into the field.  Also, how do I apply to get into the research for stats major, do I just apply in some app? Or, should I just go to the professor's office hour ask them how can I join?
4. I think I will only take 3 major classes to be full time, and that's what I did in CC. Should I take 4 cs/stats courses per quarter? 
5. What is it like to be a stats major in UC Davis?",1589681737,1,0

Residence Hall vs. Transfer Apartment,"Hello beautiful people. I would like to hear from transfer students about their experience with either housing arrangement.  I am leaning towards applying to live in a residence hall as a transfer student because I never got the dorm experience as a community college student.  Are transfer students a rarity in the residence halls?  Will I be surrounded by freshmen?  Do they room transfers with other transfers in the residence halls? 

From what I understand you can apply to live is a residence hall if you‚Äôre 24 or under.  Although from the transfer housing seminars I attended it sound like transfers are encouraged to stay in the transfer apartments rather than the residence halls.  I am also considering applying to live in a co-op but I feel like the co-op housing maybe in high demand and it will be hard to get a spot in one without knowing someone.  Really confused by the whole process of applying for housing,  even more so because COVID has everything up in the air right now.

"""35 of the final 45 units completed before graduation must be earned while in residence at UC Davis."" and COVID-19/Online Classes.","I have some questions regarding the requirement: ""35 of the final 45 units completed before graduation must be earned while in residence at UC Davis.""

I'm an international student becoming a senior after this quarter and I'm wondering about how the requirement stated above will work with online classes.

I'm not sure how long the COVID-19 quarantine will last but if this lasts for over a year and I have to take online classes until I graduate, I would personally prefer to go back home since I have to pay rent here and spent extra on living fees when I can be spending far less living with my family back home. 

As far as I know, I need to be in UC Davis physically in order to fulfill the ""35 of the final 45 units completed before graduation must be earned while in residence at UC Davis."" requirement. This probably means going to lectures, attend lab, etc. in the UC Davis Campus. How would this work with online lectures? 

If we have to take online classes till graduation, does it matter where I am when I am attending all the classes and doing all the work in time?

I'm also concerned even if the previous statement were to be true. What if the COVID-19 pandemic ends a quarter before my graduation? I will probably have to come back to the states which will introduce new problems trying to get housing. 

Is there any rough estimate on how the COVID-19 pandemic will last? I'm thinking it is probably unlikely that there will be online classes for over a year, but I'm a little out of the loop right now so I'm not sure. 

Also, is there anyone who happens to know exactly what ""35 of the final 45 units completed before graduation must be earned while in residence at UC Davis."" means? I'm honestly still not entirely sure what it means.

For reference, I'm a chem major and its recommended that I do take 128/129 but I'm worried that the workload could be too much and which class would better prepare me for my pre-med track.

Commuting 1hr 10min - 1hr 30min to school,"Hi everyone! 

I will be attending UCD this fall double-majoring in PoliSci, Public Service and Sociology, Organizational Studies (Class of 2024). I have lived in Fair Oaks the last few years (about 40 mins from Davis), but have moved out on my own with my boyfriend back to my home town Marysville (1hr 10min - 1hr 30min from Davis as I am in the most rural part of a rural town). Gas will cost at most 700 a month and at the least 450 a month, which is still less than housing would cost me and my boyfriend is paying for nearly all of it. About half my income is going towards school so I can be debt-free, and living on-campus is just not an option because I want to avoid loans where I can since I am paying for my education on my own, as well as my bills. 

I have put together a draft schedule and got it down to 3 days a week, but I also work weekends in that area. I have been commuting to my high school and Sac State for my college classes about 45 minutes from Fair Oaks and often visited Marysville to stay at my boyfriends, so I am definitely used to commuting. I also have been commuting to work a lot of the week recently. I havent minded the driving thus far. 

I hope to only do this for the fall, but I will probably have to wait to move to Davis next spring or summer. Commuting and my boyfriend helping me with transportation costs is what's allowing me to build my savings for school so I can move later.

Is this a bad idea? What are your experiences? Apologies for the giant blocks of text - I have tried to read more on other peoples' experiences but they havent been all that similar to mine, so I thought the more detail the better.

I'm tired of this class,"I'm so tired of PHY 9A. I'm sick of it. I took AP Physics in high school and have never felt this lost on physics topics before. I wish I could go back in time and take it with a new professor (screw TBA btw). 

Lecture is just the professor regurgitating what's on the lecture slides, and the information on the slides and the examples in the slides are always insufficient. Example: Teaching us about center of mass and moment of inertia in lecture but not teaching us about how to use integration with lambda to find the center of mass. But then it's expected of us to use lambda and integration on the practice midterm and homework.

Homework is always difficult. Questions have typos in both units and grammar errors. Office hours is confused people asking for help on homework questions. One time THE TA got frustrated at how many questions there were on the homework and how difficult they were. Another time in discussion we went over something that the TA assumed we had learned about in lecture but didn't (finally learned about lambda btw).

The midterms are horrible. No review sessions. There's a practice midterm but the solutions don't explain the methodology behind why the answer is what it is (it's just numbers and math). The problems are a different level from the homework and lecture examples. They're always full of gimmicks that make the problem hard. How do you expect people to adapt to these gimmicks if their base knowledge on the topic is poor?

I'm sick of having to rely on a curve on this class. I hate this toxic mindset of ""well I hope everyone else did as bad as me."" It just sucks.

Frustrating Housing in Davis,"Hello redditors, 

This is my first post here, but I made an account so I can express this frustrating notion that I feel about housing in Davis. Does anyone else feel like it is unfair and slightly abusive that apartments enforce a yearly contract and then if you want to break the lease you have to do their job and find someone to replace you?

I feel like this isn't the normal thing in other cities. My sister just got a new job and her lease ends in October, but she just broke her lease (just paid extra and sometimes nothing at all) and she is moving to another city. I feel as though apartment complexes abuse students because they know that they can get away with it. Being a student is t a flexible time in your life. You could drop out, you can get kicked out, you might have to move home, you might have so many things that change as a grad student where you travel and stay somewhere else for months on end unexpectedly. It's not a concrete thing like if you are a family and have a stable job for years in one place. 

Yes, if you sign the lease it is your fault and you should know the circumstances, but whose to know what happens in the future? Like who knew that schools would be online in December 2019 when they renewed their lease. That is something you can't even anticipate. They ask you to sign it earlier and earlier every year. For me they asked me to renew in December. Then they say there is a deadline to renew and you feel pressure to renew. Also if you ask for a monthly lease or at least a half year lease, they wouldn't even offer it to you. If you don't agree with their yearly lease then you don't have a place to live. Yes, I know you can get a house or not live in an apartment. But why are these people allowed to profit so much like this?

It's also their job if they work there to find tenants. What do they do if they can't even do this? Also Davis has a 98% vacancy rate meaning that apartments are usually very full. Correct me if I'm wrong on that. So I feel like they put the pressure on the students to make their lives easier and they are a multi-million dollar company and you are just one student dealing with getting your life together. 

Finally, all these apartments charge way too much for their horrible conditions. Literally if you take one hot shower your entire walls are covered in mold and mildew. 

Sorry for such a negative post as my first post, but I just wanted to hear other people out. Davis is such a nice city full of nice people. I'm so shocked by the apartment situation here.",1589485549,3,0

Any Recommendations?,"Hey!

Need help making a decision after bike theft...,"So I recently got this decent bike for my birthday back in October and just this weekend it got stolen. I woke up on Monday about to head to class when I noticed my bike wasn‚Äôt at the spot I left it at, which is outside my apartment complex. What was left was a broken u-lock dangling from the bike rack. I really love that bike. It was a white frame single speed bike with red wheels. I don‚Äôt normally leave my bike outside, but recently with the rain and me constantly using it. It have got warned down, so I decided to lock it outside. I was pretty confidence that it wouldn‚Äôt get stolen because I saw bikes like mine on the bike rack for weeks in the same spot. To be safe I even wrapped chains around the back wheels, which were connected to the u-lock on the front wheel. Now that it‚Äôs gone I don‚Äôt know what to do.  Due to my bike being gone I decided to buy a $124 bike from Walmart as a replacement thinking that this one might not get stolen, but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable riding that bike. It‚Äôs heavy, small, slow, and the front wheel already start making noises. I don‚Äôt know if this is weird or not but I feel like the bike doesn‚Äôt suit me and I don‚Äôt feel like riding my new bike to school for the next few years. I also have an old old bike back at home that has a huge hole on one of its tire, warned down brakes, and wobbly wheels that I wouldn‚Äôt mind riding again. (This was the bike that I used before I got the single speed bike.) Now that I explained to you situation, I need help making a decision. Do I suck it up and stick with the Walmart bike or should I drive home(2 hours away) pick up my old old bike and refund my Walmart bike and see if bike repair shops like Green Bicycle Shop can repair it. The cons of this option is that I don‚Äôt know if the shops can repair it or not and I don‚Äôt want to waste time driving back and forth just to get nothing accomplish or have to wait a few days for them to order parts online to repair my bike and it‚Äôs also midterm seasons and I don‚Äôt want to deal with bike problems while I‚Äôm trying to study for my midterms. Or I can round up some of my savings(refunding Walmart bike and adding up other savings) and buying a new single speed bike($250) again and risk losing it, but this time I‚Äôm going to bring it into my apartment rather than locking it outside. The only risk is if someone decided to steal my bike at school while I‚Äôm in my class.(My latest class ends at 6PM) I don‚Äôt know what to do and I need some guidance.

My major's advising office is ghosting me,"I'm a transfer student. I did not come from a CC, but another uni, from which I already got some major coursework under my belt. At transfer orientation this past summer, I talked to my major advisor about my weird credits, and she instructed me to email syllabi and course descriptions so they could be evaluated for fulfilling major reqs. This is something that only she can do, separate from credits counting towards GE or unit counts.

So, I did this during the summer. No response. Ok, she's busy with orientation and starting the year. Mid fall quarter, I emailed my advisor again with a ""hey you might've missed my original email here it is"" a week prior to a scheduled appt with her. I met with her and told her my credits still need to be evaluated, she was like ""awesome I am actually planning on knocking a bunch of credit evaluations out today and tomorrow"" but then she did not ever do anything. Winter quarter. I email her at the beginning of the quarter. Nothing. I email the office itself. Nothing. Mid-quarter and I have an appt with an advisor in my college's office. As we're going through my degree progress, I tell her that a lot is still up in the air because I'm waiting on this very important evaluation that just won't get done. She tells me I'm right to be concerned and gives me contact info for the advising supervisor. I email her. Once again, I am ghosted. 

With everything going on with covid, I know I'm going to get ignored if I reach out at all this quarter. That's fine, they have a lot going on, but it's absolutely nuts that I'm going to be finished with my junior year and still not know what's going on with my transfer credit. With only three quarters left, it's pretty fucking important for me to know if I'm going to have to take extra classes. To increase my stress and urgency, I was accepted into a summer program that involves courses and an internship, but it's been officially moved to online, which I'm not about. I'm going to have to defer it to fall which REALLY will affect my degree plan, and if it turns out my transfer credits aren't what they ought to be, I'm totally not graduating on time.

Seeking answers from current UC Davis students :),"Hello:)

I‚Äôm a hs senior looking to attend Davis in the class of 2024 and I‚Äôve never been to the campus (I was coming to tour on my spring break but now quarantine:/) so I was wondering if anyone has answers to the following questions?

‚Ä¢does the campus feel very isolated/suburban or are there enough things to do to not get bored?
‚Ä¢do you ever feel lost in the system, like you‚Äôre just a number? One of my fears is coming to a huge school and getting stuck in bureaucratic systems. Do you feel like you‚Äôre able to make connections w profs, do mostly profs teach the classes or TAs, and does it feel like your counselor gives you the time of day?
‚Ä¢any general info/advice from premed and or global disease bio students?

Thank you for any comments and hope everyone is staying safe and healthy!! :)",1585374961,1,0
Potential Freshman Wondering About Therapy At Davis,"Hello!

I'm a potential freshman deciding between Davis and a couple of other UCs. I've been in therapy for about a year and am likely to be in therapy when I'm in college as well. 

I'm curious about the therapy situation at Davis. I know there are psychiatrists on-campus who can prescribe medication and that you can see on-campus psychologists for a few weeks. How hard is it to make the switch from on-campus therapists to therapists in the community? What's the quality of on-campus therapists like?

I get super anxious just thinking about sharing a bathroom and kitchen with 2 other not-so-clean people that aren‚Äôt my mom. Does anyone have any other tips on keeping my germs to myself? 

These are some things I normally do anyways that might be helpful to others:

-no sharing towels 

-hovering over the toilet seat lmao (I‚Äôm paranoid af)

-closing the toilet seat when I flush so bacteria doesn‚Äôt go everywhere

-hiding my dishes and utensils so they don‚Äôt use them at all

-no sharing food

-keeping my own personal roll of TP that no one else touches

How does the Housing Application work for SHA?,"I'll be transferring this Fall and I saw information for incoming transfer students on the UC Davis housing website. I understand transfers are guaranteed on-campus housing, but how do they prioritize the apartments? It said that once the SIR is submitted, then the housing application is sent to the student. Does this mean that the sooner you SIR, the sooner you can complete the housing application on a first-come, first-serve basis?

I'm thinking of either Primero Grove or the Colleges. My mom is not willing for me to bring my car to Davis because she doesn't want me to drive for a long time even though I only live like 1.5 hours south of Davis lol, so parking isn't really a priority for me! Though it may change if I can somehow convince her :( She also mentioned she does not mind the cost of living on campus.

My priority is probably a single-occupancy room (I don't mind housemates, I actually prefer them but I like to have my own room) and proximity to campus!

Davis Comp Sci Club -- Rant,"This is more of a rant post so please go ahead and ignore this if you want. I'm a graduating senior and I've been to a lot of the CS Club events in the past and I must say I am very disappointed by the Davis CS Club board, their events, and especially the leadership. They used to be so good and they had such good events but now the quality has declined significantly. The events seem like a complete mess and they're so disorganized. It clearly looks like the leadership has been so bad this year. When I was a freshmen, there were so many people who would go to events. Moreover, they would actually retain members. Now, nobody cares anymore and I really blame the club for that. The CS community was so strong when I started at Davis and the CS Club was the catalyst for the connections I made today but I can't say the same anymore. I've even had friends who graduated and tried to reach out to the club to come back and they didn't really find the club too professional/responsive. I've even heard some of the faculty mention that the CS Club has just gone down hill during the ""Meet the faculty"" event. Idk if someone from the board will ever read this but if you do let me just tell you that if this continues, no one's gonna come to these events. It's really sad that even freshmen don't show interest in your events anymore. If you don't actually change the way you want to handle your club, I don't think anyone would want to work the CS Club and I sure as hell wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The other CS related organizations (like Bit Project, Wics, etc) have been doing way better) btw! At least they know what they're doing and have their shit figured out! K thanks bye.",1585201229,1,0

is this school right for me?(lifestyle + lab opportunities),"Hi, I come from a suburban town where I've already lived a life of there ""being nothing to do"" and ""being x miles away from LA."" I don't THINK I'd mind being in such a community again, but its more of the social atmosphere that I care about. Whether people have a friendly vibe or just mind their business. I'd like to enter a community that is green and friendly, since my high school experience has been full of extremely cliquey people that you can't simply walk up to and start a conversation. Living in another suburban town is tolerable, but I'm afraid of having to be stuck bored for years.

ALSO, the opportunities available are important to me. Ik they have a lot of research opportunities, but Im not sure I would like to do research..? The dream would be working in laboratories, so if anyone has any info on being able to work in labs I'd appreciate the info :) And being able to work in clinics or hospitals. I'm not too sure about how it is or whether it's too competitive and how it is for undergrad students. 

currently, the dream is me wanting to be able to drive to LA or some big city and have great night adventures since I'd finally be able to have my freedom lol.

UC Davis vs small liberal arts school for pre-med? Is it easy to get a good gpa at UC Davis and get into medical school?,"I am a biology major who is interested in pre-med and wants to go to medical school. I am choosing between a small liberal arts school and UC Davis for undergrad, and I do not know which one can best prepare me for medical school. In high school I had a very strong gpa.

I am worried that in a very large campus like Davis, it will be difficult to stand out as an applicant and get a very high gpa, since the student body is more competitive, and it is difficult to build relations with teachers for letters of recommendation. However, Davis is more prestigious, and can have more opportunities in the health field. At a small liberal arts school, it could be easier to obtain a higher gpa since the classes are more personalized, but there are also could be less opportunities for pre-med. 

I do not know which school to choose, and what will better prepare me for the MCAT and medical school in general. My primary concern is obtaining a high gpa, and how difficult it is to do so at UC Davis. Does anyone have any experience with this?",1586483009,1,0

Signing a Lease during covid-19,"I know that nobody has answers, but I would like to get some opinions. I am in the process of signing a lease for the 20-21 school year right now and I am not sure if I should proceed because of the pandemic. If classes go online in fall, I feel that I would be able to get a better deal on rent or find an affordable sublet because I intend to stay in Davis regardless. That being said, we have no idea if that will happen, and I don't want to be in a situation where I have to settle with an undesirable apartment because I waited; I am pretty sure I am already very behind on finding housing and feel lucky to have found an apartment that I am very happy with. I proposed to the landlord adding a contingency in the lease giving me the ability to terminate without penalty if classes go online in fall, but knowing landlords I don't think they will agree.

Additionally, a long-time professor who teaches ECN 102 writes that you can take either ECN 102 or STA 108 to prep for ECN 140, so STA 108 (which I've also taken) apparently also teaches as much ""visual literacy"" as ECN 102.

late filing for graduation,"so now that i got my degree in my hand i feel comfortable sharing this story

early fall 2019 (like week one or two i wanna say) my major advisor told me that i missed the filing period for graduation for fall 2019. which was true, i missed it and was freaking out and she pretty much told me there was nothing i could do and would have to file for graduation in winter 2020.

i was upset and decided I'm not gonna just give up there. well, i go to the admission office (? i think the...one in dutton hall iirc) and the student worker right away hands me a form that i just need to fill out. like....i just asked about late filing for graduation and i just fill out a form.


a few weeks later oasis says I'm filed to graduate yeehaw. i go to another advisor make sure everything is ok. she tells me yes, and i ask her why none of the advisors know about this form. she says the admission office must have done something nice for me...even though i saw that multiple ppl were able to fill out that form. it was easily accessible. 

how can this be?? idk i was devastated when that advisor told me i wouldnt graduate in fall and it sucks that was not true...is the late filing for graduation something new or something were not supposed to know about?? why dont the advisors know abt this???

has anyone else filled out this form before?? I'm still confused by the situation but i have my degree so ??? yay???",1586192118,1,0

You: what's your name?
Me: *says name*
You: that's a cute name, I'm *you say your name*. You have a really nice smile

You: What time is it right now?

You: And it's Friday right? Soo want to hang out around this time next Friday?
Me: Oh, no it's okay hehe
You: Well can I at least get your number?
Me: *hesitates to say no* No, I'm sorry I'm seeing someone :/
You: Oh really? Ah you're really breaking my heart here
Me: I'm sorry, but you're really sweet.

COVID19 3/7 Update: Leaders Advise ‚ÄòMaximum Flexibility‚Äô on Instruction,"A *letter from Chancellor Gary S. May;¬†Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter; Kristin H. Lagattuta, chair of the Davis Division of the Academic Senate; and David Lubarsky, vice chancellor, Human Health Sciences, and CEO, UC Davis Health.*

**Dear Colleagues,**

As you know, the situation regarding the new coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to evolve in California, nationally and internationally. The campus provides updates about the evolving situation at¬†[**https://www.ucdavis.edu/health/pandemics/coronavirus/news/coronavirus-information-uc-davis-campus**](https://www.ucdavis.edu/health/pandemics/coronavirus/news/coronavirus-information-uc-davis-campus).

The University of California revised its instructions on travel on March 5. Please consider the potential for additional countries to be added to the restricted travel list which could result in unplanned mandatory quarantine periods upon return to the U.S. It may well be advisable to limit nonessential domestic travel. Consult [**https://globalaffairs.ucdavis.edu/announcements/travel-announcement-novel-coronavirus**](https://globalaffairs.ucdavis.edu/announcements/travel-announcement-novel-coronavirus) for the most up-to-date information on travel advice.

**On March 6, Yolo County reported one confirmed case of COVID-19. There are, however,** ***no*** **confirmed cases of COVID-19 on the Davis campus. After careful review of our local situation and following consultation with health professionals regarding the specific risk represented by classroom meetings, we write to inform you that we are** ***not*** **mandating the cancellation of in-person class meetings for the week of March 9.**

We are, of course, aware that some universities have canceled in-person classes, and given the fluidity of the situation and if new information or guidance becomes available, we may have to change our plans at very short notice. We remain in constant communication with other UC campuses to profit from their thinking in the context of their local situations and are constantly reviewing the advisability of hosting other, nonacademic events on our campuses. To repeat, however**: The operational status of UC Davis, both in Davis and in Sacramento, remains unchanged at this time.** (UC Davis Health has provided relevant information for patients and visitors at [**https://health.ucdavis.edu/health-news/contenthub/novel-coronavirus-faq-for-uc-davis-health-patients-and-visitors/2020/02**](https://health.ucdavis.edu/health-news/contenthub/novel-coronavirus-faq-for-uc-davis-health-patients-and-visitors/2020/02).)

At the same time, however, **we are advising maximum flexibility and encouraging faculty or students who either should not or do not wish to attend in-person classes to complete the work of the quarter via alternate means.** The Academic Senate has made provisions to enable [**one-time instructional flexibilities**](https://academicsenate.ucdavis.edu/class-cancellation-information) for the remainder of Winter Quarter 2020, now entering its 10th and final week of classes. While the instructor of record has authorization to implement these flexibilities, we strongly encourage instructors to coordinate at the departmental level as much as possible. (We note that some professional schools are not on the quarter calendar. They are encouraged to avail themselves of the same flexibility.)

**Effective immediately, for the balance of Winter Quarter, instructors can move part or all of their remaining course content online**. Unless instructors shift totally to online mode, to the extent possible they should provide supplementary online materials to help absent students continue the course at the same rate as students who continue to come to class. Clear communication of these options is important so that no student who is feeling unwell feels pressured to attend class. Likewise, any instructor who is feeling unwell should arrange with their chair for assistance, as they would in any other situation.

The [**Keep Teaching**](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/) website provides information on remote instruction resources. We will soon provide a schedule for webinars for those who would find them helpful in effecting these accommodations.

While at this point in time we are assuming that Winter Quarter finals will be held as scheduled, the Senate has enabled and we are all encouraging maximal flexibility. Instructors may substitute a take-home exam or other assignment for the announced final examination, or they may drop the final exam altogether and grade students based on already completed work. (Instructors may choose to re-weight the graded material but are encouraged to minimize major changes in how students are evaluated.)

Instructors who so wish may hold the final exam online. Information on how instructors can set this up is available via the [**Keep Teaching**](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/) website.

Lastly, if necessary, instructors may work with individual students to take an [**incomplete grade**](https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/grades/incomplete) and finish remaining coursework at a later time, although in most cases this would be the least desirable option insofar as it introduces delay and uncertainty, which could prove especially difficult for graduating students.

Clearly, all these different types of flexibility will become critical should we need in the future to mandate a change in operational status. For this reason, and with the Spring Quarter in mind, we strongly encourage instructors to familiarize themselves with the range of options and either implement them or prepare themselves to do so at potentially short notice.

All the above should be taken as an extension of the [**Message on Planning for Instructional Continuity**](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/message-planning-instructional-continuity) posted March 5, which provides links to many critical resources. Faculty and students alike will want to know that we are also providing comparable guidance and appropriate flexibility to our staff colleagues. The guidance HR has shared with supervisors is accessible at¬†[**https://hr.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus**](https://hr.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus).

Finally and most importantly, it is crucial for all members of the UC Davis community to heed the recommendations for preventive care which have the greatest likelihood of protecting us as individuals as well as the larger community by diminishing the chances of transmission of the virus:

* **Wash your hands frequently** with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds, or, as an alternative, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
* **Avoid touching** your eyes, nose, and mouth.
* **Clean and disinfect** frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
* **Stay home if you are sick** and avoid close contact with people who are sick.
* **Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue,** throw the tissue in the trash, and wash your hands.

In addition, it is recommended that people practice good health habits: Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food. If you have not received your annual flu shot, please schedule one with your provider to help protect yourself against the flu. And do not smoke or use e-cigarettes. For information on ‚ÄúPeople at Risk for Serious Illness From COVID-19,‚Äù please consult [**https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html).¬†

Thank you for all your efforts.

Check your MyBill account activity ASAP--possible corruption,"I checked my MyBill account on a whim this morning, I had this gut feeling that something would be wrong so to make sure everything was paid correctly before the due date on March 15th, I checked my MyBill account. Normally my financial aid would cover everything, and I waive the SHIP insurance so I'm not supposed to pay for that. But lo and behold, I'm being overcharged by over $700 for the Winter quarter, for apparently no reason.  


According to my calculations (based entirely on the account activity for the Winter Quarter and on the fact that my balance for all previous quarters was $0, (I'm really adamant about making sure my balance is paid)) I should only be owing $48.54 for the Winter quarter--which would be covered by the financial aid for Spring Quarter.   


But for some reason, they're charging me nearly $800 for the Winter Quarter, which means even with financial aid, I owe over $300--which is money I don't have.  


I'll post my account activity here so you can see for yourself:

I haven't yet applied for part-time status for Spring quarter, but that shouldn't change much.  
I am a confirmed part-time student for Winter Quarter.  


My dad is a disabled veteran, so my tuition is supposed to be paid. The Pell Grant covers what the Vet Fee Waiver doesn't. He's been paying for pretty much everything for me so far because my bipolar depression prevents me from being able to handle too much stress at a time (I.E. I've tried doing work and school at the same time, even when I was only taking one class I was completely overwhelmed.) He pays his bills on a bartender salary and whatever we eat or whatever gas we use is paid for entirely by the tips he earns at the bar, which makes commuting all the more risky for me (we live in Napa.) On top of all that, his hands have been going completely numb the last few years, making it difficult for him to work. So not only is he mostly deaf, but he's going to have to have surgery soon and we don't know if we're going to be able to handle the financial issues. So as you can imagine, this issue on top of it makes things all the more stressful.  


If you have any questions or if you notice something fishy with your account as well, let me know. If enough people are having a similar problem, I'll try to find someone to look into it. If nobody does anything about it, I'll be taking it to the news.  


I smell corruption, and I don't like it.

Please let me know if you have any info or if you're having the same issue.",1583610161,1,0
Questions,"First of all, I will be a campus visitor from UC Santa Cruz next quarter. With the virus, what is the feeling about classes running as scheduled next quarter? Rather than cancel the classes, would they just switch them to online?

At UCSC, all of the upper-division classes are 5 units, so when we take 4 classes at 20 units, it is a lot of work.

Since I am not used to 4 classes, does this 15 unit UCD schedule seem doable?

\- Mat 22a 3 units

\- PHY 108 and 108L 4 units

\- PHY 115 4 units

\- PHY 104C 4 units 

I am working together with the advisor to see if I should take 104C.",1583600113,1,0

Thoughts on MAT21C with Temple?,I just wanted to ask students who have MAT21C with Professor Temple of what are their opinions of him as a teacher and lecturer. I personally have trouble understanding his lectures and that he goes a bit too fast for me so I end up most of time trying to copy what he's written on the board instead of listening to what he's trying to explain. So I'll end up going to Tavernetti's lectures just so I understand the material that's being taught.,1583525143,1,0

Interested in Ranked Choice Voting?,"Many of us are dissatisfied with how the democratic presidential primaries have been run. While there are lots of factors contributing to this, one thing I believe would help is ranked choice voting (""RCV""). 

While a few variations on RCV exist, the basic premise is this: voters rank their choices in order of preference. When tallying the votes, if someone receives a majority (over 50%), that candidate wins! However, if there is no majority winner, the candidate with the least amount of votes gets struck. Everyone who selected that unlucky candidate as their top choice gets their votes transferred to their second choice. The process starts over again. Find more detailed information [here](https://www.fairvote.org/rcv#where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used).

Why is this better than our current system? **It lets you vote your conscience without worrying that your vote will be wasted. Because voters' second and third choices are also important, RCV encourages candidates to campaign on substance, appeal to a broader base, and disincentives attacking other candidates.** 

Think of it like an *instant runoff*. In California there are many offices which use a primary + runoff process. For example, let's say there are 6 candidates for a city council seat. In March, people could vote for their favorite candidate of the 6. The 2 candidates with the most votes would face each other in a November runoff election. However, primaries typically have low voter turnout, so there are a small number of people whittling down the list. There are also increased costs that go along with this method: two sets of ballots, longer campaigns, etc. The 2 remaining candidates are also incentivized to attack one another to win the runoff. RCV addresses many of these problems - you only need one ballot/election, you have shorter and less expensive campaigns, and you would end up with the candidate with the widest support in a higher turnout election. You could vote based on your values, not based on who you thought had the best chance of winning. 

Personally, I believe the democratic presidential primaries would have been greatly improved by using this system, along with a host of other elections. A few cities in CA have been using it with good results. Maine is planning to use RCV for the November general election. I believe UC Davis uses RCV for ASUCD Senate &amp; President elections, and it's also used among faculty groups. 

**If we want better politicians, we should start with holding better elections.** 

There are a group of us (non-partisan, still working on finding a good name for ourselves...) who would love to see RCV become the standard for elections in the U.S. This effort will start with getting more cities and counties in California to adopt RCV, which we're hopeful could lead to a statewide adoption in the next 5-10 years. We're hoping to provide grassroots to support to organizations like FairVote that are tackling these issues from a different angle. 

If this is something you are interested in helping out with, ***we're having our first event at the Davis Farmers Market tomorrow from 8:00 AM - 11:00 AM***. We'll have a table set up with some literature and will be organizing a letter writing campaign to local elected officials asking them to support RCV. 

We would love to see you there!",1583517328,1,0

SJA Second offense,"So, it was in my ecs class this quarter. I looked into my friend's code from last quarter for help to finish an assignment.

Question is, I'm already in Disciplinary Probation status because I forgot to cite a source in my final paper of a sts class last quarter. Last time, sja considered my violation slight and didn't even punish me for community service. I'm really worried now about if they will straightly give me a suspension or dismissal this time.
