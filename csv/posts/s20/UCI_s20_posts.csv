How easy is it to switch engineering majors within Henry Samueli? If I go to UCI, I'll be going as a Materials Science &amp; Engineering major.

"If the main goal is for students to learn, then they should be able to decide on P/NP after finals","It doesn't make sense that we need to choose before finals. If UCI really wanted us to learn and try our hardest, then they would let us change it after finals.

This way, you are motivated to try and learn as much as possible so you can do well on the final. Worst case you dont get the grade you want and you make it a pass. Best case you do and you learned a lot at the same time!

What is the disadvantage of switching my classes to pass/no pass?,"Im a Chem E undergrad. I want to switch my 120 C class to pass/no pass because I am not sure if I'm going to pass and if I do, I will get a C and don't want to mess up my GPA. 

This led me to think, if pass/no pass is acceptable for core classes for this quarter, is there any downside to just switching all of my classes to pass/no pass? I have a 3.5 GPA before this quarter but it looks like I'll end up with B's in my other classes, which is good but will still lower my overall GPA. 

I know PhD programs etc may not accept it, but is there anything else? If I were to go to grad school I would want to do it here at UCI anyways since my family is settled here now, and since it is UCI's policy it would make sense that they would accept it.

UCs to open dorms at one third of their capacity,"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-04/uc-could-reopen-just-one-third-of-dorm-rooms-this-fall


By TERESA WATANABESTAFF WRITER 
MAY 4, 20205:41 PM
The University of California could reopen just one-third to one-half of dorm rooms this fall in order to maintain safe distances among students amid the coronavirus outbreak, a top UC official said Monday, raising questions about what would happen to others without campus housing.

Campuses are still making decisions on their fall scenarios, which may come in June or July. Last week, UC President Janet Napolitano said campuses will first be required to satisfy systemwide guidelines to ensure public health and safety and any reopening ‚Äúwill probably be greatly reduced.‚Äù

Any reduced availability of dorms ‚Äî and subsequent decline in housing revenue ‚Äî would amplify the staggering financial toll on the UC system triggered by the coronavirus crisis.

The UC system was hit with $558 million in revenue losses and added expenses to its 10 campuses and five medical centers in March alone and those costs are projected to rise to about $2.5 billion by the end of the fiscal year that ends June 30, according to Nathan Brostrom, UC Merced interim chancellor, who also has served as systemwide chief financial officer.

He made the remarks about dorm reopenings during a broad-ranging online discussion on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on higher education sponsored by the UC Berkeley Center for Studies in Higher Education.

Brostrom said the ‚Äúfinancial shock‚Äù of lost revenue from multiple sources, including dining and housing contracts, sporting events, study abroad programs and elective surgeries, would be a short-term crisis.

‚ÄúThese are one-time shocks,‚Äù Brostrom said during the webinar. ‚ÄúThere still is incredibly strong demand for our medical centers, pent-up demand for treatments, our housing. We could fill every single bed tomorrow if we were to open.‚Äù

CALIFORNIA
They did everything right to get into college. Coronavirus changes things, students say
April 13, 2020
Higher education officials across the nation are grappling with how to safely reopen campuses this fall, with many of them envisioning modified access to dorms, classrooms and dining facilities. Some small liberal arts campuses, such as Pomona and Claremont McKenna colleges, have secured leases to house additional students in nearby off-campus apartments.

But that option is more difficult for UC campuses, particularly those located in tight housing markets such as Santa Cruz and Berkeley. George Blumenthal, former UC Santa Cruz chancellor who now directs the UC Berkeley higher education center, said one possibility is to bring back limited groups of students, such as freshmen, for the all-important campus bonding experience and continue online learning for graduating seniors.

Students involved in UC‚Äôs vaunted research enterprise also would benefit from campus housing because it‚Äôs harder to do such work remotely, he said.

Blumenthal added that housing payments are used in part to pay off loans for construction of new buildings, so the loss of that revenue will affect UC‚Äôs ability to build badly needed residence halls. Housing projects are underway at several campuses, including Santa Cruz, Berkeley, Merced and UCLA.

Merced, however, is on track to open 1,000 new beds this fall as part of its Merced 2020 project. The campus expects to house significantly more students than in past years even with reduced occupancy resulting from social distancing, Brostrom said in an email.

The campus has introduced a two-year residency requirement to help its students ‚Äî most of whom are low-income and the first in their families to attend college ‚Äî better succeed by bonding more closely with faculty and peers. But Merced would relax the requirement for this year ‚Äúif that is determined to be the safest and healthiest approach to housing,‚Äù he said.

Cal State Fresno President Joseph Castro said the 23-campus California State University system could see unanticipated costs triggered by the pandemic rise to $400 million by the end of June. The biggest loss of revenue came from canceled housing, dining, parking, athletics and other large-scale events.

‚ÄúThe impact of COVID-19 on the CSU has been swift, significant and...much broader in its impact than the Great Recession was a decade ago,‚Äù Castro said.

James Hyatt, UC Berkeley former chief financial officer and currently a senior research associate at the higher education center, said the UC system is facing reduced enrollment of nonresident students, who helped campuses get through the Great Recession by paying higher tuition. He also said federal research funding could decline.

UC is heavily dependent on those federal funds, which make up 60% of the system‚Äôs $6 billion in contracts and grants, Brostrom said.

The panelists called for more state and federal funding but also said the crisis could open opportunities for more innovation, particularly in using technology for teaching and learning.",1588697066,0,0

I talked to the Camino leasing office and this is how it went.,"So i""m one of the people who needs their apartment during the summer, but not during the spring due to Summer Sessions. Let me just say, I hate the leasing office with a passion now after talking to them. This is how the conversation went:

Me: Hello! I know you're getting a lot of inquiries about this, but in my situation, I cannot cancel my lease because I need my apartment during the summer. So is there any way you can just cancel it for Spring?  


Rude lady: Sorry, we cannot partially cancel a lease so you will either need to sublease or pay the full amounts.   


Me: So if the school decides to make school online during the summer as well, I'd just be wasting $2000 for the months of May and April. So why can't you just stop rent for two months?  


Rude lady: Sorry that's just not how it works. I don't make the rules.   


\*\* At this point I was getting mad   


Me: Okay, so can you transfer me over to someone who DOES make the rules?   


Rude lady: I can't do that. NO ONE'S GOING TO LISTEN TO YOU.

\*\*\* Okay now I was pissed. She really told me no one's going to listen to me?  


Me: This is an emergency situation, and it does not happen all the time. You're really telling me that no one's going to listen to me?  


Rude lady: Yup. If you don't have any other questions, this is all I can do for you.  


I just hung up when she said that.  


All in all, the leasing office are awful, greedy people and I might go in person to wreak havoc. All of you guys need to complain and send emails because this is a disgusting situation. I'm a senior and need to take classes over the summer so that I don't have to take extra quarters. I'm sure there's a lot of people in my situation.

A Quick Case Study by ASUCI_budget,"Hey everyone, it's your friendly ASUCI budget analyst again back at you again with another analysis. With the way people are handling finals I think it‚Äôs important to understand how ***not*** to handle finals. But with infinitely less money!

This post is an open response, and is not finalized. I am working on a longer, comprehensive analysis of the response of educator‚Äôs at UCI so feel free to send me any screenshots you‚Äôd like me to use in my analysis. It‚Äôs spring break and I have some time on my hands.

Let‚Äôs get cracking.

Enter a case study of \[REDACTED\].

In response to [https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/fjc6bd/the\_state\_of\_cs\_132/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/fjc6bd/the_state_of_cs_132/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/fjcizo/meanwhile\_this\_cs\_132\_ta\_is\_deleting\_a\_students/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/fjcizo/meanwhile_this_cs_132_ta_is_deleting_a_students/)

I decided to speak up because I felt like it was important. How \[REDACTED\] responded to people airing their concerns about the final was wrong and rubbed me in the wrong way.

\[REDACTED\] is a reader in the CS132 class and he‚Äôs been responding to students on Piazza about their grievances with the final. It is clear he lacks any sort of empathy and just wants to stick to his ‚Äúhigh-road‚Äù. In my humble opinion, I think \[REDACTED\] lacks self-awareness. His responses to posts on Piazza are unacceptable.

Let us analyze one response by \[REDACTED\]:

‚ÄúYou guys need to respect Georgios more. Hes doing all he can to make this fair and so is the entire teaching staff. We read all your comments and are working on our solution. He knows more about teaching then you do and that‚Äôs why hes your teacher. Complaining About your situation and general panic is not helpful. We are going to be very lenient with your final grade and you guys should worry less. It‚Äôs one test for two hours and if you truly call yourself a computer scientist you should enjoy having your knowledge tested rather then doing anything and everything to get out of a bit of work.‚Äù

While it is fair to treat Prof Georgios with respect. He is a researcher before he‚Äôs a professor. But sure, he probably does know more about teaching that anyone else. Nothing wrong with that.

&gt;Complaining about your situation and general panic is not helpful. We are going to be very lenient with your final grade and you guys should worry less.

Fair. I‚Äôd argue if you weren‚Äôt complaining about your situation it is probably helpful for you to get informed about Covid-19 - but that's just like my opinion man.

&gt;It‚Äôs one test for two hours and if you truly call yourself a computer scientist you should enjoy having your knowledge tested rather then doing anything and everything to get out of a bit of work.

Uh. Clearly \[REDACTED\] is trying to state it is important to use your knowledge; but his response is disrespectful and lacks empathy. It is not the most tactical decision to claim people are airing their stress about having to take a final exam purely so they can get out of some work \[REDACTED\]. People are being affected right now by this emergency. Claiming people are ‚Äúcomplaining about your situation‚Äù in order to ‚Äúget out of a bit of work‚Äù is rude.

Instead, \[REDACTED\] could have said.

&gt;Hey guys! We are trying our best to make this fair and your complaints are being heard. Rest assured we will work for everyone.

In sum, \[REDACTED\]‚Äôs first response sought to reel in the class and reassure the class in the first line. Then he went and disrespected all the students with the rest of his response through his lack of empathy and lack of self-awareness.

Let us analyze another one of \[REDACTED\]‚Äôs responses: [https://preview.redd.it/i29zx81gtxm41.png?width=1401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6ae7b2cff1a4201f3ef54e65abb585dad44409b](https://preview.redd.it/i29zx81gtxm41.png?width=1401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6ae7b2cff1a4201f3ef54e65abb585dad44409b)

Anon Gear 3: ‚ÄúAnother international student here, I just travelled all the way from LA to India (21 hour flight excluding layovers and delays). I extremely appreciate what the professor has done so far but to be honest I am tired. I had to move out of my apartment, find storage to keep my stuff‚Ä¶..‚Äù

\[REDACTED\]: ‚ÄúAll that is required for the test is an internet connection. You can fly and leave if you like. I am in a very similar situation.‚Äù

Anon Gear 3: That‚Äôs true but I am extremely exhausted. I had to move out and take a 21 hour flight while being scared to death about the virus. If I wasn't this exhausted I wouldn‚Äôt say anything but I leave it up to you guys now. I think you guys are compassionate and rational people so I know you guys will do what‚Äôs in the best interest for the class.

\[REDACTED\]: ‚ÄúThere is nothing constructive about your criticism‚Äù

\&gt; other piazza posts here &lt;

\[REDACTED\]: Spamming me isn‚Äôt going to get you sympathy. If you want to discuss why your going to have a final. Ask me single questions.

Let‚Äôs look at \[REDACTED\]‚Äôs first response:

&gt;All that is required for the test is an internet connection.

This is completely fair \[REDACTED\] you only need an internet connection. But let us consider the fact that this student just spent a day travelling, probably a day packing up and finding storage. Then another day getting settled in India. That is 3 whole days spent, 3 whole days this student was not able to do any schoolwork. Also what if their internet is unreliable, online finals was sprung last minute and people who are forced to leave are not necessarily going to have time to ensure they are able to have stable internet.

&gt;You can fly and leave if you like. I am in a very similar situation

No offense \[REDACTED\], but I don‚Äôt think you packed up your entire life at UCI, left some of it behind, and then traveled a whole day home and unpacked and got settled. All in the span of 3 days while also having this virus loom over you.

&gt;There‚Äôs nothing constructive about your criticism.

By this one line, \[REDACTED\] dismissed the student‚Äôs current situation. I think factoring in the fact people are probably going to lose time organizing their situation would be a good move when considering how to proceed with finals.

Now imagine your the student who left for India and \[REDACTED\] says:

&gt;Spamming me isn‚Äôt going to get you sympathy. If you want to discuss why your going to have a final. Ask me single questions.

How utterly inconsiderate. \[REDACTED\] is so self-centered he feels like all this spam was meant to garner HIS sympathy and his sympathy alone. People were just airing their grievances and giving reasons which should be considered when deciding the state of the final.

The next response by \[REDACTED\] is particularly spicy:

‚ÄúThat is their choice. Personally I have an optional final and I‚Äôm going to take it. I didn‚Äôt spend an entire quarter of my life to not test my learning capabilities.‚Äù

Isn‚Äôt that the beauty of optional finals \[REDACTED\], people can actually choose to take it or not take it based on their own personal situation! If you were in a similar situation to the person who left for India I doubt you would have time to study and prepare for this final on top of getting your whole life together.

The correct response would have been to keep quiet and move on.

Personally I spent a quarter of my life so I could just experience life and the beauty of the world. But that‚Äôs not why we are here, we are here to understand **how not to handle finals** and a case study of \[REDACTED\]. \[REDACTED\] is an excellent example of terrible responses to legitimate concerns of students.

The job of an educator is to educate and provide the proper opportunities for the students to learn and grow.

Except \[REDACTED\] isn‚Äôt an educator in this case, he is only a reader - not even a TA.

All of \[REDACTED\]‚Äôs responses are extraordinarily self-centered. His responses lack empathy, maturity, and tact - completely unbecoming of someone who should represent UCI. Let alone someone who is pursuing a PhD at UCI.

In sum, it is important for us to remember that our fellows at UCI are going through hard times and its important to understand everyone‚Äôs situation is different. Think not about yourself, but what you can do for others. Check in and let them know their voices and being heard and comfort them if you can - wouldn‚Äôt you want someone to do the same.

Sorry for all the grammar mistakes, it is 4:20am right now and I just drove up to San Francisco around 8am on the 3/15 after moving out myself.

The Burden of COVID-19 and Finals Week

By Michael Flores, 4th Year Undergraduate in Sociology

I'm an undergraduate, but I'm older and I hang with grad students, so I've been privy to their conversations about finals. Some graduate students do not think undergrads should take finals. The question is a matter of consistency ‚Äì are we in a crisis or not?

Store shelves are bare of essentials like rice and water. Italy's borders are under quarantine. 20% of older adults will die from COVID-19. We run the risk of overwhelming our healthcare system. This is our reality. This all amounts to a crisis.

Appropriately, the administration has made reasonable changes to accommodate our public health challenge. On-campus classes are being shuttered, and students are being asked to go home. Some professors may not know this, but the administration's mandates are forcing students to make serious housing decisions in the middle of finals week. There is a sense of urgency and an implicit understanding that students need to work to make the transition happen. 

Yet, at the same time, the administration is acting as if it is business as usual by continuing finals week. The administration has failed to see how their administrative decisions are upending students' lives, so finals here we come.

Are we in a crisis or not? Because one action says we are, and another action says we are not. 

The administration's decisions hit students with a double whammy: Students must work to accommodate radical campus changes imposed from the top while studying for finals. It is as if the administration does not see the impact of its decisions.

Students preparing for administration-mandated changes have a host of things to do. They must decide if they're staying on campus or moving, right in the middle of finals week. They must consult their bank accounts and family, both things that can be in short supply for some students. They must ask their work if they can leave. If they're leaving campus, they must spend man-hours to pack their things, find storage, pay storage, and move items into storage. In addition, they must spend time to buy flights or arrange rides to go home. 

Then there is the issue of caretaking some Anteaters will face. The schools of younger siblings are now closed (LAUSD being the major one), and their parents must continue to work. Thus, some Anteaters must now remain at home, prioritizing sibling care over schoolwork.

These are real man-hours being taken away from students during finals week.

Then there is the issue of technology with finals. For students that are already home, they may not have access to broadband and a webcam. I've seen emails from professors saying that students should be prepared for online classes, and they should have the technology ready. I think that would be a reasonable expectation if it weren't for the fact that we were told finals would be online one week before. 

I have the means to weather both COVID-19 and finals. I have money, a home nearby, time, and extended family to support me. If we take finals or not, it does not matter to me, because I‚Äôm going to crush those tests. I'll be fine ‚Äì but how about students who do not have access to these resources? 

We should ask the administration to have a consistent message: Are we managing a crisis or not? If we are, is mandating taking finals in line with managing the crisis?",1584330899,1,0

Unpopular opinion: UCI admin has done a great job dealing with the coronavirus ordeal,"- Admin has encouraged professors to make finals optional
- Admin has transitioned Spring quarter to all online

If you do take the finals, it'll be 10 multiple choice questions on canvas (with no proctoring) that can be done from today to Friday (your choice basically). For anyone with this class, you don't have to stress about it as much anymore! I hope everyone can get accommodated to.",1584313096,1,0
New grade distributions in O Chem classes??,"So because of this whole Covid-19 situation a bunch of the professors (blum,bess and pronin) decided to make the final exam that was previously worth about 50% of our grades to 20% only. And to make it worse they chose to make midterm 2 hold nearly 50% of the grade now. I just don't understand how this is the only solutions they came up with. For one thing the scores on Midterm 2 were super low across all the classes, and secondly we all took lab practicals near the time of midterm 2 as well. 

With previous distributions favoring the final, the professors must have realized that so many people depend on the final to pass the class, and put more effort into it then the midterms. I don't think its a fair solution at all. Is anyone else worried about passing because of the new distributions and is there anything that can be done???",1584312977,1,0

2 chem labs over the summer?,"how deadly would it be to take chem 1C, LC, and LD over SS2? hear me out.. 

i already took gen chem a few years ago at a community college. I took one semester during intersession (5 weeks) which included 5 days a week of 5.5 hr lectures, and 2 days were lab. There was a pre lab, obviously ridiculously long lab meetings, and post lab in addition to the lecture tests. 

That being said, it's pretty dire that I complete 1LD by the beginning of this fall, versus taking it during the fall.
If I eat/sleep/breathe chem for those 5 weeks, and have pre existing knowledge, would an A still be possible in all 3? I'm not sure how labs work at UCI, i'm new.
I've heard courses over the summer are easier, but i've also seen threads of people complaining about 1C &amp; 1LC in one summer session

Thank you for participating in this discussion on homelessness in Orange County. Nothing is more important to me than listening to the members of our community. Hearing opinions from you and others in Orange County truly helps me represent our community. 

I look forward to hearing your questions and thoughts. I'm especially eager to hear if you were surprised by what you read, aware of homelessness in OC, or impacted in anyways by the homelessness crisis.

I made it my goal to start strong this quarter, like anyone else would. Sadly it isn‚Äôt going as I had hoped.

I consider myself a studious person who cares for their academics, puts in the work, and asks questions when I don‚Äôt quite understand something. 

The one thing that bothers me, and will always bother me, is seeing others who don‚Äôt put in the work that I may do better than me. This recently happened for two of my classes and the midterms we took.

It makes me feel as though I‚Äôm not doing enough (?) and it particularly makes me frustrated (and sad) that I just don‚Äôt see the improvement I want to.

ZotMail: Coronavirus Update and Health Tips,"Dear Anteaters,

As you may have heard in news reports, the CDC and [Orange County Health Care Agency have confirmed](http://www.ochealthinfo.com/phs/about/epidasmt/epi/dip/prevention/novel_coronavirus) a positive case of the Novel Wuhan Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Orange County.

We have been informed this individual is not a UCI student, faculty, staff, or patient. However, this is a serious matter, and we continue to monitor the situation. UCI and UCI Health have implemented measures to protect our community should a patient be identified in the future.

We realize that there are many questions about the virus, its impact, and what it means for the UCI campus community. The FAQ below is provided to help answer basic questions about the virus, to share steps for keeping yourself healthy, and to provide guidance if you feel that you have potential symptoms or exposure.

Any member of our community suspecting they have influenza or the Coronavirus should stay home. Students should call the Student Health Center at (949) 824-5304, or call their primary medical provider prior to arriving at the medical office. This will allow us to provide you with information on your illness, and to plan for your visit to the clinic, if needed. Faculty and staff should contact their provider‚Äôs office for additional instructions about seeking care.

The campus continues to operate normally. As the campus and medical center leadership continue to evaluate the situation in Orange County, we will share updates by email and on the [Student Health Center website](https://shc.uci.edu/).

We appreciate your cooperation and support in protecting the UCI community.

Albert S. Chang, MD, MPH

Medical Director, UCI Student Health Center

**Coronavirus FAQ ‚Äì Jan. 26, 2020**

**What is the Coronavirus?**

The 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) comes from a large family of viruses that are a common cause of mild upper respiratory infections, but also include both SARS and MERS, which can cause more serious disease. Most patients with coronavirus have mild symptoms, however this new virus has resulted in cases of severe illnesses and deaths reported in China.

To learn more about the coronavirus, the CDC website is a reliable source of updated information: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html

**What is being done to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus?**

To reduce further spread of the infection, Wuhan City and nearby areas have implemented travel restrictions. Airports in the US (including LAX), are now screening entering travelers from certain areas for symptoms of respiratory infection.

Locally, this is an evolving situation. The campus and medical center are in coordination with Orange County Health Care Agency resources and the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) to provide ongoing clinical guidance.

**Have there been any POSITIVE (2019-nCoV) Coronavirus cases on the UCI Campus?**

No, we are informed there are currently no positive Coronavirus cases on the UCI campus or at the UCI Medical Center. Detailed information of confirmed cases in the U.S. can be found on the [Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html) as such information becomes available.

**Is there a vaccine for Coronavirus, and can I be tested for Coronavirus if I feel unwell?**

There is currently no vaccine for Coronavirus (2019-nCoV); however, the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) are working around the clock to develop one.

The only current testing for the Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is done at the CDC Laboratories in Atlanta, Georgia. At this point, testing is only performed for patients who meet all of the clinical and travel criteria.

**What should I do if I think I have the Coronavirus?**

If you have a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough, difficulty breathing, or shortness of breath:

* Stay Home from school/work if you are having symptoms
* Wash your hands and stay well hydrated/drinking fluids
* Cover your cough, and avoid close contact with others
* Call your healthcare provider to make an appointment

If you have traveled to Wuhan, China, or have been in close contact with someone who has recently traveled to Wuhan, China, within 14 days before the onset of your symptoms, please notify your provider/clinic BEFORE entering their office. It is important to call so that your provider/clinic can be prepared for your visit.

The UCI Student Health Center has developed triage screening (by phone and at our front desks) and has implemented additional protocols to help identify possible cases of coronavirus to provide optimal care for those with symptoms and to protect other patients and staff.

UCI Students should call Student Health Center at (949) 824-5304.

UCI Faculty and Staff should call their healthcare provider immediately for care.

**What can I do to help keep from getting the Coronavirus, or other infections?**

* Wash your hands frequently with soap and water
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth
* Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work, or school
* Practice healthy habits: get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food
* If you have not received your annual flu shot, please visit the UCI SHC website to review the schedule, and schedule a Flu Shot visit

**Do face masks protect against coronavirus? Do I need one?**

For now, public health officials say there‚Äôs no need to wear face masks in the United States; however, there is likely no harm in adding this additional layer of prevention, especially for people who think they may be sick.

Health-care workers interacting with coronavirus patients or suspected cases will follow CDC recommendations to wear the N95 respirator mask, along with other precautions like gloves and eye protectors.

**How will I know if things change/there are any cases at UCI?**

The UCI Student Health Center will continue to screen and identify possible cases of Coronavirus. We are committed to providing optimal care for those with symptoms, and to helping ensure appropriate treatment and exposure prevention. As the situation changes and we have new information, we will send timely updates to the campus community.",1580099517,1,0

First Coronavirus confirmed in OC. Is it not around the time to stop entries from China until we find a cure?,"Look people I'm not racist but I feel the cat is already out the bag and it may get too late (or be already)..

From what I know this CoronaVirus thing takes 14 days to show symptoms. Meaning anyone could have been sick and came here carrying the virus and going undetected. 

If this spreads hospitals won't have capacity to take care and we're gonna lose a lot of lives. 

I feel like our governors &amp; those in charge are not taking matters serious enough. What do you guys think?? I'm freaking out a bit. I know that there are at least 1-3 direct flights from china with a lot of them coming to Irvine. I'm literally freaking out. Can you guys tell me am I just freaking out or am I right thinking authorities are having a huge delay to comprehend the issue? Like it takes 14 days for a person carrying virus to start fever. That means all these people that came today, yesterday, day before, tomorrow, all could be carrying the virus!?",1580026450,1,0

Hot Take on ASUCI Vsauce Fiasco,"ASUCI has ~300 to 400 executives, paid staffers, and interns. The small conference room they booked only holds 418 people. ASUCI also made it to where you could bring a guest. The numbers seem to add up to where I think ASUCI put on the event for themselves. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they let AS Peeps in before everyone else too.

I know there has been a lot of drama about the impeachment of the ASUCI President for Abuse of Power and Maladministration, but after seeing this failure of an event I am starting to believe there may be some truth behind their charges.

Another post was saying that maybe if they paid someone to put on the event it would have been better, but ASUCI actually does that by paying the president $9,000 a year and his staffers $1,500-2,500 for the whole year. It seems like there are a lot of ASUCI Peeps on Reddit attacking the Senate and defending their failures, but I think the students see right through it.",1583312267,1,0

Students at UCSC have been engaging in a wildcat strike since December of last year to fight for a cost of living adjustment as a result of wage stagnation amidst unchecked housing cost inflation and one of the highest costs of living in the United States.

Our strike has been growing, and solidarity movements have popped up at several other UC campuses, as well as a number of campuses nationwide. We were even endorsed last night by Senator Bernie Sanders.

CS 171 Midterm ‚Äì Behind the Scenes (?),"Some of you fellow redditors may have heard about the [frustrations regarding the recent CS 171 midterm](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/f5ztg6/cs_171/) with Professor Richard Lathrop. Well, I know someone who knows someone else working for Lathrop in 171 as a grader. For those of you wondering more about what the ""scheduling delay"" that Lathrop was talking about on test day was, you might now have the answer to that (please remember that this information may not be entirely accurate or even close to being so). Here was a text conversation the friend of the grader had with my source (edited slightly for better grammar and capitalization):

Grader's friend: Ok so my friend said they got the message to print the midterms at 12:09 (21 minutes before class). Now I guess it was 12 pages and there's 300+ people in the class, so that's not feasible to begin with. There was some other stuff that happened with her, like Lathrop wasn't in his office and the DBH admin wasn't there.

Person I know: Lol I didn't know they delayed the printing that much.

Grader's friend: Then around 12:40 they find out that the printer jammed. Then when they actually get the tests they find out some of them have major typos because (I'm not sure if you know this already) they made each TA and reader write a new question and I guess no proofreading happened.

Person I know: I didn't know about the new questions being written. You mean that each TA and reader had to write problems for the test? No wonder the midterm was fairly different from past exams.

Grader's friend: Yeah that's the impression I got. I'm not really sure if that's supposed to be public information lol maybe don't share it. The whole thing sounds like a disaster.

Person I know: Lol I might leak it some day but probably not now. \[The conversation starts to go on about the ""free"" question everyone could choose to get full credit on, and on other stuff.\]",1582157288,1,0

Thanking a tour guide from over a year ago,"So I‚Äôm a first year mech e but that‚Äôs not important right now. With the COVID-19 pandemic I‚Äôm just thinking about what I‚Äôve done to get to this point and I don‚Äôt imagine that this will reach the person I want it to but eh why not. When I was a senior in high school in 2018, the second weekend in October I went to Southern California and toured UCI, UCSD, and CSULB. I went to CSULB second and UCSD third. Long Beach‚Äôs tour guides weren‚Äôt that excited about the campus and honestly, scared me away from the school to the point I didn‚Äôt even finish the application for the school. UCSD I thoroughly enjoyed but the tours seems kind of clinical and where actually rather short which I understand because of how large UCSD is. But oh man let me tell you, UCI was the first tour I went on that weekend and that was even after I had been in the car for seven hours. I stood outside the Starbucks in the student center with my mom and brother waiting for the tour to begin and my tour guide might‚Äôve been one of the brightest individuals I think I‚Äôve ever met. She took us around the normal route that the tours take but she was so much more lively and inspired by the school itself and I‚Äôm convinced to this day that how she showed her love of the campus to the tour I was on was the reason I made UCI my number 1 choice and ultimately why I am going here. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what her name was but Aubrey/Audrey from UCI tours I would sincerely like to thank you for that brief thirty minutes that helped me with the biggest decision of my life",1587630229,1,0

"The Elections Cycle may be over, but we still need to hold some people accountable.","Hey y'all. The results of the ASUCI Elections were just posted [here](https://www.elections.uci.edu/), and you can see the entire spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Drpqmp1f0nMLFEVqVYoDJSK3DaxV11JY8bskUjF8G58/edit#gid=0).

For anyone who's been keeping up, you've definitely seen a lot of back and forth between slates and individuals (myself included). Even though Anteaters United came out mostly victorious, and only *one* member of Fund the Clubs got elected, I still think it's important that we address the lengths they went to in order to win.

You can see some of the things they posted about their opposition in [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/g1g5xh/fund_the_clubs_use_of_burner_accounts_is/) where I address some of the burner/throwaway accounts that Fund the Clubs and their supporters made. But I'm going to go over them again, and I think now that the elections cycle is mostly over, we can look at this through a less emotional lens.

Perhaps the most disgusting thing these accounts had posted in the last week of campaigning was [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/g0qx4g/anteaters_united_supports_antisemitism/) now deleted by user u/Book_Knome. This post straight up accuses Anteaters United (a slate of 27 individuals) of supporting anti-semitism simply because of their endorsement from Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). These accusations were entirely based on this person's political opinion on the Israel/Palestine conflict and their personal history with SJP.

[This post](https://imgur.com/roMq7ZN) by user u/ZotBotCuhBrrr accuses Anteaters United of supporting police brutality. User u/ZotBotCuhBrrr has a really interesting post history considering this account was made during the elections cycle. Their posts generally are either 1. deliberately false information and/or 2. incomprehensible. And this post is no exception. I don't even know if this one needs explaining. Many Anteaters United representatives have outright protested against police brutality and demanded we hold officers accountable, especially a few months ago when an alumni was [tackled on campus and wrongfully arrested](https://www.newuniversity.org/2020/02/29/uci-alumna-arrested-by-ucipd-during-cost-of-living-adjustment-rally-for-uc-santa-cruz-graduate-students/) by a UCIPD officer.

**Beyond these false accusations against Anteaters United and Re-Ignite Change, users in support of FTC u/ZotFact, u/anteaters_re-ignited and u/WestSideFoodCourt, all commented explicitly incorrect things about Anteaters United during the campaigning process.**

Maintaining the trend of being incoherent and purposefully absurd, u/ZotFact posted not one, but two posts titled ""ASUCI Election Fact Check"" in which they post false information in order to make opposing slates look bad. [Post 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/g2ascq/asuci_election_fact_check/) suggests that UCI Admin was pushing for specific slates to win and makes up fake names for slates that don't exist.

User u/anteaters_re-ignited purposefully made their name to look like they support either Anteaters United or Re-Ignite Change and proceeded to not only trash on the Womxn's Hub but also continue to perpetuate some of the other false information posed by u/ZotFact and u/teavana_ali1. 

u/WestSideFoodCourt posted multiple things, but the funniest one is when they accused Anteaters United of having the support of a recalled senator, when in fact, Fund the Clubs had six recalled senators on the slate. This seems to be something a lot of these accounts like to harp on even when it's the least factual thing they could've argued. Senators Chua, Ortiz, Zanipatin, Wolfe, Pavey, and Knight were all recalled a few months ago and were running on Fund the Clubs, and yet these troll accounts continued to post that Anteaters United and Re-Ignite Change were headed by representatives that were 1. recalled and 2. unable to accomplish anything in office.

Don't even get me started on Senator Bryce Lindsey's school-wide email that violate the ASUCI Code of Ethics. You can find my write-up on that [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/g1y08n/bryce_lindseys_email_does_break_the_rules_but_not/).

Even though only one representative from Fund the Clubs was elected, I hope we can remember what it is they've been doing to try and discredit their opponents, and I hope we can ultimately find them accountable.",1587622238,1,0
Anyone here with chronic injury/health issues transferring into the nursing program or already in/was in the nursing program?,"19M here and was just admitted to UCI's nursing program. Currently a 3rd year CCC student.


I've been dealing with chronic injury and health issues the past few years and I'm hoping to get surgeries soon to finally resolve them. The healthcare system and other bullshit kinda fucked me over though so I probably won't be able to get definitive treatment/surgery until the summer at the earliest if I'm lucky.


It feels like I haven't really been able to think clearly the past few years about what I want from life. I'm in pain all of the time and all of my hobbies (past hobbies now) only aggravate my pain. It feels like nothing is fun anymore. 


I want to take care of my health first and foremost, but I also don't want to do ""nothing"" while doing so. I also want to try to figure out what I really want to study/do.


I used to think I would want to go into engineering or maybe aim for medical school, but my chronic injury/health issues have really been fucking me up both physically and mentally.


I'm not sure if a nursing program is a good place to ""park"" myself to sort out my health while also doing ""something"".



Could anyone already in the nursing program tell me what it's like? Do you have a lot of free time? How stressful is it? How good are the DSPS services for it?

EC:

\- Three years of leadership/ student gov

\- One year of treasurer for a club

\- 40 volunteer hours (but I'm planning to do more hours at hospitals this summer/ shadowing nurses if I'm able to)

\- I'm taking a nursing assistant class (hopefully there's enough space) next year which my school offers. You can get certified for a lot of stuff and they also offer an internship second semester!

Does uci have an art scene? What‚Äôs the culture like at uci/irvine?,"I‚Äôm an incoming freshman majoring in literary journalism, but I might switch my major to film. I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs an art scene at uci. Coming from the Bay Area where SF, Oakland, and Berkeley are within 20 minutes within each other by BART, I feel as though suburban irvine is sterile and boring because there aren‚Äôt many things to do in Orange County besides going to the beach and Disneyland, but those get old after a certain point in my opinion. There aren‚Äôt that many concert venues where people come to play near irvine, not that many museums, and no night life (everything shuts down after 10 from what I‚Äôve heard). You also don‚Äôt get the same city vibe as you do in San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland because irvine is a suburb. 

So I guess my question is: Is there an art scene at uci? What is there to do in Orange County? Do people hang out at LA and San Diego even though it‚Äôs at least an hour away from irvine? Considering it‚Äôs a commuter school, is there a sense of community at uci?",1587529521,1,0

ICS 30 series at community college,"Hi everyone, I am an incoming freshman this fall and I plan on switching from an engineering to a CS major. I know that it's nearly impossible to enroll in ICS 31 and 32 as a non ICS major, so I'm planning on taking the equivalent courses at a community college. 

The only problem is: I've heard that the ICS 30 series at UCI is quite tough, but prepares students very well for their later CS classes.

Just visited my godmother on her death bed and wanted to share this small story about her. She was being treated at the UCI medical center so I just want to thank all of the brave men and women on the front lines.,"I waded through the house party to find my elderly godmother sitting alone at the kitchen table. I sat with her and began to discuss how to explain my first relationship to my extremely conservative/traditional parents.

She responded by reminding me of the prejudices faced by the homosexual couples in our Iranian homeland. She said those Iranians maintained faith in their love regardless of the odds, judgement, and prosecution. Love is transient in meaning and amorphous in shape, it is dependent on the individual's perspective. 

She was surprisingly spirited for her age as remarked by my friends. Her spirit was soon tested once we realized her cancer wasn't responding to treatment. A few days ago, my family and I visited her once she was discharged from the UCI medical center. Her son welcomed us into the room where she was surrounded by other family members. She was a skeleton of who she was once. Her arteries bulged through her skin, being mistaken for bones. Her chemotherapy had side effects that left her throat engorged. Even at her lowest point I still saw the same woman that gave me the same advice about fighting the insurmountable odds for those you love, living up to her word. She was forcing water down her inflamed throat to keep fighting for another day with her son and grandchildren. 

She insisted upon treating her guests with the renowned Persian hospitality regardless of her circumstance. The thoughts of impending death were the least of her concerns. She made sure her visitors were accounted for and reminded us to sit up straight and take care of our backs. She could barely speak but every word that escaped was to usher watermelon or comfort us. The worst part of it all, we had to maintain a 6 foot separation from her at all times. We overcame our most basic instincts of wanting to hug the ones we hold most dear. I hope you all can take this quarantine as a time to appreciate the small things that we take for granted. I used to think that she would live to 100 but in a matter of 2 months, a vivacious elderly woman became a fragile feather. I know it is tough to be cramped in with your family for so long but trust me you are all doing your part so that we may get back to the normal days once more. 

I may not know you but I would love to give you a nice hug and some watermelon sometime. May you and your loved ones stay safe and healthy in these tough times.",1587433773,1,0

I have had to deal with the death of a close friend and other family issues. I am not sure as to what happens now. 

my fall academic probation contract stated: \*\*\*Please note, if your quarterly or cumulative GPA falls below a 1.5 for any one quarter, or if you have not achieved a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or a satisfactory rate of progress after two consecutive quarters on academic probation, you are subject to disqualification from the university. By signing this contract, you are confirming that you understand you will be dismissed from the School of Business if you are unable to successfully obtain both a quarterly and overall GPA of a 2.0 by the end of your third consecutive quarter of probation.

How is it fair?,"How is it fair that some professors are giving all of their students A's on their finals while other professors are not? This is adding to the chaos that is going around this finals season and while some students may be studying their asses off for their finals, some students are finding workarounds thanks to their professors or even from going around the system. Shouldn't the entire school enforce the same policy? 

I've been emailing my professor for Econ 157 and he is not letting up, saying how it would be ""unfair"" for him to make the final mandatory for some students and to waive the rest. This makes no sense as many other professors are giving A's on their finals or making it optional. I even had to get a few words from the dean of social sci and he agreed that professors should be either re-evaluating their finals policies or outright skipping the final and making the grades based on current performance. How is it fair that some students still have to study their asses off with the lack of focus and uncertainty while some get a free pass to alleviate their stresses? We should all be getting the pass on these finals, especially with all that is going on. But what can we do to get the professors to all give us the rightful course of action that we deserve?",1584246698,1,0

As you may know by now, our class will not have a graduation ceremony due to the widespread transmission of COVID-19, AKA Coronavirus. Our university has taken the necessary steps into ensuring our community is safe, and I am proud to be a part of UCI for doing this so early. With that being said, I have been planning for graduation for many years as I can only presume the same goes for many of you. School has been an integral part of my life and being a student is what I feel like I have done best into making my family proud. Walking the stage was supposed to be one of the most memorable days of my life with two of the most important women watching me finish what I set out to do both for myself and for them. My grandmother and mother will no longer be able to see this moment.
