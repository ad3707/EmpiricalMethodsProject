How hard is internal transfer to Dyson?,"Hey ya'll. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm admitted ED1 to Arts and Sciences for hopefully major in Chemistry and Chemical Biology and minor in business. 

Recently, I'm growingly interested in business and am considering trying to transfer during my freshmen year to CALS for double major in Biology (biochem concentration) and AEM. 

How hard would this be? I heard transferring to business is very hard, is this true? What can I do in the meantime to prepare? Any recommended summer experiences?

Lonely &amp; in a tough spot,"Hello fellow Cornellians!

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to get on here to see if anyone had any advice about making friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a second-semester junior who transferred Fall 2018 and just got back from studying abroad. Being that I transferred, I wasn't really a part of any formal O-week where many people meet/make friends as many people do as Freshman. On top of that, I was not offered on-campus housing last year and had to live off-campus further separated me for meeting new people. Even though it is the beginning of the semester, I am feeling very lonely and don't feel like I have friends to support me. I have been looking into joining new clubs and putting my self out there more, but even when I do that I feel like people are closed off towards me and don't really want to hang out. I have tried to meet people in my classes hoping to find people within my major that have the same interests as me, but I have yet to find another Anthropology major since coming here. I am longing for someone that I can hang out with even if it's just working on homework in the library or cooking dinner together. I am always open to experiencing new things and hoping to make some new friends.",1580096443,1,0

AEP is shutting down?,"Earlier this week I went to the AEP lounge to do my homework, and, as a connoisseur of hamiltonians and second order multivariable differential equations, I partook of the Schrödinger Equation on the whiteboard. I noticed that it seemed a bit off, but I don’t like to mislead other students, so I flipped through Griffiths and wrote the correct equation on the board. I then went to the quantum professor to alert the department that one of the students was not up to par, but when I arrived at the offices, I could see the department head handing a crying junior a piece of paper that read, in bold red letters, “NOTICE OF DISMISSAL FROM AEP..” Evidently my criticism was unnecessary, so I left. However, from then on I began feeling out of sorts. I developed extreme paranoia and I had trouble following the flipped classroom lecture video for quantum 2 the following night.

Undeterred, I went back to the lounge the next day. As I was walking out, I noticed that the lounge was almost empty. I brought this to the department head’s attention, and he thanked me. We got to chatting, and thinking that as a professor of physics, I figured he could help me with my confusion, so I mentioned my trouble with understanding a concept in quantum 2 from the lecture video I watched from the previous day. Although he kept smiling, I noticed something subtle change in his expression. He began asking questions about how many classical scattering problems I have done, what does n_tar stand for, and my familiarity with scattering fractions. I thought these questions were a bit unusual, and I couldn’t tell if he was implying something or just making smalltalk. I began feeling uneasy, so said goodbye and quickly walked away. He tried to go after me, but he got a phone call he had to answer. As I walked down the stairs from the second level of PSB, though, I heard him yell at me that he was sorry.

My confusion has worsened since then, and in the past few days I’ve noticed AEP professors following me around campus. Sometimes they’re subtle about it, hiding in bushes or perching in trees that I pass by. Other times they don a backpack and wig and sit close to me in class, masquerading as a student that has mysteriously stopped showing up to class. 

The other day a student asked me for help with a homework problem from quantum 2 while I was sitting in the common area outside my dorm room. It was about scattering. I tried to help him the best I could, but I just couldn’t work out the problem. He the reached into his backpack and pulled out a piece of paper with the same bold red lettering that I saw a few weeks ago. But just then, I saw a student, who looked *just* like the student I was talking to, leaving his dorm, crying, while carrying out a ton of suitcases. I turned to talk to the student I was helping, but he was scuttling away. 

I don’t want to be expelled. I never even got the chance to take QFT. Just in case I don't make it: please scatter the ashes of my failed PSETs in PSB against some material with a target number density of 0.823 / angstrom such that the scattering fraction is greater than a third but less than a half.",1579989117,1,0

I mean, why??? 

We really need an honest discussion about hygiene because adults shouldn't be so damn nasty. I already have to sit in rank lecture halls that smell like BO with chronic nose pickers and people that cough in their hand. Maybe I just held women to a higher standard but even in high school, people weren't this gross.

"For all the posts about being alone, I recommend going Greek","No, seriously. I understand the hesitations many Cornellians hold when it comes to Greek life. In fact, I used to hold them, too, until I joined a pre-professional frat last year and a social frat last semester, (and technically I'm in an honors frat but let's not count that). 

Last year 1st semester, although I had to work to make friends, like many people here, I wasn't thriving socially, and still ate alone most of the time. And, although I still ate alone at times last semester, I can't begin to express how powerful each brotherhood can be. I'd argue that from a time and effort perspective, there's no greater way to expand your social network. By simply joining one of these orgs, you instantly gain access to 80 or so potential friends (that hopefully share your interests/vibe), as well as the friends they often bring to events. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to think fraternities were exclusively for ""frat"" types, but that hasn't been my experience. If you choose wisely, and aren't afraid to ignore reputations, then you will almost certainly find one you want to join. 

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, frats offer as much involvement as you want, usually. Want an event every weekend? Go! Want something once or twice a semester? That also works. 

&amp;#x200B;

For those that are lonely, and afraid to try something new, please consider joining a fraternity.",1579935128,1,0

Initially, I entertained and even liked the idea at first because you get to meet people in a professional manner and gain more insight into the industry, but after learning that I didn't ""network hard enough"" or I didn't get the job because I ""didn't go to as many networking events as much as possible"" and that I need to connect to as much professionals outside of school and work, devoting extra time and money, has made me feel callous.

PSA: Coronavirus,"From a dad on wechat:


Hi there,

My daughter is a sophomore at Cornell. She told me that one student coming back from Wuhan is sick and now her roommate is sick as well with the same flu like symptom. The email sent out from the school seems to indicate there is no risk to Cornell campus. But there are about 100 students from Wuhan area. The spread of the virus is at an alarming rate. What specific measures is the school taking to mitigate the risk at this point? Is it possible to mandate all students in the closed public area, like classroom, cafeteria to wear masks? Is it possible to follow up with all the students coming back from China by taking their temperatures and quarantine the ones if any suspect symptoms occur?  Cornell is a school with a large oversea  student body. After the winter break, many of them returned from China. These factors make Cornell a high risk school in my opinion.  As a parent, I am looking for proactive and specific steps to prevent the outbreak.

The Great North Migration,"I woke up greeted  with a white light emanating from my window, the glistening snow offering promise of snow angels and folly, beckoning me to go outside. As I open the door and exit my dorm, swirls of white powder bite my face and my hands. As hordes of freshmen struggle their way through the Balch Courtyard, I realize that my imagination and prospects of frolicking in the snow had been deeply misguided.  I take a deep breath and, as my face slowly numbs over, reluctantly join this Great North migration.

I may have not known who was walking besides me this morning, but when we trudged downhill side by side together, persisting through the great Ithaca winds, we all became brothers and sisters in arms. I slip down some frozen ice and hurt my knee, but a woman pulls me up and helps me continue on this arduous, perilous, tortuous journey. I can no longer see the horizon. The edges of Rockefeller hall are no longer well defined. Am I fainting? Is this it for me? Am I really willing to put myself through this for a physics lecture?

As I draw closer and closer to my destination, I notice more and more people walking the opposite direction as I. Are they coming back from class or from battle? A holy messenger in the form of a 20-year old student yells, ""Classes are cancelled! Classes are cancelled! Classes are cancelled!"" Do I trust this man and return home to the sweet comforts of my bed and the warm heat of my dorm? Or do I march onwards? How do you know if you are listening to the horn of Gabriel or witnessing the evil tricks of ad-Dajjal?

Then a holy message from above. ""Ithaca campus classes are cancelled 2/7"" There is a noticeable pause in the line of people trudging uphill, a feeling of tension and confusion that permeates the air.

Moments pass, and we turn around and walk back to North campus, not as students struggling to get to class, but as free beings about to enter a day of possibility and liberty.",1581090610,1,0

"To the Incompetent Administration,","It absolutely baffles me that Cornell, which charges anywhere between 30K-70K per year based on college/financial status, can be this incompetent when it comes to inclement weather. What confuses me the most is that we have 100s of useless ""Deans"" in every college in the university that make hefty salaries and yet the people in charge of monitoring severe weather conditions (which are a typical occurrence in Ithaca) are seemingly non-existent. 

What sort of logic goes into delaying the decision to cancel classes until 10AM, when students have already traveled to campus without bus transportation (which was cancelled as early as 830AM)? Some professors have already taught their Friday morning classes and even after classes were cancelled some discussion sections are being held to the students that remain on campus. One professor stated it took him 1.5 hours to get to the 9AM lecture that he teaches.

This statement is written in profound frustration, as this university fails time and again to adequately and professionally handle days with severe conditions in Ithaca. Cornell could learn from the other universities in the area which seem to get it right when it comes to cancelling classes in advance when forecasts are particularly harsh. Today, every other campus in the area besides Cornell was closed in advance, or at least early in the morning so that students could make accommodations.

I wish Cornell, and every other campus in the world, would be purged of 40% of its yearly revenue so instead of wasting it on meaningless admin/staff positions it would be forced to utilize its resources most effectively and properly align them with the interests of faculty and students, the lifeblood of any learning institution.",1581089222,1,0

Tips on how to make friends from someone who had none,"As someone who spent all of freshmen and most of sophomore year with no friends/bad friends, and now has tons of amazing friends, here are some of my tips! (Also this is my personal experience, take with a grain of salt). Hope this helps someone!

1. People say ""join clubs"" so willy nilly!! I think the key is to find an activity, like a job or club where you have to spend A LOT of time together. I joined a million clubs, but never made true friends in them because we only met for like two hours once a week. Being on a club sport, working job shifts, or something tighter knit (joining frat, becoming an RA, doing a PE that meets everyday, hanging out with people where you live) allows you to see the same people more frequently, which makes it easier to make friends!
2. Date someone! Okay, HEAR ME OUT. I know, how do you date someone when you barely even have friends? This one greatly depends on your comfort levels/relative attractiveness. I had literally never been on a date before, but I made a tinder and matched with someone who invited me to a party (literally my first house party, and they had no idea LMAO) , where I met some amazing people. As long as you're nice and have common interests, its pretty easy to slide into the friend group of someone you're ""dating"". One of my closest friends now is the old roommate of someone I dated. However, this one can also backfire pretty easy, so remain cautious.
3. Don't be too dismissive of people! Being friendless made me veryyyyy bitter. I'd see super loud sorority girls or frat bros in dining halls and lectures and think ""Wow, I'd never be friends with someone like that"". No one wants to be friends with someone who's super bitter (also they had friends and I didn't so who am I even to judge). You shouldn't be friends with people you don't want to, but be willing to give it a shot. I'm friends with athletes and greek life students, even though I'm neither.
4. Utilize your major! You probably spend a decent amount of time studying. I know theres that person you see in a ton of your classes, but you have NO idea what their name is. BITE THE BULLET AND ASK. Study buddies are a great way to bond and get work done. 
5. You're not gonna want to hear this, but if you're like me, you might have a funny lil boii called Social Anxiety. And if so, I'm so sorry but you're gonna have to force yourself to talk. Trust, I can barely order at Nasties without dying inside, but it makes it a lot harder to make friends if you're not able to communicate consistently and openly. This is a lot easier said than done, and took several months of forcing myself to talk in classes to get used to speaking to strangers.
6. Be kind and patient with yourself. Some people make friends for life during O-week. For others, it takes a bit of time. I was always so lonely, and thought I'd never truly find companionship here. There are ups and downs, I've made friends and also lost some, but it all will work out for you :).",1581032778,1,0

I have misophonia (a disconnect in my brain, so relatively innocuous sounds cause a strong emotional reaction, like anxiety or anger) and for the past six months, wherever I go to eat, I’m overwhelmed by how many people nearby chew loudly/with their mouth open. I’ve never really had much of an issue with it before coming to Cornell. 

Granted, I come from a *very* homogenous town, so I’m thinking that I just wasn’t exposed to other social norms. Whatever the reason, though I know it seems silly, it’s made eating in the dining halls a bit agonizing. Is it just normal to chew with your mouth open in some places? Do any of you do this? Also, anyone else with misophonia (I understand it’s pretty common) have a good way of coping with it? Thanks!",1582218964,3,0

Stop Blocking Roads. RIDICULOUS,"You are causing people delays! The use of fossil fuel is not such a dire issue that warrants you a right to block roads. People are trying to get to places! Cornell is already investing so much money towards renewable energy technology and you people are acting like fools.

Here is a fact for you - livestock causes 15-18% of green house gas emission vs 14% by the transportation sector.  You can survive by not eating meat. Some of you people need a reality check because we cannot survive without the transportation sector. The electric vehicle technology and cost is just not there yet to abandon combustion engine cars.

In my opinion, it would be better use of time to advocate stop eating meat and for Cornell to offer plant based meat substitutes.",1582162597,1,0

M. ENG questions,"TL;DR is M. Eng in ORIE for an undergrad math major worth it?

I recently got accepted into the M. Eng program for ORIE. I really would like to go into industry and solve cool problems while making some money. However, from googling ""is M. Eng worth it?"" (because it is a shit ton of money), it seems that some people hold the view that the M. Eng program here (or many other places) isn't prestigious, that they accept pretty much anyone, and is just a cash cow for the university. This has me rather bummed that some would hold this view, as I felt as though I had something unique to offer rather than being a walking money bag. I also would not like to be viewed as ""inferior"" to my peers on campus. I do not hold this view, but it is what I have seen some express online.

Anyway, I'm an undergrad in math and stats at another institution, and it appears many companies require a masters for operations research. Would the M. Eng achieve this goal and would it be worthwhile to pay the 50k? I have low debt thanks to scholarships. So it would not be much more to add, especially since it is only a one year program.",1582160543,1,0

A nightly dialogue with myself,"(One of many; though they don’t always go exactly like this, they are quite similar in theme and execution.)

Me: Man, I’m really tired. It’s normal to be tired.

...But I feel like I’m just a bit more tired than is normal. What’s a normal amount? I feel... exhausted. Homesick and cold and unmotivated and mainly just burnt out. But that can’t be. No, no. It’s much too early in the semester for me to feel this burnt out. Should I panic, then? Why do I feel this way? Does anyone else?

Me: Well, of course others feel this way. You may not have heard them say as much, but you’ve felt it. It’s in the way they move; the way they hunch themselves over against the cold but still curl a little ways upwards, outwards, towards the sun, like they’re trying desperately to hold on to their little inklings of hope and keep them trapped for as long as they can bear to. You’re not burnt out quite yet, you’re only a little lost. You will get back on track.

Me: ... But I’m not back on track. I don’t *feel* on track. And even if I was, how could I know? Everyone else seems so successful, so put-together; maybe not content but complacent. I can’t even get comfortable long enough for ambivalence. Instead I feel disappointment, discouragement, general lack of excitement for things that I used to enjoy! Why? 

Me: It’s likely because... because you’re holding yourself up to a standard that doesn’t exist, in and of itself. There is no definite metric by which to measure your success. You must go at your own pace, and take your victories, however small, as they come, or else you have doomed yourself to suffer through problems of your own making and of your projection onto other people. They are not the enemy. And, however much it may seem like, neither are you. Push through just a bit longer. You can. You must.

Me: For how long? How long must I grin and forge ahead without knowing my destination? How could this possibly be the right way of accomplishing anything?

Me: Perhaps it is not the right way. But that is of little consequence, since all that matters is that you preserve your own way. Don’t fall into mindless conformity to invisible milestones; they were set for and by others who could never possibly hope to feel the way you do, to move in the way that you move. In a place so communal, strive for the unique. 

Me: Alright, then. What they say is common, trite, I rebrand as individual. I make my own; I create. I will keep going; despite not knowing where my destination lies, if it lies... IN spite of this. My knowledge will suffice. It must. 

It was never about the missed sleep, but the missed opportunities at greatness; and greatness is not told in size, in impact, or even in boldness... it is told in the quiet times in which we can tell ourselves, with near-perfect conviction, that what we have done, through no merit or device but our very own, is, and forever will be, enough.",1582004957,1,0

Ground Report Southern Westchester #1: Sunday (3/15/20),"I was the user who was concerned about the interview in westchester. Well, I am now back since they cancelled classes as my family (a BIG family (~10 people)) wanted me home. NOTE: I PLAN TO STAY IN WESTCHESTER AND DO NOT INTEND TO RETURN TO ITHACA UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF THE SEMESTER. This is a measure to do my part in mitigating spread to other areas and I have to come back to move the rest of my stuff into storage.

I got back to Westchester Saturday (3/14/20) evening.
So far, the situation here is pretty calm and people more or less have their heads on their shoulders still. The grocery stores are rationing toilet paper and the paper rush seems to be quieting down. 
I took my dogs for a walk today (I saw some people I know from my town but we didn't come into close proximity of each other, we just said hi/what's up from across the street). Today was just another spring day so far. However, since I am basically in ground zero, I have been taking the utmost precaution for my and other people's safety by eliminating any unnecessary exposure to public settings and sanitation (hand washing, disinfection of surfaces, no face touching, etc.) 
The gas station near me was idle also, no rushes to get gas (gas would probably be unnecessary if everyone is to eventually be forced to quarantine).
I shall keep you all updated on the situation here as the days go by (if you still want to hear updates from ""Chernobyl"", if this causes stress, let me know and I will gladly stop posts).
I wish you all plentiful health and safety. For those of you traveling home, I wish you safe travels and health during your journey.

Meanwhile, I believe that this is a real avenue for Greek Life to win back some ground in the ever constant power struggle between themselves and Martha. In many ways, their fortresses (at least the ones who own them outright) will become bastions of strength and stability in this time of crisis. For fraternity members (who probably already didn't go to class), this will be an opportunity to resume throwing massive, multi day parties. The sanitation that Barton's provides, and the cleansing powers of these young men and women's livers will also ensure that they do not contract the virus.

Cornell Housing Stats from 2019,"&gt; ""How good is my housing timeslot?""

Last year, my block and I were awarded the second-to-last timeslot for general room selection for sophomores (2nd day, 10:20 p.m.). To kill time as we waited to take whatever scraps were left, I periodically downloaded the raw data from the Bed Availability Report to serve as a live scoreboard of sorts. My block managed to find a somewhat open suite in JAM.

Here's the data! It may be useful for y'all (data begins ***after*** 7:26pm Day 1. **If you have a slot before then, you have a great slot with probably some *entirely vacant suites* on West**. I did not record any data for Day 3. Also, there are less students in the Class of 2023 than there are in the Class of 2022, so that may change some things):

#DATA from GRS2019
* **[Simple chronology](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bg47AYFpySUgrAFUo6GiToVBiWgCijKi/view)** (total number of beds, vacant triples, vacant doubles, singles) by building and by time at approximately 30-minute intervals, or [grouped by area](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xkjdxC_jtledPKEkJdlyAQGFmr1Vn7XJ/view) ^[.xlsx]
* **[Full chronology](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VjZgIIcM_THCGP-ueJlZnl8G8q_60WOc/view)** (total number of beds, vacant triples, vacant doubles, singles) by building and by time with data points for every time I downloaded data, or [grouped by area](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TRKXEn3A7zMS7orRG0O-qksYf9rU69Ws/view) ^[.xlsx]

# GRAPHS from GRS2019
* **Available beds** ([total count](https://i.imgur.com/UaFuI8S.png) and by [area](https://i.imgur.com/gmad3qT.png)) ^[.png]
 * [Proportion of beds by area](https://i.imgur.com/5ujTnKn.png) ^[.png]

### During last year's GRS, there were 18 timeslots on the first day (5pm-10:59pm) and 11 on the second day (5pm-10:59pm, with a 7pm-9:19pm grace period during prelims when no timeslots were issued)

## Some Statistics from GRS2019
* There were ~68 rising sophomores per timeslot on average for the first two days. You probably got a new email with some updated figures. **On Day 1, assume that everyone with a timeslot will reserve a room**.
* Assuming the above, about 28% of rising sophomores with timeslots on Day 2 do not reserve a room.
* About 70% of rising sophomores **select rooms within the first 4 minutes of their timeslot**. Be quick!
* Room sizes range from 482 square feet to 82 square feet. The average room size is 177 square feet and the median is 166 square feet.
* Compared to the statistics emailed in the housing FAQs, West Campus filled up about as fast as expected while Collegetown was reserved slower than expected.
* Rising juniors and seniors: you will likely be limited to some rooms in some of the program houses and very few in Collegetown.
* I don't know why there was such a massive drop in Program House housing on the first day. My guess would be that for whatever reason everyone who applied up for Program Housing through the Program House Application were all entered into the database at the same time.

# Benchmark Times from GRS2019

My times may differ from the Housing Office's figures in the 2020-21 housing brochure.

* The main West Campus dorms ^((Becker, Bethe-Main, Cook-Main, Keeton, Rose-Main)^) ran out of beds by **9:20 p.m. Day 1**
 * The main West Campus dorms ^((Becker, Bethe-Main, Cook-Main, Keeton, Rose-Main)^) ran out of both fully vacant doubles and singles by **8:20 p.m. Day 1**
 * **8:08 p.m. Day 1** was the last time at least two rooms were available in the same suite in the main West Campus dorms.
* The Gothics ^((McFaddin, Baker, Boldt, Founders, Lyon, Mennen)^) ran out of beds by **10:24 p.m. Day 2**
 * The Gothics ^((McFaddin, Baker, Boldt, Founders, Lyon, Mennen)^) ran out of vacant triples by **5:42 p.m. Day 2**
 * The Gothics ^((McFaddin, Baker, Boldt, Founders, Lyon, Mennen)^) ran out of vacant doubles by **9:24 p.m. Day 2**
 * The Gothics ^((McFaddin, Baker, Boldt, Founders, Lyon, Mennen)^) ran out of singles by **10:04 p.m. Day 1**
* The former Greek houses on West ^((109 McGraw, 625 Univ.)^) ran out of beds by **10:24 p.m. Day 2**
 * The former Greek houses on West ^((109 McGraw, 625 Univ.)^) ran out of vacant doubles by **10:04 p.m. Day 2**
 * The former Greek houses on West ^((109 McGraw, 625 Univ.)^) ran out of singles by **10:22 p.m. Day 1**
* Collegetown ^((Edgemoor, Cascadilla, Schuyler, Sheldon)^) ran out of singles by **10:04 p.m. Day 2**
* Collegetown ^((Edgemoor, Cascadilla, Schuyler, Sheldon)^) ran out of singles by **10:42 p.m. Day 2**

Feel free to ask me about anything about these housing statistics! I don't have information about when the last fully open suite on West was taken (I assume it was before I started taking data, i.e. 7:26 p.m. Day 1), and I don't have any data on cooperative housing.",1583188298,1,0

People in Teagle need to calm the fuck down with the chalk.,"For some reason, we went from not a single person in Teagle using chalk, even the 4-plate squatting powerlifters, to everyone and their mother using chalk for everything. 

I kept my mouth shut when it was all over the squat racks, and even when its on the bench its fine, since people swap out barbells all the time. But it was just fucking all over the floor today and I saw someone chalking up the Lat Pulldown today, and that's definitely over the line. 

No one needs chalk to do a 100 lb Lat Pulldown. Just... literally no one. With allergy season coming up, all its going to do is cause a bunch of people to have itchy eyes and runny noses for the rest of the day, which is not exactly what we want right now. 

Just calm the fuck down with the chalk. Like 80% of you guys don't need to be using it and you all know it.",1583184674,1,0

Could you all help me choose between Claremont McKenna and Cornell?,"I’ve talked to a lot of students and alumni from CMC and no one really from Cornell. I’ve never visited and won’t be able to because of the virus so any and all input would be helpful. From what I know CMC’s in small town in Southern California (40 minute drive from LA) and I really want to get an honest answer about how life in Ithaca is. I’m looking to study International Relations and Economics. I really like CMC bc of the consortium which gives me resources to the four surrounding schools,  the small tight knit community, the emphasis on the undergraduate students; it seems like it’s very easy to build good relationships with professors there bc there are no TA’s. Could I get a similar experience at Cornell, community wise and undergraduate wise?

My mentor told me that I can’t get the same attention at a university as I could at a liberal arts college bc professors, especially the well known ones, focus on their own research and graduate students. I’m used to the cold, but how has living in Ithaca affected your mental health and overall well being? Are the rumors true how a lot of people at Cornell are upset? And how competitive are students? At CMC I’ve been told everyone wants to help everyone succeed bc no one has to compete for any of the widespread resources. 

Also I get a lot of what’s CMC and Cornell’s brand name does carry more weight but that’s something I’m not too concerned. I just want a solid 4 year college experience where I can be happy and have access to resources that will help me be prepared for a career and graduate school.

Let's Remember EMPATHY during this pandemic,"Hi guys, 

I just wanted to spread out there regarding the grade debate that it is important to accept and understand people's views. We are all Cornell students fighting the same pandemic, and this should not be an ""us"" vs. ""them"" war. Similarly, there is no ""campaign war"" either. People are just trying to voice their different beliefs so they are taken into consideration by the administration. Attacking people by name calling, bashing, or spreading fake news is certainly not what we wise Cornell students should be doing right now. Respectful and civil debate is encouraged, but immature and rude commentary is not. Let's embrace our humanity and remember we are all fighting the same war.",1585405879,1,0

To the whole grading debate,"I understand that this is an issue many people are passionate about, but it's important to keep an open mind and treat others with respect. I personally advocated for OPF, but I see how UPF can benefit those in less fortunate situations. It would help equalize the playing field for all students. 

That being said, if you support UPF or don't support OPF, please try to understand other people's perspectives as well. Yes, you may disagree, but everyone is in a different situation and are affected situation depending on what ultimately is decided. For example it may be the last chance for students interested in graduate school or a specific internship to reach a certain gpa threshold. 

All in all, there is no perfect solution and I'm sure the Cornell administration is going to have to make a hard decision, but until then, please respect other people's opinions and definitely don't call other people morons for supporting one over the other.",1585362105,1,0

"To those of you who think mandatory S/U will disadvantage pre-med students, are you really moronic enough to believe med schools will hold grades you literally couldn't control against you?","Surely, you can't seriously believe that if we are to switch to mandatory S/U and that you get an S in all your classes that it will be held against you. I believe most grad schools will just look at this as kind of a worthless semester (which it is, in terms of reflecting true understanding given the current circumstances) and look at the GPA from your OTHER 7 semesters. I guarantee Med schools will not hold the fact that students at such a well-known school like Cornell didn't earn an A because they literally couldn't. That is different if it is opt-in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly, sis, if you're counting on 1 semester to define your GPA, that's outlandish. The other 5 or 7 semesters that you are on campus are reflective enough, regardless of if this was an easy or hard semester.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR You must be a moron to think Harvard or other med schools will hold Cornell students at a disadvantage for not earning an A if we literally can't when we're on mandatory S/U",1585359384,1,0

Inspiration about improving your GPA,"Hey y'all I am on the path to improving my GPA. At the end of my sophomore year I had around a 2.7, I did really well last semester and was able to pull it up to just above a 3.0. Getting to 3.1,3.2 and beyond is extremely challenging because I've already taken so many credits and I am stressed that they might introduce universal pass/fail this semester. I'm on track to have another great semester and according to my calculations I would feasibly end up with around a 3.18-3.22 this semester. If one of my classes goes south, which is possible, I would end up with around a 3.1. I have only taken 18 and 19 credits, respectively, over these past two semesters but I am thinking of really pushing it up for next semester because it is the last semester I have before applying for jobs.  Considering my grades last semester and what I am expecting this semester, my adviser said I could potentially get approved to go over the 22 credit limit ( I would be doing research for one of my professors). I know this is an ambitious goal and I am capable I just don't want to end up destroying all of the progress I've made for the sake of an extra minor digits on my GPA (my ultimate goal is to have a 3.4 and they're not really minor because the jobs I want usually have a 3.25-3.3 cutoff but I'll rationalize it as minor if I can't accomplish it). Going from 19 credits to potentially 24 I imagine is huge. I also have been taking mostly lower-intermediary level classes because I started a completely new major. I guess I'm answering my own questions. I've been able to manage well so far but again I don't know for certain what my grades are going to look like. I know a 3.4 is basically dirt to most of you guys but that's about the best I can do so yea (I would literally have to get above a 4.0 for a ridiculous amount of credits to get a 3.5 so unless I become Einstein tomorrow...).  Unfortunately I am literally just not capable of getting an A+ so that's not an option for me, although getting an A seemed impossible to me before last semester. I don't really understand the point of this post, just looking for inspiration and advice because my adviser wants my proposal by the end of this weekend :-)

Also if anyone wants advice for how I improved my own GPA I would be happy to share!",1585335781,0,0

To the newly accepted class of 2024:,"Some of you may have applied with other schools being off a higher priority for you. And that's okay. I originally wanted Yale, and when I didn't get into Yale, I thought I wanted RIT over Cornell. 

However, I'm really sorry you won't be able to visit as part of Cornell days (or visit other schools during their respective pre-frosh programs). In 2016, that was how I came to determine that Cornell was going to be the right place for me, and that the other universities would've been poor fits (or, as I'm convinced with RIT after visiting, downright depressed).

In light of not being able to do that, please reach out to us on this subreddit (and any other resources my fellow Cornellians wish to share, I can't seem to think of them right now myself) and ask questions. And don't go off of our school year posts alone (definitely read them if your interested), because this is often a forum for complaining and blowing off steam for some Redditors, and thus negative thoughts are disproportionately expressed (and thank you to those who almost only post positive stuff). But seriously, ask us your questions. We want to answer and help you determine if Cornell is the place for you as it is for most of us. And do the same with any other school your considering.

And professors on here, I know you're incredibly busy getting the rest of our semester organized, but if you get spare moments, please respond to some of these soon-to-be Cornellians' questions.  The professor that pulled me and my parents aside to her office on Gates when we visited to get a perspective as to what I was interested in, to answer some questions I had, and to just chat for a bit, made a huge difference in my perspective on Cornell, and ultimately I may not have ended up at the right university for me, met the best friends I've ever had, and started the best relationship I could've asked for. And while I'm glad I got the chance to thank her in person before I left, I really don't think I can thank her enough for that.

P.S. when asking us questions, include the major you're most interested in. It obviously may change, but it signals to people with that perspective.",1585321058,1,0

Transfer Option Tips,"As a current sophomore who got into Cornell via the Transfer option I wanted to make this post on tips based on my experience for anyone just getting the decision.

1. Yes it is (basically) guaranteed you just need to take the required courses and meet the minimum GPA and you’re in, and most departments are willing to work with you if you fall short in areas 

2. If you know you really want to go to Cornell, I’d recommend going to a cheaper state/community college just to save money, if money isn’t a concern than idk just do you fam 

3. Take comparable classes to the ones required for your major in addition to the required/recommended courses, by doing this I was able to knock out a lot of my major requirements (you can simply email the department the syllabus for the course and ask if it will count) 

4. Don’t make a ton of friends freshman year, it will just make it harder to leave

5. Don’t worry about adjusting socially at Cornell, I’m an anti-social hermit and still managed to make friends here so you’ll be fine (probably) 

6. Also transferring to Cornell is great if you do it right you can avoid a lot of things that can suck at Cornell, like Freshman Writing Seminars, PE, and the swim test

Anyone else already sick and tired of zoom University already,"Sitting in front of a computer screen more than 8 hours a day has driven me crazy. Half of my professors have increased the workload now that we are online and office hours are now almost completely useless since you have to wait in an online queue which took me over an hour when I was trying to get help with my hw. Even in the classes that kept the workload the same it’s too much cuz things take longer now and I am so completely drained by the end of each day and go to sleep dreading having to do it all again the next day. As hard as this school is I’ve never been even remotely close to feeling this way before this. No matter how hard my problem sets were or how stressed I was for my prelims it has never been this bad. But now it has just overwhelmed me and it feels like there’s nothing I can and the work is endless. The worst part is that there aren’t even prelims or essays yet, and god only knows how I am going to cope with that in addition to all the shit the professors are already piling on me.",1586490986,1,0

From my understanding, when you are awarded private scholarships, the money can be applied to all aspects of your tuition (student contribution, loans, gift aid or any other aid given) EXCEPT for the family contribution?

So then what is the point of even trying to apply to private scholarships if you'll never be able to minimize the family contribution portion?

Even then- if for example the total of my student contribution amount, and loans given by Cornell (since I wasn't given any gift aid or work study) is $7,000, and I receive $10,000 in private scholarships, what happens to the remaining $3,000?

Career Advice: A Letter To My Younger Self,"Dear Cornellians,

While we are all locked up during this pandemic, I thought I would write a reflective letter to my past self, when I was a Senior at Cornell almost 10 years ago. It is entitled “What I Wish I Knew At Cornell”. It ended up a bit long, but might be useful to someone (or, something you disagree with!).

Cheers,

Cornell Alum

\---

**1. Find work that you enjoy.**

Work is where you are paid to solve someone else’s problem (e.g. customers, boss, investors). School is a contrived microcosm; GPA (including Ivy League pedigree) does not matter in the long run. It may only help you get an interview for your first few jobs (and I will assume that you are smart if you went to Cornell). However, I mostly care about your ability to solve a problem (quickly) that I am paying you to solve.

Thus, passion and academic intelligence are only useful insofar as it helps you solve real, external problems. The best problems are unsolved, which means the answer is not in a textbook but may require foundational ideas from textbooks. I mistakenly thought passion and academic intelligence were sufficient to get a great first job; they were not. You need to show a company why you are useful to them, for a particular role, to solve a particular problem. Passion is good, but it is individual and personal; it is what motivates you. The world does not care about your passion if it is devoid of work utility.

Ask yourself, if I paid you $100K a year, what can you do for me? Think of a job as a matrix; the columns are industry verticals (e.g. energy, health, technology, financial services) and the rows are job functions (e.g. marketing, sales, legal, engineering, product, finance, operations). Where do you want to position yourself? A finance guy in a technology company is not as important as a finance guy in a financial services company. Think carefully about your ideal industry vertical and role.

Fortunately, for many of you, Doctors, Lawyers, Bankers, and Consultants have linear career paths which may explain why hoop-jumpers are attracted to them (I was a short-lived former consultant), as they are modeled after university admissions. Be careful; make sure you truly enjoy what you spend 8-10 hours a day doing; do not be a slave to your parents expectations or peer prestige.

If you don't know what kind of work you enjoy, you must explore what that is every day of every year until you figure that out. It is unlikely that you do at this stage in your life; but you should know by the time you are 30 years old. Do not become one of my countless peers who lamented on wasted years during my last Cornell Reunion, despite having the prestigious ‘consulting’ or ‘finance’ job when we were Seniors. Tick tock.

**2. Get really good at work you enjoy.**

This one logically follows from (1). The most valuable things are hard because they are not solved yet. Commit to getting good at what you enjoy, and commit to sucking at whatever you do for a while \*before\* you get good at it. In my case, I made hard pivot in my mid-20s and sucked for a few years, spending nights/weekends on that pivot, but managed to become so good at what I liked I now get paid very well for it and have my pick of jobs.

**3. Pick a wave to surf.**

The world is a little meritocratic, but most of your success will depend on how well you position yourself within a larger macroeconomic trend. You want to create value and capture a large slice of that value. When the pie is growing faster than the people competing for that pie, your company, and in turn your career, will grow.

As a trivial example, joining Kodak as ""Super Awesome Job Title"" in 2007 would have been a terrible idea. Even if you were promised a fast-track to a promotion, executive visibility, good compensation, and a fancy desk, it wouldn't matter. Mobile phones would soon supplant the personal camera industries purpose for existence. You had better hope your skills would transfer to a role in the mobile world, or you had better be creative in finding adjacent growing industries. Indeed, I know someone who moved from Kodak's projection business to Virtual Reality at Facebook because, as a hardware optics engineer, the physics were similar. His peers who could not find another wave to surf were fired.

**4. Join a rocket ship.**

Assuming you picked a growing macroeconomic wave to take your career board and surf, you need to find the best company to join. Paddle over and beg to hop onto the fastest boat, so to speak. This would have been Google when most people still used Yahoo (or better yet, AltaVista); the wave was exponentially increasing the amount of information on the internet with exponential decreasing costs of personal computing devices that would access and generate content for said internet. These things are obvious in retrospect but difficult to identify. Finding medium-sized but very fast-growing companies is the most probable thing you should be targeting.

Unfortunately, that is why I think nonprofits/NGOs suck early in your career. Join an NGO \*after\* you achieve seniority in a particular domain, then take a pay cut and give back as a senior director at an NGO. Otherwise, if you join as a low level employee, you will hit a ceiling and learn in a resource constrained environment.

If you opt for a conventional career path (e.g. Lawyer, Banker, Consultant), then continue jumping through those linear hoops. Positioning is still important; but success is about out-achieving your immediate peers.

**5. Be close to the money.**

In finance, they call it ""the Front Office"". You don't need to be a Wolf of Wall Street Bro, but you should be in The Front Office of whatever your company is. Your job needs to be close to what makes money because your impact will be more easily measurable. Jobs within companies are very unequal, despite having similar lifestyles and dressing the same. This rule of thumb will make it harder to replace you over time and you are more likely to make a lot more money more quickly than your peers.

For example, in Silicon Valley the software engineers and product managers are in the front office. Working in finance at Apple or Facebook isn’t that important. Building the next product is. Conversely, being a software engineer at Goldman Sachs is a terrible idea (perhaps, unless you are a Quant trader and directly make them a lot of money). You want to own the client relationship or buy and sell things on Wall Street. If you're a management consultant and not on-site, that's a bad idea too. You need to own the client relationship who is paying for your overly expensive project. If you're a body to throw at a problem, you're replaceable and lack leverage.

**6. Solve Hard Problems (and make your boss look good).**

Solve the most important problems, even if it’s not sexy. What you want to do may not be what leadership wants you to do. Unfortunately, even if what you want to do is ""right"" in the long run, you need to do what your boss wants. Convince them later. If that means doing some shit work for a little while to get something done you need to do it, and fast. The most interesting or sexiest problem may not be the most business critical thing that needs to get done.

When you do have to do frustratingly mind-numbingly boring things, try to automate it the next time or try to make it more fun. If this is all you do, some process is broken and you should convince your boss that this needs to be fixed and propose fixing it. If shit work is all they want you to do, see #8.

**7. Stay curious and indulge your interests.**

No one is born with a map that outlines a plan for their life (unless your parents have forced theirs upon you). What use is a map if the world is always changing? Instead, you need to find a compass. I think curiosity will be your best north star. Make time to be self-indulgent in things that you are eager to discover, or that excite your imagination. Do it, even if you suck. This will ensure you always do (1) work that you enjoy and (2) stay good at it over the long run. Which leads to the next point...

**8. Know when to stick, and when to quit (then go to #3).**

We don't talk about strategic quitting nearly enough. The world is always changing, and so will your interests. If something doesn't feel right, and you know it's not right, have the courage to strategically quit. This is not giving up because something worth doing is too hard; strategic quitting is being selective in investing your time in things that will give you the most reward. Go read Seth Godin's book ""The Dip"".

**9. Set limits.**

You are more than just your job. One day your career triumphs and failures will all be but a distant memory. Strong organizations move on without you by hiring a new person. Set limits on what you are willing to compromise and what you are not. If your commute is dragging you down, figure out a way to move or quit. If a new promotion requires far more travel than your family wants, don't take it. Do you have enough time to pursue your hobbies or see old friends?

**10. Invest in your friends and family.**

It becomes increasingly harder to make time for people as you get older. Everyone gets busy; if you're free they need to be free too. It can be harder to make many new friends in new cities, especially if you're an Ambitious Overachiever who is likely to rotate through a few major cities for new career opportunities. Indeed, I have spent considerable time moving between three major cities in the USA in just the past 6 years.

Therefore, you need to be proactive. Maybe you have a friend who is a ""starter"" and can hop on their social bandwagon. But more likely, you need to own and actively build your community. Plan for a year or experimenting with different social activities to find your crew. Most people are waiting to be invited somewhere. Everyone wants to feel included. Be a leader, and make things happen.

**Conclusion.**

If you follow that recipe, there's a high likelihood you'll have a rewarding, successful, and enjoyable career. You'll feel happy, your friends and family will be happy because you'll be happy, and you'll continue to get better at your thing.

There is no perfect job. If you're successful, you'll have your pick amongst a lot of good choices in different ways. There won't be a ""best"" career choice. Only best, with respect to your values and current situation at the time of the decision.

Think about your job as a long and nonlinear career arc. You need to be deliberate and intentional with your time. Your goal should be to shift your work away from tasks you dislike or are bad at, and towards tasks you enjoy and are good at.

You might not know what you enjoy and are good at yet, but you probably already know what you don't enjoy or are bad at. That's normal. You need to explore more to discover what things excite you. You'll know when your natural curiosity takes over and the task at hand doesn't feel like a chore.

Don't be a dreamer who doesn't execute. For example, I have a friend who is unenthusiastic about her marketing career but can't decide if she wants to be a journalist or get a PhD in Psychology. She's 30. She's dreamt about these things for 10 years. Instead of spending Sunday afternoons writing articles or reading psychology, she watches Netflix and makes excuses. At this rate, she'll wonder if she made the right choice at 40, and 50, and 60.

Think about exploring your interests like going to the gym. You might need to work your way up to going, but after you get started it begins to feel good.

Stay safe and healthy everyone. This pandemic sucks, but it soon shall pass. The next decade of your life will be exciting and filled with many ambiguous choices. Everything will eventually work out if you maintain the right mindset when navigating this next chapter of your life.",1586461314,5,0

Advocate for yourselves against increased workload and unaccommodating professors,"I’m a PhD student teaching an FWS (throwaway account). I’ve seen a lot of posts and comments about professors increasing the workload and not being accommodating to students’ needs during this crisis. I want you to know that your anger is completely justified and that this is absolutely not ok.

We as teachers/profs have received very strong guidelines about how to conduct the rest of the semester. We are required to be accommodating and very strongly encouraged to rework our syllabus and reduce the workload. I have personally cut the workload for my FWS significantly and I think all professors should do so. *Increasing* the workload is ludicrous and explicitly goes against Cornell’s guidelines.

I highly encourage undergraduates to organize and advocate for yourselves. In classes where professors are doing this, don’t just post on Reddit or complain to your friends. Advocate for yourselves. But be cautious about doing it alone: individual emails can single you out and expose you to possible backlash. Talk to other students. Collect and compile your complaints. Submit them to the professor, anonymously if necessary. And if your professor refuses to change, then take it to your department or your dean. I think they will put significant pressure on professors who are doing this. Change can and will happen if you organize.

If you do this, you might also want to reach out to Cornell Graduate Students United. As grad students we have our own major problems to deal with right now, but I think you would find support from us.

Good luck. Take care of yourselves and each other. We will make it through this together.",1586451136,26,0

Wtf... Some professors are taking advantage of the online classes to make classes longer and add work,"One of my classes was 3 days a week, 50 mins per class.

He is now posting the lectures online and is taking advantage of the lack of time constraint by recording 75 min lectures.

So now, instead of three 50 min lectures per week, we have three required 60 min Q&amp;A sessions AND three 75 min lectures per week. This is more than TWO AND A HALF TIMES the amount of time that should allowed for the class. He’s just making more work for himself as well as for all of us.

Seeking help,"Hi - just wanted to reach out because idrk where else to turn.

I'm a freshman in CAS and have had a really rough year this year, especially this semester. It's only gotten worse since coming home, as my home life (though not the worst by far) is not great, and my spiraling mental state has gone lower than it's been in a long time. I'm only in four classes, as I dropped my fifth right before we left Ithaca, but now I'm trying to see if I can re-enroll and take it S/U (though I'm sure that'll look bad in the future, but at least it'll keep me on track for the minor I'm trying to do).  Overall, I feel very off-track for my degree path and almost as though this entire year has been a waste. I feel as though I have to squeeze everything into the three years I have left because this year was such a shit show. 

I tried reaching out to my Advising Dean, hoping for some kind of guidance and support, and she told me that it was my own decision whether I re-add the class; she also didn't give any advice on managing online classwork or moving forward. She also made a remark about how the advising office is busy trying to get support for students who don't even have laptops or internet connections; this made me feel like an absolute piece of shit for my own concerns, when there are students faced with a lot worse...

I really don't know what to do moving forward. I feel so behind my classmates in terms of the degree(s) I'm hoping to get, internships, and life in general. I also just feel very dumb. I can't do a lot of my schoolwork, like I can't concentrate on it, can't read, can't focus... and this was honestly a problem before leaving Cornell. Quarantine has given me time to think about what I'm even doing at an institution like Cornell - everyone around me seems better than I am, more ambitious, more driven, more successful. I know it's not really ""everyone"" but the people who go on to do big things in the world surely aren't failing their freshman year. I know freshmen who have internships lined up at places I could only dream of getting to: the State Department, think tanks, etc.

I made the mistake of trying to talk to my mother about that the other day, though we haven't spoken in months (and haven't \*really\* talked in years), and I told her about these feelings of how I'll never achieve the things my classmates are. She said that if I really, truly believed that I'm dumb, maybe I should lower my standards and expectations and not chase after the things that others are chasing because they weren't meant for people like me to achieve. I'm starting to think she's right.

I'm the emblem of mediocrity, and I fear that this is just the start of the rest of a very mediocre life.",1586352420,1,0
Why are people so anal about their grades?,"I get it, we’re Cornellians and a lot of us are hell bent on getting good grades. And during a time when the inequalities between students are put in starker light, I can understand why people are passionate about the grading scheme that’s implemented. 

However, the majority of us are going straight into the workforce. I’m honestly surprised that so many people are investing so much energy into their respective grading campaigns when the economy is totally getting fucked sideways—whether you take a class S/U or graded isn’t going to matter when the unemployment rate is so damn high and demand for new hires will be low. I’d rather see people just help each other out, whether that be just going grocery shopping for them or helping them find a job to get through this (a lot of students lost their jobs too).",1586351954,1,0

The break made me forget how bad it was, but I feel like such an idiot. I spent a week of break watching recorded lectures from other schools on the same topic as this class, rereading lecture notes/the textbook, and now I'm sitting here staring at this project, as I have been for the last three hours, with no idea what to do or how to start. And it's annoying because I feel like I understand the basics (barely),  and I keep trying to work it out, and I'm going in mental circles. I keep trying to work up the courage to post a question on the discussion board, but I'm so screwed I just get embarrassed and close the screen every time. What am I supposed to ask when I don't even understand how to start? Right before school let out, I was just starting to talk with my professor and go to how to address my problems, but now that everything is online idk how to get the help I need. Day 2 of classes and already feeling defeated wooooo

Life Sucks -- but my professors understand,"This has probably been the hardest time of my life. My autistic brother has been in and out of the hospital for the past year due to his seizures. We are in a lot of medical debt because of that. And now both my parents have lost their jobs -- so we are all now working at Amazon just to survive. Now I'm having to balance working at a wearhouse (even though I have moderate asthma and am high risk for covid 19), taking care of my nonverbal brother who needs constant attention and doing school. It's already been a shit year due me always worrying about my brother and now it's worse. 

But the bright light in all of this? I told my professors about my situation and they all understand. They were willing to be flexible with me and even gave me tips on how to manage my time. The professor I do research with even offered to pay me double so I can reduce my hours at amazon. I cried when I heard that.

Those who are still ON CAMPUS...social distancing PLEASE.,"I know recently the weather in Ithaca is incredibly good and feels like actual spring, BUT it shouldn't be the reason why some of you can play volleyball/soccer together in large groups and eat lunch/dinner together (especially while one of you was coughing).

I get that some people will take the ""you're weak"" stance and they'll say if you're a hard worker then you'll push through. No one in my family is dying, we have the essentials, we have dogs, what am I complaining about? I'm still stressed out and dealing with depression (which according to my parents isn't real and they'd also equate it to laziness and being weak minded). 

My prof, TAs and course staff are all great and are really trying to make online classes work for everyone. I haven't reached out because tbh I'm scared to. What would I even say? And what would I tell my parents?

I do want to do well and I am trying. So, fellow Cornellians, could you put yourself in my shoes and give me inputs please?",1587527558,1,0
“Lightening the load”,"So in the past week I have had:
-1 major 9 page essay worth 30% of my grade
-1 major statistics assignment due on the same day as this essay
-1 semi-major 3 page paper worth about 10% of my grade
-4 quizzes over lecture material that I’m expected to learn without the professor actually teaching it (he doesn’t do zoom classes)
-2 statistics problem sets
-2 minor response papers (one of which I ended up missing because it’s completely new and I didn’t realize it existed)
-An oral presentation in French

Things I still have left to do this week:
-4 more quizzes over lecture material that my professor hasn’t taught
-A 300 page book’s worth of reading 
-A short response to this novel 
-Another 50 page reading
-A major paper worth 20% of my grade
-2 short response paper in the same subject due on the same day
-2 more statistics problem sets
-A set of revisions to my French paper

How the hell is this supposed to be “lightening the load” or things less stressful for us? I am literally more stressed than I have ever been before at Cornell. And that’s not even mentioning the bloody pandemic and the stress that comes with that! I’m missing assignments and lectures for the first time ever and I can barely work up the initiative to do anything because the minute I get anything done, 3 more completely new assignments replace it. Literally for one of my classes the teacher barely does anything. There aren’t any zoom sessions or discussions (beyond occasional office hours), instead we take daily quizzes on the annotated but very sparse slides and fill out major assignments that don’t offer any room for discussion. He seems to have shifted the entirety of the work onto us in the middle of a pandemic without any regard for the rest of our classes!",1587526720,1,0

I am trying to do a bit of informal research/digging into how Cornell has handled cases of harassment, stalking, sexual misconduct, and other awful stuff of that nature.

To me it looks like the narrative out there is one of two: either people talking about Cornell being unjust to the accused parties, or Cornell basically doing almost nothing to help victims. I want to know what kind of experiences Cornell students have had, in their own words.

If anyone wants to talk here, or PM me, I am hoping to get a better understanding of how well people who have been through this think Cornell handled it.

When I woke up at 8:03 AM (the quiz was due at 8:00 AM) I figured I did the entire question wrong so I sent an email to my professor at 8:10 AM with a correction but he replied I can't get credit for it now that the deadline is over so now I'm possibly going to get a zero on the question....and I just feel so,,,sad :(

cornell affecting family relationships,"Hi , never been one to post anything like this before but don't rlly know where else to go

anyway i go to Cornell and i absolutely love it, when i got in my family was incredibly proud and r very proud i am there now. the thing is now that I'm back, i notice my family dynamics have changed. i have a sister in high school and there is a clear tension that exists between her and my dad. they argue everyday and she is constantly mean and detached. i think this is a result of the fact that my dad unintentionally is placing a lot of pressure on her to do her best to try and get into an ivy. its not that he wants her to get in , its that she says she wants to but displays no effort and he gets frustrated by that and often suggests ways she can study or work which makes her angry and they argue. when i left i feel my whole family was much more lighthearted but now the daily pattern is that she barely talks to him ab her life and when he tries to talk to her ab school she gets mad. he doesn't even know what to do bc he doesn't want to pressure her into an ivy yet knows she feels pressure to get into one and is trying to help her thus straining the relationship further. i don't know what to do, the whole thing is causing me stress bc i feel like if i hadn't gotten into an ivy, the situation would have never happened and i just want my family situation to be as it was before i left.

How likely am I to get matched financial aid at Cornell? (Transfer into CAS),"1) My parents, who never went to college themselves, have been running their business (homebuilders) at a loss for two years and have a negative income. 

2) My dad builds about two or three multi-million dollar houses a year  in Middle Tennessee on a referral basis alone, and we hop houses (living in the demo product before sale) once every two-three years. The house we live in is like a shopkeeper's shop, it's an advertising device. We report in excess of $2.5 million in assets because CSS counts home equity, however unsellable, toward total assets. 

3) My dad says we can’t take out loans because he cannot tarnish his negotiation leverage at banks (for when he loans to buy a new property or build a new house) by having other loans on record. He says a student loan beyond 5k would ruin his business, but I suspect he is mistaken.

4) My older brother is also a full-time student at Purdue University, and my younger brother goes to a private middle school. We have no educational savings. 

5) I’m receiving $35,000 in need-based granted aid from BU currently, and I've been told Cornell tries to match. BU gave us this significant aid award through the appeal process because of the situation we explained above. 

6) How successful is the appeal process at Cornell? How much do they do change decisions based on the idiosyncrasies of an individual situation? 

7) And how compelling is the ""match my aid"" argument given what I have said about my parent's assets? Their current position is that I will have to refuse my offer of admission if we get anything less than 80% of the current financial relief we get at my current school.

Financial Aid Nightmare,"So I am crushed and tearing up right now because it looks like I won't be able to pay for Cornell. It was a great run, you guys. I was accepted as a transfer into the class of 2023. Sad to think some of us would have been friends. I would have loved to meet you but we just can't pay. They've (my parents, who never went to college themselves) been running their business (homebuilders) at a loss for two years and have a negative income. My dad builds about two or three multi-million dollar houses a year  in Middle Tennessee on a referral basis alone, and we hop houses (living in the demo product before sale) once every two-three years. The house we live in is like a shopkeeper's shop, it's an advertising device. 

As a result, we report in excess of $2.5 million in assets because CSS counts home equity, however unsellable, toward total assets. So that means I'm rich, right? There isn't a person alive who would actually buy our house for it's reported value, and that money is so illiquid it might as well not exist. We're receiving $35,000 in need-based granted aid from BU currently, and I've been told Cornell tries to match--but given our situation I don't know what will really happen. I found out tomorrow if we get nothing, in which case my father has told me he's not going to be able to make it work. I have no idea what to do.

Physics Research S/U,"I know there’s been a lot of these posts pertaining to classes, but I haven’t seen anyone ask abt research and think I would feel better if I heard someone’s input on this. I’m thinking of taking my research S/U. Basically this was my first semester doing research, and it went so so (This is my third semester at Cornell). It took me a few weeks start to understand the basics of what my group was doing. Then just as I was about two weeks into a particular project, coronavirus hit and I had to change what I was doing. At this point, I feel like I’ve accomplished very little this semester on my own; I’ve been working on simulations recently but I had to learn some physics first and I haven’t finished them yet. Today, the professor I’m working with announced that the administration told him he can’t give pretty much everyone an A, as he would like to do. (He beliefs research is long term work not a one semester thing, yada yada). He is being forced to give some people Bs and even Cs. I’m not rlly sure where I stand, but I feel as though a bad grade in research could be devastating, even given my otherwise very good grades, due to the fact that PhD programs are research based, and so they want ppl who can do actually research (I want to go to grad school). On the other hand, my group is very big, so if I go S/U, there’s bound to be ppl from my group that apply to the same grad schools as me. In which case, the admissions ppl might think something is up, if I went S/U and others didn’t. (Might be different if I had a real corona related reason for going S/U, but I don’t; 4 of my other classes are still graded, and one lib study is S/U, as it’s been since late February). 

For more context, this is a group that, I’ve realized, I’m not that passionate about; I’m thinking about switching to a new project after the summer.

It’s amazing what a change of scenery (and sun) will do,"I’ve been feeling depressed for weeks (seems to be the norm now), and it’s been insanely hard to motivate myself to do work. Between my uncomfortable desk and my bed, it takes me hours to complete even the simplest of tasks and I have absolutely no attention span. 

Today, Ithaca was beautiful. I sat outside near Schwartz for most of the day, and my productivity was through the roof. I read a 20 page article, analyzed a whole set of data, wrote 14 pages, and attended 2 Zoom meetings. I haven’t been this happy in a long time. The sunburn was totally worth it. 

Ironically, when my laptop died I went back home and tried to continue to do work, but yeah, as soon as I retreated back into my room, I again lost all motivation.

Really violent movies given as assignments,"Last night, my GF and I got together over zoom and watched a movie assigned to her in Spanish 2090. The movie was called Amores Perros, but I didn’t know anything else. Turns out, it was about dog fighting, and there were several scenes depicting the fighting and its aftermath in very bloody detail. Other potentially distressing topics in the movie included Gun violence 
Homicide 
Sexual assault 
Domestic violence 
Abortion 
Cheating 
Nudity 
I was in shock watching the movie, as I just could not comprehend why, of all the Spanish movies out there, this was the one chosen. Students are dealing with a friggin pandemic right now, so why expose them to all of this really depressing stuff on top of that?

From my understanding, movies that were assigned earlier in the semester were equally if not more distressing than this one! Furthermore, my GF told me that there were many instances in class where students expressed their discomfort with many of the themes in this movie and others. The one issue is that the Spanish 2090 curriculum is organized by one person (a tenured professor probably), but then taught by several grad students and other professors, so students complaints may not have been heard by the higher ups. I am going to email the head professor, requesting that the curriculum be changed. 

However, my question to you is what I should do if the professor tells me that she won’t make changes. I can’t stand the thought of another class being forced to watch all these horrendous movies. I think we can all agree Cornell gives us enough to deal with as it is.

How do I optimize Grading option,"Okay I need some advice on how to strategize my S/U option please. So right now the predicament is this: 
I’m doing like A-/A-/B- in my 3 major related courses, classes 1,2 and 3 respectively. My two options are as follows:
1. Focus on bringing my B- up, which will probably make my other two grades stay as they are as I have a lot of material to catch up on for class 3 
2. Pass fail class 3, ignore it for the rest of the semester, and bring classes 1 and 2 up to A’s. The material in class 3 is somewhat important for the future so I’m going to self study it over the summer. 

Material in class 3 isn’t difficult per say, it’s more that for the past 2 exams I’ve just had bad luck and had it on the same week as my 2 other exams, and I’ve always prioritized that’s last. I dont think self studying it is going to be an issue for me.

Of course, responses including any other aspects of the crisis is always appreciated.

Think about what you all would want students in the future looking back at this time to know about the crisis/online learning. How has the university responded to the crisis? How have professors responded? How do you feel about your online classes? How are you thinking about the future?

I'm frustrated,"I need to rant about Cornell's handling of the COVID-19 situation. 

Cornell is a hard school, we know that, I decided to come here knowing that. I also enjoy my life at Cornell, I know that some people don't and that's cool too, I hope it gets better for them. This said, Cornell/Cornell Professors needs to have a little more flexibility in the current situation. The workload is not being reduced, in most of my classes it has been increased. I had three prelims over Thursday and Friday and two classes had assignments due Saturday night after the prelim just because they needed to get one more p-set in. I have done more work these past weeks at home than any of my time at Cornell before, when we were still at school this was an easier semester. I am lucky, my home life is fine and I have a space to work here, still this is a dumb amount of work. I can't imagine how hard this is for some people. Finally, having the pass/fail deadline due before the final is literally the dumbest thing on the planet. I understand that professors are probably trying to figure out how to navigate this now too, and I highly doubt I will get any grade estimates post prelim 2 before the final. There will literally be no basis for choosing pass/fail other than my hope that I'm doing well in one class versus another.

Anyways, I'm less mad now at the end of this, but it's still stupid. This is one of the best schools around, they should be able to handle this situation in a way that doesn't upset the entire student body. I hope everyone is doing as well as they can and staying safe. We'll get through this eventually.",1588468658,1,0

Words of Encouragement!! (for Pre-med students specifically),"I know everyone is really struggling right now with their pre-med classes, especially being online but I wanted to offer some thoughts as a Senior who experienced the up and downs of this very difficult path.

My freshman year and sophomore year I struggled immensely in my pre-med classes. I felt defeated and watched my friends do ""better than me"". I definitely experienced imposter syndrome, but then I realized everyone is struggling too and that you aren't alone. My freshman fall GPA was very low and I remember being devastated thinking I couldn't do it. Now I am a senior graduating with a 3.7 and looking back on it realize how much I wish I could've told myself when I was getting Bs and B-s in chem and orgo, that it would be okay. I probably wouldn't have believed it, but I wanted to tell others that it will be okay. You will find your path and make it work. 

For me, I didn't get the best grades in intro chem and orgo, but I found my way with biochem and physics. You will find what you are good at and the upper level classes will be easier because you know what you are doing. I promise it will be okay, take whatever grades you get now with thoughts of yes this grade isn't my best, but I will get better and do better. Don't beat yourself up. I believe in those on the pre-med struggle bus (and everyone else obviously) to persevere and improve. 

Happy to offer any advice or words of encouragement through DMs. You learn a lot when you go make it out of the struggle.",1589736543,1,0

cHeM 2080 - I was thinking...,"I was just thinking. If we all complain about the final and at the end of the day what if she says we have to take the final later. Isn't that worse? She could say we would have to take it on the same day as our other harder finals. I would just wanna get it over with on monday. Then again she could make the exam easier and still make us take it on Monday. 


I have another thought. What if she makes the exam kinda hard and a lot of people do bad. Then maybe she could be planning on giving us a good curve and passing everyone. 

Here is the worst thought of all...
What if she says we have to take it when we get back in campus? I wouldn't want to think about 2080 next semester. There's a lot of other things to worry about next semester.",1589726060,1,0

"CHEM 2080, Let's Do Something!","Hey guys!  ( and sorry to those browsing reddit and seeing chem 2080 posts 24/7)  I know that almost all 400 of us in this class can agree that Chem 2080 has been absolutely terrible at making changes to account for this pandemic. Instead of making life easier, they manage to make it harder. We're probably all struggling and studying our asses off right now. Instead of just waiting and complaining, let's sign the petition (I did not make it - credits to whoever did!!). Who knows if it'll make a difference? But let's try it.

Chem 3580 Thoughts,"I saw the post from yesterday by another student in 3580.  I thought I was the only one who thought that way so I didnt speak out about the unfairness of this whole situation.  Here are some simple calculations: with the final being 150 points and prelim 3 being 100 points, thats already 250 points out of our total 550 ... almost HALF of our grade is based on the exams taken unsupervised.  Now with the 150 point final that is bound to be mad difficult, like what the redditor yesterday said, some students who might have scored high according to the usual means in on campus settings could see a drop in their grades because of the weird distribution that this all creates.  This is what bothers me that people who would have gotten higher grades because of hard work and studying will score lower than and earn lower letter grades than those who might not even learn anything from this clss except to cheat.  And I hear all you ethical moral people saying that those who cheat will feel be punished in the long run and those who keep their academic integrity will have the higher footing in the long run.  But will that actually happen?  With a higher grade in a weed out class like organic chemistry theyre put at a higher advantage in med school admissions, at a higher ranking med school, theyll have an advantage in residency matches, and to me that seems like theyre winning in the short run and the long run. i get that theres no way to make sure that nobody cheats but i just wanted to get that off my chest",1589662470,7,0
