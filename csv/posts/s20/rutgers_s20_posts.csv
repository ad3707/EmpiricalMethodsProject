Is Data 101 really a 101 class? I'm in dire need of help.,"I'm currently taking Data 101 with Amelie Marian and I am so lost, I don't even know where to start.  
I have done HTML and Java in Comp Apps, but that is all the coding experience I have, and honestly I forgot alot of it.  
But this R programming stuff that's happening in this course...I can't even begin to grasp it and it's already the 3rd week of classes.  
I got the 1st assignment (sorta) because we're allowed to use Excel, but this second assignment requires R stuff and let me tell you, I'm either going to get a 0 because I don't have anything to submit, OR I'll get like a 1 because I make a late submission of some trash attempt at figuring it out.

I go to lectures and recitations, but I can't follow, and I want to ask questions, but I don't even know what I don't know so I can ask. I go over the slides, but I don't get the context...I feel like I probably need to start from the beginning?  


Needless to say, I am snowballing to a fast F for this class if I don't understand this R stuff....  
Any suggestions to how I can become data literate?  
There is no data tutoring or anything at the learning centers and I've emailed Prof to schedule a meeting, and I'll try  head over to my TA's office hours, but it's gonna be a tight squeeze with my current schedule so ya,...

Conflicted with meeting professors for research opportunities. Need advice pls!,"So basically I had emailed a professor, Professor A about research opportunities, but had not heard from them in awhile so I had assumed research positions were full and I moved on to reach out to other professors. I had emailed another professor, Professor B later on and was offered to meet up for a potential position. The thing is that Professor A has now gotten back to me and also offered to meet up to discuss as well. I dont know what to do. I am interested in Professor A and their lab but I dont want to waste their time should I end up with a position by Professor B which I feel fits my interests better. However I still want to get more of a feel of both professors and their labs so I dont really want to turn down any of their offers/meetings should I end up not getting into any lab or see that it doesnt fit me well. I have already scheduled a meeting with Professor B first (before getting a response from Professor A) but am hoping the meeting will help me decide before meeting with Professor A. I haven't responded to Professor A yet. Any advice? And how do I break the news to one of the professors should I decide that I am joining one lab over the other. Would it be bad if I called off the meeting for Professor A if I do find that Profesor B is a good fit after the meeting ? Also any tips in general on meeting with a professor for undergrad research opportunities? Im kinda nervous and conflicted. Thanks so much in advance",1581100363,1,0

Some late night thoughts on coronavirus and recent posts," A tldr; at the end if this is way too long.

I've had a lot of my own opinions about the posts and comments regarding the virus and those of Asian descent. I've never gone out of my way to say stuff about race, racism, etc. online, but I feel like I should in a community that I'm a part of.

I am of Asian descent, born and raised in America, and I've always been very proud of my heritage. When the virus first began to be reported, it started off as jokes, memes... slowly it began to gain traction and people became worried, and **rightfully so**. **Yet** those feelings of concern grew into hatred for some individuals. Maybe you haven't heard, but I certainly have from my family warning me to be careful of being attacked. The most recent incident I'm aware of is a Chinese woman in New York being physically assaulted in a subway station and called a ""disgusting bitch."" Or those videos I've seen on Twitter of people quite literally burying their noses into their shirts because an Asian woman was sitting near them.

Am I offended by certain comments on this subreddit regarding being cautious around Asian people because they're Asian and that should be enough merit to believe they have the virus? **Yes.**

Do I think those people are being completely irrational? **Not exactly.**

Here's the thing. Yes, I understand the worry of staying healthy in a situation where we don't know much about the virus. I understand that some people might be overly sensitive (and I don't mean sensitive in a negative connotation) to any indicators that may suggest someone has the virus. It's an act of trying to be self-preserving.

But for a moment, try to imagine being in my shoes. You're walking around campus, trying to get your Kilmer's sandwich before lunch rush comes in, and someone starts looking at you funny or maybe having enough courage to ask if you're healthy. You haven't coughed or sneezed or looked anything other than perfectly healthy. Would you understand why they're asking you this? And just because you understand, does it really make it excusable for this random person to ask if you're sick just because of your race?

Again, I understand the need to stay healthy, especially in times like these. But as someone who has **never been to China**, who's family doesn't visit China **more than once every 5-7 years**, who has been **perfectly healthy** for months... I can't even sneeze or cough without feeling like I'm going to get dirty looks or that I've offended someone for existing in the same space during the time of the sneeze/cough. And it's all just because of my race.

**Just because someone** ***looks*** **Asian doesn't mean it's excusable to assume they have the virus.** What if they haven't been to China for over a year, or have never traveled to China? What if they're not even Chinese? Is it not the least bit insulting of being viewed negatively because of your race?

Instead of feeling like every Asian-looking person needs to be quarantined, how about everyone start practicing basic personal hygiene? Washing your hands after using the bathroom, using hand sanitizer often, being aware of touching especially dirty surfaces or objects, **washing your hands when you get back home after being in a public setting (I cannot even begin to stress the importance of this last point enough, you're touching so many public areas, why wouldn't you wash your hands afterwards?).** And if you think this is too much work... Then all I can really do is shake my head and chuckle. If you're truly worried about getting sick, why not take precautions of staying clean by starting with yourself, instead of pointing fingers at people and being worried they have something?

Tldr; It is not acceptable for those of us of Asian descent to feel as though we're being accused of having the virus based on nothing other than our race, especially those who have never been to infected areas.

Now it's super late and I really want to sleep. Here's to hoping I don't wake up to angry replies to me or to each other. I just want everyone to understand one another.",1581066899,1,0

I‚Äôm just curious to understand how people numb themselves to both participate in and facilitate  sexual, emotional and physical abuse. I‚Äôve noticed that severe hazing is more common in frats and uphold toxic masculine traits. I‚Äôm genuinely curious behind the thinking process and culture surrounding such behavior. Why do you think men are more likely to take part in such strenuous activities? Are the men emotionally disturbed later in life but feel like they can‚Äôt express it / don‚Äôt know how to express it? Especially when it comes to sexual abuse, do men feel like their trauma isn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal‚Äù? More over, why do a lot of frats depend on sexual hazing while sororities don‚Äôt?

When I was a senior in high school I was working at a sprint cell phone retailer as a sales rep and ended up not going to college. By 20 I became the store manager and was doing alright, ended up quitting because life was mundane and I didn‚Äôt want to be stuck there. Moved to San Diego, blew all my money and came back lol. After bouncing around different restaurant jobs among other work for a few years, in January 2017 I started at brookdale community college, got my associate degree in business administration.

As of a few days ago, I‚Äôm now 26.

Besides tv, music, and reading, I took up painting last semester, I dabble with some poetry and I‚Äôve been skateboarding on and off since I was young lad. I also enjoy coffee and conversation.

Livingston/Yard/Buell Apartments Selections,"The way the numbers are assigned changes year to year. Thus the cutoffs do change quite a bit. Not to forget differences in people‚Äôs preferences, some years more people want the Yard, other years more want Livingston. This year was also the first year the Buell Apartments on Busch were allowed to be selected by underclassmen. This paragraph before the cutoffs is to let the future generations of Rutgers redditors who read this to understand the numbers are not *necessarily* concrete

# SOJOURNER TRUTH YARD APARTMENTS CUTOFFS

-2018 the Yard cutoff was around 1600

-2019 the Yard cutoff was around 762

# 2020 the Yard cutoff is a 1713

*16 SENIORITY POINTS ARE REQUIRED FOR THE YARD*

---

# LIVINGSTON APARTMENT CUTOFFS

-In 2017 the cutoff was a 2926 with 16 points

-In 2018 the cutoff was a 2234 with 16 points

-In 2019 the *first round* cutoff was a 2187 with 16 points. The *second* round cutoff was around a 2299 with 16 points

# In 2020 the cutoff is a whopping 4600 with just FOURTEEN (14) points

---

The last time the cutoff was under 16 points was before I was even a student here. There are many reasons as to why this happened this year, [as outlined by u/OkayKatniss413 here](https://old.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/f7018k/why_are_the_cutoffs_for_the_livi_and_sojourner/fi878rb/), but basically it happens when people's preferences change especially when you throw a whole new res hall into the mix, in this case that's the Buell Apartments

---

# The cutoff for all the 4 person single bedroom apartments was a 5169 with 13 points

---

As of this post the Livingston Apartments are all filled. I do not know the status about the Buell Apartments and I definitely do not know jack shit about a second round. If there happens to be one and you're in it post or comment about it tho. 

**2 and 3 person applications have reopened as well as the Busch/Cook/Easton application**

This process is always cancer, I‚Äôm so fuxking glad to finally be done with it forever at least regarding *my* housing as I will be a ~~super~~ senior next year. I look forward however to hopefully witness the process in the years to come with you my fellow scarlet knight redditors

- have a set time during the day where your phone is off and you're studying
- take BREAKS! I cannot stress this enough. During breaks have a set idea and time for what you want to do so that you don't get distracted too much
- reward good behavior!!! Try to make yourself some tea or go out on a little excursion (a hike, a walk,...) REWARD YOURSELF!!
- try to be social, while still self isolating: you can FaceTime friends, you can play online video games with friends(I like PUBG Mobile hahaha), stuff like that
- try to appreciate alone time. We're in a weird spot where we're basically kinda forced to self isolate. Try turning this into a positive!! Learn something new, start reading a book you've been wanting to read, make art, practice self care(make yourself a face mask, watch Netflix, take a bath),...
- track your progress and try to have positive self talk. Such as when you have a productive day, tell yourself strong and loud that you are proud of yourself.
- keep expectations low. This is a stressful time for everyone, and your grades might also be affected. Try not to be too hard on yourself. It's gonna be alright!!",1584382040,1,0
Rutgers University Operating Status - as of March 16,"A couple things have changed.

**Dining halls, Woody‚Äôs and Starbucks are TAKEOUT ONLY. Social distancing is a must**

**ALL THE GYMS ARE CLOSED**

**WE ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING BACKüò≠**

Seniors, I am so fuckin sorry. I can‚Äôt imagine what you and really everyone else who loves Rutgers is feeling reading this. This timeline just sucks right now. Governor Phil Murphy has closed schools indefinitely beginning on the 18th. This includes universities. At this point, it‚Äôs just playing a waiting game for when Barchi emails us that it‚Äôs over. The CDC has recommended no events with larger than 50 people be held for the next 8 weeks. Graduation commencement is actually scheduled for after those weeks are up, however with all that is happening, plan on it getting at least postponed if not cancelled all together. 

**Please, PLEASE do not go outside your houses unless it is absolutely necessary. Social distancing is something you HAVE TO DO**. If you actually went on vacation to Florida or some shit, low key fuck you, but get back safe. It‚Äôs gonna take a long time for this to be over. So buckle down, use that internet and quarantine on

Yours in quarantine too,

-Desh

**CLASSES**

**Governor Phil Murphy has closed all schools including universities beginning March 18. This is indefinite. Rutgers will not open till the Coronavirus subsides, thus it is most likely that we will not be back this semester**

Starting on Monday March 23rd all instruction will be online. **This is now indefinite per the governor‚Äôs mandate**. It is up to your professor how this will work, like is it going to be a two way conference or will the prof just be lecturing while you ~~sit and browse Reddit~~ listen to them. How any exams will be administered is also up to the professor. Just because one class or section is having an open book, no proctoring exam doesn‚Äôt mean another class or section will as well. If you‚Äôre wondering something about how class will run, the answer is probably ‚Äúask you professor.‚Äù 

**Dining Halls**

http://food.rutgers.edu/operatingstatus/

**Dining halls, Woodys &amp; Starbucks are now TAKEOUT ONLY**. Only Brower and Busch are open. Meal plans will be accepted, but only during the online learning period. Also they close at 6. So if you‚Äôre on campus and relying on the dhall get used to early dinners for a while. Woody‚Äôs is open too and will take meal swipes once online classes begin. Woody‚Äôs is open on weekdays only from 8 to 2. Starbucks on the Livi Plaza is also open, limited hours this week and normal hours once online learning begins. **REMEMBER, TAKEOUT ONLY, SOCIAL DISTANCING IS A MUST**

**STUDENT CENTERS**

http://studentcenters.rutgers.edu/operating-status/

All 4 student centers and the sac will be open on weekdays only from 8 to 5. The restaurants in Cook, Douglass and Livingston will be CLOSED. **In response to the top comment on the last corona announcement, CASC Wendy‚Äôs will be open** along with the rest of the restaurants there and in the Bcc. The hours are listed in the link above

Any accounting major prepare for CPA? Please advise me !!,"Hi,

I will be graduating in May 2020 with 120 credits and have questions for preparing CPA. I got a job offer from accounting firm and will start working from OCT 2020. I know i need more 30 credits to be eligible for CPA license (150credits) and would like to ask you about better options.

Please see below and let me know which option is best for my situation.

1. Take classes as much as possible during summer before start working, and then prepare CPA while work full time. 
(FYI, company will support the cost of CPA exam.)

2. Prepare CPA exam as much as i can during summer before start working. If i pass the exam, and then take remaining required credits for CPA license while work full time.

Which option is better ?

I counted myself that I would get 30 credits in Accounting after May and NY License required 33 credits in accounting, so i think i should take one more accounting class during summer. 
Except that, can i take any classes at community college only for the credits? (art, music etc)

Petition for Partial Tuition Reimbursement,"Hey everyone,

We created a petition last night, that asks for 3 things: unnecessary computer/campus/school/lab fees refunded this semester, a partial tuition reimbursement, and financial aid credited to future use.


Given this pandemic, some members of our campus community will inevitably feel the impact much worse than others. It is important to come together as a student body at this time to stand up for one another.

I wouldn't say I have a clique or am popular just am comfortable with these people I see all the time and developed close relationships with 4 people outside of my roommates. This all accumulated over 3 years though, not immediate at all. I'm really intimidated by the largeness and party-like school of Rutgers as it is the polar opposite to Drexel (which I really liked and will miss). I'm really just there for the academics but I don't wanna be in complete isolation when I get there. The housing options are also HELLAAA intimidating.... just a big roblox OOF tbh.

Question about calculating your Major GPA,"So for my HR degree, I finished it with the 14 courses and have my GPA.

Now my question: I got a higher grade in HRM Social media than I did in one of the HR classes I took prior. Can I just swap the two courses which would raise my major GPA?

To clear up my question: I took course A to fulfill requirement 1. Later on I took social media, which also would have fulfilled requirement 1 AND I got a higher grade in social media than I did course A. I took course A before social media, and I took social media after finishing all the requirements for my HR degree. Can I swap the two and raise my major GPA?",1586547884,1,0

I went to their party back in November and let‚Äôs just say after that while I was walking back to my dorm I saw a bright light in the dark sky shining upon me. I was shocked at first, but then, I saw it. It was a beautiful DEPsi angel telling me, ‚ÄúThank you.

One day...,"I was having a lackluster night. Just work, work and more work. I grabbed a slice from my local pizzeria and walked home to my apartment. After eating it, I want straight to bed, wondering when my boredom would end. I dozed off, dreaming of a white Christmas. Until I heard footsteps. I quickly, but reluctantly got up and grabbed my phone, getting ready to call 911. I quietly opened the door and then turned on the light. I was in shock. There was a rather large man with a white beard wearing red inside my- was it Santa Claus!?! He turned around and saw me, ‚ÄúGood morning. I have brought thou this holy gift you shall need in your life! Here, take this, and go!‚Äù I took the card from his cold hands, and he then walked out my front door. I mean, I was wondering how he got in, since I don‚Äôt have a chimney. I locked the door too. Anyways, the card had three foreign letters engraved on to it. Out of curiosity, I ran to my desktop to look it up. I determined the language was Greek, and I translated it. I was amazed. This was the mark of Delta Epsilon Psi, a powerful foundation of brotherhood and success. I couldn‚Äôt wait, and so I contacted them, went through the wonderful process and I became a brother, as soon as I could. In one day, my life went from boring to beautiful.

# Why I made the app

I‚Äôm Augustus. I went to Rutgers and graduated in 2017. I grew up next to Livingston Campus in Piscataway...I'm actually typing this about 200 feet from campus.

I like bullet points...

* If I could go back in time to Rutgers I would spend a lot more time investing in my relationships. I know lots of people, regardless if they were introverted or social butterflies, who would say the same thing.
* In my personal experience, if you weren‚Äôt involved in greek life or into partying, once you became an upperclassmen your friends were pretty much ‚Äúset in stone‚Äù.¬†
* ‚Ä¶.So we made an app that focuses on discovering new activities to do and meeting people specifically on college campuses. It‚Äôs sort of like a cross between facebook events &amp; tinder (but without all the negative connotations of tinder haha. we not a dating app nor do we want to be one)
* With the app, we want to recreate the feeling of the first week of freshman year, where everyone was making friends and grabbing lunch with new people left and right (You literally could‚Äôve met someone in the BATHROOM stall and then invited them to get lunch with you and it would‚Äôve been normal)¬†
* It was originally intended to be for face-to-face meetups but we‚Äôre exploring ways to help the student body keep socializing during interesting times like these and also during summer/winter breaks

What does the app do

* Helps people find hangouts with other students.¬†
* You can create your own hangout, RSVP, message each other, etc.¬†
* We‚Äôre still building features and if you have any questions or just wanna talk, feel free to reach out to me at hello@imthere.co or DM us on¬† IG [https://www.instagram.com/imthereru/](https://www.instagram.com/imthereru/) since that‚Äôs where all the cool kids are these days",1587558418,1,0
About to fail college. Help!,"I am a freshman at Rutgers who‚Äôs situation keeps getting worse and worse. Last semester (fall semester) I failed two of my classes and ended up with a 1.16 GPA. I decided to retake the two classes I failed, Com Sci and Intro to Business to replace the two F on my transcript. But at the beginning of my spring semester, I‚Äôve just been at a bad place in life and lost all motivation. I wasn‚Äôt interested in the classes that I picked and I didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do in the future so I just kept them. I only showed up to class to take the exam and just gave up all hope in life. I didn‚Äôt care a lot and just foolishly kept telling myself things will turn out fine in the end. My depression got worse and I would have a mental breakdown every week and lost a part of myself every time. I told my self I would fix everything and I did for a week. And then suddenly I was back home stuck alone because of the corona virus and that didn‚Äôt help at all. Having online classes made it harder to focus on my classes and I lost my sanity more and more each day. I want to fix all of this and get my life back on track but I saw that an F for 3 out of 5 of my classes. They were all around 50-60 range and the semester is almost over. This didn‚Äôt help and the panic attacks because more frequent. I made an appointment with an assistant dean to ask for some advice and she reassured me by telling me to bring my grades up and not to worry about academic dismissal because they were going to be more lenient this semester because of the corona virus. But I know I couldn‚Äôt use this as an excuse to ignore how deep of a hole I dug for myself. I‚Äôm trying to bring up my grades as best as I can but with the lack of interest with my classes and how soon the semester is going to end, I just don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to do next and if it‚Äôs worth it. I‚Äôm worried about my financial aid and the lack of credits that I have. What do I do?

"CBN premed, comp sci minor","**I've bolded key questions, if you can speak on even one I'll bore your children**

As I'm reorganizing myself post-advising sessions, I'm looking over the advice I wrote down. My CBN advisor recommended that, because I have a fuck-lot of credits, I should get a minor in something I like. I've taken 3 years of comp sci in high school (now rising sophomore) and suggested it; she seemed very supportive of it.

Before I get torched, I'm not saying I'm well acquainted with CS. I can hardly compare AP Bio with the Gen Bio 1/2 sequence; I expect there to be a similar trend with everything 198.

**(1, can anyone attest to this? AP CompSciA vs. CS 110, 111, 112)**

*My advisor told me that the reason this path is less common is because of the need to take Data Structures and Calculus II (I can't seem to verify this*). I've got AP credit for Calc II, so that's a good deal covered, but my CS only goes as far as 110 (4 on the AP)

&amp;#x200B;

The core reason I'm writing this post is actually because of what follows:

**(2, Would taking Orgo I, Physics II(w/lab), and CS111 be exceptionally difficulty? Fall 2020)**

**(3, As for the following spring semester, would taking Orgo II(no lab), Genetics, and Data Structures 112 be exceptionally difficult? Spring 2021)**

&amp;#x200B;

I don't mean to sound arrogant if I come off like that, I just want to feel around and maybe learn some more. I have ultra-novel experience in python and BASIC, and I'm slightly better acquainted w js.

I can't seem to find many reddit posts about crosses similar to this. The reasons I'm going so far as to ask:

1. It breaks the general rule of 2 heavy classes, and
2. I don't have a means of gauging the difficulty of these heavier classes.

I met with three advisors (SAS, CBN, HPO in order) last week, and go figure this pops up in appt. 3. I'll be sending emails around soon.

Any advice helps. If you want to shit on your class, you can post that too. If you liked a (198:anything), I haven't taken any CS courses @ Rutgers lol so feel free

Two years in and I have literally no friends here. Let's remedy that before we all go literally insane.,"(Please don't curbstomp me for this. I literally can't take anymore. Every time I've asked for help, whether it be from advising, or within the Discord, or even on another post, I've just been berated by everyone else or used as a punchline with no actual help being provided.)

Rising junior and I still haven't really found my crowd here. After a pretty rocky freshman year I thought I could use my sophomore year to actually get into the culture here - and then, between tough courses and COVID-19, that idea evaporated pretty quickly.

Back in pre-corona times, all the clubs meet way too late for me (~8PM is usually right when I finish homework and am ready to just chill out for the day - commuting back and forth to campus again is too much).

So, screw it! I'm just gonna do it here:

Commuter. CS major. LGBT+. Any pronouns, idgaf.
I like cartoons, computers, science, drawing, and nature. Also I quote _Jake and Amir_ a ton.

I don't like talking about politics, or social media (not any more, anyways - it's all just gotten super vapid and toxic, including this site. I'll shut up about it now before I write another three paragraphs on the matter.)

DM me, don't DM me, leave a comment, inscribe your words on an ancient crystal and beam it to me, it's all good. I'm really only on Discord nowadays. 

Oh also I'm a total and utter slut for Star Wars, so if that's your game, call me so I can yap about Y-wings for three hours. I just wanna be part of the life here and actually have some people to meet up with when we're all back on-campus.",1589759155,1,0

Chemistry VS. Chemical Engineering,"Hey guys! Just joined Reddit and this group lol. I'm having a dilemma, and was wondering if you guys could help me. I'm basically deciding whether I should major in Chemistry or Chemical Engineering. Sounds simple, but my situation is a little crazy.

So I got my Associates Degree from Ocean County College in General Science, and I'm an incoming transfer student. I initially was just going to major in Chemistry so I applied for the School of Arts &amp; Sciences and got accepted for the Fall. Luckily a majority of the classes I took at OCC transferred over and is taking the place of all of the core curriculum classes I would need to take at Rutgers to get the Chemistry degree. So I would be going into my Junior year and would only need a certain amount of classes, and 2 more years for by Bachelor's in Chemistry. Yay!

However, recently I've been looking into Chemical Engineering, and in the School of Engineering there's no ""core curriculum"" of humanities or social sciences like SAS. There's literally a schedule of all the classes I would need to take for all 4 years, and they're almost entirely different than the classes I would need to take for a Chem degree. There's probably 5-6 classes that would transfer over from OCC. So basically it would take me 2 years for by Bachelor's in Chemistry and another 4 years for my Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering. (My Associates Degree would basically be a waste üò´).

With that being said, I did research on the jobs I would get with a bachelor's in both fields and Chemistry majors make about $48,000 /yr starting out and Chemical Engineers make about $72,000 /yr starting out. Because of this, I would want to eventually get a Master's in Chemistry, so that's going to be 4 years already. (So I guess money wise a Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering is equivalent to a Master's in Chemistry?? Correct me if I'm wrong). I know it sounds like I'm only in it for the money, but I genuinely like Chemistry and Math. I just want to pick something that I'd love and would be worth it for me. Bc either way, I'm going to be in debt a lot of money lol.

If anyone that's reading this is in the engineering program: How hard is it? lol. Is it something where only a small percentage of people that get into it pass and graduate? I'm not a dumb student, but I'm also not an A+ genius one. I like to challenge myself, but I'm average so I'm also nervous that It's going to be super challenging and I'm not going to be able to passüò¨.

One last thing: I already got accepted into the SAS, so regardless of what I chose, I would have to go there this semester. If I definitely want to go to the Engineering school, I can apply and possibly transfer after my first semester at SAS. Does anyone know if I can take those engineering courses offered at the Engineering school this semester? When I go to register for classes, it shows the engineering courses, so I'm assuming I can? IDK, but then what would be the point of going to the Engineering school if the classes are offered at the SAS?

I know I'm all over the place, but I'm having a really hard time figuring out what to do. If there's any students, professors, or chemical engineers that could let me know what they'd do in this situation. Thank you so much!!",1588640853,1,0

Mentally drained from this semester,"I've never posted anything on reddit, ever. I usually just scroll down, and up/down vote whatever I find deserving. But as finals are starting to approach, my mental health is starting to really take a toll. I haven't felt this anxious in a while and its really starting to bother me. I guess this is me venting. Maybe get some advice from my peers.

As a senior, I'm taking 18 credits of mostly ECE courses. I'm already a super senior and wanted to graduate as soon as possible, hence the 18 credits. I'm doing okay in just about all my classes except one: digital electronics. Although I've done well on quizzes (20% of grade), both of my midterm scores are well below average. I feel extremely behind on the material, and the final is on the 7th. Even if I study as much as possible, because the material for the course is so dense, i feel its not possible to reasonably do well on the final. Its starting to really bother me because this one class might be the reason why I don't graduate. If I don't graduate, I won't be able to retake the class during fall semester. I have run out of all my financial aid , and my widowed mother is currently unemployed during this pandemic. Even if i had aid , aid is provided for 12cr+ full time students only, not for just one class. In other words, if i fail this class, 5 years of college might go to waste, at least until i get the opportunity to take this single class.

 I contacted the professor, hoping to get a little bit reassurance that things will be okay. She tells me either I should pass/nocr the class so that the failed grade doesn't count towards my gpa or she can delay the exam for me by a couple days but the exam will be completely different. I email her back asking what she means by ""completely different"". I ask her does different mean more difficult or same level of difficult but different set of questions. If its more difficult, then perhaps taking the makeup might not be the right move. She replies by saying ""It should be ok if you are well prepared for the exam."" What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Like how am I supposed to interpret that? Her response absolutely triggered me.  

At this point I've really lost it. It seems like some professors are doing whatever they can to teach and allow students to learn but also being as empathetic as they can during such a tough time. But not so much by other professors. She unfortunately seems to fit the latter description. From her email responses it seems like she really doesn't care about her students. Definitely not their mental health. So basically i replied back to her email absolutely flipping out on her. Oh well. If I fail this exam, then I'll most likely be working at my local shop rite trying to make end meet. If I somehow slip through the cracks and pass, then hopefully the job market heals up and I can actually put my degree to use.

Anyways that's my little story. Wish me luck.",1588637188,1,0

Is a CS or physics minor worth it?,"CBN major here. Not pre med anymore. Avoided comp sci and physics like the plague but I realized I actually really enjoy those more than biological sciences. Shoulda noped out of CBN earlier but he we are. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve kind of been learning some coding on my own. Is it worth it to take CS111 next semester and potentially pursue a CS minor? I need the credits anyway since I pretty much completed my major by using every shortcut that I possibly could (and now I have less than the required # of credits ). 

I am already graduating late so I am questioning the worth of this. Is a CS minor going to really make me that much more employable? I get the vibe that with CS having the skills might be sufficient, without the minor. It doesn‚Äôt seem like medicine where you need a credential/licensed for every little skill (and understandably so). 

I also really like physics but idk where to start or what the point even would be. I lowkey want to go to grad school for physics and then go to law school. But I don‚Äôt know exactly how much leg work I would need to do.

RU Screwed out of a meal plan refund,"I understand the guidelines for refunds that dining services put out and as such was not expecting anything because I used meal swipes after March 23rd. But, I just found out my gf got a meal plan refund even though she had also been swiping after the 23rd. And, before someone states the obvious, neither of us used more than abt half of our respective swipes (well under the 75% mark).

I'm just wondering, who can I contact about this to get it fixed/secure a refund? Has anyone had similar weirdness go on with their meal plan refund?",1588602001,1,0

Missing my Rutgers years... how are you guys doing in NB?,"I am reading a beautiful fiction novel and thought of Rutgrs when I read the word 'scarlet' towards the close of the chapter. It made me think of my years in the special town of New Brunswick. Not so long ago.

Let me make this a little warm for you guys. And share an interesting memory from my first few days. 

I saw this young lady at the busy George Street bus stop holding he bike by its handle. The EE stops and she goes to the front to pull down the rails and perch her bike on the face of the bus. I was dumbfounded. Boy, I had not seen any of this have ridden buses all my life in quite a few cities. 

By now, you guys may have guessed it that I love bicycling. Oh yes! I had bought an expensive Trek from  Jay's cycles in Princeton.

ps.  Would be fun to read about your memories and experiences from living in this unique Jersey town.",1588594640,1,0
