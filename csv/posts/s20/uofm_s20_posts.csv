A question about for prereqs for transferring to umich as a computer science major,"Hey there, I don't if this is the best place to ask this question, but I figured that I should ask. I am hesitant to email admissions because I am concerned that my question is a bit silly. I am a computer science major interested in transferring to umich. I was looking at the differences between LSA and the college of engineering and they seem minimal for computer science. As a consequence, I am having difficulty picking one over the other.

However, I haven't taken all of the required courses for the college of engineering (I am missing physics 2). In addition, my non-computer science classes have mostly been history, philosophy, math and chemistry courses. I know that LSA doesn't have specific requirements for transfers, but encourage a wide breadth of courses and I don't know if my courses satisfy that. However, I am interested in taking more classes in the humanities so I am inclined towards LSA, but I also want to be realistic about my prospects of getting into either college. Does anyone have any recommendations?",1580068022,1,0

Hey all! I’m a prospective student who was accepted recently and trying to decide where to go this fall.

For those who are current pre meds could you describe how competitive it is at Michigan? I know any institution is competitive but is it overly competitive like a place such as JHU? How many pre meds end up applying to medical school?

Is it hard to get the classes you want? 

How hard is it to get research opportunities beginning your freshmen year? Would I be able to start in a research lab at the medical center? 

Would labs accept me if I don’t do UROP?

How hard is it to get other pre-med extra curricular opportunities like shadowing and volunteering? 

Is the pre-med advising helpful since there is so many students?

How many students from Michigan undergrad tend to be accepted at the Michigan medical school? Is it higher than average?

Since I’m OOS would I still be at a disadvantage when applying to Michigan medical school even if I do my undergrad at Michigan?

Do you have to apply to be a part of clubs like at Penn or is it more relaxed to join clubs?

How hard is it to get into honors? How do I apply and when? 

Do any of you regret your decision, why?

Finally, why did you choose Michigan for pre med?

• How's the atmosphere like for transfers generally?

• Will I be able to find a good friend group as a junior transfer? (I'm a big football fan and also other sports like hoops and ice hockey! I would love to attend games but just worried if I won't have any people to go to the games together :(

• Being used to the California weather, I'm worried how cold and hot it gets in Ann Arbor?

• How's the political atmosphere in the school and the town?

• I'm thinking about living off campus. Is it hard to get the housing off campus?

• Is there any rule that I have to graduate in two years after I transfer? My current school doesn't have the major so besides GE classes, I couldn't really take any lower division classes for the major. I think I might have to take more time to take all the classes that I need.

• Lastly, what do yall like the most and least about the school!

Possibility of rescinded acceptance over withdrawing from one course?,"Hi! I was recently admitted as a transfer, but I do have a concern. This semester I maxed out on credits, which are mainly higher level courses in my major besides one \[high credit\] intro science course, and the workload has been killer as is.

Worst of all, I live in a city that's been on complete lockdown due to COVID-19, and not only is my housing situation giving me a lot of trouble on focusing (I have an alcoholic roommate, enough said), but the science course has been translated TERRIBLY into an online format, leading me to start falling behind on my more relevant, higher level courses. I want to avoid this happening and don't want to do a pass/fail semester (which my school is offering) for credit transfer reasons, so I'm considering withdrawing and retaking it over the summer. I'd still be a full time student this semester FYI, and this course is not a prerequisite for my major.

Is there any chance of U-M rescinding my decision for this? I've maintained straight A's for 2 years and am expecting at least B's or above in current classes (no clue because my midterms have been rescheduled 3 times now so I can't even accurately evaluate lmao).

However, I don't know if that policy has been loosened given the new grading system. Do you think they'll require us to unmask our grades for the classes we want to get major credit for, or will P/F grades be counted towards major/minor credit just for this semester?

Should I keep my grades masked?,"I’m a pre-med student taking some natural science classes. I have been told by advisors to never take a class pass-fail, this is because if an admissions counselor sees someone with a “P” for a grade while everyone else has an “A,” they tend to think that the person who got the “P” did poorly in the class.

I think the same thing can be said about this semester. If I get a “P” in chemistry but many others unmask and get an “A,” it will look like I did poorly, and as much as medical schools want to make it fair, at the end of the day there are only so many spots and they’re out to pick the most qualified person. If I were them at least, knowing nothing else about an applicant, I would also pick whoever got the “A.”

What’s everyone else’s thoughts? Not just with pre-med, but with all pre-professional programs. I would think that this would apply to most pre-professional grad school programs (Ph.D., D.D.S., etc.) as well.",1585031114,1,0

Should I switch my major from DS to CS?,"I am a transfer student from OCC and this is my second full term at UMICH (I took one class during spring 2019, FRENCH 103). I haven’t declared a major yet but I was considering Data Science. In the Fall I took FRENCH 231, MATH 217 (had to drop) PUBHLTH  200 (RE credit) and EECS 183 (which was my favorite class) I actually came to UMICH thinking Actuary Science major or some other math major as I LOVED all three Calculus classes at OCC but decided to change because MATH 217 kicked the ever loving crap out of me, and I really enjoyed my EECS class (never had any programming experience before this class). Right now I’m taking FRENCH 232 (last language class thank goodness) EECS 280, MATH 425, and MATH 214. I transferred in STATS 250 so I can’t get credit for STATS 412 so my only option is to also take MATH/STATS 425. 

So anyway I have been struggling in both my math classes and I don’t know if it’s because I’ve overloaded myself or I’m just not understanding the material. And I’ve been wondering if I’m going to make it even as a DS major. I really enjoyed STATS 250 and thought it was really easy at OCC but I think I’m going to just barely pass these 2 classes (if I pass at all!) On the other hand EECS 280 is going swimmingly so far (I am in the midst of the euchre project) but I know the EECS classes get harder. I still need to take EECS 203 and was going to wait till the fall to take it but that pushes back progress for a CS major. I know I can take it during the spring but was hoping to get an internship for this summer. 

Do I stand a chance in the DS major? How difficult is STATS 426 and 413? I’m feeling so defeated right now and I don’t want to start over from scratch again...",1581886242,1,0

Researching has got me no straight answer and would like some insight.,"Hi friends.

Only recently for the past year I've been looking into civil engineering, specifically structural engineering. I happen to live in Michigan and had a set choice of umich engineering. Thing is, at school I never tried, I always did the least amount of work and always flunked out. I am now doing online schooling, taking tutoring with specifically trigonometry and pre-calc.

So far, I'm half way through my 10th grade in online schooling, 15 years old, and I happen to be Asian American. My PSAT in 9th was an embarrassing ~970 and I've never  done any extracurriculars. I also happen to have one parent and low income with added social security from my nonna.

Although this may be the case so far in my life, I now realize I need to get my things set and straight. Next year I plan to go back to public highschool and absolutely try my ass off. Doing everything possible I can. I also believe and know I can get better SAT and ACT scores, 10x better than before.

Now, with this information I gave you, be completely and generally honest, how well of a chance do you guys think I can get in to CE? I've found out that the average entrance scores are 1400 SAT 32 ACT and 3.9 GPA. But maybe I need a wake up call, and hopefully you guys can give me some heads up. Possibly tips I can use to improve? I'm not sure, I did give some vague information but hopefully it's enough to get some perspective on my situation. Thanks in advance.",1581883035,1,0

 I don't have any formal tutoring experience, but I got an A or A- in pretty much every single class I took freshman and sophmore year on the pre-med/chem major track. I think I'd especially be helpful for orgo (one of my proudest A's) as I have a bunch of studying resources.  I genuinely enjoy helping people learn, and selfishly, I know explaining those concepts will be a really effective way to drill MCAT material into my head. 

Does anyone know how I would go about doing that sort of thing? I would also be open to tutoring highschool students. I'm just not really sure where to start.",1581812067,1,0

Struggling trying to network and improve my social experience,"How am I supposed to “do networking” as a student here? It seems as though any club or activity that is worth networking through has an application process where they weed out candidates making it almost impossible to get your foot in the door. I failed at a lot of these opportunities my time here, and have been working hard to play catch-up.

I’ve generally struggled socially and have been trying to to act and seem like a more approachable and likable person to try to get into some of these places, because it is something that doesn’t come all that naturally to me and have tried working on this for the past few years to no avail (ie:reading books on social interaction, losing 30 pounds, dressing better, writing down and dissecting my social position and social interactions I’ve had throughout the day and I’m still trying to improve on them, living in a nice apartment at a prime campus location etc). Simply put none of this shit is working.

All this work culminated in the process of rushing professional fraternities and clubs this year all to get rejected from all of them, most of them at first cuts. And I tried EVERYTHING to get into some of these places. (attempted to leverage anyone I sort of knew in these places to give me a good word, had someone in this clubs review my application letter, applied all of those body language techniques that I tried to learn from those worthless fucking books during rush events, stalked current members on social media to “just happen to” bring the conversation to shared topics of interest during rush events, pre-writing my answers to interview questions, etc) 

I really struggle at making friends, and I’m in what you would call “in between friend groups” now, and I’m most likely going to spend my 21st birthday in the library tomorrow studying. I know I’m not alone in my experience, but come fucking on, there should be an easier way to go about this, because the avenues that I have been trying all seem to be falling right on their face and everyone else seems to think this school happens to be great for networking and making friends.

Am I screwed if I used a CLEP test to test out of general chemistry?,"When I got into community college I didn’t want to waste a bunch of time retaking general chem because I have already gone over that information 3+ times and so I tested out of it using CLEP.

My question is, did I screw my chances of getting into Michigan since I tested out of this class instead of taking it? Will I possibly have to go back and take the class in order to get accepted?

 I am just now reading that they don’t accept CLEP tests most of the time and since chemistry is my major this has me very worried.

To keep this short, I was planning on taking calculus 3 and differential equations at my local community college this summer.

If they did not accept the classes would I have to retake them in-person in order to gain credit or is there a way I could test out of them at UofM?

Internships/jobs coming out of Michigan CS,"Hi! I was accepted as an incoming junior majoring in CS. My current school's program is...terrible with zero guidance -- most people have trouble finding internships, let alone jobs -- so actually feeling prepared career-wise is 100% my priority, and the fact that Michigan is ranked highly for CS matters a lot to me.

My question isn't so much what the cons of Michigan CS are, because I've definitely heard that it's overcrowded like in terms of registering for classes (a concern since I couldn't take AP exams and will only have 70 credits by the end of this semester). That being said, do the pros of Michigan CS outweigh the cons? Ie: do you think that, despite everything, it still prepares students well and leaves them in a good position for internships and jobs? My other decisions will be out in a month+ so I'm trying not to overthink yet, but I'm still stressing since I don't know if I should be really crossing my fingers to get into a comparable private like USC, or just relax and know I have a solid option already. I feel like a lot of the general ""how is CS here"" posts can devolve into being fixated on negative details, so I'm trying to look at the big picture.

Just a Couple Questions about Computer Science,"Hi, I was admitted to the class of 2024 for Computer Science in the Engineering School. I am an OOS student, but have loved UMich for a long time (Go Blue!) and am super excited to enroll this fall. Although I know it is a top-rated CS program, I just had a couple questions about the CS department given how much the program has grown recently.

* I heard it's become a nightmare to get the upper-division CS electives you want.  Is this true, and if so, is this for just some electives, or across the board?  (I have APs that translate to 23 AP credits for math/physics/chem courses, so will that help?)
* Are upper level electives capped at 2 classes per semester even as a junior or senior and does this make it harder to graduate in 4-years? 
* Is it true that you have to wait for hours to get any office hours with a professor? Is this for all the courses, and are there any workarounds (like online chats or study groups etc. that the professors make available)? 
* Are the advisors helpful? 
* Last, since the program size has increased massively, is it harder to get internships? How many people normally can even land internships at the FAANGs or other big name companies?  

I was hoping to hear from students actually in the department before I officially commit (also have Georgia Tech and UCLA has options, though I am heavily leaning towards UMich). Any advice would be super helpful :)",1586377142,0,0

Huge Gap Between Lecture and Discussion,"Hey everyone, I'm pretty frustrated right now. In BIO 171, it seems like the lecture and discussion are now two separate courses. I'm not sure if this is because of the current situation, or how that might cause this, but I don't remember this being the case. Earlier in the semester, discussion was a kick-ass resource for understanding the lecture material and being able to talk to other students about it. Now, unless there is some major caveat I don't know about, there is nearly zero overlap between the discussion content and lecture. Committing time to the learning objectives is no longer enough, as the discussion material is (and always has been) fair game, but it has seemingly zero relevance to lecture.

Michigan Medicine Weekly COVID-19 Email,"I’d like to preface this by saying that we definitely should not worry yet about this. But, after seeing the previous post on here I thought this might be beneficial.

Michigan Medicine sends a weekly email to Employees updating about the virus and casual plans. I’ve attached the most recent one (from today) here. If anyone would like more of these, I’m happy to keep updating but again, I do not think this should be a concern yet. Thanks!


&gt;Colleagues,
 
&gt;Please see this week’s update below regarding COVID-19 (novel coronavirus). Updates will be sent each Tuesday, or more frequently if major updates occur.
 
&gt;Please share this information with your colleagues.
 
&gt;Attached is a one-page flyer that can be printed and shared in your work area.

&gt;Situation update
 
&gt;COVID-19 is continuing to spread, with more than 92,000 cases identified worldwide and over 3,100 deaths, with most occurring in China. 
 
&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is reporting more than 100 cases in the United States. There is ongoing transmission in Washington State, many associated with a skilled nursing facility, with several deaths reported. Currently, no cases have been identified in Michigan.
 
&gt;Michigan Medicine updates
 
&gt;Identify: Travel screening has been in place for several weeks to identify patients with risk factors so that appropriate precautions can be taken immediately. In addition, visitors are being screened and those with risk factors for COVID‐19 are not permitted to visit. 
 
&gt;Workforce members with travel to CDC level 2 or 3 travel notices (China, Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan): All health care personnel with recent travel to any CDC level 2 or 3 travel notices should self‐report to Occupational Health Services and monitor themselves for 14 days for symptoms of fever, cough and/or difficulty breathing.
 
&gt;Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
 
&gt;Please help protect the supply of PPE at Michigan Medicine by carrying out the following steps:
 
&gt;·       Ensure close monitoring of your PPE supply to avoid misuse.
&gt;·       Oversee masks intended for patient use to avoid misuse.
 
&gt;As COVID-19 continues to spread, plans for caring for ill patients in both the ambulatory and inpatient settings are being developed. This includes where the care would occur, how to conserve and utilize PPE, ensure that health care workers are able to put on and take off PPE safely, and allocating resources appropriately.
 
&gt;This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. Please visit the Infection Prevention COVID‐19 webpage for current protocols and information.
 
&gt;If you have further questions that are not answered on that site, please email coronavirus-info@umich.edu and your question will be answered as quickly as possible.

Earth 110 Exam Qs Grievances,"I’m not sure where to ask this, but I have some grievances against my Earth 110 professor that I believe ought to be addressed. I took the Earth 110 mini-course during the 1st half of this semester and it was honestly one of the most ridiculous classes I’ve taken here at UM – especially for it being a 1-credit mini-course. There were 2 LockDown Browser exams that we were expected to take w/out using any outside resources and these contributed to 58% of our overall grade. There were a couple of questions on both of these exams that were on topics that were neither included in the PowerPoints nor discussed at all in lecture – or if so, very briefly. I cannot imagine anyone doing well in this course unless they did use online resources while taking these exams. I made a list of said questions that were not fair on the exams, but I’m not sure where to go from here. I’ve talked to and heard from other students who’ve taken this professor’s classes and said that she’s really dismissive of concerns similar to those I have. I’m wondering if it’s even worth discussing my grievances with my professor if it’s likely that she won’t do anything to address them.

I guess that the only way I can find out whether my professor will do anything regarding my grievances is if I bring them up to her in the 1st place, but I’m not sure how to do this w/out it being awkward or coming off as offensive. Is this something that I can address with the ombudsman or Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences Dept. Chair?

EECS 183,"I might be downvoted/laughed at since it is just an “intro” class but whatever. 

EECS 183 has to be by far the most unpleasant experience I’ve had at U of M so far. 

The class materials/resources only teach the absolute bare minimum of how to code which pretty much gets you nowhere on projects. ZY books is almost useless and barely explains anything, and the lecture slides are completely worthless to review since they’re incomplete. 

The projects are ridiculous for an intro class and if you’re truly absolutely new to coding like me prepare to spend 40-50+ hours completely pulling your hair out. 

The staff is completely rude and condescending at office hours and piazza. My partner and I were completely stumped on a part of our project so we asked for help on piazza and subsequently were scolded because “it should have been obvious”. Ffs, it’s an introductory class. 

Don’t fall for trap that this is a class for people who have no prior coding experience. If you’re truly new to coding you’re going to be absolutely thrashed since they apparently expect you to already be an expert. 

I’m absolutely grateful this is the only EECS class required for my major. This class convinced me I hate coding.",1582813872,1,0

It’s always been my big school at the top of my list. But now my mom wants me to reconsider even applying because she said the money is just too expensive. I’d be applying out of state, so she’s pretty correct in that assumption. My test scores aren’t grand, but i plan on working to make them higher hopefully (testing has never been my strong suit, that’s for sure). My parents also don’t have a college fund set up for me or my sister, so im basically on my own. I don’t have a job (because my schedule is loaded with extracurriculars) so I cant save up.

I really don't feel like I belong here,"This isn't a ""Ohh I can't make As, only Bs, this school isn't for men"" post. I really don't feel like I should be here.

&amp;#x200B;

I applied for this school in particular for an admiringly stupid reason that ended up falling through spectacularly, when I got here I quickly realized also that, mayyybee coming here when I felt completely burnt out and tired of trying for little good that came out of my efforts wasn't a good idea. I've been trying to convince myself that ""if I just get through college and do well, I'll be home free!"" I've made such promises to myself before that did not come true, so it's a little hard to keep making such promises. And I don't do well in my classes, I actually failed my CS class (280) not a good sign. Due to burn out / test anxiety. I feel I can problem solve well when my brain is fully functional which is rare cause burn out. I got a C in math 115. for the same combo of reasons. Hoping Honors Calc 2's different format will help me do better lol

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, I might have gotten good grades in my programming CS classes in community college, but a lot of those classes were complete jokes. Projects were just about doing one function each project. Despite having credit for EECS 183, I needed to take it cause 280 downright scared me due to not being adequately prepared. The As I got in many classes took so little effort (C# class was literally just, add an extra line of code to this given file and submit it). Final was about making this huge project we were not properly trained to do. I failed that but because my other stuff was good I got an A in that class. Java classes were about doing fairly simple functions each week. One weird crazy challenging assignment, which I failed and got shamed by teacher for. Midterm / final was ""Answer super specific questions about the Java language despite having not studied it"". Other classes were literally ""Follow this step by step guide to do a thing using the textbook"" tedious but easy as heck.

&amp;#x200B;

All of these were the online versions of classes , I'm guessing in person classes were hella different from online and are what Michigan evaluated and judged my success based on. I didn't know Michigan disapproved online classes before applying.  This is the heart of why I don't feel I belong here - my grades feel hella inflated and I don't think I really clear the Michigan bar, not even close.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw my essay scores for my admission application . They were like, 1.5 or 2 / 5. This makes me really feel like my race (Hispanic) is a huge part of what got me in. That and inflated grades. I haven't seen too many Hispanics on campus,  Sorry that that seems harsh on myself but yeah

&amp;#x200B;

Also I culturally just don't fit in here. Maybe it's just being a lot older, but I feel like I won't find people who I would get close to because everyone I talk to, I feel this weird barrier of perspective sort of separate us. I can have fun in the anime club but it just feels like I'm sorta separated from them in a hard to explain way. It's not just me going ""Baghh stupid kids"" I see them as equals, but just, time has made them innately unrelatable. Not a fan of sports, luckily doesn't seem to matter here but the ""geek culture here is . . .stressed out EECS kids with little free time, including me lol. Graduates are closer to my age, but graduate life seems so different from undergrads, Not sure how many transfers would be any closer to my age. Never had time to go to transfer events due to burn out making me slow. Also I like having deep convos but the people I've tried to talk to seem so absorbed in their own opinion, they can't even consider what I'm saying / why. Not trying to change their opinion just want an honest conversation instead of feeling I'm being ""sold"" the ""woke""/ PC opinions without being listened to in return. . And I'm not super in tune with Spanish culture, or interested frankly so it's not as easy as ""Oh just find the other Spanish kids""

So to summarize, I feel like I got in with inflated grades, essays that got scored poorly, feel like I got accepted to boost race stats, find it difficult to make friends due to age / culture difference . Find classes difficult

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry fo the long post, feel absolutely free to give your opinions, even harsh ones / honest. I kinda wish it was easier to transfer but I have the best finned deal here for being 24 + (independent). Also classes don't transfer easily ETC.

Thoughts on Schlissel’s e-mail?,"To All Members of the University Community:

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has announced that in-person laboratory research can resume with limitations based on public health guidance.

As the largest public research university in the nation, this is a significant development for our state and our university as we continue to adapt to the coronavirus pandemic. We’re beginning to see how certain activities can resume in a public health-informed manner, while also understanding that work will be very different in the months ahead. Here’s what this means for us right now:

All work that can be done remotely must continue to be done remotely. This includes office and dry lab work.

Our state remains under the governor’s Stay Home, Stay Safe order, but as detailed in her MI Safe Start Plan, various economic and work activities can resume in phases. We are taking a similar approach at U-M, and planning for a safe and gradual return is underway at the university level and in our schools, colleges and units. Initially, we are only bringing back a subset of labs for in-person work.

In fact, some of the same U-M public health experts who are providing advice at the state level also are helping us formulate guidance for our campuses. This is a complex endeavor for a university as large and diverse as ours, and I appreciate the thoughtful work that is being done to help us all be safe.

Some in-person research labs and studios will open under strict public health guidelines.

The Office of the Vice President for Research has been working on plans to ramp up in-person research almost from the moment when we had to suspend it two months ago. This extensive planning has included close collaboration with leaders and investigators in our schools, colleges, institutes and regional campuses.

They have mapped out a plan, in alignment with state and other public health guidelines, to bring back in-person experimental lab and studio-based research in waves so as to minimize risk. The first pilot wave will involve a few carefully chosen labs, with strict public health guidelines for faculty, staff and graduate students. Guidelines will include such things as monitored entry into buildings, a requirement to wear a face covering and maintaining a low density of people in a lab at any one time. We’ll track performance metrics for each wave, and that will determine how and when we open additional labs. Additional details will be sent soon to the research community and published in The University Record.

Please note that even though individual labs in different buildings will resume operation, this does not mean that everyone in those buildings can return immediately. It’s quite the contrary. We still need to manage density of spaces and strictly abide by the best public health practices, including requiring all work to be done remotely that can be done remotely.

We need your continued cooperation.

This differential and staggered approach to resumption of activity will be the next great test of our resolve and compassion for one another. Full compliance with state and other public health guidelines will help to ensure that we’ll be able to resume more work as quickly and safely as possible. We have to accept this shared responsibility even as different parts of our university resume activity at varying speeds.

I know this is difficult. We all want to be back to in-person work. I very much miss seeing the vibrancy of campus each day and look forward to being able to walk into the office again. To help us reach the day when we can all be together, shared responsibility is essential, not just for our mission but for each other, our families and our future health.

While we know that life and work will be not be the same for a long time, I am very optimistic about our future. The planning taking place at all levels is thorough and impressive, and we’ll share more information as soon as we can. This includes our preparations for the fall, as we hope to be able to deliver a public health-informed fall semester with in-person instruction on our campuses.

What’s clear right now is that the care we have for our students, faculty, staff, patients, visitors and communities is always at the forefront of our efforts. The immediate future of the University of Michigan will look very different than what we have been accustomed to, but it will continue to be determined by the excellence and hard work of the many people who are devoted to our public mission. That’s why I am optimistic.

Thank you, all, for your continued diligence. Stay healthy.

Sincerely,

Mark S. Schlissel, M.D., Ph.D.

Waitlists for Upper level cs courses?,"So I'm an incoming freshman into the COE doing CS and I saw multiple articles/reddit posts detailing how most upper level CS classes have insanely long waitlists causing many students to take the courses that are solely available, not what they're interested in.  My question is if I come in with 23 credits, is it possible fr me to graduate early, taking the competitive upper level courses I am interested in.

Also regarding the same topic, is Umich planning to do anything to fix this problem in the future (maybe making direct admission to cs more competitive like in other top cs schools). Another solution could be fr the school to cap the number of courses students can get waitlisted in. If most students only sign up on the waitlist for 1 course, not two, wouldn't this whole problem blow over (correct me if I'm wrong tho)

A random question about self-studying EECS,"For a bit of background, I'm someone that is going into a career that is by no means CS related, but I've always found coding quite fun (I've done ENGR 101 and really liked it). As a result of this, I've been looking into sharpening my coding skills by unofficially following along with EECS 280, since they post the class materials publicly. What I was wondering is if the autograder checks to see if you are enrolled in the class to let you submit.

incoMing: Mentorship Program for New Students,"Hi everyone!

I’m new to Reddit, but wanted to share a really great resource for rising freshmen! My friends and I created **incoMing,** a by-students for-students mentorship program designed for freshmen students entering the Ann Arbor campus. Incoming students often have little resources or connections to get their questions answered and learn about college life leading up to their first day on campus (especially without in-person orientation!). 

With the **incoMing** program, casually text, email, or video chat 1-on-1 with current UMich students matched to your academic, social, and personal interests through a quick form to gain a holistic and transparent perspective on the transition to Ann Arbor.

Interested? You can find more information and the form to sign up at [www.incomingmich.org](http://www.incomingmich.org/). Feel free to send this to your friends (both current and incoming UofM students)! Contact us at [incomingmich@gmail.com](mailto:incomingmich@gmail.com) or message me if you have any questions!",1589562760,1,0

Transfer Chances for Winter 2020?,"Hi there,

  
I have been accepted to MSU this Fall, but I also wanted to give a shot at applying to UofM for the Winter semester. I've never applied to UofM before and would appreciate any tips you can offer. Here's  my profile:

  
**Major**: Mathematics

**High school GPA**: 3.5

**College GPA**: 3.72

**College credits**: 72

**ACT/SAT**: didn't take

**Residence**: In-state

**Courses**: Calc I, II, III, Diff Eq, Linear Algebra, Intro to Stats, Physics I (algebra-based), Chemistry I, C++ programming class, three social science classes, two humanities courses, and English composition. 

  
All courses were taken at OCC and are transferable to UofM (I've listed only courses that transfer).  I also plan to take two more humanities classes this summer.

Is it worth it to continue taking EECS 370 in the spring?,"Hey all, sorry for the CS question! 

I’m currently in EECS 370 for the spring semester and it’s going well, but I’m concerned for how things will shake out in the coming weeks as I’ve heard the difficulty ramps up considerably.

Plus, I have a time-consuming extracurricular and a full-time internship that I’ll likely receive but won’t find out about until after the drop deadline.

Still, I know EECS 370 is pretty stressful during the fall. That’s why I’m unsure if it’s a good idea to take it with other rough classes in the fall when I could just get it over with now. I don’t think I’ll be any less busy in the fall, either.

External Cross Campus Transfer (LSA to COE),"I know there have been numerous posts on how painless transferring from LSA to COE is if you complete the pre reqs and hover around a 3.0 or above.

COE seems like a good fit since I am interested in pursuing a CS and IOE double major. 

This summer, I can either complete some LSA GenEds or my left over engineering requirements, with which the risk of wasting those extra math and chemistry credits comes if I don’t get into COE, thus pushing me back by a semester in LSA. On a side note, I never thought I’d be interested in IOE until recently, after I got into LSA, when I took a short course in industrial optimisation and management.

Essentially, Any advice on maximising my chances of transferring to COE from LSA would be really helpful as an external transfer to LSA. I’d love to hear from any external transfers on how they went about the application and credit situation.

OSU is in second with 21 territories, Wisconsin and Georgia Tech are tied for 3rd with 17 territories. At this point it's pretty much a head to head battle with OSU for the win. Whoever has the most territories at 11:01PM tonight is declared the winner. 

We **NEED** to maximize our player count to increase our odds of winning tonight. If you haven't played yet, **please** consider taking the 30 seconds it takes to log a move for the first time. **Instructions are below for new players**. If you have played before, then we urge you to return just one more time for this final roll.

To play, follow these simple steps:

*     Connect your Reddit account to collegefootballrisk.com and choose Michigan as your team
*     Go to michigancfbrisk.com to get orders that are part of our team strategy determined daily by our mods and players on our vetted discord 
*     Follow the link back to collegefootballrisk.com and input your orders in the actions menu at the bottom of the page


Here's how College Football Risk works: Each day, players input an ""action"" on behalf of their team to defend a territory their team currently holds, or attack one their team borders. It takes just one click to input the action, and it can be changed throughout the day. At 11 pm EDT, all the actions are finalized and put at the mercy of the random number generator to see which team wins a territory based on the odds accumulated by the number of players inputting moves (and weighted by player stars accumulated throughout gameplay).",1589210222,15,0

Non-Honors roommate for Honors housing,"I'll be attending Michigan this fall, and am enrolled in the honors program. I'd prefer the South Quad Honors housing because of its location and recent renovations. 

However, I have a friend I'd like to room with who is in LSA but not in the Honors program. If I listed him as a roommate and opted for honors housing, is there a greater chance that both of us could be assigned to dorm in South Quad than if we were both not in the honors program? And if so, what's the likelihood of that happening?

Appreciate any responses, thanks!",1589160395,1,0

transfer chanceme,"Hi everyone! I’m applying to Michigan engineering as a fall 2020 transfer from Purdue University. I applied to UM engineering as a senior (in state) and was waitlisted (i don’t know if that’s relevant) and I have a 3.1 at Purdue. Another thing is that I’m a freshman by credit, but with the way my schedule here worked out + my community college credits I have enough credit to apply as a junior for the fall, but I obviously don’t have much graded work to present in the prerequisites.

Transfer Course Question for Economics Major? (MSU-UMich),"Hello! I'm plotting out my courses for MSU's Fall 2020 semester, but I'd like to apply for Umich's Winter 2021.

I'm looking at Umich's requirements for Econ majors, and I'm a little confused. MSU has a course that transfers as ""401X,"" but Umich wants ""401."" 

Also, in regards to Statistics, MSU has a required course that transfers as ""101X,"" but Umich wants ""250,"" which actually translates to a more basic course in MSU's lingo. What's up with this?

Oh, and does anybody know what's up with AP Macro/Micro? The transfer website says Umich won't allow you to bypass their beginner Macro/Micro course even if you've hit the required AP score.

Thanks in advance

College Decision Help,"College Decision Question

Hey everyone,

I have a pretty tough choice, and I wanted to hear your opinions on what I should do.

I got admitted to pre-business, and I’m currently on the waitlist for the business school at UW-Madison.

I got admitted to LSA at the University of Michigan and I’m waiting on the Ross school of business.

I live in Wisconsin, and the cost of Michigan would be $14,000 a year, and UW-Madison would be completely free (I had a FAFSA EFC of 0). I want to major in Finance ideally.

I know Michigan is generally regarded as a better school but I don’t know if it’s worth $14,000 more per year, because free is pretty hard to beat. All of my friends are also going to UW-Madison. It is also really close to home. Although at Michigan, I feel like I would have better job opportunities but way more debt.

"COVID-19 update from Student Life: ""There are several confirmed cases within our community, dozens of others remain under evaluation, and many others have been placed in quarantine as a result of exposure. And these numbers are growing daily.""","Full text below:

----

Dear Students,

**For those of you who still remain on campus, especially in residence halls, you need to return to your permanent residence, if that is an option for you.** New developments and guidance in the COVID-19 pandemic make it clear that now is the time to return home if you can.

To diminish ongoing transmission of this dangerous infection, we need to decrease the density of people on our campus, in our residence halls and in group living circumstances off-campus. We thank those of you who have taken the action of leaving campus to help us reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the U-M community.

There are several confirmed cases within our community, dozens of others remain under evaluation, and many others have been placed in quarantine as a result of exposure. And these numbers are growing daily.

We continue to coordinate with public health officials. It’s clear that the virus is continuing to spread and threatens to overwhelm health systems, putting those who are most vulnerable at risk. Practicing social-distancing is paramount to reduce the spread of COVID-19. For those who have the choice, we need you to go home. Those who go home will be helping those who need to stay by reducing the density on our campus.

For those students who must stay, we are sensitive to your needs. If you haven’t already, please complete this survey. We need this information so Student Life knows who needs to stay, can follow up with you, and work with you to make sure your needs are met.

[COMPLETE THE SURVEY](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPk5LqYRyjnt3wivkDKKEZW5yynqEg4DV3HRQ7knXcGaRuHA/viewform)

It is abundantly clear that life in our communities in the weeks or months ahead will be vastly different from what we may have grown accustomed to. Today’s executive order by Governor Gretchen Whitmer spells out the latest round of changes we must face. The order includes:

* Closing all restaurants, food courts and coffeehouses for on-premises consumption. Drive-thru and carryout still available.
* Closing all bars and other places offering alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption.
* Closing all theaters, cinemas, and indoor and outdoor performance venues.
* Closing all libraries and museums.
* Closing all gymnasiums, fitness centers and recreation centers. 

In response to the governor’s executive order -- and following the recommendations of university health professionals -- the University of Michigan is:

* Suspending dining-in service at all campus dining facilities. Boxed take-out meals will continue to be served during specific hours.
* Closing all libraries and museums. Online access will continue.
* Closing all recreation and fitness facilities and canceling recreational sports. 

For students who need to stay on campus, the University Health Service will remain open, as will our essential dining and housing services, though operations are being modified. Students living locally off campus can also [contact the Dean of Students office for assistance.](https://deanofstudents.umich.edu/)

We again urge all students, living on- or off-campus, to limit interactions to every degree possible in groups and confined spaces. We need you to help us prevent the spread of COVID-19 – and protect the most vulnerable members of our community.

COVID-19 is most commonly spread by close contact with others. This is a virus that moves person-to-person. Some people with COVID-19 can transmit the virus even though they don’t feel sick. This puts those who are older or have chronic medical conditions at risk. Some of these people may be your friends or loved ones.

No matter your age or travel history, [we all share the responsibility for flattening the curve.](https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/wellness-prevention/flattening-curve-for-covid-19-what-does-it-mean-and-how-can-you-help)

**Health and safety measures everyone should take**

We urge everyone, wherever you live, to practice the everyday prevention measures you can take to reduce the spread of illness no matter where you are:

* Stay home when you are sick.
* Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
* Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
* Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
* Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
* Consider alternatives to shaking hands. State health officials are now also discouraging “elbow bumps.” 
* Unless you are sick with cough, sneezing and fever, it is not advised to wear a mask.

Thank you for helping us minimize the spread of COVID-19 to all.

These are difficult times and we are in this together. The safety of our students is our top priority and we appreciate your cooperation as we make these difficult decisions together in the best interest of our community.

"Financial concerns amidst covid19, are any financial aid sources still available?","Long story short, my dad's job is asking him to take a 1 year 100% pay cut to cover coronavirus-related losses so the non-profit he works at doesn't go under, which means my family just lost the vast majority of our income.

Is it too late to seek financial aid for the semester? Any grants or loans that I can get from the university or elsewhere? It's too late to drop classes for this semester and get a refund and we need that money in other places.

Terrified of upcoming 203 midterm,"Hello,

I wanted to give a distress signal and ask for some general advice towards the EECS 203 tests. 

Background info on me: Ive never really had to study in order to get good grades in all of my classes up until EECS203. I seriously bombed the first midterm, and now I’m quite anxious of failing the class and it is impacting my daily hw performance.

I thought I’d ask, how can I pass a 203 midterm if I know literally nothing about what’s going on in the class right now? Luckily the test got pushed back so I get more time to prepare, but what do I need to start doing in order to understanding the class, the material, and getting comfortable enough with said material in order to pass an exam?

Drop Deadline Extended For LSA Students,"Fron the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Education and Student Academic Affairs

Dear LSA Students,

The college recognizes that adapting to online teaching and learning for the rest of the term may be challenging. To give you some time to get used to online instruction and potential changes to assignments and grading, we are extending the late drop deadline by two weeks. **You will have until 11:59 p.m. on Friday, April 3, 2020, to submit a late drop request in Wolverine Access.** Keep in mind that although it’s possible to submit requests in the evening, there will be no tech support available then, so it’s always best to do this before 5:00 p.m. if it’s on the last day.

If you’re contemplating a drop, be sure to get your instructor’s input by email, phone, or virtual chat. If you’d like to discuss it with your academic advisor, you can contact your advising office to schedule a phone appointment via MyAdvising. Virtual appointments may also be available.

My primary concern now is what am I to do if a travel ban is put into effect and if this is a likely occurrence to happen. I'm from Massachusetts, so travel-bans related to snowfall and storms are no stranger to me, generally, this would be associated with being pulled over and told to go home immediately if you were caught in the dead of an extreme snowstorm, but this almost never happens. However, a lot of the people close to me are now concerned that I might not be able to make it home in a few weeks, for example, because a travel ban would be put upon the US or Michigan or Massachusetts that forbids me from traveling.

Full Tuition at MSU (not including housing) versus U of M for a prospective pre-med student,"I got accepted into both MSU and U of M, and I currently have difficulty deciding where I should go for my undergraduate studies. Originally I was all for going to U of M, but after participating in the  Alumni Distinguished Scholarship competition and being awarded a full-tuition scholarship and a PA (Professorial Assistanceship) from MSU, I began debating my options. For U of M, I would only be paying tuition and other academic expenses as I will living at home with my parents (I live in Ann Arbor, there is literally no point for me to spend thousands of extra dollars on university housing). I received no financial aid from U of M (except for the insignificant $1500/year regents merit scholarship), however. At State, I will only be paying housing (unless I choose to make the one hour drive twice daily to the campus) and meals. I'm planning on majoring in cellular and molecular biology  if I go to U of M (maybe transferring to biomedical engineering later) and biochemistry if I go to State. What do you guys believe will be the best choice for me?

COVID-19 Clarification: Is the virus airborne?,"I've seen some confusion on this sub and on the internet in general, relating to whether SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19/Coronavirus is an airborne virus. The short answer is, no, at least not in the way you might think. 

A lot of people have been under the impression it is airborne due to some articles floating around such as [this one](https://www.livescience.com/how-long-coronavirus-last-surfaces.html) from LiveScience, and reprinted by various other sources, stating that ""the virus can remain viable in the air for up to 3 hours"". This information (and the vast majority of all other statistics regarding how long the virus remains on surface) was taken from [this study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf), a pre-print that is awaiting peer review before print in the New England Journal of Medicine. In this study, they found: 

&gt;that viable virus 36 could be detected in aerosols up to 3 hours post aerosolization

Okay, great. So what does aerosolization mean? Basically, when something is turned into a substance that can be carried into and remain in the air. What many websites reporting thee three-hour timeframe are not explaining, is that this aerosolization was *not* occurring naturally. This aerosolization ""were linked to aerosol-generating medical procedures"", such as bronchoscopy or intubation. This is why negative pressure (airborne isolation) rooms are needed to treat people with severe cases of the virus. Yet, these aerosol particles do not occur normally and do not occur when someone coughs or sneezes. [Here](https://twitter.com/angie_rasmussen/status/1237858406343397383), is an excellent thread from Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia, explaining this.

When someone coughs or sneezes, these particles are referred to as ""droplets"" not ""aerosols"". So, if someone coughs or sneezes on you, sure, you can catch the virus. However, someone coughing or sneezing will not result in the virus staying in the air for three hours. [Here](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1236037605101314053), is clarification from Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the WHO, stating that it's indeed ""not airborne"". 

This virus is very serious and people need to take proper precautions in order to limit their exposure and spread of the virus. However, it is also important to know the facts of the virus. If you walk into a room where someone coughed two hours ago, you will not catch the virus from simply breathing. If someone coughs on you, that's another story. Hopefully, this was somewhat informative and gives some peace of mind regarding how it spreads. Stay safe out there.",1584218527,1,0

Hey, everyone, this is the post of a long time social media lurker who almost never posts anything (majoring in Communications and Digital Studies) and other places who thinks it would be good for people's morale if with some of their new-found time as social distancing practices continue to maybe get a student discord for either just UofM or between colleges (perhaps even Ohio State because this is very serious) for socializing about things going during the objectively scary and uncertain time of the Coronavirus. While I am not personally immunocompromised when I was 4 I got the flu and pneumonia at the same time very bad and even though I wasn't hospitalized, I remember scary bits and pieces of being ""wtf is going on with my body"" levels of sick and despite usually being a bit of a cynical shit about the world I feel very clear and calm rn (part of me has really prepared for something like this since I was a child) and despite the looming fear I think undergrad students across the country need to make friendships in spite of the Coronavirus, both in social terms and in terms of solution collaboration as much as possible. Pandemics are fucking scary but as someone who has until right before the Virus for personal reasons been a shut-in (to my own determine) we need to talk to about these issues with each other and make interpersonal connections via the internet now more than ever since the beginning of proper social media or at the very least find a new network of people to play videogames with while we wait it out.",1584203585,1,0

2. YouTube a Zumba Class and dance it out.
3. Get a headset and find an online gaming community 
4. Paint, draw, craft
5. FaceTime a friend, put on a movie, watch it together.
6. Vitamin C and Vodka. Make a Quaratini and call a friend you haven’t spoken to in forever. Have a good long chat and digital cocktail hour.
7. Watch GOODEATS, experiment with cooking a new dish with your roommates - be extra careful about hygiene!",1584182455,1,0

Ann Arbor paramedic here to talk about Coronavirus,"[proof](https://imgur.com/a/fRsYrTU)

I’m an actively employed paramedic with Huron Valley Ambulance, the service that provides the 911 response for Washtenaw county, as well as bits and pieces of several surrounding counties.  I’ve almost certainly transported several of you after you’ve been overbeveraged at our highly esteemed frat parties. 

I’m bored on shift and figured I’d post on here and see if I can answer any questions and try and defuse some of the tension/early panic.  AMA

FAQs:

-	Yes, the “HAZMAT” suits you’ve been seeing are normal protocol during situations like this.  We’re currently required to wear masks and face shields any time a patient has any respiratory symptoms, no matter how minor, and regardless of travel or exposure.  Considering the more sensitive among you probably have seasonal allergies acting up from the recent sudden Michigan heat wave and snow melt, that’s going to be a lot of patients.


-	We’re required to add the gowns if the patient also has traveled outside the state of Michigan, been exposed to anyone who has traveled outside the state of Michigan, or been exposed to someone confirmed to have the virus.  That’s also a lot of people, the vast majority of which will not have the virus.


-	So far there have been no confirmed cases originating from Ann Arbor, to my knowledge.  There have been Washtenaw county cases, but none from the UM campus, unless it’s happened recently enough that we haven’t been made aware yet i.e. last 18 hours or so.


-	If you’re a young healthy adult, you have very little to worry about in terms of your prognosis if infected.  Your biggest concern should be not spreading it to vulnerable populations, in other words, immunocompromised people, elderly people, or people with lung or heart conditions.  Don’t go visit your grandparents for a while.  If you are part of a vulnerable population, pray.  (/s.  Just take extra precautions and be cautious)


-	Stop with the fucking toilet paper.  It’s a viral pneumonia.  It’s not going to make you shit uncontrollably or give you diarrhea.  I’m running low on toilet paper myself and I can’t find any.",1584147899,1,0

Club Sports dropping boxing and taekwondo teams—unacceptable! Please help support these teams.,"Join me in signing their change.org petitions and supporting the teams via the following links:

* [Boxing](https://www.change.org/p/university-of-michigan-recreational-sports-keep-boxing-on-university-of-michigan-s-campus)
* [Taekwondo](https://www.change.org/p/university-of-michigan-office-of-risk-management-keep-taekwondo-at-u-of-m)

I'm an alum and former leader of another club sport team, and hold my participation in that team dearly. It was the foundation of my collegiate experience, the basis of my social group, and gave me opportunities for competition, leadership, teaching, and even research. For those who participate in club sports, their team is a fundamental part of their life at Michigan. I'm not close with any members of either team, but we shared space with boxing and they were great on all levels. I'm sure the same can be said of the taekwondo team. Not to mention, these teams have won many national championships and are highly successful in competition.

Anyone can join these teams, and the funding received from the school is small relative to their operating budgets. They are a net positive for the Michigan community. The main benefits club sports receive over other student organizations are access to athletic venues for practices and use of the block M.

Club Sports called a meeting with these teams on March 11 (apparently the same day it was announced that the school would move to remote instruction) and informed them that they would be getting axed due to analysis by the Office of Risk Management. The teams were never consulted by Risk Management, and the teams' own stats on injuries were ignored. If Risk Management wants to talk safety, then allow these clubs to speak for themselves, or work with them to improve safety. The school sponsors varsity football and hockey, but draws the line here? What other sports will be under attack next?

The teams have been denied the chance to extend this decision. The teams have until May 1 to clear out their spaces despite the pandemic and stay-at-home orders.

The heartless, unaccommodating, and anti-student behavior form both departments was within my experiences as a leader of a team. It feels that these departments think team leaders and members exist to serve them, while in reality, the administration exists to serve the students!

Again, please join me in supporting these teams. Don't let your peers be deprived of the opportunity to participate in their beloved sports.

1) Water Deposit

Is this a normal thing? My parents have never heard of it. I guess we pay Ann Arbor $1176 to turn the water on, and as long as we pay our bills we get it back when we move out... has anyone done this?

&amp;#x200B;

2) Total Gas/Electric Cost

As you can see in the link above, electric is projected to cost roughly $230-$330 a month, and gas is $96. I understand that the house is on the larger side, and it is rather old, but these numbers still seem high. I am interested to hear what other people in similar circumstances are paying.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Electric ""Budget Plan?"" 

Our landlord has informed us that we have two options, the option to pay as you go for electricity or the option for DTE to average our monthly usage and pay a flat rate based on that average, AKA the ""Budget Plan"". She seemed insistent that budget plan was more common and would save us money, but again my parents have never heard of this.

I'm an international transfer LSA admit that's probably gonna go there for Fall 2020. (if the corona virus settles). 

I'm planning on doing a cross campus transfer from LSA to COE if I plan to go to the U of M so, I have to take pre reqs there and get atleast C's and a 2.5 gpa. I've read that the transfer process is relatively easy but are the pre reqs hard like weeder class?

Sorry if this question have been asked before. Thank you.",1585819622,1,0
Describe UMich to an accepted transfer student who has never visited the campus,"Hi! I’m an international transfer student who was admitted to LSA starting this Fall 2020. With the COVID-19 situation, I will not be able to visit UMich at all before the tuition deposit deadline. I’ve never been to Michigan as well. 

1. How would you describe the overall vibe of UMich to a newly admitted student, whether it be academics, community (students, professors, advisors), transfer student experiences, pre-med resources, employer reputation, etc.? 
2. What do you love or hate the most about UMich? 
3. For someone who has never been to Michigan and will have to be very far from her home country, how easy is it to adjust?

Any advice will be appreciated, as this might be the closest option I have to experiencing what UMich is like before I commit. 

Thank you so much! Hope you are all doing well.",1585812305,1,0

Should I go to UofM?,"I love UofM and I really wanted to attend, so I was ecstatic when I received my acceptance letter. With my situation, however, I don’t think I’ll be receiving any financial aid and I’ll probably be paying in-state full price. May 1st is coming and I haven’t decided where I want to go. Here are my 3 options:

1. I could go to UofM and pay 30 k ~ a year, racking up some lovely, hefty, student debt. But I like the spirit of UofM and the quality of education, and I think I would be happy if I attended. 

1. I could go to Grand Valley State University under a 10k/year scholarship but stay at home (since it’s 20 minutes from my house) and save 15 k in dorm and meal payments. The financial aspect is appealing here but I don’t know if I want to miss out on dorm life. 

2. I could go to Central Michigan University under a 12k/ year scholarship, leaving only 13 k that I would have to pay every year. This is a good value but I don’t know if the education is comparable enough to UofM to be worth it. 

For context, I plan to major in International/Global Studies and minor in Spanish.

What would you do/ recommend?? Thank you so much :)",1585795942,1,0

I've been accepted into the RC. I'm really exciting since I love learning foreign languages and plan to major in something related to linguistics/languages.

I'm totally cool with that, but as a more moderate democrat (think Pete-Buttigieg-type) will I have any issues with feeling excluded?

I plan to send an email to admissions to thank them for the acceptance but also to let them know admission to Ross is my first choice and would result in me matriculating 100%. Are there more details I should include in this? (like updates on my application) Also, where is the best place for this. Should it be to RossUndergrad@umich.edu or to my regional admissions rep?

How will my grades at EMU affect my chances of being accepted as a transfer student Winter 2021?,"I went through a lot of hospitalizations/medical issues my first few years of school. I had a 3.8 GPA in high school, a 29 on the act, and accepted a full ride to eastern in 2015. I ended up having the s scholarship taken away due to grades / dropping out, but I managed to get back to good academic standing before I officially left the school. 

A few classes at Schoolcraft/WCC (both A's). About 2 years ago, I took a class at WCC that I ended having to drop after the deadline again, so I failed the class. 

Last semester I got a 4.0 (""Dean's High Honor Roll""!) during my first FULL-time semester back, and I'm hoping to do the same this semester as well. That will put my gpa at around a 3.8. 

I've been working full time since I graduated high school, and have documented my medical issues with the school. I am 22, and I've funded my education/housed myself since graduating high school. I am taking some"" difficult"" classes this semester and next semester (calc 2 etc.), and I'm just praying that my good grades at WCC wont be overshadowed by the first few years of college i took when I didnt have the resources I have now.
