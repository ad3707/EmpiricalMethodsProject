I don‚Äôt know why, but since we‚Äôve gotten back from break things have gotten worse. his backhanded comments and judgemental presence has almost gotten intolerable and have made me uncomfortable in a space I sleep, eat, and should feel completely at home.

just some of things he‚Äôs done: asked me to illegally buy me alcohol when he knows I don‚Äôt drink; has eaten an entire jar of peanut butter I bought without asking, and even moved it from the place I usually put it; has consistently made passive aggressive/backhanded comments about my major, implying that he works harder bc he‚Äôs in STEM and I don‚Äôt bc I‚Äôm in a visual arts major; has said the N word when he isn‚Äôt in any way part of the black community; has made passive aggressive/backhanded comments about my diet and my body; does not bother to bathe or even make an effort to mask the smell he radiates when he returns from the gym in the middle of the night.

Possible case of cheating,"Hey,  I just wanna know if this has happened to someone before. 

I just got an email from my CS professor that he has reasons to believe that I have cheated on the programming assignment. I literally wrote the entire thing on my own and I don't know why he thinks it's cheated. 
I did use some basic 'how to read a file' functions from stack overflow and couldn't submit the README file with references because the deadline had passed and the portal closed with half my files in it :(
I am guessing that's probably why the engine might have caught a similarity. Other than that, I don't see any possible reason why it would be considered cheating.

I need to know if this was a fever dream,"Ok this is going to sound like a shitpost but I swear on my mothers grave it‚Äôs not. I need to know if anyone reading this was also on this bus because i need to commiserate with someone! 

About 2 years ago, or maybe even towards the beginning of last school year, I was in a huge hurry to get downtown from campus in time for a doctors appointment. Finally a bus pulls up, the display was broken but a paper sign in the window said Route 19. And...as the drivers opened the door, everyone inside started chanting ‚ÄúRoute 19! Route 19!‚Äù. Almost everyone was laughing and chanting this but I was like ok maybe it‚Äôs a club or frat or something and they were being goofy?? 

Then we got to the next bus stop...and the driver says something like ‚ÄúReady?‚Äù and everyone starts doing it again! And since this bus stop had so many new people get on, as they walked in he explained that it was his very last route before retiring after driving busses for like 30 something years!!  And bonus: he was going wherever the fuck we asked him to go. Which was fantastic for me because I was already about to be late for my appointment üò© I don‚Äôt think anyone asked to go anywhere outlandish but I think we ended up stopping in some random neighborhood and then also drove all the way down by the boardwalk roller coaster instead of turning at the driving circle by the pier. 

Anyway, I need to know if anyone else was also on this bus!!",1580023079,1,0

I‚Äôve made treats like this in the past back home and always received positive feedback, but I don‚Äôt wanna make them if people realistically won‚Äôt buy them here!

You‚Äôve definitely heard the price angle, so I won‚Äôt go into that (though please look at the prices dear lord), but I want to talk about the quality of education. 

UCs are really great for networking with professors and grad students, we have some amazing thinkers and researchers on campus. It‚Äôs where you can do real research and work in your academic field. That‚Äôs why people should come here. 

If you don‚Äôt know your academic field yet, you won‚Äôt benefit from all those things. 

I‚Äôm a cog sci major, education minor, I went to community college for 4 years and I‚Äôm set to graduate this spring with a 3.9 gpa. 

I didn‚Äôt have a single class in CC that had more than 30-40 people. You know what that means? One on one attention from your professors all the dang time. My professors knew my name and actually graded and gave intense feedback to all of my papers, and were really able to push me as an individual. All of my hardest and best classes were at CC. For so cheap I could pay for them myself working part time at Panera.


At CC I was able to study abroad in Barcelona for a semester- the sticker price was only 10k including tuition.  That‚Äôs kind of about price, but also about how there are still great opportunities at community college. 


Also, they never tell you, but when you transfer from a community college your GPA is wiped clean and all your sins are forgiven. You can fail your world literature class in cc because you dropped the class after arguing with your professor for 20 minutes about Joseph Conrad. IT DOESN‚ÄôT MATTER. In CC My GPA was like, 3.2 cause I was 18 and fucked around (and argued with professors) 

I get good grades now cause I have a goal and a vision and a life plan, ya know? I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt come at 18.

BME 110 and BME 130 were just added to class search yesterday, as was the expansion of BME 163.

BME 110 and BME 130 are suitable for anyone in the life sciences who has had a genetics course (BME 110 will accept a biochem course as prereq instead).

BME 163 has BME 160 as a prereq, but students with strong Python programming experience can probably convince Chris Vollmers to give them a permission code to add.  BME 163 is changing from being a 5-unit course to being a 3-unit course, but I don't know whether that will take effect with this offering of BME 163 or the next one (the change was just approved by CCI, so could take effect immediately).

The capacity for BME 160 (Research programming in the life sciences) was also increased, but the increase was swallowed up almost immediately and there is again a waitlist.  Too bad, because that course is the solidest intro to Python on campus (much faster paced than CSE 20).

Emergency notification: Confirmed case of COVID-19 at UCSC,"March 27, 2020


To: UC Santa Cruz Community

From: Chancellor Cynthia Larive¬†

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services Sarah Latham

Subject: Emergency notification: Confirmed case of COVID-19 at UCSC	


We write to share that the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency confirmed today that a student member of the UC Santa Cruz community has tested positive for COVID-19. The student lives off campus and has been self-isolating since being tested. The student was last on campus March 16 and is doing well.¬†


We are coordinating closely with local public health officials and following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) guidance in responding to this case. Student Health Services and Office of Emergency Services personnel are working with public health officials to determine whether there are members of the campus community who may have had significant exposure to this individual and who may subsequently have an increased risk of developing COVID-19. Public health officials will determine specific actions that may be needed, such as self-quarantine.¬†


The health and well-being of our campus community is our top priority. The campus is ensuring that this student is getting the care and support that they need. Student Health Services and Office of Emergency Services personnel continue to proactively identify individuals with potential COVID-19 exposure and request that they self-quarantine to protect our community.¬†


Students, faculty, and staff should stay home and call their healthcare provider if they have symptoms of respiratory illness, especially fever and cough. The CDC‚Äôs coronavirus self-checker is a good tool to help you determine what next steps should be taken.¬†

What students should do

Students, whether on campus, off campus in Santa Cruz, or at their permanent residence, can call the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 for instructions on self-care or to make a telehealth or in-person appointment. Information about after-hours care for students is available online. Acutely ill students who are not in Santa Cruz should seek medical care from a healthcare provider in their area.


If you are a student who received care off-campus and have tested positive, or if you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive, please notify the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 so that we can help coordinate your care and support the health of our campus community.

What employees should do

Employees should seek medical care through their regular healthcare providers. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone who tested positive, please email your supervisor and the Office of Emergency Services (Lisa Ehret, director) at oes@ucsc.edu.

Where you can find updates and additional information

The COVID-19 situation is dynamic, which means guidance from public health officials and the CDC changes frequently. The COVID-19 campus website is being updated regularly with the latest information, including the number of confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County and our campus community. Notification about additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 within our campus community will be based on guidance from public health officials.


We appreciate everyone‚Äôs cooperation and patience during this challenging time.¬†

Steps to stay healthy¬†

The CDC provides the following guidance on how to protect yourself:¬†

Clean your hands often:

Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.¬†

Avoid close contact with others:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Put distance between yourself and other people (at least 6 feet).

Take steps to protect others:

Stay home, except for essential business/services as covered in the state‚Äôs stay-at-home order.

Cover coughs and sneezes:

Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.

Throw used tissues in the trash.

Immediately clean your hands.

Wear a facemask if you are sick and around other people.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.¬†",1585344552,1,0

Free Focusmate Account for UCSC Students during Pandemic,"In light of the Covid19 pandemic Focusmate, a **virtual coworking and accountability service**, has agreed to give UC Santa Cruz affiliates unlimited sessions free of charge (normally it's $5 a month, but I asked the founder to do us a favor). Sign up using your UCSC Email or use this link: [www.focusmate.com/signup/UCSantaCruz](http://www.focusmate.com/signup/UCSantaCruz)   


Please share this with your classmates, friends, &amp; teachers! 

  
**How it works:**¬†  
First you commit to a 50 minute time slot, and you are matched with a focusmate. When the time comes you show up on time, briefly check in with your partner **over video chat**, leave your video on while you work quietly in tandem, and then briefly check in at the end to see how the session went.¬†  
**Why Use it**¬†  
I personally find focusmate useful for studying year round, but I think it will be critical for doing well on online courses next quarter.¬†¬†

* Get the social accountability of a study buddy while maintaining safe distances¬†
* Keep a schedule and maintain momentum in these Weird Times
* Hold yourself accountable to study at specific times¬†
* Use social pressure to get up in the morning¬†
* Have the option to match with UCSC affiliates¬†by only selecting ""University California¬†Santa Cruz"" under groups. (though this will only be useful if enough of us sign up for time slots)¬†

**Focusmate** **Community Standards**  
Here are the guidelines that Focusmate has for their sessions.¬†I will...  


* Spend 10-30 seconds describing the tasks I‚Äôll work on during the session
* Ask if my partner prefers my mic muted or unmuted
* Work on the tasks I‚Äôve declared, updating my partner via text chat as I go
* Check in verbally with my partner at the end to discuss how it went, and celebrate!

I won't...¬†

* Start a conversation during the session
* Socialize with others around me
* Get up and disappear without letting my partner know why and for how long
* Leave early, or without checking in verbally with my partner
* Take screenshots or recordings of my session

If this sounds like it'd be something useful, Go to[ this link ](https://www.focusmate.com/signup/UCSantaCruz)or sign up with your UCSC email!!¬†

Why you should be scared,"In about two weeks time our healthcare system will be completely full. There will be more critically ill patients then there are ventilators and physicians to help them. People will die because they are sick at the wrong time. Look at the mortality rate in Italy -- this is a result of overburdening the healthcare system. If you want to be careless and get sick, fine, you have a 5-20% chance to enter critical condition and require hospitalization. Since you are young, you will have high priority and likely get treatment. However, they will be kicking a grandmother off her ventilator to do that for you.

I‚Äôm seeing on social media these dumbass college or high school kids partying after they find out that school was ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù which literally ruins the whole point of the school being cancelled to promote social distance.

It‚Äôs making me so pissed. I have grandparents who are vulnerable and seeing all these people being so ignorant and careless pisses me off. I hope that cities or entire states go on lockdown cuz if that‚Äôs what it takes to prevent the rapid spread of the illness then so be it.

Difficult changing majors from Sociology to Cognitive Science for a incoming transfer student?,"Hey guys, 

I'm thinking about changing my major from Sociology to Cognitive Science, but couldn't find too much information regarding that specific change. I have taken most of the classes needed (except two classes) to declare for the major.

I emailed counseling and this is what they said:

&gt;Congratulations on your admissions to UC Santa Cruz! As Cognitive  Science was a screening major, you cannot petition to change your major  at this time. If you enroll at UC Santa Cruz, you can petition with the Psychology Department who oversees Cog Sci in the¬†fall quarter to change  your major and it would be up to their discretion. One key aspect that  they will consider is if the major preparation courses are completed.  And even you have them completed, there is no guarantee they will  approve your petition. Please read the Transfer Information and Policy  from this link,¬†[https://catalog.ucsc.edu/Current/General-Catalog/Academic-Units/Social-Sciences-Division/Psychology/Undergraduate-Program/Cognitive-Science-B-S](https://catalog.ucsc.edu/Current/General-Catalog/Academic-Units/Social-Sciences-Division/Psychology/Undergraduate-Program/Cognitive-Science-B-S),¬†as it provides the most up to date major reparation requirement to see if you will meet the requirement by fall 2020.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;I  would also reach out to the Psychology Department now to see how they  have handled transfer student who want to change into their major. Their  contact information is provided at the bottom of this website,¬†[https://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/majors/cognitive](https://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/majors/cognitive).

Masters Program in Computer Science,"Hi!

I was recently admitted to the Computer Science masters program here and was having a hard time figuring out whether or not this program was right for me. A bit of background, about myself, I graduated with a B.S. in Biology and decided to change my life path, so I will this year complete my A.S. in CS and want to get a M.S. in CS to better get knowledge to work in the CS field. I don't have a ton of experience just yet in this field due to my recency of switching topics, so I am really looking for a program that will both give both a good education and help get me experience in the field.

I have been admitted to several other schools, including a few in Denver and USC  (as my top contenders with here). I was mainly wondering if anyone within the MS CS program had any advice or thoughts on the program itself that could help give me a better picture of where I should go to grad school?

Will they rescind my acceptance?,"Hey y'all,

I'm currently attending an LACCD college and am in a bit of a tight spot. I'm taking a class, Discrete Structures, and am majoring in Computer Science (Game Development). The class itself is a major requirement. Though I've received my acceptance, I'm now concerned that dropping this class will cause them to rescind me despite it being the only major requirement I'll be missing.

Though I don't want to drop the class it's caused me severe mental strain-- panic and anxiety attacks. The professor has not taught us anything and has only communicated with us ONCE after we made the online transition. We have our midterm in early May that I doubt I'll be passing-- I don't have the time to sit down and read through the text, unfortunately, because of my other classes.

My question, after all that rambling, is: How will my dropping of this class affect my acceptance? I know dropping it will leave an EW on my transcript and I don't want to drop a class I desperately need, but the mental strain is killing me and I'm having trouble deciding if it's worth it.

UC Santa Cruz vs Cal State LA Computer Science,"Hi there,  


I am computer science transfer student choosing between Cal State LA and UC Santa Cruz.   


I'm not interested in academia. I am interested in going to the industry as soon as I finish undergrad. I know that Cal States will be more hands on while UC's are focused on theory.

UCSC vs CU Boulder CS Transfer Fall 2020,"Hi all,

I recently got accepted to UCSC as a Computer Science transfer from Northern California for Fall 2020 (Yay!) However, right now I'm trying to decide between my two top choice right now which is UC Santa Cruz and CU Boulder. I don't really expect anyone here to know too much about CU Boulder but I'd love to hear about the CS department at UCSC and genuine feelings about majoring in CS at this school, the good, the bad, the ugly. Ive visited UCSC multiple times when some of my friends used to go there and one thing that really stood out was the amount of homeless people downtown and it didn't seem like there was very much to do. Also I was curious how the classroom/ lecture halls are for CS students.

Thanks y'all",1587427953,1,0

Where to start? (Questions for (biomolecular) engineers),"Hello everyone! 
I'm excited to be posting here as a new biomolecular engineer and bioinformatics major at UC Santa Cruz! My background is a transfer student with basically all my math, physics, (organic) chemistry, and physics all taken care of at community college. On top of this I have taken classes in Matlab, AutoCAD, solid works, and additional classes to full-fill a certificate of achievement in computer architecture; basically some intermediate c++ programming, assembly language, and theory on computer architecture. Where I'm getting at is:

1) what is and is not important? - math, physics, chemistry knowledge, important programming languages to know, etc.

2) where are places I can start looking for research/current research events (seminars)/lab jobs

3) are counselors at ucsc on engineering helpful? Should I even go to one? - what could I get from them versus what I can gather online?

4) what helpful services are not very known, but should be? Are there sites like this?

I'm just worried about not having a clear insight on what to do, and then the next thing I know is wasted my first year ""figuring things out.""

Just any insight will be deeply and greatly appreciated.

The petition includes four crucial provisions:

2. Expedite testing by directing UPS, Amazon, FedEx and USPS to coordinate on shipping.  
3. Improve data management by getting Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and others to consult on managing the huge flow of new data.  
4. Communicate clearly by getting the American Medical Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other medical experts to give clear guidance on who needs a test, where to get the test, and what to make of the results.

Stand up to Napolitano's threats and stand in solidarity for living wages for grad students! DOOMSDAY RALLY THIS FRIDAY 11AM AT THE QUARRY!!!,"Full transcript of the email sent out by Stefan Yong:

&gt;The doomsday clock is close to midnight. Janet Napolitano has spoken. If wildcat strikers do not submit grades and cease their strike activities by 11:59pm on Friday, February 21, over 200 graduate student workers risk being fired en masse by the UC.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;**The time to show up is now. The Undergrads for COLA Doomsday Rally and March is this Friday in the Quarry Plaza at 11am.**¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;If carried out, the consequences of this mass firing will be severe. For many strikers, it would spell the end of academic careers at UCSC. For the many international grad students on strike, this means de facto deportation from the United States. The sudden absence of hundreds of TAs from campus will drastically limit the ability of academic departments to offer classes, impairing the ability of many to graduate. Undergraduate education, especially in the Humanities, the Social Sciences, and the Arts, is likely to take a historically unprecedented hit. Contrary to the administration‚Äôs claims that they have your safety and well-being in mind, they propose sacking hundreds of graduate students‚Äîthose who most closely mentor and supervise undergraduate academic work conducted at UCSC.  
&gt;  
&gt;**This Friday, we need your solidarity and your collective strength more than ever.** Rally with us on Doomsday in the Quarry. March with us to the base of campus, where we will be joined by contingents from other rallies on campus‚ÄîFaculty for COLA, STEM for COLA, Lecturers for COLA, and the many autonomous groups of students and workers springing up daily.¬†¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Solidarity will ripple across the UC system as the strike spreads. Our rally coincides with rallies and pickets planned at UC Davis, UCLA, UC Riverside, and UC Santa Barbara.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Beyond the UC, many thousands of workers, students, professors, members of the national media, the City Council of Santa Cruz, and a U.S. presidential candidate have thrown their support behind our movement. **Which side will you be on when the clock strikes?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Undergrads for COLA! Solidarity forever!

Yong said it better than I'd ever be able to. Convince everyone to come out and support! Show the administration that we WILL NOT be stopped by threats of expulsion. We have the support of other campuses and even presidential candidate Bernie Sanders made an official tweet expressing his support for COLA. Let's do this!!!

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

Re: Academic Council Statements on the UCSC Graduate Students‚Äô Strike and Police Presence at UCSC

Dear Janet,

The Academic Council has approved the following statements concerning the graduate students‚Äô strike at UC Santa Cruz and the associated police presence in response to the strike. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have additional questions.

Statement on UCSC Graduate Students‚Äô Strike

The Academic Council of the University of California wishes to express its deep concern over the trajectory of the labor conflict at UC Santa Cruz and its hope that both sides will strive to achieve a just resolution of their differences. In a public statement, UCSC graduate students have offered, without requiring a reason, to enter the grades of any undergraduate student who requests it, which demonstrates the graduate students‚Äô strong sense of responsibility and support for the undergraduate mission of the University of California. In further achieving a resolution several principles must be acknowledged:

1) Doctoral funding and support are complex issues.

2) The success of UC‚Äôs undergraduate and graduate missions are inseparable. If graduate education is not flourishing, undergraduate education cannot flourish either.

3) Graduate students cannot be expected to fulfill either their learning or teaching responsibilities when they face significant housing and food insecurity. The University should be committed to providing adequate housing and food security in concrete ways to its doctoral students.

4) The University should refrain from punitive action against graduate students during the strike and from retaliation against them once the strike has been concluded. The preservation of high quality graduate and undergraduate programs demands no less.

With the wildcat strike having brought attention to the significant challenges facing graduate student employees, Council believes that the best way forward includes both sides working together through the collective bargaining process to address the legitimate demands of graduate students regarding food and housing insecurity.

Statement on Police Presence at UCSC

The Academic Council of the University of California is distressed over the UC administration‚Äôs deployment of an armed police presence in response to the peaceful student protest and strike at UC Santa Cruz. Numerous national journalistic accounts and personal testimonies (including in-person video recordings) from students, staff, and faculty at UCSC describe a climate of fear, violence, and hostility that has been created by militarized, riot gear-wearing police officers, including non-UC police who have little familiarity with our students or the long history of campus protest in the UC system. This police presence disturbingly echoes recent and historical examples of police force at the University of California that must not be repeated.

The Academic Council supports more than 200 faculty at UCSC who are calling on the UC and UCSC administrations to:

1) Substantially roll back the police presence at the UCSC student strike, which is addressing urgent issues of financial, food, and housing insecurity. There is no reason for 50-70 police officers to engage in shows of force against students involved in peaceful demonstration.

2) Demilitarize the police presence at UCSC, which has thus far had the effect of intimidating peacefully demonstrating students with implicit and explicit threats of violence; this armed police presence has multiple adverse effects on the teaching mission of the university, including the classroom work undertaken by graduate students, Senate faculty, and contingent faculty.

Academic Council supports the principles of debate, engagement, and collaborative/consultative problem solving in approaching the difficult issues raised by the UCSC student strike and protest. The escalated police presence on the campus does not serve the shared objective of reaching an outcome that best serves the needs of all our students and fulfills the mission of the University of California.

As noted in the Edley-Robinson report, ‚ÄúOur University is charged by the State of California with the profound responsibility of educating its sons and daughters. Its policies at every level must reflect that core educational mission. This is particularly true when it comes to protest and civil disobedience‚Äîactivities that frequently will advance the University‚Äôs educational mission by allowing students to become active, engaged, and responsible citizens, and to express cutting-edge ideas. We must view civil disobedience by protesters through the lens of the core values of our institution.‚Äù

Sincerely,

Kum-Kum Bhavnani, Chair

Unpopular Opinion: COLA protestors are wasting their time and embarrassing our school.,"I want to begin by saying that I sympathize with their cause. 
I don‚Äôt understand why undergrads are supporting the strike either. If they do get their $1,500 per month raise, it‚Äôs going to cost the university potentially millions of dollars by the end of the year. The next logical step for the university is that they increase tuition on undergrads to subsidize the COLA. Grad students don‚Äôt care because they‚Äôre graduating in less then two years anyways. 
What COLA should be doing instead is taking the protests to City Hall. They should be pushing for more renter friendly policies like rent control. It‚Äôs not the university‚Äôs fault that rent in Santa Cruz is expensive because the wages were already agreed upon and set by the other campuses. 
The media attention has made UCSC and the protestors a complete embarrassment. It makes our school look dysfunctional. We pay a lot of money to study here and we are supposed to get a quality education. The protests have hindered this transaction significantly.",1582160904,1,0

SJSU vs. UCSC for Computer Engineering,"Hello everyone, I got off the UCSC waitlist a few days ago for computer engineering, and I have until Monday to make my decision. I committed to SJSU a few weeks ago for the same major, and since I'm a local I would be staying at home. I checked my UCSC portal yesterday for financial aid, and they're giving me A LOT of grants for this year, to the point where I'd barely have to pay, if anything. 

I pretty much accepted going to SJSU, I'm cool with it, but UCSC was my top school before, and now that I got accepted there and getting a lot of aid, I'm rethinking my decision. However, I've realized that there might not be much to do around there (I go to the area fairly often), and a lot of my good friends are going to SJSU. I know the social scene at UCSC is a lot more laidback compared to SJSU, but I'm more of a mix between being really social and outgoing and laidback at times.

In terms of my major, I know UCSC has more research opportunities, but how does it compare to SJSU? I'm not sure if this matters either, but the median starting salary at SJSU is higher than UCSC which is also admittedly influencing my decision. Which school would be better for my major? In terms of social life/academics (and connections, as I know SJSU has a lot of networking where you could land good jobs/internships being in the heart of Silicon Valley) as well, which one do you guys think I should choose?

Hi yall! My name is David. I am running for SUA Vice President of Academic Affairs. Since I am the only one running for VPAA, I don't really know who I can debate during Friday's debate. I will still attend, but I want to do something more proactive. Please join me for a discussion of academic affairs related issues you are facing and tell me about where we should be doing more advocacy! If I don't have an answer for you, I will look into it and follow up with you later.

What: Discussion of academic affairs issues

When: Friday, May 15th, from 4:30-5:00pm.

Where: Zoom link TBD

I will post the zoom link on FB and Reddit after I figure out the technical settings. You can also use this form, and I will email you the link + you will be included in my follow up email after I look into your questions and concerns.

How relevant is college affiliation if not living on campus?,"Reading the colleges guide on this subreddit, it feels like most of the reccomendations assume you'll be living on campus, are under 25, or both. I'm neither, and since being 30 living in a dorm sounds like a real, true nightmare, I figured I'd rent a room somewhere in the city and commute to campus. Although, the way things are looking right now, I can't/won't need to physically move until late 2020 at the earliest.

Stevenson hosts most of the classes for my major, so it feels like it should be my primary preference. Crown and Cowell also seems like decent fits, but outside of proximity to/quality of dining halls, late night activities, and living arrangements, what else does college affiliation affect? Can you still use the resources at other colleges? Are there restrictions that come with affiliations?

Can anyone give me some perspective here?",1589518748,1,0

Would it be feasible to take courses over the summer and take a gap fall quarter?,"So this is going to be a long one, bare with me.

I was thinking about possibly taking courses over the summer at a CC since they're going to be remote regardless, but since UCSC is remote during the summer, it seems as though it would make much more sense to take classes through the UC. Now, my thing is, this seems as if it's a cheaper option than taking classes in Fall Quarter, since summer classes tend to be on the cheaper side, and Fall is very likely to be remote anyways. So pretty much the difference in this situation is cost.

What is holding me back is the idea that I may have my housing revoked because I chose to take a gap Fall quarter, though I'm not sure if that would happen if it turns out to be remote anyways. I plan on contacting housing anyways, but that's just a thought running through my head. 

Along with that, I'm thinking about the fact that I won't get any refunds since I won't be attending Fall quarter. Ideally, I would use those refunds to fill in the gap for summer tuition (which I know I would have already paid- pretty much just covering the cost). So at this point, I'm thinking about possibly attending and doing the bare minimum 12 units just so I would get the refund.

This is a lot, and I appreciate anyone responding and giving me their position, because honestly I have no idea what I should do.

i'm more on the extroverted side and i'm super talkative and overall fast paced but i'm not really into full on ragers, more toned down parties are my thing. i'm not really athletic unless it's for the sake of staying healthy cause i do regularly exercise but if someone invites me to do something like hiking i'm down. i'm also a biology major and it would be cool to have people around me that i could be like ""hey, drank a lil too much dumb bitch juice today, help"". science is definitely cool but i'm not really sure if being around people being mega into it 24/7 is for me (that's the stereotype i've heard about crown i think oops)

i'm 100% latina and have all the features but i'm just super pale so there's that but i have all the traits of a stereotypical so-cal raised mexican, i'm not really sure why i'm including this but i saw other people doo it so yeah 

i would say i am more on the dorky side but not in the gaming/anime way (only game i be on is city folk on my wii because i'm too broke for new horizons) but more-so in the fangirly i never grew out of my one direction phase way. deadass if you want the overall sum of me i'm a kpop twitter stan with a sanrio aesthetic lmao

PROSPECTIVE UCSC STUDENT ANY INSIGHT IS APPRECIATED,"Hi,
So I was just notified that I have been taken off the waitlist for this fall. Before this, I was planning on deferring my enrollment to SDSU and taking a gap year to study and intern in China where I grew up since they are opening back up, and I am lucky still to have connections there with family and friends. My declared major at SDSU is international business and I got into the Global economics program at UCSC. I know I eventually want to get a career related to international business. My economics class was also probably my favorite class in high school. Since UCSC is saying on their website that they will be accommodating deferrals, I am strongly considering making the switch. Although I am aware I shouldn‚Äôt base my decision off of this, I do prefer the location and size of this school more than SDSU. If anyone has anything to share about the Global Economics program, Chinese language program, and student life I will greatly appreciate it as I need to make a decision by the end of this week.

Fall Quarter: Online or In person,"What do you guys think is going to happen. I'm struggling so much with online classes that I'm thinking of just dropping everything. Like I have access to ta's and office hours but I have such a shitty internet connection that listening to lecture sounds like professor just has a voice modulator all the time. I know I'm just complaining about all this, but honestly I didn't sign up for online classes because I know I'd suck at them.

Professors 2 cent on fall 202,"Well, there are enough predictions by students I have seen about fall 2020 in posts. The email was crap, so i wanted professors on here to chime in on the fall 2020 situation and what they foreshadow. Do you guys see fall  learning returning to normal, or will there still be restrictions?

Withdrawing/Dropping a CSE 101? I need advice...,"So I came back from a Leave of Absence and went headfirst over the recommended classes, because I'm used to doing that. However, due to the corona virus I'm in my parents house, which has put me in a bad place, where I have fallen back into my terrible high school habits(bad time-use to purely get out of stuff, and not being able to be productive when they are awake).

So currently I can see myself failing this class purely because of the labs and my current situation of being at home. This is only because of the labs, I've been acing the tests and I do get the actual topics. I have probably lost only a maximum of 15% of my overall grade so far, but we are barely halfway. Can anyone toss me any advice, and what dropping vs withdrawing a class means? (Last withdraw date is the 8th) Will doing either of these actions take away that one allowed failed class as a CS major?",1588484283,1,0

Returning to UCSC for CS masters after a few years in industry?,"Does anyone know how to difficult it may be to get into UCSC‚Äôs CS master program after working in the tech industry for a few year (2-3)? 

As my CS senior year comes to an end, I sorta regret not getting more involved in research and some of the more niche fields of CS and software engineering. I have a general idea of what kind of specific fields within software engineering I‚Äôd like to get into in the future but it seems that most people in those roles at tech companies have PhDs or masters. My employer has an educational stipend so cost isn‚Äôt too much of a factor, and I won‚Äôt be working very far (San Jose).

With all that being said, I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôd be accepted in the CS grad program. My gpa is okay (~3.3) but I do have a few internship experiences and maybe some full time experience with tech companies over the hill may help? I‚Äôm not even sure if CS grad programs care about that type of experience. 

Are most people in the program fresh out of bachelor?   Are they mostly looking for more theory and research oriented people? Any of your thoughts on the CS grad program here are appreciated!",1588383381,1,0

Below is the ideal criteria to be eligible for the interview:

1. Being a UC Undergraduate Student (any class student)

2. Identifying with a religious group

3. Had experience of anxiety or depression and are comfortable with talking about it

If any one of these fits with you and are interested in being interviewed, please email me at Jorgeac3@uci.edu so we can set up a time that is most convenient for us both. There is no compensation of participation, but I will greatly appreciate it if you would consider participating",1588377763,1,0
