I am about to lose a scholarship what do I do ?,"The spring check for the HOPE scholarship is coming up and I am 95% sure that I am going to lose the HOPE scholarship. The cost of college is going to go up $7k for me if I lose it and that would put me in a terrible situation. I was planning on taking summer classes but now I don't know what to do. I can't even get a job/internship because of the pandemic. Anyone else that has been in my situation how did you earn enough money to afford the next semester ?


Side note, I don't think I will get financial aid from Tech. My parents make a decent amount of money(they aren't going to make much contributions to college however).",1586559081,1,0

"A Mockmuentary-style tv show is not set in your major or current job (think the Office or Parks and Rec), what is a scene that takes place?","As a fun activity, I thought we could script a few scenes from a GT mocumentary about our own majors or careers, the Office GT. For example, I majored in economics, here is how I think a scene might go:

(Cold open on G10 in the Old Civil Engineering building where all profs and some grad students are about to listen to a seminar, the powerpoint reads ""The Economics of 3-d -printed Guns: a quadruple difference model"")

Presenter (A white or Asian sweaty nerdy male in his mid-twenties): I would like to begin with the background. 3-d printing blueprints have become available online, and I wanted to look into how downloads of plans- (Gets cut off by professor in audience)

Professor Jones: I have a question about your methodology.

Presenter: That's five slides ahead. I am getting there.

Professor Jones (clearly ignoring the presenter): I was just wondering how you can use pooled data when the characteristics of the group changes over time  
Grad student Elijah (Extremely nervous and visibly sweating): How- how do you handle heteroskedasticity?

Presenter: There was none in the model.

Grad student Elijah (suddenly angry for whatever reason): I didn't ask whether there was heteroskedasticity in the model- I asked how you handled it.

Presenter: The normal way, I suppose.

Professor Smith: I am sorry. I am going to need to see the slide with the residuals.

Presenter (Jumps immediately to that slide): As you can see the residuals indicate homo-

Professor Jones: I am sorry, we are out of time for the presentation. Lets all give the presenter a round of applause. (No one claps, everyone leaves)

Cuts to Dr. Thomas in a camera interview : I actually really liked that presenter. I think we might hire him.

Cuts to presenter visibly crying in his car. Cuts to opening theme music. Title card: The GT Econ department

The plot of the episode then focuses on students prepping for an impossible microeconomics exam, the kind that seems to occur literally every single time the class is taught regardless of the teacher. One student runs a regression that predicts that most students will fail. There's a subplot involving an extremely arduous series of consulting interviews that get more and more bizarre. The students study together, and everyone is concerned about their grades. At the end of the episode it is revealed in an interview scene that the professor actually has only ever failed one student and actually mainly sees tests as a tool for himself to judge his own performance.

So I would like to see something like that. Use fake professors like I did or don't, but I find the idea intriguing.",1586554037,1,0

Just needed to share,"I could have posted this in r/offmychest but I really just want to post it in here with you guys right now if that's okay. It's kind of incoherent but...

I was talking to my dad, who is, like, one of my biggest cheerleaders and I love him so damn much. He thinks I should stay in a class I'm taking, but it's been killing me the whole semester. It would keep me from having wasted some of my HOPE hours, especially since I've dropped at least three courses within previous years, and two courses this semester, which I know is really bad. Sometimes I'm miraculously able to pass courses I was doing poorly in the entire semester, but I have a strong feeling that won't happen this time.

I struggle with a cocktail of suicidal ideation, perfectionism turned OCD, anxiety attacks, the occasional panic attack, and apathy. Yes, I'm in therapy and on medication and I'm only taking two courses (because I freaked out and, as mentioned earlier, dropped two toward the beginning of the semester), so I'm beating myself up for not being as functional as I ""should"" be with all of the help I'm getting. I even have academic accommodations and while only one of them has been helpful, I'm very grateful for it. There's only so much that can be done for one person.

I'm doing way better in my one other course. I feel like there's a lot of hope for me in that one and that therefore I can go all out with the energy I do have. I don't want my chances of doing decently in one course to go down because I'm trying to salvage the grade of another. It doesn't make sense in my head. 

Ugh.

It's like...I know I'm not that important but there's always this sense that I'm letting someone down.

I just don't know the difference between ""I'm struggling"" and ""I'm a bad student.""

I might drop and keep it a secret from my dad. Idk if I should say anything to my professor but I want to. I mean, not in too much detail of course. Just like an explanation that I've enjoyed the class and appreciate the changes that have been made to the syllabus (he was kind enough to make changes due to Corona) but that I've just been struggling all semester in general...And I usually feel detached from what's going on around me so that makes it hard to process things even in regular conversations

It's just kind of hard to be honest about mental illness. Opening up about something that is going on inside of you on a daily basis is way different from opening up about something that is caused by a specific event going on outside of you.

Where is our advocacy?,"I'd like to begin by saying it isn't only Tech's fault. From what I understand their hands are tied by USG. What I don't understand is the lack of advocation. Sure, schools like GSU have basically forgone classes and have had expections lowered. At Tech however, they really haven't. There needs to be more of a push to move to Pass/ Fail classes. We don't need to get all As like other school but there should be a system to help since so many people are feeling effects of the virus.

There are a handful of kids at Tech severely effected by Corona and for them I feel exceptionally sorry. Yet, let me tell you the more common story that comes from the kids willing to push through and except the unfortunate situation they find themselves in. My parents don't understand what it's like to be at college. They expect that I can just put my lecture on pause and help out around the house or that when lecture is over, I should be able to help. They don't understand the rigor or the time commitment of school they can easily become frustrated that I am not being an active member of the family. Meanwhile, both my parents are essential employees and I have to deal with the ever present fear of one of them bringing home the virus. I understand I'm young and would most likely be fine but it still scares me everyday.

What I feel is really missed is that at school, I feel alive. I have people around me pushing me to succeed and offer enjoyable breaks from the tough classes. I have people to talk me down in the form of friends and mental health services and at home I have a dog that eats my shoes and parents with whom I have to hide integral parts of my identity. So yes, GT may be one of the few USG schools upholding a professional standard but it comes down to tech deciding wether to advocated for this struggling minority in the system or deciding where to cut corners and help out the students. 

Getting rid of the third test and moving it's weight to the final is not helpful. It just means my final is 40% of my grade and determines if I pass. I love Tech and believe we all are some of the best of the best out there. It's time we were treated like it. Across majors, averages are going down and if administration is just going to sit back and ignore that then so be it. Although my puppy barking throughout all my exams is not the only reason I'm doing poorly, the instutue should really consider the distractions faced by students in a home environment and the mental stress of overbearing parental figures.",1586475375,1,0

An Open Letter to the Board of Regents and USG,"To Professors, the Board of Regents, USG, and anyone who will listen and help us: 

&amp;#x200B;

We need the pass/fail option more than anything right now. Reaching higher should not be an option, mercy and understanding should be the standard. From the international student couch surfing because your home country's borders are closed, to the poor in state student who has spotty internet service, to the well off student who is comfortably at home, we all need this, we all need to be seen as humans are affected by this pandemic.

Please be aware that your students are also human beings that don't simply exist just do schoolwork or exist to get good grades. We are human beings also being personally affected by this pandemic. Not every student has a stable, loving home environment, perfect health, or even decent internet service. We are scared as we watch people in our lives get sick and possibly die, or lost their jobs and can't afford food, or even have to continue to risk their lives as essential workers. Myself and many other students I personally know are in these positions.

We need to know that you don't care more for this class or our grades more than you care about the fact that we are also human beings. My grades are very important to me, but my health is even more important as everyone on earth stares this virus, and possibly death, in the face. Don't tell me to use schoolwork to distract myself from the state of the world. Don't assign harder tests because people may cheat. Don't give us more work because YOU are just sitting at home doing nothing and think we are all like you.

WE ARE STRUGGLING. WE ARE SCARED. I cannot speak for all the students, but I can tell you what I am concerned about, what I am stressed out about, what keeps me up at night unable to do anything but lay there and be sad.

I have concerns about my grades, as my work may dip in quality due to factors outside of my control. Home is not a good place for me to work. You constantly remind us how/what we would be doing if we were at school, but we are not that is affecting my ability to do quality work, from fear and mental health concerns regarding the pandemic, to just having internet issues and family issues being at home

I am concerned that should I get sick, professors will still expect high quality work because you all think that we are just sitting at home ""doing nothing"".

I have concerns about the world as a whole, for my country as whole, as the world changes right before my eyes and no one know what is going to happen.

I am stressed out about life right now, and school is doing nothing but stressing me out more, and it's taking a toll on my mental health.

I am not procrastinating, lazy, or ""doing nothing"". I'm just trying to survive.

An Accurate Method to Determine If/When We Get Pass/Fail,"In a comment responding to a previous post regarding P/F, u/straight-outta-dixie made an excellent point that the state of Georgia depends upon a certain number of people losing their scholarships every year for their budgeting. 

This is most likely the cause for the holdout. The only feasible way that this loss of scholarship money that is depended on each semester by the Georgia government to finance something like a pass/fail option is that enough students in public University System of Georgia using the government funded scholarships will lose them in other ways (ie: death to COVID-19) to offset costs. 

Although quite crazy, there really isn’t any other work around unless there is a huge change in fiscal behavior of Georgia’s government. However, this balancing would apply to a non-emergency annual state budget. Georgia’s government could see the increased loss of scholarships as an opportunity of liquidity they could use for emergency funding and leave us students in USG out to dry since scholarship money probably won’t be a priority for a state government trying to compensate for leave-the-beaches-open-as-my-daily-COVID-death-count-raises-from-10-to-119-in-one-day inept Brian Kemp tries to play catch up as coronavirus pounds the state and overwhelms the healthcare system. 

Shortly, it would take probably a near miracle to have a switch to Pass/Fail. However, there are other potential avenues to compensate for money lost due to potentially failed classes because of the new circumstances that would possibly be more productive.


1.) The violation of contract on Georgia Tech end of paying for a full-length, in-person semester being substituted for a substantial time (4 weeks out of 16) in an online setting. Given the fact that there is proof that GT’s online masters in CS costs significantly less than in person classes, you could try to argue for compensation proportional to taking online classes for a quarter of the semester, not to mention a week of missed classes.

2.) For OOS students like myself, being subject to the decisions regarding my tuition (no scholarships or financial aid) at a public university by elected officials which I cannot participate in the election process of, there is an argument to be made on the basis of “no taxation without representation”. Since I pay full tuition, that theoretically compensates me for not being a Georgia resident and paying taxes there. I haven’t read through the tuition contract yet, but this could be a loophole since USG elected officials are making decisions, not GT. 


Anyways, on a different note, my two cents on Cabrera criticism. On one hand, Cabrera really is at the mercy of USG and probably really desires a Pass/Fail compromise as this shortcoming will be a huge taint on his record of trying to improve student (mental) health and probably will majorly alienate most GT students and create distrust from his future efforts in his tenure. On the other hand, if he truly cared about student mental health more than his paycheck, he’d fight and publicly defy USG and rally tremendous student support across the state. Sadly, this is unrealistic to expect from a man who has already had a shady financial record regarding Koch brother money in his time as George Mason’s University president. His actions speak as to who and what he prioritizes.

Finally, I know the need for pass/fail is caused by the major issue of financial strain caused by losing scholarships or job opportunities or enrollment due to GPA. Please always remember this situation every election and go out to vote for someone who advocated for you and will put an end to these issues. That is how you create change.

But, NEVER STOP FIGHTING. Your continued efforts of public exposure may bring us P/F. Thanks to all who have dedicated such time advocating for others and doing so.",1586323125,1,0

For students whose grades are falling and for students who struggle with mental health issues.,"I was diagnosed with major depression, anxiety, and mildl bipolar disorder several years ago. Today I had two panic attacks. I’ve stopped turning in assignments. I’ve stopped studying.

For those of you who are like me and whose depression and mental health conditions have relapsed because of the isolation and the stress and the lack of resources: you are NOT alone. And it is OK to put your health above your grades.

Now, my dad happens to be a professor at Emory and shared some news with me that made me feel better. He has been receiving emails from Deans around the country - from colleges, from grad schools - and he says that the consensus has been the same: no one is going to look at grades from this semester. No one. No grad schools will hold you accountable for what has happened to you.

So again: it’s going to be ok.",1586303879,1,0

A (slightly pessimistic) potential reason for no P/F classes,"**TL,DR: The HOPE/Zell Scholarship fund was created with certain projections in place that model how many students will gain, retain, and lose their funding per year. Giving all USG schools the pass/fail option would keep kids on the edge from dropping out for one more semester and help bubble students’ GPAs, which in turn would cause the fund to be overdrawn and interfere with future cycles.**

The University System of Georgia is unique in two distinct manners: USG is not only the sole state governing body to not abandon letter grades during the coronavirus pandemic, but also the only system that ensures most/all of its schools’ tuitions to be paid for through the GA lottery for high performing Georgian high schoolers.

With the list of signatures and phone calls from invested stakeholders across the state growing by the day, why would USG resist on what is allegedly a “simple decision” to make? Money, obviously, as it is the answer to most questions. But whose money is at stake?

While *MOST* Georgia Tech students currently receiving aid are likely not in the bracket on the edge of losing meaningful amounts of scholarship money, as someone with siblings at other universities in the state, I can assure you that the average of our student body is so far removed from the average Georgian student that it is difficult to fully encapsulate the distinction through text. Of these “less than stellar students” at one of the numerous other USG institutions across the state, a significantly non-zero percentage of them were going to flunk out, drop out, or perform below the level necessary to maintain their scholarship this semester.

Giving all USG students a pass/fail option would be giving tens of thousands of students another go-around at college in the fall—millions of dollars not projected to leave the fund that can’t be recaptured through the same tax mechanisms used to grow it. While assessing the difficulty of re-stabilizing the base amount is difficult without hard financials, it would not be surprising if USG officials determined that given the pandemic, it was easier to cut their “losses” (read: human capital) and keep the letter grades.

So who do you save here? Do you allowed the “scheduled culling” to cut a little deeper than before? Or do you find another way to make millions of dollars for college appear in the middle of an unprecedented lockdown? Seems like USG made their call.",1586265674,1,0

Classes are difficult, stress builds exponentially, and yet Georgia Tech is far and away my favorite place on the planet. I remember my first week on campus and realizing that for the first time in my entire life, I was completely surrounded by people my own age that inspired me to grow and learn. You guys are the most amazing, talented, driven group of people I have ever met. We are the one of the most unique schools on the planet - a hybrid of sorts. We have all the wonderful perks of a state school: rich culture and history, deep connections with our hometown and state, sports and fans, a large alumni pool of absolute badasses, etc. However, we also have the academics to rival any STEM school on the planet - and rival them we do. In every single endeavor we take, I feel like GT students attack problems with this level of ferocity I just haven't seen at any other school. Maybe it is because deep down, every one of us has something to prove to the world, maybe it is because our culture encourages this level of performance; I don't know: but I love it and I miss it.         

I know this might be a little bit of a rose-tinted view of GT, and sure there are things that objectively suck here. Dining is ass, dorms are ass, classwork is ass, USG is omega ass, CS majors straight up smell like ass... But overall, I think Georgia Tech is exceptional - mainly because of you guys, the people I am proud to call classmates.

Fostering Pets,"Hi guys, I know that with everything going on about the Corona virus, other problems in the world seem sort of insignificant but I’d like to get a quick minute of attention about something that deeply troubles me. Every year thousands of families across the United States are displaced due to natural disasters (There was a terrible tornado which just hit Nashville).

Now you might think that this problem has been addressed really well; I mean thats why we have organizations like FEMA and emergency response personnel right? I’d have to agree with you, they do their job extremely well and I respect all of them and thank them for all that they do. There is one thing though that sort of gets swept under the rug and forgotten about in the wake of disaster. Pets. After a large-scale natural disaster, a lot of people lose their homes and although they often are able to find a safe place to live, they usually have to say goodbye to part of their family. Dogs, cats, and plethora of other pets, are simply given up to shelters and for adoption because their owners simply have no other place for them.

A couple of friends and I, thought that the idea of losing a member of your family that you love amidst already losing your home and a majority of your way of your life was simply deplorable. So, we’re humbly asking all of you if any of our fellow yellow jackets would be interested in fostering displaced pets or know someone who’d be willing to. If you know someone who’s also facing that impossible choice of letting go of a loved one simply because they have no place to keep them right now, we’d love to hear from them too. If you’re interested at all, we’d love it if you could take a second of your time and just let us know who you are at [fosterlink](https://mailchi.mp/f209b65bd7d6/fosterlink).

Discussion about coronavirus,"First, I am very pessimistic about the situation. I closely follow the news since the beginning of the outbreak in China.

I believe an outbreak in Atlanta is inevitable. The problem is that the two confirmed cases were not quarintined immediately at the airport, which means others on the same flight are highly likely to get infected already, but not quarintined yet. It usually takes 7-14 days to develop a symptom, yet infected people with no symptom can still infect others.

My suggestion is to wear a mask, even though the CDC guidline does NOT recommend do so. My reasoning is that:

(1) It is actually extremely difficult to avoid touching your face/mouth/nose in daily life. Wearing a mask means your mouth and nose are covered, which greatly reduces the possibility to touch them.

(2) A case study on *Lancet*, *The spread of the virus in a family cluster* [https://www.thelancet.com/infographics/coronavirus](https://www.thelancet.com/infographics/coronavirus) shows that the only person not infeced ""wear a surginal mask for most of the time"".",1583280495,1,0

"""Campus response to COVID-19"" – Letter from President Cabrera","&gt; Members of the Georgia Tech community: 
&gt; 
&gt; In light of the recent increase in cases of coronavirus worldwide, I want to update the campus on the measures we have taken to safeguard our students, faculty, and staff here in Atlanta, on our campuses abroad, and as part of the international programs being hosted throughout the world. 
&gt; 
&gt; First and foremost, we encourage everyone to follow appropriate preventative strategies, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): wash hands regularly, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, cover coughs and sneezes with tissues, avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay home when experiencing symptoms of illness.  If you have any illness – common cold, flu, cough – please stay home and take care of yourself until you are better. This will help slow the spread of all sickness. We are working with faculty to allow for excused absences in cases like these. 
&gt; 
&gt; Visit www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov to find out more about prevention measures. 
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, as previously communicated, we have canceled spring programs in China, South Korea, and Italy. We have also preemptively cancelled the China Summer Program. We continue to uphold the “Do Not Travel” notice to China issued by the University System of Georgia (USG) on Jan. 31 and have advised faculty to cancel any travel commitments to all countries currently under the CDC’s Level 3 notice — China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran. 
&gt; 
&gt; We have also established a coronavirus task force that will lead the preparation for and coordination of an Institute response in the event our operations are affected. I’ve asked my chief of staff, Frank Neville, to chair this group. Other members include:
&gt; 
&gt; • Rob Connolly, chief of police
&gt; 
&gt; • Erika Gravett, deputy director, Human Resources
&gt; 
&gt; • Laura Gustavson, emergency management coordinator, Emergency Management
&gt; 
&gt; • Kasey Helton, vice president, Campus Services
&gt; 
&gt; • Jennifer Herazy, chief administrative officer, Academic Affairs and Research
&gt; 
&gt; • Dr. Ben Holton, senior director, Health Services
&gt; 
&gt; • Pooja Juvekar, undergraduate president, Student Government Association
&gt; 
&gt; • Pinar Keskinocak, professor, Industrial and Systems Engineering
&gt; 
&gt; • Renee Kopkowski, vice president, Institute Communications 
&gt; 
&gt; • Keith McBride, chief of staff, Georgia Tech Research Institute
&gt; 
&gt; • Jim McGarrah, interim vice president, Information Technology
&gt; 
&gt; • Ajay Patel, director of purchasing, Purchasing and Procurement
&gt; 
&gt; • Jennifer Rhodes, project manager principal, Information Technology
&gt; 
&gt; • Narayan Shirolkar, graduate president, Student Government Association
&gt; 
&gt; • Will Smith, director, Emergency Management
&gt; 
&gt; • John Stein, vice president, Student Life and dean of students
&gt; 
&gt; • Nazia Zakir, assistant vice president, Environmental Health and Safety
&gt; 
&gt; The task force convened yesterday and has begun to engage key units to plan for the safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff here in Atlanta and abroad, as well as to start continuity planning in case normal campus operations are interrupted. This work will help Georgia Tech prepare for a broader range of potential future concerns beyond the current public health threat. 
&gt; 
&gt; We are following the USG’s guidance concerning students and international travel. In the coming days, our task force will be considering its recommendations for faculty and staff who travel in the coming days. 
&gt; 
&gt; We are conducting an inventory of personal protective equipment, disinfectant cleaning supplies and hand sanitizer currently available in multiple departments on campus. We will be placing additional orders to ensure we have sufficient stockpiles of these items on hand.  In addition, our Building Services custodial staff will alter building cleaning practices to focus more on surface cleanliness and disinfection.
&gt; 
&gt; We are coordinating all of our plans with federal and state authorities as well as the USG. They have been closely monitoring the ongoing outbreak in Asia and Europe and have offered direction to our institutions in line with guidance from the CDC, U.S. State Department, and the Georgia Department of Public Health.
&gt; 
&gt; We encourage you to visit the USG resource guide for the latest information concerning travel advisories and other guidance at www.usg.edu/coronavirus. 
&gt; 
&gt; As we continue to learn more, we’ll keep you updated through regular communications. Our communications archive is located at health.gatech.edu/coronavirus. Please direct any questions to publichealth@gatech.edu.

Is Georgia Tech worth it?,"Hey everyone, I'm a high school senior currently trying to decide between Georgia Tech and Penn State Schreyer Honors College for chemical/undecided engineering.  

For context, I live in PA so going to Penn State would be much cheaper than GT. Although I wouldn't be forced into debt by getting a B.S. in 4 years at GT, the high out-of-state tuition is a big concern, especially since I'm also thinking about going for a Master's after undergrad. There are a lot of factors that I'm considering outside of cost, though. 

I do really like Georgia Tech, which is why it's such a difficult decision. The engineering programs are very well-ranked and I like that the campus is right in Atlanta, unlike PSU which is a college town surrounded by nothing. But on the other hand, Tech's expensive tuition, combined with quite competitive and stressful academics (from what I've heard), along with the ongoing housing crisis prevent me from seeing it as my best option.

Parents look down on GT?,"I'm going into my second year at GT next year and I've absolutely loved my time here so far, but this entire time I have gotten constant disapproval from my parents at my choice to attend GT over another engineering university.

They never stop doubting GT's credibility, the intelligence of its students, and the work I do here, suggesting that I'm dumber and less hardworking now than when I was in high school because of how easy it is at GT. I have no idea how to deal with this because I've usually brushed away their constant disapproval but when combined with less-than-ideal online learning, it's become this persistent thought knowing that they are deeply disappointed and ashamed with everything I've done after high school. They literally trash talk the school and everything about it while laughing at me as I sit at the dinner table with them.

I think I was a decent student in high school and that I'm doing alright at GT now too, but the daily reminders of their disapproval at my institution and the growth I'm trying to go through here gets harder to deal with everyday.

Anonymously report unfair professors?,"My professor reported me to OSI for cheating. The thing is, I didn't cheat. And I just got the report from OSI... he didn't have any evidence of cheating. The only argument he made was that I didn't show all of my work on a problem (skipping the algebra steps of an integral bc I did it in my head), so he assumed I must have used a calculator. There is no evidence of me using a calculator, and I didn't use a calculator, but I still got reported off of speculation.

I believe I will beat the OSI case, but these things take forever to resolve, and I'm worried that my professor will give me a 0 on the test and completely destroy my grade. 

I tried to email the professor and ask him what his plan was for my grade on the test because it would take a while for my case to be resolved. Instead of responding to my question, he insisted that I do not contact him about this incidenent.

So now I'm worried that I'm going to fail math. It's been a month since the test, but there still has been no progress on my case.  I feel like I got screwed by this professor.

Housing for Fall/Covid19 Questions,"Forewarning: This is not a political post but it will contain some political issues.

Since Georgia is ""reopening"" or allowing for a momentary cease of the lockdown, I'm worried about corona virus affecting the Fall semester. I'm worried that if this ""reopening"" causes a second wave of Coronavirus to hit Georgia, that Tech will choose to make F20 online. If that is the case, will I receive my housing fees for that semester, along with all the fees that I would not be paying (such as transportation, the CDC, etc)?

Money is critical in this time as I'm out of my part-time job and my family has been affected by the job shortage. I'm worried that my deposit will be lost and I will have lost more money because of this virus and Tech. 

My biggest question is essentially this: If Tech decides to go Online for Fall 2020, will my housing and other fees that I normally will pay for oncampus living and enrollment be returned/refunded since I will be taking classes online?",1587528002,1,0

We're faced with a learning environment that we did not sign up for or expect, and taught by instructors which many of whom have no experience teaching in this way. It's not fair that students who are in living situations not ideal for online learning, that don't have adequate access to technology, or live in different time zones have to compete on the same level with other students who may not be facing the same problems.  It's not fair to students who follow the honor code and follow the rules when professors say that their exams are closed book/note while other students can use the internet and compare answers to cheat without consequence.

The University System of Georgia is not above institutions like Stanford, MIT, Duke, and others which have embraced Pass/Fail for these reasons when they tell their students to ""reach higher.""",1587422962,1,0

Convince me to come to Georgia Tech,"I’m currently a senior in high school planning on studying industrial engineering and am struggling figuring out where I want to go to college. Right now I’m between Penn State, Clemson, and Georgia Tech. I understand that GaTech is far superior for what I want to study and will probably have me more well off after I graduate, but I’m worried about my experience actually attending the college. 

I hear all the time how people can’t wait to get out or how their favorite times at GaTech was getting accepted and graduating... Obviously those are exaggerations but I also believe they hold some truth. I have heard from many people that GaTech has torn them down and that the culture on campus is really competitive and introverted. When I visited the campus it seemed like everyone was in their own little “academic bubble” if that makes any sense. 

Now when I visited Clemson, almost every single person I talked to LOVED the school, and I could tell they were being 100% genuine. I had a friend who didn’t get accepted into Tech, who would’ve gone to Tech if he did get it, but loves his decision to go to Clemson and would not change that for anything. 

I want to challenge myself and I know that Tech will do that, I’m just worried about not having a college experience that I can look back on and say “I had a  great time there”

I hope this post made some sense, and I’d be thankful for anyone who was in a similar situation to share their experience/decision process or any other relevant information.

Transferring from GSU to GT for BBA?,"I did terrible my first semester at GSU (even failed GSU 1010 which is their orientation class... and two other classes). I was on academic probation for a semester but my SAP appeal got approved because it was due to financial struggles and emotional trauma. 

I know that GT is known for STEM but I absolutely hate anything related to STEM. That’ll probably be a problem if I have to take Calc or Stat for a BBA. I’ve been dead set on a business degree (finance, marketing, international business, or HR) since I was in middle school but I really can’t do math at all lol. 

I graduated from a really competitive Georgia high school with a 3.6 with honors and APs. Never took the SAT, got a 31 on the ACT. Lots of extracurriculars and state business competition awards. Didn’t bother applying to any other school other than GSU because of financial problems at the moment. My GPA isn’t the best right now and I lost HOPE scholarship after my first year but it’ll be a 3.0 again after summer classes. 

I guess my reasons for wanting to transfer to GT are because my friends there, the academic rigor, campus life, and opportunities. GT also has the same environment as my high school with lots of students on little to no sleep and academic stress/pressure. GSU isn’t very motivating to me and it’s been hard to get a that “college experience” as a commuter with no friends. 

Not sure if I should transfer to GT, go out of the country, or just stay at GSU. Thoughts or opinions are appreciated.",1587259711,1,0

My team at Joby Aviation is hiring and I want my new coworker to be a Tech grad.,"Hey guys

My team at Joby Aviation is looking to hire a junior flight test engineer to join our world-class Flight Test team! Joby Aviation is a venture-backed eVTOL startup based in the bay area. We are on a mission to save a billion people an hour a day by enabling 3-dimensional urban mobility. We recently announced the closing of our Series C (https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/joby-aviation-raises-590-million-led-by-toyota-to-launch-an-electric-air-taxi-service/  and you can of course learn more about Joby on our website: https://www.jobyaviation.com/

I am an extremely proud tech alum and I would absolutely love for someone from Tech (hopefully AE :P ) to join our team. This position was approved just two days ago and I want to give tech students and alums a headstart in the process 😉 We are looking for someone with some flight test experience under their belt but we will definitely consider fresh graduates. Reach out to me personally if you have any questions!

We are very selective in who we hire and we have a distinct culture as we are a venture funded startup. A ""startup mentality"" is must. If you are looking for a cozy 9-5, this is not for you. This is 24*7*365 hustle to fundamentally change how we travel.

About me : GT Grad. BSAE-2016, MSAE-2018. Hats I currently wear at Joby : Flight Test, System Safety, Failure Modes and Effects Testing, Flight Controller analysis and evaluation, Sim validation and modeling, System Identification. 

Note : Do not share outside Tech yet, I want to give yellow jackets a headstart before i start spreading the word. Good luck!",1582251205,1,0

Pimp My Crib (sheet): advice and recommendations to improve your midterm cheat sheets,"Happy midterm season everyone! 🥳 I am a fifth year ME student who tends to create crib sheets that are a *little* [extra](https://imgur.com/gallery/1hGBVRD). If you’d like to do the same, here are some ways to take your crib sheets from drab to fab in ~~no time~~ a bunch of time! 

1. **Use ultra-fine pens, not a pencil.**  I’m a left-handed person, so I don’t say that lightly. You can’t color-code with pencil, it won’t last as well, and mechanical pencil lead is too way too thick. If you want to write super small, you’re going to need pens that you likely won’t find at office supply stores. For reference, those pens usually have a nib size of 0.5mm-0.8mm. I typically use pens with nib size 0.05mm-0.3mm. Here are my three recommendations in order of price. (Formatting kinda messed up bc I’m on mobile. Sorry)

    1. **Pentel Arts Slicci 0.25 mm Extra Fine Gel Pen ($17 for 8 assorted colors):** These are the best bang for your buck. They generally last longer and are less delicate, as they are not felt tip. I would say the line width it puts out is more comparable to the 0.05 or 0.1mm pens I describe list next. I have only been able to find them on amazon. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003D7HFFU/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_utYsEbCVCFMER 
    2. **Sakura Pigma Micron Pens ($2-$3 per pen):** these are felt tip art pens and are much higher quality than the Pentel pens. I love using these pens, but they do tend to run out of ink pretty quick. They come in a good range of colors. They make a pen with a 0.03mm nib... I own one but would only suggest using it if you want to write a textbook on one sheet. I primarily use the 0.05mm and 0.1mm but will also use 0.2 and 0.3 if I’m not super pressed for space on my cheat sheets. You can buy these online, but I’d recommend going to a local art store (Blick’s or Sam Flax) to test them out and choose the ones that you like best. Those stores also have student discounts. 
    3. Copic Multiliner pens: ($3-$4 each) yeah so these are expensive and probably not worth the price. They’re basically the same as the Micron pens but nicer, longer lasting, and more expensive. They also start the nib sizes at 0.03mm. I’d only recommend buying their black pens that you intend to use heavily. You can buy them online, but again, I’d recommend going to the art store.
2. **Use fancy schmancy art paper,** not copy paper or, heaven forbid, notebook paper. Whether you took my pen advice or not, this does make a difference. The pens won’t bleed, and the paper will hold up well. I buy paper specifically made for pen drawings. It’s like heavy card stock, but the ink won’t spread or smear. My favorite is sold at Blick’s in midtown and is maybe $10ish for a 9x12 pad that will last you through college. You’ll have to trim it to size. Canson Fanboy Comic and Manga Paper https://www.dickblick.com/products/canson-fanboy-comic-and-manga-papers/ 
3. **Write your notes in thin columns down the page.** Don’t try to write notes horizontally. You’ll end up with equations side-by-side, and it’ll be hard to follow the natural flow of your notes. Definitely don’t do the whole brick thing where you just have a million boxes/bubbles with equations that are hard to find. Write your notes in order, and give each equation its own line. Separate your columns by a distinct bold line. Try to make the columns wide enough to fit the width of your longest equation. If I have the space to spare, I’ll divide the columns by one straight line. Otherwise, I will just snake the line along the end of each row. Ideally, you still want to maintain some semblance of a column. 
4. **Number, box, and highlight all your equations.** This will allow you to easily reference equations in other places on your cheat sheet. Boxing and highlights makes them easy to find. 
5. **Create section and subsection titles.** Seems minor but really helps find stuff. I write section titles large, bold, all-caps, and in a bright color. Underline or box it in if you feel so inclined. Basically just make it easy to find the different topics and their key ideas. 
6. **Color code words according to their meaning.** If it’s a definition, I’ll write the word in blue and the definition in black. Equation names in pink, followed by equation in black. Set of rules/guidelines/numbered list? Title of list in orange, numbers in orange, and text in black. Examples should be titled as such in another color. Any particular extra important statements are written in red. 
7. **Only use one side each sheet of paper.** This is more of a personal preference than anything. If I’m allowed to have one page front and back, I’ll use two sheets and only write on one side of each. I like to be able to look at the sheets side by side, but if you’re going to be limited on desk space or will be allowed multiple pages, stick to using both sides. 
8. **Scan your cheat sheet so you have a digital copy in case it gets damaged.** Do this especially if you get to reuse the cheat sheet on future tests. I once spilled a 4Loko on part of a Dynamics cheat sheet and the thing still smells icky sweet to this day. Also, don’t drink 4Loko. It’s trash. 
9. **Fill in your remaining space with example problems that may be similar to exam questions.** Honestly, this is if you have the time. It’s better to make sure you understand and can use the concepts than to just have a bunch of example problems to look at during the exam. If you don’t still understand the material, none of this will help that much. 
10. **Do not choose making your cheat sheet crazy fancy over getting sleep.** Get the most necessary stuff on the page and go to bed. Get at least 5 hours of sleep. You won’t do well if your brain is scrambled from no sleep. 
11. **Probably don’t try wearing those red/blue 3D glasses and writing a page in red ink and then blue ink over top of it.** I guess the idea is to be able to write two pages of notes on one page. I’ve seen the idea float around the internet at some point. I’ve never actually tried it, so maybe it could work for you. Mostly it makes me laugh. 

Cramming as much as you can on one page won’t be helpful if you don’t still have a good understanding of the material. With that said, making these intricate cheat sheets does help me learn the material. It’s not always good or necessary to fit all your notes in, but if you want to you probably can. I managed to fit an entire semester of ME2016 notes plus all the homework and practice problems on four sheets for the final exam and made an A in the class. The cheat sheets were easy for me to follow because I had made them and organized them pretty well, but it would probably be hard for anyone else to use. Those are shown at the bottom of this pic. I pretty much took that exam on autopilot with no sleep. Most of my other cheat sheets are never that extreme. 

If you made it this far, maybe you found something useful in all this, or maybe you just think I’m a little weird. I can confirm that second part as true. Life is more fun with a little weirdness. 

**As one last note, just remember that your performance at Tech does not define your worth. You are pretty damn awesome no matter what happens. NOTHING is more important than your wellbeing.**",1582157372,1,0

Concerned Alums -- We would like to help!,"Hi y'all! I'm a 2013 alum (ISyE and BSBA if that matters). It has been a while since I've been back to campus but I've been keeping up through Reddit, Grad student friends etc. and I am honestly saddened and concerned about a few of the major issues plaguing student life at Tech, particularly mental health. I know firsthand the struggles you face here -- I took time off for anxiety and depression myself, and struggled to find the resources to help me cope at school. Since my time there, Tech's reputation has burgeoned both in terms of prestige but also academic rigor, but it is clear that improvements to student life and care have not kept up. I'm not looking to point fingers at whose fault that is, but I do want to see if we can help turn this around. 

A few years out of school and with the benefit of hindsight and a broader perspective, some of us alums out in the bay area have been discussing what we can do to tackle real issues facing Tech today (besides just upping donations and getting the cold shoulder from the administration in response to emails and requests for a discussion). 

I'd like to hear your perspectives here and am also looking for suggestions on the best way to gather data on the issues (surveys etc.) so we can start to put together something concrete.

The ED of HRL position is the top-level position within the department and oversees the functionality of the entire department. Since September of 2019, this position has been vacant and the impact has been quite noticeable within the department and throughout the residential community.

The Department of Housing and Residence Life is at a critical juncture in its functionality as a service provider to the residential community. As a member of the ED of HRL search committee and as a fellow student, I'm asking for your assistance in what is likely to be one of the most important decisions made for the foreseeable future in regards to HRL. I can't emphasize enough how important it is that the right person is in this role to ensure that many of the issues faced by this year's residential community are ameliorated and future residents can live on a campus that proudly wears the name and reputation of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Below, the available sessions are listed and as well as a signup link to indicate your participation in the process:

ED of HRL Available Sessions
Candidate One Campus Colleagues' Presentation: Friday, February 21st | 9:30am - 10:30am

I hope the extra money in your pockets is worth the loss of sanity and financial security of SEVERAL of your students.

Just know that you are the ones taking away a students wage that they may need to feed themselves. You are the ones shutting them off from every social, emotional, and academic outlet. You are the ones increasing the ALREADY stressful PRESSURE that every GT student feels every. single. day.

GT says they care. That they worry about our mental health. That they want us to succeed. But literally y'all just care about the money and that's just disgusting to me.

GT is only the institution it is today because of every single student that has step foot on this campus. Do better and give us some basic respect. It's laughable that we have to beg for that.

Your students are not your servants. Give us what we deserve.

Sincerely, a student who is not even a PL/RA but is severely saddened by your lack of humanity. Like holy sh*t, this is a new low.

"Do Not Become an RA/PL, Take a Stand","Sorry if we've been going on about this, but it needs to be said.

GT Housing and its treatment of its employees and residents has gone downhill for the past 4 years I've been here. We are belittled, disrespected, and gaslit by our Hall Directors, Area Managers, and other professional staff. None of our concerns are ever listened to, and there is no stability in the department overall. The few times we ask for support from them, we're ignored or pushed aside.

The emotional toll that it takes to be an SSM is insane, and we aren't provided proper support when dealing with it. The number of cases of sexual assault, depression, homesickness, coming out, break ups, break downs, roommate conflicts, and just general bad days that I've seen myself and my fellow RAs/PLs go through on nearly a daily basis is unparalleled to any other department except for Counseling. The only problem is, we aren't trained or compensated fairly for this kind of work. We are pretty much volunteer triage counselors, and it takes a fucking toll when you add in your other clubs, jobs, classes, and personal issues.

Not only this, but they have the audacity to removed half of the PL positions across campus, leaving one PL per floor to deal with double the residents, duty shifts, and general bullshit on their own. The ""additional"" compensation they're providing for double the work is a joke, and they're even banning SSMs from having any kind of other job on-campus or off-campus unless it's research. 

I have loved this position like no other for the past 4 years, but I can't let this malpractice go unnoticed for any longer. If you're applying to become an SSM or considering returning to the position, please reconsider. **It isn't worth it. Period.** Putting in a decent number of hours a week at a part time job you enjoy would pay about the same while avoiding the stress and anger that we go through on a daily basis. The only way that anyone in Housing will ever listen to these issues is if they're starved of candidates and can't function, so please join in this good fight and spread the word.

Together, maybe we can move on from this era of shitty maintenance, overpriced housing, and staff neglect.",1581963144,1,0

A sample email to your professors to ask you to have your grade changed,"This format has worked really well for me in the past and just bumped me up in both classes I'm taking right now, so I thought I would share one of the emails I sent.

_______________________________________________  

Hi Dr. 'Doofenshmirtz',

I was doing some grade calculations on a spreadsheet earlier and based on the syllabus I’m looking at a final average of 78.1. I know your threshold to bump people up is when they are within 0.5 points of a letter grade, but I wanted to ask you if you might consider bumping me up in this case on an exception. The major contributor to this average for me is an incomplete homework 4, since I was unable to complete some of the latter sections which resulted in me getting a 60 on the one assignment (I thought I could take a hit on one assignment because of life circumstances around that time, but that ended up not being the case). Looking at my grade history, I maintained a pretty solid ‘B’ average and performed at that level for the whole class, and doing the math shows that if I get just a total of 4.5 points back on exams, then my average will go up to a 79.5. I also maintained a solid performance history on the homeworks which I spent a lot of time on, though I didn’t do as well as on the exams as I would have liked.

I completely understand if you would prefer not to bump me up in this scenario, but I figured I would ask anyway and maybe make the case that I performed adequately at that ‘B’ level save for one exception, which was the one homework assignment right around spring break. Getting this C wouldn’t make or break my GPA, but keeping the B would absolutely remove a lot of stress for forthcoming semesters, and I wouldn’t be asking you unless I really felt I had a decent case.

Thank you, and I appreciate everything you did for us this semester!

7 days left! 

The good news is we went up in territories (we have 19 now), are much closer to first place today (Michigan is in first place with 26 territories), and we got rid of Nebraska's presence in the Southeast. This is what can happen when you don't have a day of terrible luck!

The bad news [is some Texas Longhorns showed up](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeFootballRisk/comments/gd545e/if_tu_was_a_person/) and treated us worse than they did that ugly bulldog from uga. It makes our map look pretty messy. That's no bueno. Seems out here getting desperate and it's creating a bit of chaos, and I don't mean Team Chaos. We were also breached by Michigan in Miami with some bad luck RNG.

Today we will need to take our territory back in the SE while maintaining pressure on Michigan to even out the game and give us a chance to win. We had a nice boost in players yesterday which was great to see, and let's keep that flow coming! We are right in this thing! Directions to get started are below.

Possibility of Grade Appeal?,"Hey guys! So, in my MATH 2552 class, I'm currently sitting at an 89.68% after the final exam.

Indeed, I submitted what seemed a valid regrade request to my teacher that other students in my class apparently got a point back for before. However, when I submitted the request, my teacher said it was too late to change my grade for that quiz. I was hoping now there could be a way I could contact someone like the Registrar's Office, the Math department, or anyone that could help me figure this out.

Yellow Jackets Swarm California! (College Risk Day 41),"[**PLAY HERE**](https://collegefootballrisk.com/) **|** [**MARCHING ORDER SIGNUP HERE**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8F5KfttZQBj8ccK0PlrjOGDZqUJb87fPxLm-YPdY4cIqmRA/viewform?fbzx=-5834518503355511020) **|** [**GAME EXPLANATION HERE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/fm76nt/coronabummed_time_to_destroy_every_other_school/)

This game is getting tight! Yesterday, we prioritized California a bit and were able to grab 3 strategic territories that allow us to hit Michigan hard today! This did mean chaos was able to take some territories from us as they continue to be a nuisance in the Southeast, but hopefully we can clear some of that up today. Chaos tends to attack WAYYY more than defend, so taking back chaos territories doesn't take much power. On our northern front, we have Michigan creeping into North Carolina a bit which would be great to push back. Ohio St, who we are working with right now to help dent into Michigan's lead, will likely assist there.

We are currently in 2nd place in the game with 20 territories, with Michigan leading with 26 and Ohio St just behind us at 18. Each day right now is super important as positioning in the final couple days will be super pivotal! Log on, make that move each day, and let's take home the crown!

**How to Play:**

1. Go to [collegefootballrisk.com](https://collegefootballrisk.com/) and link your Reddit account and select Georgia Tech as your team
2. If you haven't already, sign up for [team Georgia Tech marching orders](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8F5KfttZQBj8ccK0PlrjOGDZqUJb87fPxLm-YPdY4cIqmRA/viewform?fbzx=-5834518503355511020) that will help tell you where to attack or defend each day based on where we need to allocate resources. We have over 750 people signed up!
3. Once you get your orders each day (around 2-3PM EST), head back to [collegefootballrisk.com](https://collegefootballrisk.com/) and at the bottom click the territory you want to attack or defend. **Remember to put in your move each day**! If you do, you will become more powerful as a player and be more likely to help us win.
4. Check back in after 11PM EST that night to see how we did for that day. You may have even won an MVP!

"If y'all didn't want ""lazy"" students, maybe the institution shouldn't be lazy to start...","[The university's right now are upset because of cheating but the real issue is:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dbR2JZmlWo)


While I'm confident i can maintain my GPA with online courses the fact that USG didn't move to pass/fail as an opt-in when even U of Boston, Yale, etc. are is hilarious. I agree it should be an option, just an opt-in, as I definitely understand how some people suck at coping with the current situation. But trying to crack down on cheating by violating people's privacy on a third party site is a quick way to undermine your own institution and fast.

##Here's a fucking thought:

* cheating is gonna happen with or without Chegg
* and if Chegg starts to comply with all these academic requests, its gonna destroy their company. because lets be honest, Chegg is for cheating and that's the hard truth of it
* [If you don't want *lazy* students to be able to find the answers to your HW or test online... ***how about you don't be a LAZY AS FUCK PROFESSOR/INSTUTITION AND MAKE YOUR TESTS AND HOMEWORK BY HAND INSTEAD OF USING PRE-MADE TEST BANKS?***](https://youtu.be/F3S-ojKNQSs)
* How about actual department reviews where department heads have to properly review and sign off on material that the professor presents instead of just winging it? Maybe then students wouldn't get lost in your courses, especially in this force-online environment?


I mean, these people collect a paycheck for simply reusing the same testing material every semester that they didn't even make themselves and I'm supposed to feel bad for the institution when its gotten that fucking lazy that there aren't scheduled reviews, revisions, and checks on the material being used/presented? The fact that most professors don't even go back over the material between semesters to try to improve the course for students and themselves is downright pathetic. This should be a big wake-up call to the academic institution as a whole. You get lazy students who cut corners where they can when you have a lazy institution that cuts every corner imaginable. Not to mention, the majority of students on this campus are engineers. Isn't the motto for us supposed to be ""Work Smarter, Not Harder""?

The thing is, my social life is a very big priority of mine, and being OOS, I don’t wanna repeat my social mistakes in High School. Any advice what I can do now?

Student consolidation during a growing pandemic -- from GT Housing,"First of all, I am an international student and approved to stay on campus till the end of the semester. Here's the email I've got from housing about ""consolidation""

Dear XXX,

Georgia Tech Housing and Residence Life knows that the last week has been very stressful, and we appreciate your patience and understanding as we manage unforeseen circumstances during uncertain times. Over the last few days, more than 6,500 residents have successfully moved off campus for the remainder of the semester. Our records indicate that you have been approved to remain on campus.  The following provides additional information on your next steps.

**Housing Consolidation** 

Approximately 700 remaining residents are presently located in more than 40 residence halls across campus. In order to better serve remaining residents, Georgia Tech Housing and Residence Life is consolidating residents into five buildings. All will be assigned their own apartment, to ensure proper social distancing, while allowing the reduction of needed housing staff to accommodate residents during these unique circumstances. Residents who are already located in these five buildings will likely not have to move. The buildings were selected in order to minimize disruption for remaining residents. All new rooms and common areas are currently being sanitized and will be clean prior to move-in. 

**Your New Housing Assignment**

On Monday, March 30, you will receive an email with your new housing assignment. Rather than assign move-in windows, we are asking residents to provide their primary and secondary choices. A confirmed move-in window will be sent by Housing and Residence Life along with your new room assignment on Monday, March 30. Please click [**HERE**](https://starrez.housing.gatech.edu/StarRezPortalX/InitiateLogin/StarNet.Core.AuthProviders.Shibboleth/) to select your move-in window.

**Move Process** 

Since you have been assigned a new room, we ask that you begin packing your current room this weekend. The Move-In window will be Tuesday, March 31, through Friday, April 3. On Monday, March 30, you will receive an email from Housing and Residence Life with your approved move-in window and new room location. We’d ask that residents try to complete their move within a two-hour widow, if at all possible. 

Please return all keys to your current area office and pick up your new key from the area office associated with your new building. Contact information for all area offices can be found [here](https://housing.gatech.edu/area-offices). Boxes and packing tape will be available either in your residence hall lobby (for larger buildings) or in area offices (for smaller buildings). Residents are allowed to park in any Georgia Tech parking space, no matter their assigned lot, excluding handicap or reserved spaces. The Housing and Residence Life team is happy to assist with this move process, so please contact us for additional questions at [information@housing.gatech.edu](mailto:information@housing.gatech.edu) or 404-894-2470.

**Limited Campus Services**

Despite that the majority of Georgia Tech residents and employees are no longer on campus, limited campus services are still available. To stay up to date on all services, including hours of operation, virtual opportunities, or contact information, visit [https://campusservices.gatech.edu/hours](https://campusservices.gatech.edu/hours). 

For additional questions on Housing, visit [http://housing.gatech.edu/move-out-faqs](http://housing.gatech.edu/move-out-faqs). For questions not addressed through the Housing FAQs, email [information@housing.gatech.edu](mailto:information@housing.gatech.edu) or call 404-894-2470. Due to high call and email volume, we will respond within 24-48 hours at the latest. For Georgia Tech communications regarding the coronavirus pandemic, please visit [http://health.gatech.edu/coronavirus](http://health.gatech.edu/coronavirus).

SGA COVID-19 Update (3/27/2020),"Dear Yellow Jackets, 

As we gear up to get back into the class routine next week, I want to provide updates on all things Georgia Tech. I know there is a lot of valid frustration and sadness surrounding the uncertainty of these times -- current and summer classes, commencement, and your connectedness with others -- just to name a few.

There was a cheesy quote that I read recently: “You do not have to make sense of it all in order to be worthy of peace.” I want each of you to know that the complexity of the emotions you feel are valid. If there is anything that brings me hope, it’s that our resilience as students to be there for each other -- to check in, ask for help, and cheer each other up -- will get us through this period. 

Over the last week, SGA has heard from many of you asking how Georgia Tech can contribute face masks to hospitals and those in need. You have offered your fresh produce and cans of food. You have asked questions and brought your frustrations and concerns to us. Because of all this, we are stronger. **Thank you.** 

**COVID-19 Emergency Fund**

Since the creation of this new Emergency Fund, over 170 students have applied. Regardless of whether you think your expense is small, this fund was created to assist students. 

The [Student Emergency Fund](https://studentlife.gatech.edu/content/student-emergency-fund) has been created by the Division of Student Life with support from the Alumni Association and Office of Development. This fund allows for students who are in need of financial assistance to receive up to $1,000 for travel assistance, housing assistance, medical expenses, moving costs, financial support, and food insecurity. [Click here](https://gatech.campuslabs.com/engage/submitter/form/start/394732) for the application.  

**Housing and Dining**

I want to reassure you that students will be receiving prorated housing and meal plan refunds. For those who cannot move their belongings out of their dorm or apartment before the end of the semester, you will still receive the prorated housing refund. For students who remain on campus, Ferst Place is open and provides the option to deliver meals to Brittain Dining Hall and Woodruff Residence Hall. Here are links to information about [meal delivery](http://campusservices.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/dininghoursupdate3_24_002.pdf) and other [campus services hours](http://campusservices.gatech.edu/hours).

**Academic Support**

To support our students academically, 1-on-1 tutoring will continue on BlueJeans, and students can schedule appointments by visiting [http://success.gatech.edu](http://success.gatech.edu/). PLUS Leaders will develop and distribute weekly study guides for their courses and host weekly two-hour remote sessions via BlueJeans where students may work collaboratively on problems. More information can be found at [http://success.gatech.edu/plus-sessions](http://success.gatech.edu/plus-sessions). 

We have heard that many instructors have been adapting well to these circumstances and are providing greater flexibility. We encourage you to communicate and work with your instructors to voice your concerns and needs during this time. SGA is here to support you in instances where these accommodations are not made.  

**What is SGA doing?**

We have advocated for the extension of the withdrawal (W) deadline to the end of the term, increased financial support for students on and off campus, extended airport/grocery shuttle operations, and added delivery options for on-campus meal plans. 

For those who are graduating, we will continue to meet with Institute leadership to express the desire to hold a commencement ceremony. We are advocating for seamless reimbursements for summer study abroad programs and for more information on what summer class offerings will look like. In addition, we are working to better understand the exact amount of prorated fee reimbursements. We are working on allocating funds from the newly formed [Joint Governing Board](https://sga.gatech.edu/c-19r/). Please continue submitting your feedback to us with [this link](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0HEwF2T8pNfr92d) so we can better understand your needs. 

**Looking** **Forward**

Next week, we officially begin the term in a very different way. Because of the unifying way I have seen students ask what they can do for others, I am confident we will come out of this stronger than before. The selflessness of my peers gives me hope that we are indeed a school full of brilliantly kind students. That is the Georgia Tech I know. 

In Progress and Service,

Georgia Tech guidance on Graduate Student Employees (GRAs/GTAs),"&gt; Sent on behalf of Chaouki T. Abdallah, Executive Vice President for Research, and Rafael L. Bras, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Faculty and Graduate Student Employees —
&gt; 
&gt; As a follow-up to the Thursday, March 26, message to campus regarding leave with pay procedures for employees, we would like to clarify the expectations around graduate student employees for the remainder of the Spring 2020 semester.
&gt; 
&gt; All graduate students on an assistantship must be allowed to telework to fulfill their work expectations.
&gt; 
&gt; For students on teaching assistantships (GTAs), this work will likely include supporting their faculty member in the preparation of course materials and other support of remote delivery of instruction. 
&gt; For students on research assistantships (GRAs), this work can include, but is not limited to: preparation of data, completing literature reviews, data analysis, drafting manuscripts, and contributing to sponsor reports. Additionally, if other work assignments are not available, GRAs could be redeployed to support instruction, as appropriate to needs and funding sources. 
&gt; Similarly, graduate assistants (GAs) should telework to complete the duties and terms of their assistantship. 
&gt; In all cases, graduate student employees are students first and foremost, and the work of courses, dissertations, and theses should be made a priority. Students who are close to graduating and need to complete time-sensitive activities to meet spring graduation deadlines should consult with their advisors and the Office of Graduate Studies to ensure progress toward these deadlines.
&gt; Students who are teleworking from international locations must inform their advisors. Faculty advisors and PIs with researchers working from international locations must consult with the Office of the General Counsel (asklegal@gatech.edu) to conduct an export review to ensure compliance with U.S. export control laws.
&gt; As of March 19, all on-campus research laboratories were restricted to only essential activities. Research activities designated as essential have been approved by their school chair or IRI director. Research personnel conducting these essential activities are permitted to be on campus as approved. GRAs can be designated as essential research personnel. This ramp-down plan does not apply to the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). GTRI personnel should follow current guidance from their leadership. 
&gt; 
&gt; Because the cessation of research activity is mandated by Georgia Tech, graduate students on an assistantship must continue to be paid during the period in which they will be teleworking, regardless of the source of funding for their assistantship.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Chaouki T. Abdallah, Executive Vice President for Research
&gt; Rafael L. Bras, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs

Refund Breakdown?,"Does anyone know if we will be receiving a breakdown of the refunds we'll get for fees, housing, meal plans, etc?

I saw a direct deposit from Tech when I checked my bank account today, but the value seems too high to cover the fees they stated we'd be getting partially refunded and *way* too low to be my housing reimbursement. I have no idea where the number came from and it's not listed anywhere in my Bursar's account. Outside of this money appearing in my bank account, marked as a direct deposit from Tech, I have no idea what it's for, if I should expect more, if I'll have to pay it back when they figure out what they're doing and correct the numbers, or what.

2 More Students Test Positive for COVID-19,"Today, two additional Georgia Tech students self-reported that they have tested positive for COVID-19. This brings the total of students who have tested positive to three.  There has also been one Georgia Tech staff member who has self-reported a positive test result in the past week.

One of the students who tested positive was last on campus on March 12 and the other was last on campus on March 13.  Both reported their symptoms started several days after leaving campus while on Spring Break.

 

If you test positive for COVID-19, please immediately contact Stamps Health Center at covid19travel@health.gatech.edu or call the Emergency Management Team within the Georgia Tech Police Department at 404-894-2500.

 

When a positive test is reported, the staff at Stamps Health Care Center will reach out to any affected units so that any necessary notifications of potential exposure are communicated and applicable public health guidance is followed. The Task Force will also alert Facilities to determine what, if any, additional cleaning or building closures are required. 

 

If you have not tested positive but are ill or have been exposed to someone who is ill, please follow the guidelines shown in the infographic we distributed last week for reporting your illness. 

 

If you have been ill and want to return to work after exposure or illness, you are asked to follow these CDC and Department of Public Health Guidelines:

If you’ve been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 but you are not showing symptoms of illness, self-quarantine for 14 days. If you do not develop symptoms, you may return to work.
If you are symptomatic of COVID-19 or any general illness (using the infographic above as a guide), CDC guidance requires that the following three conditions are met before you discontinue isolation: 
No fever for 3 days
Improved symptoms
Allowing at least a week to pass since symptoms started. 

In addition, if you have recently traveled to areas where there are ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 and develop fever with cough and shortness of breath within 14 days of your travel, or if you have had close contact with someone who is suspected to have COVID-19, stay home and call your health care provider or local health department right away. Be sure to call before going to a doctor’s office, emergency room, or urgent care center and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.
 
For members of the Georgia Tech community, the best prevention measures for any respiratory virus, including COVID-19 are:
Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces

While we understand the concerns and fear around COVID-19, it is extremely important to stay calm and maintain a close eye on your health and any symptoms that may arise. The symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath.

&amp;#x200B;

Emory makes a sound argument. Here are some statements I liked:

""Students who endure extreme socio-economic and health-related hardship should not suffer academic consequences because they lack a financial safety net, stable access to internet or computer resources, or the well-being necessary for scholastic pursuits.""

""Universities’ responses to COVID-19 nationwide have had serious repercussions for all students, especially low-income and international students.""

"fyi if you got approved to leave your belongings on campus until april 30 bc you can’t afford a packing service, GT housing also refuses to refund as of rn","gt housing basically says that you need to have been moved out by the 29th to get a refund. so people who can’t afford packing services and are keeping their stuff until april 30th are unable to get any money back as of right now. this is both upsetting and unsurprising as gt housing continues to leave students with 0 options. if students are not even using utilities and living in their room, especially if they have no way on moving their stuff out, how would you be able to expect them to afford to lose a whole months rent?

i know that these times are uncertain and it’s not something the institution has ever faced but god has gt housing completely screwed me over with making premature decisions and giving hope with options such as these and then pulling it out beneath your feet with such tight deadlines to act on.

this whole break has been 24/7 stress and anxiety. i’ve spent everyday emailing and calling gt services, having to schedule and cancel flights, and now have to probably ask a huge favor for someone to literally go and pack up all my belongings when i left spring break with the message that “we should not pack up anything.”  if georgia tech thinks that students are able to continue to perform the same academically then i just don’t know what to say. bc as of rn i, as well as i’m sure so many others, don’t even have the time to attend online classes or do work because we’re having to deal with the aftermath of housing’s decisions.",1585235629,1,0

I know there are more important things than a drug test right now, I know health is more important. But I need to decide - should I wait for another week and see if they change their policies? If they don't it'll probably be a worse time to get out than now.

GT Alum with kn95 masks for healthcare workers,"Hello GaTech, I’m a GT BMED alumnus (2019) with a bunch of kn95 masks available for those who need it most (healthcare workers without them). As we all are dealing with the effects of covid-19, I had many of my own family members working in hospitals/clinics in &amp; around Atlanta the past weeks fearful of working without these masks, so after some logistical leg-work, I got a partner in China that manufactures FDA and CE approved medical personal protective equipment (PPE) including these kn95 masks to send me a couple hundred of them. A week later and all my family and their staff have masks!

Now I’m ramping up this effort to help all healthcare workers who still need these. I’m ordering thousands of kn95 masks per week and selling/shipping them in boxes of 50 for under $4/per mask (hopefully the price can stay this low, at the mercy of the manufacturer’s demand and they could raise it any day). Barring any UPS delays I should have hundreds available by Friday. **We are prioritizing healthcare workers,** with exceptions for those with health conditions that really need these as well for their own safety.

This is where you can help: if you work in healthcare or know people working in healthcare that are looking for these masks, please PM me for details on how to order, suggestions, or more info. The GT community is the first place I'm posting about this. I am not listing these on Amazon, eBay, etc. because the point of this is to help those on the front lines, not the general public wanting to hoard masks. A website has been setup for ordering as well but again, not listing to general public because they’ve been selling well just from word of mouth to doctors so far.

"Latest email: ""Spring 2020 Student Fee Refund Overview""","    

  Email:

""Students: 

The health and well-being of our campus community is of utmost importance to the Institute. To help protect the safety of our students during these challenging times, the University System of Georgia (USG) instructed all institutions to move to on-line instruction only for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester. Students living in residence halls were also asked to move out by March 29, with very limited exceptions for students with special circumstances. While Georgia Tech’s campus is not closed, campus services utilized by students including housing, dining, transportation, and recreation have been greatly affected. 

As such, Georgia Tech has been working with the USG to develop a refund plan that would apply to the mandatory and non-mandatory fees listed below. Fees will be pro-rated, beginning on Monday, March 16, 2020, for the remainder of the spring semester.   

**Mandatory Fees:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Activity
* Athletic
* Campus      Recreation Center (CRC) Operations
* Student      Center Operations
* Transportation      

**Non-Mandatory Fees (based on type of plan and usage, where applicable):**

&amp;#x200B;

* Dining      fees 
* Housing      fees 
* Living      Learning Communities (LLCs)
* Parking      permit fees – semester or annual
* Student      Life: Tech-Prep (summer program)

The Institute anticipates processing service fee refunds by April 8, 2020. Students should make sure their direct deposit is set up so that any refunds will be sent directly to their bank, and then monitor their student account for balance changes resulting from refunds. If you have not set up direct deposit, an email will be sent to you with instructions on how to set up include direct deposit. Questions regarding direct deposits may be submitted to [bursar.ask@business.gatech.edu](mailto:bursar.ask@business.gatech.edu).

We ask the Georgia Tech community to continue to monitor all communications that you receive from the Institute, and frequently visit [health.gatech.edu/coronavirus](http://health.gatech.edu/coronavirus) for the most up-to-date information.

For questions regarding refunds, please contact the Office of the Bursar at [bursar.ask@business.gatech.edu.](mailto:bursar.ask@business.gatech.edu) """,1585143985,1,0
Wheelchair Research Survey,"Researchers at Georgia Tech are interested in developing technology to help wheelchair users prevent pressure ulcers. The technology would monitor how long you are seated, how often you perform weight shifts and the pressures or forces on your buttocks. Other measurements may also be possible such as the temperature of your buttocks. Information would then be sent to your mobile device.

&amp;#x200B;

Collecting thoughts and opinions from wheelchair users’ is an important part of the project. An anonymous survey has been developed that will not collect any personal or identifiable information from you. The survey should take about 7 minutes to complete.

&amp;#x200B;

We recognize that you have many more important things on your mind at this time and sincerely thank you for your time and your opinions.

Out of State Transfer Student - Illinois,"Hey guys,

I was looking to apply as a transfer student to GA, majoring in computer science. I was hoping in getting some help to see what I could to improve my odds for acceptance, and possible scholarships since I will be out of state, and due to my financial background.

**Here I will do a profile on me, and if you could tell me what I could do in order to be a much more suitable candidate for these requests.**

* I currently go to a community college in Illinois, completing my degree in Applied Arts and another degree in Applied Sciences for Computer programming.
* I'm also 22 years old(I had a late start going to college, and taking me a little longer due to the duel degree).
* I was not born in the united states, and I'm also a DACA recipient. 
* I currently hold a GPA of 3.5 to date.
* I'm in my community colleges Honors Program and also in the PTK Honors Society
* I do not currently do any volunteer work or in any after school programs or where doing so before corona started. Although a year back I was volunteering at a Spanish community center, and before that was in a few after school clubs. 
* I also work full time in order to be able to pay for my schooling, which is another reason I cant really participate in many after school programs.
* I also was a average student in high-school, test scores were average, SAT scores not to well, and no after school I participated in. I'm not sure if this would be much relevant information though. and if my college academics would take precedence instead.
* My parents also don't have much income, I don't necessarily know their exact tax bracket.

Thank you all for reading and looking forward to hearing feedback.",1589737361,1,0

So I'm looking at internships for the spring semester  and I was wondering if there is a website(s) out there that describes peoples experiences of their employment for that company.

Also, is there a website to base a fair and competitive pay to know that I'm not getting screwed over for an offer. Like if a company says they will pay me $8 an hour but the average pay for the position is $10. Is there a website like this too?

How would you feel about a 'Some Good News' series about Tech?,"I'm a GT film student with the urban media lab and I'm looking into new projects to take up over the summer; I was wondering how much appeal there would be for a weekly video filled with upbeat news and neat stories entirely from and about Tech students.

I'd imagine it'd be similar to John Krasinski's 'Some Good News' series, but related specifically to Tech students. While general good news about Georgia Tech as a whole could be covered, I'd imagine it would focus more on the smaller stories of student success that take place over the summer. It'd be a chance for students to share their victories, no matter how minor they felt their wins were. I figure with 25,000 students, there's probably a whole lot of impressive feats and cheerfulness out there that's going under the radar.

People could put forth a shout-out for their friend's achievements or submit their own stories to be told along with others in a ~five minute video uploaded once a week. Do you think it's something you'd enjoy seeing, especially if all the stories were provided by and about our community? If not, what do you think would make it more engaging or enjoyable?

Running Out of Zell hours - What Would Be My Best Options?,"Hey everyone,

So i’m a summer transfer student, I came in with quite a few credits but I have, not counting my in progress summer credits, 52 hours left to graduate. Problem is, I did lose some on the way over and I have only 42 Zell miller hours left. Any way I crunch it, it’s looking like my last semester’s tuition will have to be paid for OOP (this is assuming I keep zell but let's just say I do for right now). Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I know there is a hard cap at 127 that I won't even try to negotiate, but I’m planning to talk to the financial aid office and scholarship office sometime in the immediate future, see if theirs anything else I could do. Alternatively, if I have to take out a loan or just work to pay it off I’m fine with that too. But I wanted to see if anybody might have anything I hadn’t thought of.

I'm definitely planning to do a Entrepreneurship certificate, which takes half of my remaining courseload, but among the remaining space, I'm thinking about the following, and I was wondering if anyone in these minors(,/majors if applicable) could help me make my decision more clear.

Music Technology - I've taken MUSI 3450, and enjoyed most of the class except for like one unit which I've grown to appreciate afterwards, and I do produce EDM as a side-hustle. Thus on paper, this is the chalk choice for me, but is this minor as fun as it looks from the course list?

BME - have a lot of relatives who are doctors, and I do have some interest in some medical AI applications down the road, but is there much in this minor that would really tie in with the Intelligence thread of CS? Seems like a lot of it is very biology/mechanical based. 

Robotics - Did Robotics in HS, on RoboJackets now, but have never been super good at the mechanical or electrical aspects. Is it hard to pick up those aspects from a CS perspective, and would you say it's worth it?

Thank you for answering, in advance! Right now I'm leaning Music Tech, but I wanna make sure I have an informed decision before I go ahead.",1589473686,2,0

Im well aware this is pretty low for Ga tech transfer students, so I'm curious what Ga tech students have to say what my chances are.  Knowing the School of Design only requires a 3.0 and that my gpa has continued to improve (after some maturing), I think it could be possible but not likely. Hopefully admissions take in the fact that each semester my grades improved; please let me know any of yalls thoughts, Thank you",1589335894,1,0

Chem 1212 or phys 2211?,"I’m likely going to be a transfer student in the fall (I have a pathway) and am wondering if there is a large difference in the difficultly of chem and physics at tech. I’ve taken almost all my prerequisites through ap credit and at Georgia College (Calc 2, linear algebra, biology 1/2, and chem 1). I still need to take either my second chem or first physics course. I’m worried my chem 1 class was too easy and hasn’t prepared me to take chem 2 at a more rigorous school and I did take ap physics in hs (I got a 3 unfortunately but my teachers wasn’t the best). I’m a psychology major so I don’t think the choice really affects me later on but was just wondering if anyone has some insight into which would be the better option! Thanks:)",1589326143,1,0

Satisfactory Academic Progress and FinAid,"Hey everyone, do any of you know how the Financial Aid Warning works? Do they evaluate it on a semester-by-semester basis? Or do they take the whole academic year and look at that? Because I got put on warning for the 75% of completed courses thing, since I successfully completed only 40/63 credits (lots of Ws and maybe a few Fs), but I still wasn’t over 75% last semester and they told me nothing. The reason I’m asking is because I’m taking 6 credits this summer, so will they evaluate me again at the end of the summer and take away my financial aid for the 2020-21 academic year?",1589319478,1,0

Monitoring the path of coronavirus,"""  To the campus community,  
 

We have been closely watching reports of a new coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China.  As of today there have been five confirmed cases in the United States. There have been no identified cases at Georgia Tech or in the state of Georgia.  
 

Our health professionals will continue monitoring the situation and are following the direction given by public health experts.  It is important to note that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a recommendation to avoid all nonessential travel to Hubei Province, China.  
 

Symptoms of coronavirus are similar to the seasonal flu, which remains the higher risk for our population. This is also the time of year when we typically see a rise in cases of seasonal flu.  
 

Students who have traveled from central China in the past 14 days and have a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing should contact Stamps Health Services immediately at 404-894-1420. Options for medical assistance outside of normal business hours are available at [health.gatech.edu/after-hours](http://health.gatech.edu/after-hours).  
 

We encourage all members of the campus community to follow the same preventative strategies used during a normal cold and flu season: getting a flu shot, washing hands regularly, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when experiencing symptoms of illness. Students who have paid their health fee are eligible for a flu shot at no charge.  
 

It is recommended that anyone over the age of 6 months get the flu shot, and especially people with chronic medical conditions who are at high-risk for flu-related complications. Information regarding how to get a flu shot at Georgia Tech or what to do if you think you have influenza is available [online at the Stamps Health Services website](http://health.gatech.edu/additional/flu).  
 

Sincerely,

Regarding Upcoming Changes to 2nd-year Housing,"Good afternoon all,

Thank you for communicating your concerns and questions with us over the past week regarding the upcoming changes to 2nd-year Housing for the 2020-2021 academic year. Before you continue reading, we’d like to explicitly state that the Residence Hall Association is a fully-student run organization and we are not official spokespeople for the Department of Housing and Residence Life (HRL); however, we have, over the past year, worked diligently to build out a strong communication network with HRL to be able to deliver concerns (like those expressed this past week) quickly and efficiently. With that information out of the way, we have an update to provide on this topic.

Below, you’ll find the text of the document discussed with HRL leadership earlier yesterday:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Delivered to HRL leadership on the morning of Tuesday, January 21st*

**Main Concerns**

* Those living in North Ave could lose their current room for next year
* Those applying for housing next year want to know which buildings will be available before they apply

**Questions**

* Will certain floors or certain buildings be reserved for 2nd Year Housing?
* When will we know which buildings will be designated for which cohort of residents?
* What will the housing application process look live for those wanting to live in North Ave?
   * Will there be a preference question for different buildings? floors?
* Will 2nd Years be required to live in North Ave?
* What options for housing are available for 2nd Years?
* How will this impact West Campus and West Campus apartments?
* Will those applying to live in North Ave (upperclassmen) who don’t currently live in North Ave have a lower chance at getting into a room in North Ave for next year?
* Will a full suite of roommates be prioritized over random self-select applicants?
* Will 2nd Year students be required to live on campus?
* Are time slots based on credit hours, payment date, or application date?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Based on our discussion from yesterday, we can provide the following immediate information:

* The buildings and/or floors that are chosen for the 2nd-year living communities will be directly based on the number of applications for each housing community
* At this time, the exact buildings and/or floors that will be selected for the 2nd-year community are not known and have not been decided
* We should find out soon after the housing application closes (Feb. 23th) the buildings and/or floors that will be chosen for the 2nd-year communities (estimated between Feb 24rd - Feb 28th)

Can transfer students apply to the BS/MS programs?,"I know that they need teacher recommendation to take graduate courses but I want to know if I transfer my junior year (spring or fall), if that program would be available to me",1579726544,1,0
SAT II Subject Test For Transfer Credit Question,"Hello. I've just been accepted early, and I'm looking to earn some transfer credits before I start freshman year. On the school's website ([http://catalog.gatech.edu/academics/undergraduate/credit-tests-scores/sat-ii-subject-tests/](http://catalog.gatech.edu/academics/undergraduate/credit-tests-scores/sat-ii-subject-tests/)) it says that some SAT II Subject Tests taken before my enrollment date can be used to earn credit for certain classes.

My question is about the ""enrollment date"" part. By ""before my enrollment date"", does it mean that I can take a test this summer before I come on campus this fall, or does it mean that I can only use tests taken before the date that I paid my enrollment deposit?

I know this sounds like a dumb question, but I want to make sure that I don't waste my time, money, and effort on taking a test that isn't worth anything to me. I've looked on the school's website and on this sub and found no answers, so I'm hoping that there's someone on here that has done this before that can help.",1579724635,1,0
The End of an Era,"&gt; To the Georgia Tech Community:  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Provost Rafael L. Bras has informed me of his intention to step down from his position, approximately Sept. 1, and continue at Tech as a professor.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Provost Bras joined Georgia Tech in 2010, and his decade of leadership as the Institute’s chief academic officer has resulted in some of Tech’s largest and most innovative strides in higher education, and I am glad that he will remain at Tech as a professor.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;His legacy and influence are evident in the more than 300 faculty members hired in the past decade and in the new major initiatives in Panama and China. His passion also ignited what is known today as Georgia Tech Arts, a dynamic program that has brought several extraordinary pieces and collections to campus and continues to help the campus community find their own creative voice. He has been a true champion and leader for bold institutional initiatives like Library Next, the launch of the Online Master of Science programs, and the Commission on Creating the Next in Education, among others.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Truly, Provost Bras’ vision has been a driving force for Tech as we have sought creative solutions for how we might bring new programs and pedagogies to life and open Georgia Tech to the world.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;In the coming weeks, I will announce a search committee and provide further details about the transition. Meanwhile, Provost Bras will continue to serve in his current role as the search begins for his successor.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I hope you will join me in congratulating and thanking Provost Bras for his service to Tech and for his greater contributions as a leader, scholar, and educator over a career that has spanned nearly 45 years. I certainly wish him and his wife Pat all the best.

**PROJECT: Web components development with StorybookJS**Time: 15-20 hours per weekDuration: Spring 2020 / expansion through mid-June if additional targets met

This project will adapt the newest GT campus theme and common editorial design elements to CMS-agnostic web components.

We will create content components from existing UI/UX research and use cases, along with identified needs from editors.

The finalized components and Storybook instance are expected to be production ready and usable for work portfolios. We will make sure all production work is accessible and identified with your involvement.

This project requires proficiency with:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Git
* Web components (litelement [https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/), direct ECMAscript either)
* Producing clear documentation

Highly preferred experience:

* Storybook JS, latest stable (v5.3.x - [https://storybook.js.org/](https://storybook.js.org/) )

**PROJECT: Knowledge base consolidation and customization**Time: 15-20 hours per weekDuration: Spring 2020 / expansion through mid-June if additional targets met

We need to streamline our internal documentation from the units. Many topics of existing FAQ / KB articles can be consolidated to a core topic with details attached for each unit. But we only want to display the unit specific details as appropriate on distributed sites.

This project will help us test and implement a common FAQ depot which then shares these core topics with the unit specifics selectively.

This project requires proficiency with:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Git
* JSON based data population
* Producing clear documentation

Highly preferred experience:

* Drupal 8 / JSON:API
* oembed or other remote loading shadowDom experience
* GT Plesk web hosting

We are also looking for 1-2 UNDERGRADUATE student workers for part time help with web development. The level of commitment should be at 12-20 hours per week. Work times are somewhat flexible (business hours needed, no nights or weekends) and the individual must be reliable. Hourly rates are competitive. Work environment is relaxed.

We maintain a variety of sites, primarily using Drupal and Wordpress content management systems. General computer experience is necessary, and a working knowledge of basic web design including:

* HTML
* CSS
* Github / version control

is required. Preferred experience includes:

* Javascript (vanilla or any framework)
* PHP
* Shell scripting
* or prior web design is a plus.

Individuals must be enrolled at Georgia Tech but may be taking a semester without classes.

This job entails maintaining existing Drupal and Wordpress sites, handling support tickets, performing CMS updates, formatting new pages and content, creating new sites, and some occasional scripting. The most important quality is a willingness to learn and a commitment to building positive client relationships.

How to recover from a disappointing start?,"So, I'm about to graduate but I want to stop a problem I've consistently had. I tend to be doing okay until the second test or project and then the bottom falls out of my grades. 

Taking ME capstone, Sys Lab, CS 2110, and CS 1332. I don't need the last two but I developed an interest in the material last summer. So far I'm tracking to make a B in everything, I need one more A to graduate with a 3.0 which I desperately want because of the job search. I could still easily make mistakes and earn a C in a couple of classes.

The CS classes confuse me. The tests/quizzes feel dead easy but I still make Bs. HW is easy.

SYS lab just feels really annoying, currently in the Thermal/Fluids/Heat transfer segment which is the material I struggle with the most.

Capstone fine but I'm scared it will become too much in about a month.

&amp;#x200B;

How do you recover in the middle of the semester when you have tons of stuff going on? Looking back I always felt like I could never regain my balance once things got hectic.  I'd panic about a test, mess up my sleep/eating/exercise schedule to take care of it, and then I would be off for weeks. Thanks for any advice.",1581200564,1,0
Advice for a European Exchange students,"Hey Yellow Jackets (I'm pretty sure that's your nickname)...

I'm a student from Madrid, Spain, attending a Mathematics and Physics double major at École Polytechnique in Paris, France. I just got accepted to go on exchange to GaTech for the first semester of my Junior year (August-December 2020) and I wanted to arrive there with the correct expectations so that I'm not overwhelmed/underwhelmed or surprised by anything.

So... Coming from a school that loves sodomizing their students with a heavy and hard workload, I'd love to have more of a 'chill' semester to be able to travel a bit and just have a nice experience. Is this a reasonable expectation or nah? 

Do you guys recommend having on-campus accommodation or better off-campus? If so, is there a specific area in Atlanta where most students live? I know nobody there, so sharing an apartment can be kind of hard...

Also, are there many exchange students, and if there are, do you guys know/mix with them or do they just mix between them (I say this cause American students in Europe like mixing between themselves). If there are any European students reading this, a short summary of your experience would be greatly appreciated!

Lastly, how's nightlife/social life in Atlanta/campus and how difficult is it to move around Atlanta/get to the city centre without having a car? Having lived in Madrid, London and Paris, 3 cities with great public transport I've moved most of my life in it, but I know American cities, in general, aren't that great in this aspect. I basically don't want to be stuck on campus for my 6 months of freedom.

P.S: I spent about 1-hour researching courses and chose some pretty random ones: Partial differential equations MATH4348, PHY2022 Stars Galaxies and the universe (I think this will be my 'easy' course), ME3345 Conduction and radiation heat transfer, ISYE3133 Engineering optimization, ECON3150 Economic and financial modelling. Any of them you would completely reject? How's the style of teaching (mostly you do your own studying at home or are there exercise sessions...).

Withdrawing from CS 2051?,"Hey guys, CS major here. CS 2051 has been a wild ride. I'm might get a C or a D. The prof has said she might scale but she'll only know at the end of the semester.

Final grades are calculated as follows: 20% midterm 1, 20% midterm 2, 30% HW, 30% Final Exam. I have an 80% average on the homework right now. And I just took midterm 1 an hour ago and I'm not feeling too good about it. 

Obviously I'm going to wait and see what I get on it. However, the withdrawal deadline (March 11th) is one day before Midterm 2. If I bombed this exam and got like a 50, then I don't think I'll do much better on the other exams and in that case, I'll be stuck with a C or a D. So the only thing I can base withdrawing on is this exam because there won't be another one before the deadline. 

 If I thought I was going to fail 2051, I would definitely withdraw before I let that happen, and then just take 2050 later. And I need a C to even pass.

I have not heard any reports of infection on campus, and panic is foolish and stupid. However, there's strong evidence supporting the story that the official numbers on infection and fatality rates coming from China are blatantly false and vastly understated. At best, we're dealing with something worse than the flu. At worst, we're dealing with a virus with a (POTENTIAL) 15% mortality rate (see the stories about the fluctuating Tencent numbers). 

Take preventative measures. Wash your hands more often. Educate yourself. Just be aware.

Oh, and don't be racist and assume Chinese students are the only ones who may be potentially transmissive. Chinese students are probably worried about their family back home, and we should support them as best as we can. Be nice to them (and everyone else).",1580972335,1,0

Severe Weather Possible Tomorrow,"  

# SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

**SUBJECT:** Severe Weather Possible Thursday AM

**SITREP #: 2020-2.1**

**ISSUED:** Wednesday, February 5, 2020 at 3PM

**OVERVIEW**

A deep upper level trough will push into the eastern half of the country overnight setting the stage for severe weather on Thursday. At the surface, we can expect a relatively strong cold front to impact the region tomorrow morning. We expect storms to develop along a squall line ahead of this front producing heavy rain, strong winds and possibly tornadoes *\[see figure 2, below\]*. Timing for our region should be between 9AM and 12PM. Rain may be heavy at times and may exceed 2 inches for the event. The Storm Prediction Center just expanded the Slight Risk area *\[see figure 1, below\]* to include the Metro Atlanta region, with a large area of Enhanced Risk to our south and east. In addition to the severe weather threat on Thursday, we may have some wrap around precipitation Friday morning in the form of light snow showers and flurries *\[see figure 3, below\]*. Expect much colder temperatures (mid 30s) Friday morning with breezy conditions. **However, we do not expect any impacts to roadways or travel on Friday.**

  

[Figure 1: Day 2 Convective Outlook \(SPC\)](https://i.redd.it/1d5kf721z5f41.gif)

**PRIMARY HAZARDS**

I should be doing work but,"This just another phase probably because it's Hell Week but I really hate how everyday is the same cyclical wake up, class, study, other work, eat, repeat. Feel like there's other stuff I want to learn and do and I know that I can dedicate time towards it but then I'll be upset when I don't do well in my classes--not necessarily because I didn't get the grade I wanted but because I'd feel like I'd have no right to be upset when I didn't ""give it my all"" for the class. In general, I really like the content in my classes but I hate the structure and feel like I have just enough time to learn for the test but not really appreciate the concepts because we'll be learning new material at the same time during test week so my focus is divided. My brain right now just feels very numb and it used to be a during-high-stress-time numb but its been feeling numb regularly everyday now. Like I need something to kickstart my brain nowadays, stress or caffeine, before the cloudiness goes away and I can be productive and ""awake"" if that makes sense. I'll joke around with my friends when I'm with them but in reality I feel very very empty inside. I don't really have that many close friends here but the ones I do have are clearly being hit hard this semester too so everybody's kind of grinding nonstop--just makes me think about post-college life when everybody splits apart for work relocation and stuff and I'm working a 9-5 financially stable office job but coming back to en empty apartment before repeating the next day.

I'm not totally sure I want to keep doing this anymore.,"Chances are, this ""mood"" will pass in three, four days and I'll be back to my regular ol' productive self. But I don't really know that I want to be here anymore. I don't really want to keep studying. I don't feel very smart - or anywhere near as smart as my classmates. I don't think I can even ""fake it 'til I make it"" nearly as well as they can. I don't know why I'm here. I was pushed into this school by my parents to study something that I never really had any interest in but would ""earn me a lot more money"" than any actual interests I had - interests that I don't even have the time and energy to pursue ""to balance out the studying."" I feel shriveled up, grey, and like a husk. I wouldn't even mind crying right now because that way, it's at least some emotional release. But I can't because I don't even feel human anymore. I've dehumanized myself, or at least enabled it. There'll be times where I'll laugh, but it just sounds hollow to my ears, and it's always fleeting. I haven't felt anything but stress, anger, and sadness during the few times I haven't been apathetic because I've just shut down completely. I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. All this time, I've been lying to myself in the hopes that if I do it enough, I'll start believing it, but it's been three years now and I'm tired. I am young in age, and yet I don't feel like it. I hold no excitement for tomorrow, and if anything, there are days I wish tomorrow would never come.

I have gone to the counseling center here. When I was referred to the psychiatric department to help me find someone off-campus because ""we can't handle issues that are that deep,"" I went to Stamps and I found a therapist. Once a week, I took MARTA, sat in on my session, and paid the fee before taking MARTA back. Things got a little better. But then the 2.5, sometimes 3 hours needed for that trip was too much. Even once a week. So I stopped. But I thought I was okay because I was in a better place than before. I thought I could take it. But I can't. The hopeless emptiness runs in me too deep to dig out. And it's grown too large for me to ignore, and I don't have the strength anymore to keep trying.

Maybe I'm just exceptionally weak-minded. Literal thousands of people have graduated in front of me. People come back and say, ""It gets better, it was definitely worth it."" And that's great. I'm glad for those people. But cowards just don't have the resilience for this, so call me the biggest one of all.

I don't want to be here anymore.",1580787749,1,0
I just didn't get the point of the info session,"Hi buddies, 

I attended an info session tonight. 

So the key takeaways were: 1, The HR was not taking any resume from the student.

2, The employees from the firm didn't even bother to read candidates' resumes quickly.

3, The current employees acted really arrogantly. It's like they got the most fantastic job in the world but still have better things to do so they don't have much time for the students and they are superior than our students. 

To be honest, I feel surprised to see this, especially when considering that this info session is hosted by a big firm at a prestigious university. If you happened to attend this info session, you know which firm I am talking about. I really don't know the point for them to even have this info session. I interviewed with this firm last year, and I know they are somewhat unprofessional but this time they really broke their reputation.",1580786247,1,0

"Kemp's ""Game-Changer""","From the Washington Post:

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) said Thursday that he had only just learned people can spread the coronavirus without showing symptoms, despite warnings of that possibility dating to late January. The governor’s remark came as he explained why he was issuing a stay-at-home order, after previously resisting the step, which has been taken by at least 30 states. Kemp maintained that more drastic measures were not warranted — until learning of the “game-changer.” “What we’ve been telling people from directives from the CDC, for weeks now, that if you start feeling bad, stay home,” he said during a news conference. “Those individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt bad. We didn’t know that until the last 24 hours.”",1585863150,1,0

Housing Impact Update [Post 8],"Good evening all,

It's been a tough few weeks-there's no getting around that. I do hope that each and every one of you (as well as your families) are healthy and well. We've gotten quite a few questions regarding current on-campus living conditions and below you'll find the answers we've received. For our recent residents now residing off campus, be on the lookout for an email in the near future regarding a few initiatives we're working on to improve off-campus community and make the best with the circumstances we've been given.

**Q&amp;A Regarding On-Campus Living Conditions, Moving &amp; Residential Support**

*What cleaning measures are being taken before residents move into their new assignments?* 

* In order to maintain social distancing practices, only one person will be assigned to an apartment. This will allow everyone to have access to their own bathroom, kitchen and living room. Each of these apartments will be thoroughly cleaned by Housing staff before a resident moves in. The Housing Custodial staff use a disinfectant that is listed by the Center for Biocide Chemistry as a Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Fighting Product. Housing Custodial staff have been and will continue to clean high touch/commonly touched areas multiple times a day in occupied buildings. 

*Since we're moving residents to new buildings, will new parking spaces be available to those that have cars on campus?* 

* Students will be able to contact Parking and have their parking lot changed. Call 404-385-7275 to have your lot assignment changed.  

 *How should current residents go about requesting assistance for moving to their new assignment?*

* Boxes and tape are still available to residents at this time. Students seeking additional assistance should place a request at [information@housing.gatech.edu](mailto:information@housing.gatech.edu), and we will do our best to accommodate you.    

*Which buildings are being utilized for consolidation?*

* The buildings being used are Maulding, all Eighth Apts, North Avenue North, North Avenue West, GLC, and Tenth and Home. 

*Of the residents staying on campus, what percentage are being asked to move?*

* Approximately 40% of students that were approved to stay were asked to move. 

*Given that the moving time tickets could interfere with online class sessions, if neither of the options that are provided for residents to select are available to them, will individuals be able to request an entirely new set of options by emailing* [*information@housing.gatech.edu*](mailto:information@housing.gatech.edu)*?* 

* Residents will be able to select time ticket preferences within the April 1st - April 3rd timeframe using the link in the email with their new assignment. If they have any questions, they can email HRL at [information@housing.gatech.edu](mailto:information@housing.gatech.edu).

*With a limited number of SSMs on campus, what resources will be provided from HRL for individuals on campus for the duration of this semester?* 

* We will have about 40 RAs on campus to assist with resident needs. They will be placed within our consolidated communities. We look forward to offering virtual opportunities for residents to connect with each other to limit all physical interaction in the halls. We will also have Hall Directors on campus to support residents.    

As always, should you have any additional questions, you can add them to the [Housing Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/fle8pu/megathread_questions_related_to_housing/) or drop them below and we'll answer questions as appropriate. At this time, we do not have any further information regarding the status of summer housing. If you have any areas of advocacy you believe RHA can help out with, you can send them over to [advocacy@rha.gatech.edu](mailto:advocacy@rha.gatech.edu).

I'm trying to get a sense of whether Gatech students perceive busyness here at Georgia Tech as a sign of status. I'm a professor here--I teach the happiness course--and I was trying to do a formal research project with four students this semester about this question. However, given the current COVID-19 situation, we weren't able to launch that project. 

We were curious about this topic because there's some psychological research suggesting that upper class professionals (like doctors and lawyers) use busyness as a sign of status. 

Here are examples of what I mean at Tech:

* Someone takes a high number of credit hours because they expect people will admire them for doing that
* Someone does a lot of extracurriculars because it looks good
* Someone brags about how little sleep they get or how late they sleep as to show how busy they are.
* Someone hides the fact that they go to sleep at a reasonable time
* Someone conspicuously shows how busy their schedule is, e.g., talking about how many things they have to do or how many events they have on their schedule.
* Someone exaggerating or misrepresenting how busy they are

Does this seem common at Tech? By common, I mean it's more than just a few people doing this. Feel free to drop any anecdotes. I'm not going to use any of this for a formal published analysis. I'm just trying to informally figure out how people feel about the issue. Thanks!",1585771381,1,0

My one pet peeve about online classes,"Today I just had an online math exam through Gradescope and I just realized how easy it is cheat. I am an honest person and I would never cheat. But it would ridiculously easy to get someone else to take your exam for you or even communicate with other classmates during the test
.The professor could give a really hard test like mine did and the class average could still be high because of cheating. I think professors should take that into consideration when it comes to curving. It would be unfair for honest students like me to study and completely fail a really hard exam while others are putting in absolutely no work and getting 100s which would mean that the class is not curved.

Why am I working my ass off if the grading scheme for my courses makes an A so hard to achieve. Tech doesn’t do B+’s either. 2 of my B’s are going to be around an 87. I feel like I should just stop doing assignments at this point. All non-tests have such little weight that getting zeroes on them wouldn’t hurt me. 

Should I just transfer? I feel like I’m doing just as much or more than those who I see succeeding, but I’m still struggling to maintain a 3.2. Am I dumb? Should things be just as easy and straightforward as my professors and TAs say they are? Does anyone even give a shit?

Response to my USG complaint about P/F,"The University System of Georgia is aware some institutions around the nation have decided to shift to pass/fail grading after transitioning to remote education. We are confident our students will rise to the challenge, and the USG will do everything in its power to help them do so. We trust our faculty to teach and grade students effectively.

In times of adversity, we should reach higher, not lower. Maintaining high academic standards is critical to the success of USG students now and in the future. Continuing letter grading for the final few weeks of the semester will allow faculty to assess the performance of students in the same manner as they always have. The USG is confident that faculty and students will rely on the resilience they have shown thus far and continue to meet our high standards.

While online instruction will be new to many, thousands of USG students and faculty have already experienced it through nearly 11,000 online course sections offered prior to USG’s temporary shift to all-online instruction.

"Should I go to GT over UIUC (in state) for CS? Honest Opinion Please, I’m really confused","I guess part of my confusion is that my parents are telling me that GT, as an overall school, has a ""bigger brand value"" (read: prestige lol) than UIUC. They show me stats that have GT students being recruited more heavily by FAANGs and Wall Street Firms; whereas, UIUC has less recruited people, even with 30,000 more alumni. Plus, since I know that I want to get into AI/ML (along with Health Informatics), GT has a whole separate school with lotsa research funding and great faciliities (School of Interactive Computing) dedicated to it; whereas, at UIUC, it all comes under the umbrella of Grainger. I know that UIUC is a good program but do you think I should go for the in-state tuition (id be at a diff of 8-10k per year) if I personally feel a better fit with GT (where I can recuperate the extra money with coops, while gaining experience)? While I’m aware of its social shortcomings, I’ve really grown to love GT’s academic/nerdy environment and really see this as somewhere I could spend my next 4 years.
