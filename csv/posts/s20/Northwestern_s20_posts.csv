What are the best bathrooms to poop in?,"Yo waddup fellow cats
Have you ever had the urge to go number 2, only to stumble upon a nasty stall, or one full of people? 
Am currently writing this post while in this situation on the 2nd floor tech bathroom. 
Pls send your best spots to poop at based on these criteria. If there are enough spots, I’ll visit all of these within the quarter and compile a tier list.

When evaluating pls keep in mind the following criteria:
1) cleanliness
2) amount of ppl that normally frequent 
3) number of available stalls
4) accessibility to public
5) gender of bathroom (male stalls may be worse than females and vice versa)

For me, my top choice right now is the 3rd floor mixed bathroom at Francis searle.

ISP application,"Hi!

I'm currently writing my application to the ISP program (got into NU ED) and just have a few questions about the application for those who have applied to it/anybody who's willing to help. Thanks!

1. Since there are no word limits for each of the essay questions, how much should I write? Some of the questions are very open-ended (discuss interest in math/science, educational goals) and I feel like I could write wayyyy too much.
2. There's an essay question that says ""List your extracurricular activities. Please include the dates of participation,"" which should be pretty straightforward but seems a little vague. Should I copy what I had for the activities section in the Common App? I've been playing cello since elementary school and have played in a regional orchestra since middle school. Do I put down that I've played since elementary school or just list the regional orchestra? I know they probably won't care about this, but I'm a little stressed out, not going to lie.

How Feasible Is Study Abroad?,"Hey,

I'm currently planning my next few years at NU (Class of '24), and I have a few Q's about studying abroad:

1. I'm interested in studying at Sydney/Queensland University in Australia for one year (I checked in NU's website, they do offer the courses relevant to my major). **How likely is a student to receive an entire year at his top selected university, given he meets basic requirements?**
2. What is the advised/""typical"" time to study abroad? Sophomore Year? Junior Year?
3. I found a few blogs about students who studied at two separate locations during their year abroad. How common/likely is this? 
4. In case I attend an affiliated university, will I be fully immersed in the university? Do NU students typically study abroad in groups (with other NU students/American university students), or could I just as likely be the only NU student at the foreign university? I'm trying to understand what the social situation is like for study abroad..
5. I'm mostly looking to study abroad for the experience (and fun). Am I missing any reasons against studying abroad? (GPA impact/credit transfer issues/other institutional disadvantages)
6. Aside from the typical study abroad options, if you guys are familiar with ""special"" programs that aren't as easily found on the NU website, I'd be happy to hear more.

Mostly I'm wondering how sure I can be before coming into NU that the school will enable me to study abroad at my preferred universities.

Transfer SAT Scores,"Hi everyone,  


It's transfer season! Everyone's hard at work getting those apps in!

 I'm currently a sophomore at my local community college finishing up my last semester. On my transcript, there will be 2 semesters worth of grades (All A's) as well as in progress courses that relate to the major I would be going into if accepted at Northwestern. By the time I would attend, I would already have my associates degree. 

My question is, do my SAT scores still matter? My high school grades weren't terrible, though they weren't NU material either. I've become super involved in my school and am a part of the honors program. My SAT score though (taken in 2016!) have me fearing the worst.

Older Undergraduate Student,"Hey,

I was admitted into NU (Weinberg) for Fall '24, and I'll be a 24 y/o freshman. The school seems like the perfect fit for my academic interests, it's truly a dream school for me. The primary concern I still have before attending is whether I'll be able to find some sort of community that I can click with.

I'm definitely open-minded about befriending the younger students, but it'd be great to hear from current students/alumni whether there are some more students who started off a bit older (military veterans for example) - I was unable to find up-to-date stats about the students' age range. I'm familiar with the SPS program - I'm mostly referring to students who attend the Evanston campus regularly.

Also, it'd be nice to hear how integrated the undergrads are with grad students - Just to get a feel of how feasible it'd be to befriend grad students around my age.

Either way, any input on what to expect as a significantly older-than-average Freshman would be great  - My attitude is definitely positive even if there aren't many people my age, just trying to get a better feel of what to expect :).

I’m an incoming freshman looking to major in Econ, maybe minor in comp sci, and hope to get a certificate at Kellogg.

Current high school junior interested in ISP,"Hey r/Northwestern,
I’m a high schooler from California, and I’m extremely interested in the sciences. The ISP program at Northwestern is currently topping my college list, and I would apply Early Decision to Northwestern, as I’m fairly confident I could get into ISP if I’m admitted. The only problem is that I haven’t actually toured the campus in person, due to the Coronavirus. I was wondering if you would be willing to answer some of my questions about ISP and Northwestern in general to help me get a feel for the college in case I never get to see it before this fall.

1. How would you characterize the overall vibe of Northwestern? Is it more relaxed or competitive?

2. Which kinds of students are happy here? Which ones are not?

3. I know it gets really cold in the winter, but how oppressive actually is it?

4. How are the dorms? Are they divided by area of study?

5. What’s Evanston like?

6. Northwestern seems to have a better social scene than most of the schools on my list. How often are there parties, and do they revolve entirely around the Greek system?

Now for ISP specific questions:

7. Are the teachers for ISP more concerned about research than teaching, or do they make lectures engaging?

8. How much do ISP students interact with students from outside the program?

9. How much easier is it to get research opportunities while in ISP?

10. What’s the ISP house like?

11. Do ISP students have to take the same amount of core classes as the rest of Northwestern?

It’d help me a ton if you could answer just 1 or 2 of these, since I may not get the chance to see Northwestern in person. Thanks!",1587513212,2,0

Question about frats/social life,"Hi everyone. I was accepted to SESP which is awesome, and now I'm deciding between NU and one other school. The thing is I'm someone who doesn't really want to be in a frat. I like partying/drinking I just don't really see myself enjoying being in one. 

Be honest, whats the social life like for someone not in a frat? Are there still sufficient parties/events through other organizations? Should I try living in a res college then?

I ask because I love everything about NU but I've never been there and I'm afraid to go there and not find any friends bc i dont wanna rush.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

*When will I find out about housing/how does housing work?*  
[Check out this page for an overview of the new student housing process.](https://www.northwestern.edu/living/housing-options/housing-selection/new-students/index.html) The tl;dr goes like this: You'll fill out a housing contract sometime in April, where you will rank your top 5 or so housing options. Then, your housing and roommate assignments will be released sometime in early August. [Explore housing options here!](https://www.northwestern.edu/living/housing-options/undergrad-housing/index.html)

*Should I find a roommate or should I go random?*  
The housing contract has a very short questionnaire that is used to match you to a roommate. From my experience, there is not necessarily a higher ""success"" rate among people who picked their roommates compared to those who went random. So unless you care a lot about the type of person you want your roommate to be, I woud say it's not really worth the trouble to find yourself a roommate before you submit your application.

*Can I transfer schools?*  
Generally, yes. Transferring schools is pretty easy - just send an email to the registrar asking about it. You may have slightly more difficulty transferring into schools that are more specialized, like Bienen or School of Comm. Other than that, transferring is incredibly easy. I would, however, definitely do it before your first quarter so you can properly plan your schedule.

*How is ___ class? How is ___ professor?*  
CTECS are a great resource to learn about specific classes/teachers! They're anonymous reviews left by previous students and I've found them to be incredibly useful. You'll be able to access CTECS through Caesar once you have a netID. If possible, please check the CTECS before asking about a class here - if you still have questions after checking, then you can feel free to ask!

*Should I study computer science in McCormick or Weinberg?*  
In either school, the CS major will have the same requirements. The difference comes from whether you want to complete the McCormick basic requirements (like DTC and EA) or the Weinberg ones (distros and language). A McCormick degree will be engineering-heavy while a Weinberg one will feel more liberal-arts. Neither is ""better"" for a CS career. It entirely depends on what you want out of your college experience.

*Other questions?*  
Before asking a question here, it would be awesome if you could do a quick search of the subreddit, just to see if it's come up before! If that doesn't help then feel free to come back here and ask.

Advice needed for fulfilling the basic science requirements for McCormick,"For my intended major, I'm going to have to take 3 or 4 basic science classes.

Premed at NU + MSP?,"Hi guys, I'm beyond excited to have been admitted RD into NU!! it feels like a dream. Legit since freshman year this has been my dream school!

I am, however, on the fence about committing, and it's mostly because of how hard pre med is at NU. I have a state school nearby that has a 75% matriculation into med school rate (compared to NU's 80%), and I'm trying to decide whether I should attend NU or go to the state school (money isn't a factor, both cost the same).

I've heard and read a lot that pre med is hella difficult (at my state school, its not as difficult), since NU is a T10 level pre med program. This mainly scares me because I do want to have at least a 3.7+ (I know the average is about 3.65 but I also know that this average is an average of a bunch of smart people since NU does admit the best of the best :) ) 

I just wanna say I'm a hardworker..I will put work in and I'm smart BUT by no means am i brilliant. I will try my best to maintain a high gpa but is it possible? Like for somebody who will work hard? I've heard that classes are curved very heavily and you are often pitted against ur peers who are generally very intelligent. This worries me..that even if I do the work I may not succeed. I don't want to have to take a gap year before getting into med school either.

Anyways, I'd take any advice you guys have to offer. Another thing pulling me to NU is that I'd possibly be able to explore global health and polisci in addition to pre med and i'd love to do that!

However, the Willard and Chapin facilities just look SO much nicer. It also seems that they have some more opportunities/events and fellows, and look a bit more established as well. Am I correct in saying that, or is it just bc the CRC website isn't the greatest?

Thinking of staying in research/academia and getting a PhD but there’s also a chance I’d go BS/MS path and move to industry. If anyone has thoughts on these programs and paths, that would be super appreciated!

Things I’d like to know:

1) How supportive are faculty? Are they approachable (during office hours or emails) and open to help?

2) How is the general student community at Northwestern (by comparison I’ve heard students from the other school say their peers are all driven and busy, so a vaguer description of the student community like that would be appreciated)?

3) Res life? Could I get into the green house res in first year because it sounds really cool haha. Otherwise how is res/dining?

4) City life and campus life? No specific questions about this but if anyone has thoughts on like city/campus vibes and stuff to do I haven’t visited and would really appreciate it.

5) Research? Chances of getting into research in freshman year, flexibility moving between labs or talking to different profs, getting involved in exciting research, etc. 

6) Nice study spaces, coffee shops, bubble tea? (I have my priorities straight lmao)

Thank you so much for any help!!",1587844886,3,0
McCormick (external) transfer: how would I complete all the requirements in three years?,"I'm pretty sure i'm just missing something and this is a super dumb question but I'm going to ask it anyway: according to McCormick's website the B.S. in computer science requires you take 48 units. Based on my understanding, each class is one unit. Assuming I enter Northwestern as a sophomore with only about 8-10 units, that would leave me with about 38 units left to fill. Assuming I take 4 credits every quarter (which I think is the usual amount?) that would mean that each school year I would take 12 units, and for my three years at northwestern I would only take 36, falling two short of the needed 38. Can someone tell me where i'm messing up here? thanks",1587841790,1,0

COVID-19 MEGATHREAD (please put all related comments/questions/information here),"I'm making a new megathread where I can edit the OP in an effort to make sure everyone is as informed as possible.

First off: There are currently *no confirmed cases* of COVID-19 on Northwestern campus. (Last updated 3/13, 1:23AM.)

There have been a couple of rumors going around and a few incidents of precautionary measures taken by the university due to *potential* cases. Once again - none confirmed.

Things that have happened include:  
- A CS PhD student being taken to the hospital. This has been confirmed to not be due to COVID-19. [Source from Discord.](https://prnt.sc/rfmw9w) Ian Horswill is a CS professor.  
- An email sent to the residents of the second floor of Shepard Hall warning about possible exposure. This was followed up by a second email stating there are no confirmed cases on campus.

It's extremely important to remember that tensions are high right now, and panic and misinformation thrive in this sort of environment. If you have any further information, feel free to post it here, but also remember to check your sources.

Finally, there is a petition going around that will be sent to Morty at 10am tomorrow asking him to require that professors cancel finals or hold them remotely. [Access it here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18mOYCC4Xn_ucfPvcHYFTYGYzRskJ4-Y8JNA1WUW1jxI/edit?usp=drivesdk)",1584081221,1,0

Northwestern Master of Science in Law input,"Hello everyone,

I've been getting a lot of emails from the Northwestern Law School about the MSL (Master of Science in Law) program. I even attended an open house this past weekend to see what it is about. But I also wanted to get more input and perspective, so I was wondering if anyone in the subreddit has heard of it/know of anyone who is in it (or are alumni of the program)?

Background about me: graduated with BS in Neuroscience and BA in Psychology in 2019, realized that I didn't want to go to medical school, thought about career changes in data analysis, business, etc. When I came across this program, I thought ""why not check it out?"" I think I like that it's very unique and can cater the STEM people to the business law and entrepreneurship since it could be a way for me to integrate the different fields that I've been pondering about. Any input about this would be very helpful. Thank you!",1583784554,1,0
"[Coronavirus] Proper hygiene is not enough; this isn't an economic decision, it's a moral one.","**Before you read let me clarify** that if you are prone to anxiety about this, take it with a major grain of salt, or don't read it altogether. I'm not saying you should let this be a fear that takes over your life, that's not healthy. I just want to explain why it should be taken more seriously. 

Further, 
I'm not giving medical advice, I'm not pre-med, but I (believe) I have a better than average understanding of disease spread. Not stating anything here as definitive. I did, however, spend a very, very long amount of my time researching all perspectives on Coronavirus (I have close relatives with weakened immune systems) and want to offer my opinion.  

This is also particularly because of the highly upvoted post about proper hygiene so spring Q doesn't get cancelled, like other schools have. 
While people should definitely have proper hygiene, that's a preventative but non-comprehensive measure. 

**So let's get to it:**

If it hits it us it will still spread (a conservative estimate is 3^n, 3 people infected for each person infected - the worst case scenario is 70% worldwide contraction (WORST CASE) peaking in a month (a lot of people underestimate exponential growth), and **fast** (people in dorms would be in major risk) and affect even the good hygiene people (you're bound to touch your face at some point, no matter what). People need to stop comparing it to the flu - the flu has treatment, this does not. Italy had 14 cases 2 weeks ago, and has 366 dead (166 just yesterday, including leader of democratic party who said to ""keep going as normal"" and 7500+ cases now, and that's only the confirmed ones. Trump Admin is treating it as the Flu. He tweeted today it's just like the flu. Maybe situation @ CPAC will get them to take it more seriously, but that's wishful thinking. Illinois has had over 20 confirmed cases, and isn't taking any measures differently from Italy. And to those who would argue the money for tuition, I posit that low-income/low-resource students would be MOST affected by an outbreak. The e-mail they sent today shows the university's starting to tell instructors to cut us slack. 

What I want to make clear is unless there is a sudden peak and reverse in the next two weeks, NU should likely move classes online, as Princeton and Stanford have. This isn't a money issue; it's health and that's a human right. There are students here with underlying conditions that put them particularly at risk. Death rate figures are still extremely variable, and we can't count on reliable facts from CDC so the best measure to take is airing on the side of caution. For people that want to compare it to SARS and MERS, check coronainfo.xyz and look at the insane exponential difference between COVID and these. I don't mean this post to cause hysteria; but I think people are being too relaxed about it, which was (Italy, Iran, China's mistake, yet Korea took it seriously and contained it), and politicians in BOTH parties will seek to minimize panic, not give out facts. 

We don't know if it has permanent effects. We honestly don't know anything. People who ""recovered it"" have re-contracted it two weeks later - does it lay dormant? Do we ever gain immunity? What are the long-lasting effects, and what do they depend on? Tons of wild outcomes keep coming out, some not even reliable. Unless you have the answers to all these questions, you can't encourage people to relax and act like nothing's going on, telling them to just keep washing your hands a lot. 

If the situation continues to exponentially grow (which I and many others expect it to, no signs of stopping - unlike SARS and MERS did in warmth, it's spreading just fine in southern hemisphere in summertime), for NU to give take home finals or do spring Q online is not just the responsible choice, it's the morally correct choice. Yes, we pay a lot in many ways, but our health is more important than any sum of money.",1583781922,1,0

Northwestern can't actually use its endowment for a bailout,"There's lots of anger circulating about all these big name colleges with huge endowments not refunding tuition etc. I completely understand the frustration and have experienced the same. But a balanced perspective for it is to understand that with endowments, as [Harvard explains on their site](https://www.harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/endowment) there is a ""a common misconception that endowments, including Harvard’s, can be accessed like bank accounts, used for anything at any time as long as funds are available. In reality, Harvard’s flexibility in spending from the endowment is limited by the fact that it must be maintained in perpetuity and that it is largely restricted.""

I just bring this up to say NU doesn't have a 11,000,000,000 saving account that Morty and the bois are using on blow. If people defer enrollment, our school, which gives us employment prospects, will substantially suffer, both financially and in its academic programs (they'll be forced to cut necessary programs like humanities and some social sciences that wouldn't be deemed essential enough). I've considered this and decided I would rather support them and use that time continuing to learn (the economy is in the gutter anyway, what would anyone do in a gap year). 

Don't mean any controversy with this, just wanted to offer up the perspective. Everyone has the right to do as they please with their tuition dollars.",1589503888,3,0
I'm concerned about NU implementing a pitfall similar to the pass/no pass conundrum in the fall,"For those who don't know, pass/no pass (in general, not for this quarter) issue arises from making it optional (but not really), thereby letting students with more resources take it for a grade, with a higher likelihood of succeeding, and less privileged students who must work/etc might have to choose p/np as their only recourse. 

Now, what I'm worried is gonna happen is it's just about confirmed that fall won't be close to normal. For those who might not have seen[, Hagerty essentially admitted on-campus presence if it happens will be voluntary/opt-in](https://dailynorthwestern.com/2020/05/12/campus/in-interview-interim-provost-kathleen-hagerty-talks-fall-quarter/). Now, employers are surely gonna feel that an online education is not as valuable as an in-person one, and that's where the problem comes in. I imagine that NU would want to make/add a note on students who opted online vs. in person on transcripts, since they must maintain a ""standard of excellence"" for employers. As someone who's compromised, I have no shot of returning in fall, but thankfully in my field transcript doesn't matter. For others though, who won't have any option, people with immune issues will be forced to likely get the stamp on their transcript saying they took classes online, and a major part of the value proposition of coming to this school will be robbed from them - they'll be looked down upon compared to people who will be able to make it on campus. 

I'm super open to hearing other perspectives, and if someone thinks I'm wrong, I really would love to be on this. I wanted to broach it now so people are aware of this. Hope everyone is staying safe and well. Go cats.",1589503285,1,0
Transfer concerned about social life,"Hey guys, so I was recently admitted as a transfer student to Northwestern, which I am ecstatic about, but I do have a few concerns about the social scene. I'm coming from a state school with really active nightlife (bars, apartment crawls, student org parties, GREEK LIFE), which is actually one of the few things I really like about it, and I was wondering how different this would be at Northwestern. I was also admitted to a school with a social scene similar to my old school, so this is a factor in my decision on where to commit.

From what I've heard about NU, it's difficult to get into bars unless you're 21+ and most people go to parties hosted by the clubs they are part of. I would appreciate any insight on whether this is true and also on the following questions:

1. Do students under 21 go to Chicago for nightlife often, if ever?
2. Do students ever go to nearby Chicago universities for parties?
3. Do you have to be part of Greek life to get into frat parties after rush? (I'm a girl, if that makes a difference)
4. Are frat parties mostly a freshman thing?
5. How often does the typical NU student go out? What about you?

My father is a Northwestern graduate student (class of somewhere late 80s) and that got me thinking about my own graduate outlook.

While the research I have done has turned up a lot of support for engineering and health, I know they have a F&amp;B geared focus and would love to hear from any alumni that attended the program with that focus.

Housing for Transfer,"Hi, I'm a rising sophomore and an incoming transfer to Northwestern! I had a few questions about the housing process:

1. As a transfer, how much say do I have in what dorm I want? Am I more likely than not stuck in Foster-Wallace?
2. To the extent that I do have a choice, what would you recommend as the best housing for an incoming sophomore? I definitely want to be on north campus and be a part of the social scene/frats.
3. Lastly, does anyone have general advice about being a transfer? Mainly, I'm worried about being able to meet new people and fit in at a new school, particularly if I'm in a dorm that isn't as social. Any advice or tips or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

transfer student deciding between northwestern and another college,"hi everyone! i'm currently feeling pretty stressed because i have to choose between two schools that are absolutely amazing. i'm leaning toward my other option (top 3 LAC), but i feel like i haven't given northwestern a chance simply bc i found out about my other school a lot earlier. to this end, i was hoping current students could provide me with some insight into a few areas.

1. How cutthroat is Northwestern? at my previous school, students rarely talked about grades in an unhealthy-competitive way, and i really appreciated the collaborative environment that could be felt in the classrooms and on campus.

2. How stressful are students in general? more specifically, how is the academic rigor of Northwestern's Political Science and Economics majors? I know NW's profs, especially in these two fields, are amazing experience-wise, but how approachable are profs (at NW in general, and in these departments specifically?) By approachable, I more or less mean do you get the sense that your professors genuinely care about wanting to see you succeed? Also, is there any grade deflation/inflation in these majors?

3. How large are class sizes? I loved being in seminars with 15-20 students maximum, which is a huge reason why i really like LACs in general. I fear that at a larger school like NW, class sizes will inherently be larger and thus the overall learning experience will be diminished, and the ability to build strong relationships with profs will be more difficult. Is there any truth to that?

4. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to visit campus so my introduction to campus is a bunch of youtube tour videos lol. What are your general thoughts about campus and campus vibes? Do you feel inspired on campus, even during the winter time? I guess a better way of phrasing it is does campus feel consistently lively, or fluctuations between lively in the spring and absolute misery in the winter lol

5. Career wise, I'm looking to go into management consulting after college, and likely law afterward. I know Northwestern is a target for MBB and finance, but I'm def not looking to stay in the Chicago area after graduation. Does Northwestern place well for MBB, specifically in California or NYC?

6. Also career wise, my prior institution was pretty weak when it came to the career office. How helpful is Northwestern's career office in helping with internship opportunities, connecting with alumni, etc.

7. lastly, what is the thing that you love most about NW? 

while i'd obv appreciate if people could address all of these, i'd still love to here if anyone just wants to go in-depth about one of these points. thanks guys :)",1589009461,1,0

Stress at Northwestern?,"I was just admitted to McCormick for the class of '24, and I am having a difficult time choosing between NU and another really prestigious, academically rigorous university (EDIT: it's Princeton).

While the other college I'm considering is cheaper (cost isn't a factor) and super close to home, from the Zoom chats I've been attending, it seems like everyone there--especially engineering students--is always stressed and there is a high level of competition between students. Furthermore, it seems like the culture of the school is ""study-study-study,"" and no one really attends the athletic events. And one last thing: I live about 40 minutes away from campus, and while I recognize the benefits of staying close to home, the idea of leaving Pennsylvania only to end up in New Jersey is quite unexciting.

On the other hand, I know NU is part of the Big 10 and there is undoubtedly more school spirit. Plus, it seems to me that NU students know how to party amidst rigorous academics, unlike the students at similarly prestigious institutions. And, while I've never visited NU or even been to Illinois, I've heard the campus is gorgeous (the lake!!!).

That being said, I'm wondering how stressed the students (especially engineers) are at NU. I know the quarter system can be a cause of stress for some people because of its pacing, but coming from a high school with block scheduling (4 classes per semester), I've come to enjoy fast-paced learning with brief classes because heavy learning in a lighter courseload has helped me absorb the material.

Masters in Analytics Questions,"Hello NU Subreddit!

Currently I'm an admitted student for Masters in Analytics program, starting August 2020. Is there any current student or alums who would have some time to answer a few questions? It's mostly about self-doubt (it might be some form of imposter syndrome).

Some background: Graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology with a BS in Applied Math, minors in Chem and Econ. Have been employed as a software analyst working with SQL for the past two years.

I'm mostly worried about my inadequate preparation in programming. Though I am familiar with IT systems from my work with SQL, my programming experiences have been limited to 2-3 courses taken over my undergrad career (1 semester of Python, 1 semester of R, 1 semester of SAS, 2 semesters of MATLAB). Despite my strong background in math, I am not confident I will succeed due to my shortcomings in CS.

Best way to approach studying CS and Physics?,Greetings. I just got accepted to northwestern and I'm trying to figure out the best way to approach studying both cs and physics.

If I do get in to MMSS, I am willing to consider transferring to Weinberg and switching to Econ/CS.

Would like advice from McCormick people,So I was recently accepted to McCormick as an Electrical Engineering major. I am struggling to figure out if I want to attend Northwestern or my state school. Both would be relatively the same price. At the state school I would be given a lot of credit because of AP and Dual Enrollment whereas at NU it is iffy. I really want a 3.5 gpa and I know I would basically be guaranteed that at my state school. The quarter system scares me a little and with the research I have done I heard classes are toughhh especially in McCormick. Does anyone in McCormick have advice of keeping a 3.5 or just my situation in general?,1585887184,1,0

Should I commit yet?,"Hello. I was accepted RD and have every intention of committing. However, I noticed that my financial aid checklist is still not complete.

A few days ago, I emailed a picture of my passport to the appropriate office and thought that would be over. Today, I checked my portal and saw that it was still marked as not received. I realized that since the school is mostly closed, people might not be there to process my file or they might be very busy with other concerns. They could be short-staffed for all I know. This makes my mom and dad very hesitant to let me commit, but I really want to so I can stop stressing and start arranging things with a possible roommate.

Petition - Tuition/Fees Reduction for Spring 2020 at NU,"Sharing this Petition for Tuition / Fee Reduction for Spring 2020 at Northwestern. 

***https://www.change.org/p/northwestern-university-tuition-fees-reduction-for-spring-2020?source\_location=topic\_page***

I've copied and pasted below something that a classmate of mine put together here at Kellogg which I believe embodies what a lot of us are feeling here at the business school.

*To the wider Kellogg community: It is discouraging to see that the university leadership has chosen to keep tuition constant despite the Spring Quarter being moved online. The lack of rationale/candor for doing so, exhibited in the university’s vague statement that “Northwestern will continue to provide a high-quality education, whether remotely or in person, so tuition will still be charged at the same rate for Spring Quarter,” is unsatisfactory. It is easy to preach “brave leadership”, but quite another to practice it by breaking ranks from other leading universities and doing the right thing, especially given the uncertain economic climate that students are graduating into. A collection of Kellogg students took the attached list of arguments pro tuition adjustment to the Kellogg administration and the Northwestern Provost to lobby on behalf of the wider student body – an executive summary is set forth below:*

*1. Online learning represents a fundamentally new product warranting new, fair pricing*

*2. Students should not bear the brunt of the financial burden themselves (as would be the case if they paid regular tuition for an online service) and Kellogg/Northwestern has access to a multi-billion dollar endowment that can be accessed in times of crisis* 

*3. Kellogg/Northwestern will ultimately benefit from good faith pricing as students (i.e. future alumni) will remember the actions of the administration during this time*

*4. Kellogg should align its actions with its ethos of brave leadership and not take a ""follow the leader"" approach to tuition reduction*

*The way this crisis is handled will assuredly impact Northwestern and Kellogg for years to come – both in terms of matriculation and alumni donations. In this vein, I personally do not identify with the decisions made by Northwestern and Kellogg. I would urge you, fellow Kellogg students/alumni, to directly reach out to the Kellogg Deans, Northwestern Provost, and Northwestern President if you are similarly disheartened by today’s determination, so that they can receive a fulsome (and unignorable) account of how their decision has impacted you. At the very least, I believe we deserve transparency by the administration.*",1585584064,1,0
