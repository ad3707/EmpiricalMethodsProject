Calc 3 with Inbar Klang?,Anyone took calc 3 with him? How’s he? How’s the class?,1580086686,1,0
Verma ML vs Paisley ML,"Currently caught trying to decide between verma's ML (COMS 4771) or John Paisley's ML (ELENE 4720).

I was surprised by how challenging Verma's calibration homework was (HW0), but don't know a great deal about 4720.

Based on what I've read, Verma's ML is very theory heavy - John's class is titled ""Machine Learning for Signals, Information &amp; Pattern Recognition"" so I'm guessing that it may be a little less heavy on the theory and some balance between theory and practice.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone taken either and can give me a take?

I'm fine with multi-dimensional statistics and bayesian stats but not too sure I'm quite ready for high dimensional convex analysis and proof only exams!

Advanced Programming or Data Structures,"I have one slot left for my final semester as a senior. I study statistics and went hard on the math and theory aspects of machine learning. But in my research my roadblock has been my programming. I can program well in python and rudimentarily in java, but I find that because I taught myself programming from scratch (not under a formal course environment), my code is messy and I’m not organized in my workflow. I also have no knowledge of any CS.

I was hoping to take either advanced programming and data structures to improve my programming but also have a deeper understanding in CS. For Statistical ML research, which would be more useful for me? Thanks.",1579824828,1,0

Is there anything I should look for in deciding which one I should keep?  They're total opposites in how they're taught.  Do people try to avoid those giant courses?  The largest class I've ever been in was like 40 people and I just transferred to Columbia.

"Living north of 125th, along Broadway - safety, quality of life?","Hey everyone, so this is my third time coming to the CU area for a short-term (2.5 month) research visit, and I'm thinking about housing. Previously, I've gotten housing through CU's off-campus housing assistance program, but I don't think I get the best deals. I've always stayed below 125th nearby campus, but on Airbnb there are some cheaper and more updated-looking apartments north of 125th that seem tempting, specifically west of Broadway near the 1 train stops at 137th, 145th and 157th streets. I'm wondering about safety and quality of life. For safety, I've literally never been to the area, so I'd like some advice about the safety situation at night, since I'll be getting off the subway there around 9pm on weekdays. Previously, I used to walk home from the 125th ACBD stop thru Morningside Park every evening without a problem, and I'm also fine with walking past the projects on 125th/Amsterdam at night, so those two experiences are my point of comparison. For reference, I'm an average height/size male. In terms of quality of life, I'm wondering if the area is generally quiet in the evenings, or if there are people blasting music late into the night. (For this, I read on the internet that it's best to stay west of Broadway). Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",1579647758,1,0

I recently graduated and I just wanted to give the community a huge thank you. Although Columbia was pretty intense sometimes, it was so worth it.

Does this happen in other departments?,"Registration for GSAPP courses is such a clusterfuck, and I’m curious if other schools have this problem. 

There’s no limit on how many students can add a course and no waitlist to get in if someone drops. Last semester I had three out of four instructors require all registered students to write a short essay about why they added the class. This was then used to determine who gets to stay and who is forced to drop. One had 50 registrants for a maximum 20-person seminar. 

The problems created by this are obvious; professor doesn’t like women, or minorities, or just dislikes a particular student? They don’t get into the class. How the fuck is this okay with Columbia?

Because there’s no guarantee of any classes being secured, lots of students register for way more courses than they actually intend to take, just to hedge their bets. Of course, this just creates more of a problem because the class sizes are even more inflated by people who would rather not have to settle for a second or third choice, but who also need to graduate. 

On top of that, one of the courses I added was scheduled at the wrong time (7am instead of 7pm), so the instructor has put a registration block on SSOL requiring his approval to add the class. Which makes sense, since he just wants to be sure that there are no scheduling conflicts. But because SSOL is such a piece of garbage, students who already registered but would like to **drop** his class **also have to get a form signed by the instructor.**

And of course this extra course is causing my initial loan disbursement refund to be a few thousand dollars less than it supposed to be. I just don’t understand how we can pay this kind of money and they can’t be bothered to hire any competent people.",1579197740,1,0

I know the MSOR and MSCS programs are highly competitive. I estimate that I will finish my undergrad with roughly 3.4/4.0 and one 4th year capstone project I could probably brag about in my resume.

In terms of internship experience, I did an real estate data management summer intern with the municipal government, and I will be working as a software development analyst in the following summer at Citi (that’s the only US big name company I have ever worked with).

I barely just started to study for GRE but I’m not too worried about that. My majors concerns are my low gpa, my lack of research experience during undergrad, and maybe they only accept students with &gt;2 years work experience.

Is Columbia Worth It?,"Hello Columbia Community,

I was admitted to CC as an Econ major through early decision, which means that I would enroll in the fall. My financial predicament has resulted in me having to take out ~$50,000 worth of student loans per year. I was hoping this wouldn’t the the case, but my financial aid appeal was denied. My true ambition lies within the fashion industry, and I plan on pursuing it there. I’ve been proactive and applied for scholarships, but obviously, I am afraid of the immense amount of debt that I will accrue as a result of my attendance. Thus, I have a few questions. 

1a) Will the experience that I will have at Columbia be worth it for someone like me? The environment provided by NYC would likely be conducive to my interests, but will it be worth the potential $200,000 debt I’ll have by the time I graduate?

1b) Are there any fashion-specific extracurriculars that I can take part in on campus?

2) Are there any other financial aid opportunities provided by the institution that I can take advantage of once I am on campus? Even if my appeal for more aid was denied? Can I reapply for more aid as a freshman?

I would really appreciate it if anyone had any thoughts or opinions on the matter. Anything helps!",1581024571,1,0

"Radish News Report: JJ's Place Employee Accidentally Treats Student like a Human Being, Placed on Administrative Leave","Earlier this week, an employee at JJ’s place was placed on administrative leave after accidentally treating a student in the French Toast line with respect. Witnesses say the staffer was taking an order for an omelet when he took the unthinkable step of asking the student how his day was going, and sealed his fate after making eye contact and smiling while delivering the food. 

Jessica Holmes, currently in charge of managing the venue, explained to us how horrified she was upon hearing the news. “Those damned Ivy League students and their $119 bookstore sweaters! It’s important that everyone who walks in to JJ’s place is treated with as little humanity as possible. Fortunately, the individual at the door made no eye contact and forced him to use a guest swipe, so the situation was largely contained.”

When asked what section of university policy calls for this type of behavior, Holmes pointed to pages 315-320 of the employee handbook, but refused to show us in person as that chapter was ""temporarily closed for cleaning”.  

Following this incident, dedicated reporters from the Columbia Spectator swarmed the individual at the center of this — Columbia College Freshman Andrew Charles - in their latest attempt to desperately monetize our status as students. He will be speaking in Butler on Friday about Domestic violence, and in case you’re not interested, thirty to forty fliers will be shoved under your door in the coming weeks. Katherine Gibberish, who currently heads the newspaper and argues that her last name inspires its content, explained that she cares “deeply about domestic violence,” which is why she took time out of her busy schedule of suing local restaurants who didn’t attend Food Expo to organize the event. 

Following this incident, and in an exclusive interview with The Radish, Lucas explained that he was “in shock” and was “struggling to find meaning in life now"", but that the French Toast was pretty good. “It’s moments like this that make me wonder — where would I be if it weren’t for ResLife playing crappy 80s music and handing out Oreos every few weeks? I was going through a pretty rough stretch, but it was the fifth hour of “Enya — The Classics [Remastered]” at full volume emanating from the John Jay lounge that finally cured me. Who needs large scale administrative reform and mental health support when you have double stuffed [classic flavor]?”

Chem and physics w/ labs in the same year,"I’m interested in PT school and need to understand how heavy chem and physics are.

Fall 2020: chem, physics, poli sci, poli sci

I want to take chem next year is because this will be my only chance to take the chem prep over a summer. I want to take physics because I am currently in calc 1 and want it to be fresh in my brain. Do I need to take calc 3 to get an A in physics 1 or 2?

Can I get myself removed from a CA position after accepting it.,"So, I accepted a CA position for an advanced course which did not have any other takers. The prof said that I did not need to know the course beforehand as I would have access to lecture vids which I can watch to be up to date with the course. 

However, after going through the class lecture videos, I think that I'll not have enough time to complete my responsibilities as a CA for the course. 

The main issue is that I have to come up with the solutions to the assignments myself which would take a lot of time. Grading the assignments is manageable. 

Hence, I want to remove myself from the position of CA (after accepting it). Is this possible? I have not received any income so far. (First income would be received after 2 weeks)",1580337602,1,0

[Transfer] Unsure whether to apply to GS or SEAS,"So, maybe this is the 9000th post on this subreddit about this particular situation, but anyway...

As the title says, I'm a transfer student who's thinking about applying to Columbia. I'm a non-traditional student \[break in studies since HS\], so at first that may seem like Columbia GS is the most obvious choice, except for me, it doesn't seem as straightforward because the major I particularly wanted is not offered by GS/CC.

Some more info about me:

* Currently attending a community college with a \~3.85 GPA
* HS GPA: 3.7 UW (I forget the exact weighted value)
* SAT: 780 Math, 670 Reading and Writing
* Extracurriculars: Interned at NASA

If I were to transfer, I'd apply to SEAS as a Computer Engineering major. However, due to extenuating circumstances, I have more than 4 semesters completed; I had to transfer from a university to CC, then had to retake a significant number of courses at the CC. Moreover, I'm under the impression those with more than 4 semesters of coursework are generally not eligible to transfer as CC/SEAS, as detailed here: [https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/apply/transfer](https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/apply/transfer)

This leaves me potentially applying to GS as a CS major instead. However, I'm not sure I want to, since Engineering isn't a major there. Also, from my understanding, the financial aid from GS is not nearly as good compared to CC and SEAS.

From what I have seen online, students are expected to know (or at least be studying) two foreign languages, and to take a literature class in at least one of them. However, because language classes are often for more credits than others, I don’t see how this is possible with the credit limit if you are coming in without a strong foreign language background. For example, I am consider taking an accelerated course in a Romance language so that I could get to the level where I could take a literature class in it by my sophomore year. This would be worth 6 credits, and, with 4 points for a second language course and the freshman requirement classes, would pretty much max me out for credits my first year. If I did this, would it still be possible for me to meet all the core requirements and the requirements for the major? I don't really want to kill myself my first year by taking the maximum amount of credits, but I would be willing to challenge myself if that is what I had to do to catch up.

Basically what I am wondering if it is feasible to take two language classes at Columbia in order to pursue the Comp Lit major, or if it's better to go for something else if you are coming in without a foreign language background. Thanks",1583094526,1,0

Columbia=Come-and-feel-dumbia,"I have been sitting on my cushy ass for about 10 hours at this point in butler and i seriously think i might go CRAZY.

this feeling of deep academic dissatisfaction and mediocrity is gnawing at me and it feels like an overwhelming and heart-beat skipping sense of déjà vu from high school. I had 12 credits, 12 CREDITS, last semester—all introductory class—and I had a B+ average. Yes, a 3.33 gpa, everyone. First semester of freshman year. I am an international student majoring in philosophy. I have no fucking chance in the job-market. I am mediocrely intelligent at best. I am not beautiful, I am not rich, ad infinitum. I thought I tried my best last semester. I thought I was on the right path...but nothing NOTHING seems to ever EVER give me those sweet As that I feel I need.

I cannot believe that my friends, my boyfriend, and all the peers around me are just so capable. My boyfriend who barely studies past midnight, who does not give a shit about grades got on the Dean's List and I was struggling to get a full night's sleep usually. 

I can't help but feel that this is a diagnosis for how my life will be here on out. Wallowing in mediocrity, constantly comparing myself to others, constantly being proved right that I am, in the end, solidly and pathetically gob-smack in the middle no matter how fucking hard I try. 

I am so fucking done with this. I just want to slap my self into oblivion. It just can't go on like this.",1582940807,1,0

What should I expect in SEAS digital interview?,"Hello,

I have been invited by SEAS to a digital interview for the MS in Chemical Engineering program. I need to know what type of question/s should I expect in the interview? What will be the duration of the interview and how should I prepare for the same? Does SEAS send out interview invitations to all applicants or is it only for a selected few? Please let me know as Columbia is my dream school and attending it will definitely decide the next course of my life. I am mentioning my profile details below - 

GPA - 7.01/10 (Graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from a top tier 1 public university) 

GRE - 301 (Q152, V149, AWA 4.0) (Was juggling between my internship and preparation for GRE and hence could not score more)

TOEFL - 107 (Reading 25, Writing 29, Speaking 25 and Listening 28)

Publications - 1 conference publication at an international symposium and couple more papers have been communicated to an international journal with a very good impact factor.

Research Work - Undertook my bachelor's thesis work at the premier nuclear research institution in my country and also did my internship at the same place after graduating. Interned for one month at a crude processing facility of an Oil and Gas industry giant in my country. The said company is the largest one in terms of production, sales and revenue of Oil and Gas products in my country and is also mentioned in the Fortune 500 list. Completed another three-month internship at a company that's involved with manufacturing of flavouring and fragrances, and is a supplier to some F&amp;B industry giants.

Extracurriculars - I have participated in many science-related competitions and have a good amount of certificates from them. Teaching underprivileged school kids in my neighbourhood for a while now and been involved with a couple of charitable causes. 

Letters of recommendation - I have two LOR's from my undergraduate professors and can definitely say that the LOR's would have been strong since I am on the good books of those professors. The third one is from a senior scientist who is a section head at the nuclear research facility that I did my internship and project from. This LOR would be a very strong one, as the senior scientist was quite impressed with my work and had offered me an extension for my internship duration. I worked on some really good project during this extension.",1582714640,1,0

Biochem Tutoring Today,"Biochem Help?

I have a problem set due at 6pm that's released at 3pm PST. If someone is good at the CMP regulation, please pm/email me at [biochemtutoring123@gmail.com](mailto:biochemtutoring123@gmail.com). I can pay you very well. One example question we were given is about what will happen to the CMP in biosynthetic conditions?

The  answer we were given is here: We are in biosynthetic conditions. This  means we are using something smaller (in this case citrate) and using  that to build something larger (in this case fatty acids). For  biosynthetic conditions to even be active it implies we have a much  higher amount of ATP because ATP positively regulates biosynthetic  pathways. Since we have high ATP that means have a lot of our products  for the ETC and therefore ATP synthase will get inhibited. If we inhibit  ATP synthase this means that we have nothing to dissipate our pH  gradient and therefore it will become too unfavorable for the ETC to  continue to pump protons against its concentration gradient and  therefore the ETC also will shutdown. This will then cause a build-up of  the substrates of the ETC, one of which is NADH. Now, that you have  high amounts of NADH and ATP, they will together go and inhibit the  irreversible steps of the TCA cycle.However, this is where it gets a bit  complicated and why you need to remember the bigger picture (and this  will answer your second question). Yes, NADH and ATP will both inhibit  the irreversible steps of the TCA as well as ATP inhibiting both PFK and  PK in glycolysis. However, remember that you are also removing citrate  to produce fatty acids. Even though citrate synthase is being inhibited  by NADH and ATP, if we keep removing citrate you would eventually get to  a really really low concentration of citrate and therefore it will pull  forward that reaction even though citrate synthase is also being  inhibited (remember our bigger picture is that we need to keep being  able to produce citrate to remove it to make fatty acids so that's what  is happening here as well). Same thing happens for glycolysis. Since we  keep removing acetyl-CoA to make citrate, and pyruvate to make  acetyl-coA, and so on, the rest of glycolysis will also be pulled  forward even though we are inhibiting many of its enzymes. So there  wouldn't be an accumulation of glycolytic intermediates again because  they are being broken down to form more citrate so we can ultimately  make more fatty acids.",1584299744,1,0

From Presbo this morning,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

Over the past week, I have sent messages setting forth our efforts to grapple with the health risks of COVID-19 while doing our best to keep the University functioning. Each one has asked for increasing levels of change in our operations in response to rising risks. Today is yet another. Two significant events have happened in the last 24 hours. The first involves the increased number of people in the surrounding region infected with the virus and, most immediately, the discovery that one of the members of our community has been infected. The second change is the announcement that the federal government is entertaining the prospect of imposing restrictions on domestic travel. Both of these now require us to take the following steps, and I ask everyone to help with implementing them.

We must significantly reduce the number of students in our residence halls. Any student who can leave must leave, by Tuesday, March 17. Some students will not be able to leave, and for us to care for them, in every sense, we need the space to do so. It is, therefore, a responsibility of those who can go home to do so. We recognize this is for almost everyone a major sacrifice, and we are prepared to, and are preparing ourselves to, help in every way we can.

We must take steps to reduce our research activities to those that are “essential”—at this point a necessarily vague standard, but one that at least points us in a direction we must go and that can be implemented with careful thought and particularity by our respective deans and chairs.

At the Medical Center, we must continue to reduce the number of students in our dormitory, identify what research can be done remotely, and take other steps to suspend student clerkships and rotations. Here, especially, our efforts must be to aggregate our medical capacity to serve the patient needs likely to arise from the spread of the virus.

Lastly, we need to close various non-academic areas that bring people together in large groups, such as the gymnasium and our Chapel.

All of these actions will lead us to become an even more virtual community for the time being. As such, Columbia will remain our point of connection in teaching, research, and action, as well as emotionally. This is a time for everyone to help each other out as much as possible. As always, this communication will be followed by others with more details. I am sorry to convey these messages and actions.

Bard Residents Forced To Move Out at Medical Center Campus,"We're being forced to move out at the medical center campus. This doesn't affect those in the on-campus apartments, just the dorm Bard Hall. I thought that main campus wasn't forcing people to move out of the dorms. Weren't they encouraging people to leave if they're able to, and those with hardships could stay? There are several issues with this. Many people in my program still have clinicals. The ones that are suspended could resume at any point during this semester too, so we can't just leave. In addition, we still have simulations. If we're staying on-campus, they will probably move us into on-campus apartments, but these cost more and it would be difficult purchasing furniture, toilet paper, cleaning supplies, etc. during this scare as well.


&gt; Dear Bard Residents,
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Following up on the email you received earlier this morning from CUIMC’s four deans, it is important that we reduce the density of students living in Bard Hall in order to mitigate risk to our students and the CUIMC community. 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; The Office of Housing Services is requiring all Bard Hall residents to complete a Bard Hall residency of intent form by Tuesday, March 17 to inform us of their housing needs, as you are required to leave Bard Hall by  5 p.m. on Friday, March 20 or sooner (if you are currently on campus).  If you are currently not on campus and need to return to pack your belongings, you are expected to check out of Bard Hall by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, March 31.  
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; As this situation continues to evolve, we understand that students may have questions about what it means for them now. Please take a moment to review our Frequently Asked Questions for some important information about next steps and your options. Should you still have any additional questions, please contact us directly at cumc.housing@columbia.edu.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your patience and understanding during this situation. We are ready to support those of you who may be leaving campus as well as those of you who wish to remain on campus for the duration of the semester.
&gt; 
&gt;

exam writing on zoom is just dumb. I hate this shit so much.,"the professor for IEOR ML decided to host the exam in his personal zoom room instead of the columbia email invite. All he did was post the invite on Piazza without giving any more detail about it. So obviously no one is going to compare the room numbers etc. This is also our first virtual class and it's our midterm.

We sit in the official columbia zoom invite room for like 30 minutes into the exam thinking that he was just late. Only to miss instructions about timings, submissions, etc... Panic search for any other zoom invite and then finally stumble into his personal zoom room to finish the rest the exam.

The professor then says he had no idea that there was another room.

"Online for the rest of the semester, students 'encouraged to move out'","Presbo's email:

Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

As promised, I am writing with an update on how the University needs to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. We all know this is a rapidly evolving and very challenging situation. Yesterday afternoon, the World Health Organization officially declared this to be a pandemic. Thus far, we continue to have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on our campuses. Just to be clear, the principle that has guided us up to this point is to maintain the mission of the University as much as possible consistent with preserving the health of every part of our community. To that end, as of yesterday, we launched nearly 2,000 classes online and continue to prepare to teach classes virtually for the remainder of the semester.

In light of the spread of the virus, especially in the New York metropolitan region, we now need to take further steps. Specifically, in order to reduce the density of our residential environment, while respecting the interests and needs of students who have reason to continue to remain in residence on campus, we are instituting three critical decisions: (1) The University will remain open and functioning; (2) All classes for the remainder of the semester will be conducted online; and (3) We encourage any students who are able to move out of undergraduate residence halls for the rest of the semester to do so, and we are ready to help in that process. The Office of University Life and your school will follow up with more information.

It is worth repeating that our campuses will remain open. However, we have restrictions in place for those who have traveled to severely affected areas, as per guidance from the CDC. We will, as indicated previously, actively discourage congregations in large numbers. We also strongly discourage holding any events with over 25 people, at least through April 30th. All Columbia business travel, both international and domestic, is now suspended for all affiliates.

This is a hard time for all of us. We are concerned about every student, colleague, friend, and neighbor. Clearly, balancing all of the interests of all parts of the institution is an extraordinarily complex undertaking. I am so grateful to all of you and especially to those who daily help us chart the right course for Columbia through this crisis. 

Sincerely,

Lee C. Bollinger",1584024384,1,0

Full-time employee here. My office is forcing us to come in and work.,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I work in the tech department (won’t say which school or department for anonymity) here at Columbia. HOWEVER, they are still forcing staff and employees to still come in. My supervisor recently sent us an email that we are all expected to come in to work tomorrow and it is all hands on deck. No exceptions.

Mainly we are all managing classes remotely through Zoom and making sure they are up and running since most of our instructors are either too lazy to learn the video conferencing system or are too technologically challenged to function without tech support. I’m talking they don’t even know how to plug in their microphones or drag and drop files to a USB kinda challenged. Employees who are not even working in tech but other un-related departments are being dragged into this to support classes.

My commute takes over an hour and I don’t have a car so I have to commute via MTA. I have to take one train into the city and then have to transfer at a large station hub (e.g. 34th Street Penn Station, 42nd Street, Grand Central won’t say the exact one for anonymity) and take another train to get to the University. Everyday I risk myself and my older parents whom I live with, with the possibility of catching the virus. My mother previously had surgery to remove a cancer and is extremely weak immune system-wise.

They are making us work overtime without compensating us also it’s not fair that they care about the health of students but not about the health of staff. Is there anything I can do to complain about these ridiculous conditions? I would expect an Ivy-league school to do better in light of the novel coronavirus. Since I'm full-time and salaried, I don't get overtime.

Directly talking to my boss won’t work. They are too strong-headed on this “no working remotely” deal and they are the ones pushing this onto us. I’m too low level in the job hierarchy to enforce any changes. Normally, I work a regular 9-5 full-time job, but because of the influx of things we have to support I’m going to have to work from 8am to 7pm for idk how long. There are hundreds of classes we manage for our department. HR doesn't seem to be a viable option and they mostly are there to defend the University tbh.

Right now I’m just taking my own personal precautions on my commute to work everyday. After getting off the train I immediately use hand sanitizer and then wash my hands thoroughly when I get into the office. Whenever I touch a shared space or surface I wash my hands again and clean the area too. I avoid crowded trains but there’s only so much one can do.

NICK MUTCH - Conflict Journalist The Times, Sunday Times, Daily Best etc  
CHRISTOPHER SABATINI - Chatham House

With the oil price crashing today now more than ever the pressure will be mounting on the Maduro government, with Moscow and Beijing circling around. 

Its designed to be a crash course on everything you need to know to try and understand the country in its current state, as well as an expert insight in the next 6 months for the Maduro government. 

We also decided to leave it some of the more controversial points this time, including the outcomes of the US taking drastic measures into the country.

The show is really starting to pick up and this sub was a huge help in gathering guests and info so I thought I would share it here to say thanks.

Would love your input and feedback as well.

COVID-19: Update for Students,"Dear Students, 

  
This **email contains important information** for this coming week. As President Bollinger informed you, in light of new developments related to COVID-19, classes are suspended on Monday and Tuesday, March 9-10, as we prepare to move to an online format for instruction for the rest of this week. **Please read to the end of this message.**  


This new development is based on an abundance of caution. As President Bollinger noted, we do not have a confirmed case of the virus on campus. A member of the Columbia community is in self-quarantine on campus as a result of exposure to COVID-19. This individual is well and is receiving appropriate support, consistent with guidance from the New York City Department of Health. Federal law precludes us from disclosing the person’s identity, and we urge you to respect the privacy of this individual and that of anyone else who may have a personal or family connection to COVID-19 exposure.  


We understand that this development may cause anxiety or concern. Please know that you have many sources of support here on campus and access to resources and accurate information [on Columbia’s COVID-19 website](https://www.columbia.edu/content/coronavirus). Please continue to follow these familiar basic health precautions: wash your hands, don’t shake hands or share food and drink, cough and sneeze into your elbow, and avoid touching your face with unwashed hands.  


Because this is an unfolding situation, we understand that you will have many questions, including about next week and beyond. For now, please read this information carefully, and we will follow with more in the coming days.  


**Classes**  


* For Monday and Tuesday, classes are suspended as we prepare to move to the online format.
* You will soon receive instructions from your school about how to access your classes online.  

* Some classes cannot easily move to an online format. Your school will let you know about alternate arrangements for these classes.    


**Exams**  


* Take-home exams will continue as usual.
* Your school will update you about arrangements for in-class exams.

**Disability Services Accommodations**  


* Disability Services will communicate with registered students about accommodations that may be needed for the online format.

**Columbia Health and CUIMC Student Health Service**  


* Most services remain open to support you and your well-being. Because of the high volume of inquiries, we encourage you to use online resources for information and support.
* For your information, t[he U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) has issued recommendations that individuals at higher risk for COVID-19 complications should stay at home as much as possible. **Those at higher risk include adults over age 65 and people who have severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease.**
* You may want to take additional precautions to reduce your risk of exposure if you are immunocompromised, such as on chemotherapy, having had an organ transplant, taking immunosuppressive drugs; or have a serious cardiovascular or respiratory disease.

**Other Questions About Libraries, Fitness, Housing and Dining**  


* Campus remains open; this includes libraries and fitness centers.
* You can continue to study with friends and classmates.  

* Dining facilities and coffee shops remain open, with enhanced cleaning. All dining facilities will offer grab-and-go meal options.  

* Housing remains open, and enhanced cleaning of high-touch areas continues in all common areas of residential and academic buildings.

**Spring Break travel**

* We know many of you have questions about spring break travel. We will follow up soon with more information.   

**Campus Life**  


* Most schools will be on spring break from March 16 to March 20. University Life will follow up with more about campus events and activities – both in-person and online.

**Getting Help**  


* The [University’s COVID-19 website](https://www.columbia.edu/content/coronavirus) has up-to-date information on all University policies and resources.
* Beginning tomorrow, Columbia Health’s COVID-19 phone hotline will be available for questions from 9 am to 5 pm Monday-Friday: 212-854-9355.  

* For concerns about bias or harassment, please speak with your Dean of Students or contact [Student Conduct and Community Standards](https://studentconduct.columbia.edu/) with concerns. In this unusual time, our community values of respect and consideration for each other are especially important.  


Thank you for your careful attention as we continue to develop and revise policies, with the health, safety and well-being of everyone at Columbia as our top priority.

I feel like it would be wise of Columbia to be proactive in stopping the spread of the virus rather than waiting for the inevitable first confirmed case on campus.

Any Current Students Who Can Tell Me About Student Life or Opportunities at Columbia?,"Hello, Columbia Reddit community, 

I was wondering if there are any students who may be able to tell me where my interests fit in at the College of Arts and Sciences, in terms of extracurriculars and classroom pursuits (such as research, specific professors, even if I may only take their classes in later years). I would really appreciate it if anyone of you who have similar interests or know of friends or acquaintances with similar interests would be able to send me a private message. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because this is a public forum, I do not want to post too much information identifying myself so I will only give a brief description. I am currently considering whether or not I want to go to Columbia. I would be in the class of 2024. The major I applied for was political science, but I listed my other academic interests as philosophy and sustainable development. My other interests are French (which I am fluent in) and literature (especially the classics. I am taking a class this semester at my high school in which we actually have read or are reading quite a few of the books that are read in the Core Curriculum (ike *The Republic*, *Antigone*, and *The Iliad*, among others). During my time in high school, I have been very involved in advocating for justice on behalf of adolescent survivors of sexual trauma. Careerwise, I want to influence international policy on behalf of women and children. Obviously a very broad aspiration, but that is why I am asking everyone here because I want to know how an education at Columbia could help me narrow that down specifically. In terms of hobbies, I have been taking classical voice lessons for the past five years, enjoy drawing and painting, and also creative and non-fiction essay writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any of your help telling me where all these interests could fit in would be very much appreciated. Again, in private messages, I would be willing to give more information about myself.

Columbia MS Degree,"Hi! 

Hope this post finds you well and that you’re all in healthy, high spirits! I’m a barnard sophomore studying chemistry and pursuing the 4+1 engineering track to get a MS in chem engineering. If I continue with this track, that means I will be applying to Columbia grad next semester — but before that, I’d appreciate some feedback. 

I’m a first gen (very) low income student and so far have $8000 in federal subsidized loans to pay back. I anticipate that the total by the end of my undergrad will be about $20K. As much as I’d love to get a MS degree in engineering from Columbia, I’m also considering applying to other engineering schools where the cost would be significantly less. 
By the end of this semester, I will have 90.5 credits and a good chunk of my major courses completed. I also plan to finish almost all, if not all, of my pre-engineering classes during my junior year so that I’ve completed 122 credits and am eligible to graduate. Given that, my advisor recommended starting grad courses in my senior year so that I’m fulfilling masters credits with an undergrad tuition. She also offered giving me a TA position to help me even a little bit with paying for school. 

I’m not sure what my question is exactly other than that I’d appreciate some thoughts and feedback on what I should do. Do the credits from grad courses I take during my senior year count towards my MS? Is Columbia grad school worth $60-70K ? 

thank you in advance 😌",1584982992,1,0

Spring Break Extended By 3 Days -&amp;- All Classes To Be Graded As PASS/FAIL,"Just sent by PrezBo:  


Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:  


I write today from our Morningside Heights campus, which now has an eerie and uncharacteristic stillness about it, with three purposes. The first is to express my deepest appreciation to everyone for the extraordinary actions taken over these past two weeks to transform the University in ways that will allow us, as much as possible, to continue our work while we, the nation, and the world confront the unprecedented threat of the virus known as COVID-19. I am in awe of the students—and the staff, parents, and friends who supported them—who moved out of the residence halls these last few days, not just for the orderly ways in which it was carried out but for the spirit of citizenship and shared sacrifice that defined it. You heeded the call and showed that there is still, indeed, life in the commons. To those students who have needed to remain due to exceptional circumstances, I want to reassure you that we will continue to provide essential services even with the announcement today from the governor to further reduce our workforce.   


The second purpose for this message is to say that, with the exception of clinical education, I am postponing all instruction for the first three days of next week in order to give everyone a little more time to prepare to resume classes for the final few weeks of the semester. Classes will continue virtually on Thursday, March 26th. And, further, with respect to courses, working with each of your schools, we have decided that all classes this semester will be graded pass/fail. This, of course, does not reflect a reduction in expectations, but rather an acknowledgment of the severe complications of this unusual moment.   


The third purpose is heartbreaking. Given life as it now is, we cannot go forward with Commencement ceremonies on May 20th, as planned. And, unfortunately, we are not in a position at this moment to announce an alternative plan. The situation is too uncertain, and any plans made now run a high risk of having to be abandoned as circumstances change. But this I can assure you: I will confer degrees on May 20th. We are and will continue thinking about this every day, and we will have a plan to honor and celebrate your successes. Speaking personally, there is no academic ceremony I love more, and I expect to love this one the most.   


The world has moved on to a different plane, one none of us could have anticipated a short while ago. I want to say, on behalf of all of Columbia, that we are, as always, ready to do our part, which, given the assembled talent and public spiritedness of this community, is never inconsiderable. While a stillness pervades Morningside Heights, that does not mean our work has abated. Meanwhile, a very different atmosphere characterizes our medical campus in Washington Heights, where our colleagues are girding to face the fraught and daunting challenges to come. Indeed, the outpouring of time, effort, commitment, and personal sacrifice of those serving on the front line of the CUIMC campus are already very palpable. This dedication also portrays the work of all employees essential to keeping the University in operation. My deepest thanks to everyone.

Columbia Law now has mandatory pass/fail for all Spring 2020 Courses,"Email from Dean Lester below:


&gt;Dear Students, 



&gt;Of all the decisions we have faced in recent weeks as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency, few have been more difficult or complex than the question of grading policy for the spring semester. I have heard from many within our community—J.D. students from all class years as well as many LL.M. students—who conveyed a broad range of thoughtful views. In reaching the decision announced below, I have worked with a special committee of faculty to weigh and deliberate all sides of the issue; I have also solicited input from the full faculty, as well as administrators, and received their thoughtful and considered advice.



&gt;I am heartened that those who have shared with me their concerns, their reasoning, and their personal stories, have also recognized that there is no perfect solution. I am grateful to all of you and it pains me to know that no matter the outcome, some of you will feel sharp disappointment. 



&gt;Grading Policy for Spring 2020



&gt;In light of the disruption caused by coronavirus, including the shift to remote instruction for the balance of the spring 2020 semester and the associated and varied burdens on students, faculty, and administration, grades for all Law School courses will be awarded on a mandatory Credit/Fail grading system. This applies to all first- and upper-year J.D. students, as well as LL.M. students.



&gt;Reasoning



&gt;Student well-being was the paramount consideration in determining how to proceed, understanding that what relieves anxiety for some students could increase it for others. Some of you would feel most assured knowing you would receive letter grades or have the option to do so, while others wish for relief from the pressure of differentiation.



&gt;Ultimately, it was concerns about how current conditions will undermine a level playing field that weighed most heavily on me. This spring, many of you will be living and studying in very trying conditions. For reasons that are wholly arbitrary, the burdens on some will be heavier than on others. Some will have obligations to family and distractions that you do not face on the Columbia campus. Some will face anxiety about the well-being or even survival of loved ones. Some of you may be confronted with health problems of your own. Many of you have experienced physical dislocation and lack access to the technology and other resources you need to prepare adequately for examinations, access research sources for papers, and perform the full range of tasks ordinarily assessed in experiential courses. 



&gt;Curved letter grades never perfectly reflect merit, but under current and anticipated conditions I fear they would be particularly inaccurate. The differences measured may reflect arbitrary disadvantages and not effort or ability. Although employers will be aware of the extraordinary circumstances of this period, some may nonetheless view the spring semester grades as just as much an indication of academic and legal ability as in normal times.



&gt;Our faculty discussed the possibility of moving to an opt-in system in which you would be allowed to choose, either ex ante or ex post, whether to be graded Credit/Fail or by a letter grade in each course (we also considered other variations). Many were concerned that neither option would fully alleviate anxiety, as a negative implication could be drawn about those who elected Credit/Fail, thus replicating the very thing we sought to avoid by moving away from our status quo system of curved letter grading.



&gt;In addition, the faculty considered preserving letter grading in seminars, clinics, and practicum courses, on the theory that casework and written work is easier for faculty to evaluate and does not implicate all of the concerns described above for examinations.  However, it seems unfair that some students would receive grades and others would not, depending on whether they had enrolled in non-exam courses this spring. Furthermore, for many students, writing a paper is equally or more challenging than writing an exam, with concerns about technology failure, availability of source materials in far-flung places, and so forth, present there as well. 



&gt;Our LLM and 1L students, having only one semester of curved letter grades from Columbia, and many having yet to develop relationships with employers through summer employment or job offers, are understandably concerned about their employment prospects here or in home countries. I am very moved by these considerations. We have learned that the major New York firms are strongly considering moving EIP, the job-matching process for private law employment, from the summer following the 1L year to January 2021, which may mitigate this concern, at least for 1Ls. I am also confident that our professional staff will work very hard with every student to reduce the impact on job placement, including for our international students, wherever they may be starting their careers.



&gt;Additional Grading Adjustment and Enhancements



&gt;No grades earned for Spring 2020 courses will figure into any student’s cumulative academic record and Spring 2020 grades shall not be counted for calculation of graduation honors that are based on cumulative grades.


&gt;Transcripts will be annotated to indicate that Spring 2020 grades reflect the Law School policy in response to the current public health emergency rather than student choice. 



&gt;Whether or not a student was previously enrolled in any course on a Credit/Fail basis, the Credit/Fail grading in the Spring 2020 semester will not count against any student’s maximum number of permissible Credit/Fail courses. 



&gt;Kent and Stone honors will continue to be awarded in the current academic year, but will be based solely on grades earned during the fall semester. There will be a special category of recognition in Spring 2020—designated “Dean’s Honors”—to be bestowed upon 3-5% of students in each spring semester class. For classes with fewer than 20 students, no more than one student will be eligible for the designation of Dean’s Honors. 



&gt;Subject matter prizes will be awarded on the same terms as is usual and include performance in Spring courses.



&gt;Exams will be administered in an online format, with further announcements to come from Registration Services providing detailed instructions.



&gt;Let me express my hope that our immediate reaction as a community will be one of compassion—for those among us who have been deeply and personally affected by this pandemic, and for those who feel the loss of the full measure of benefits of a Columbia Law education during this unimaginable time. 



&gt;Please know that the faculty and administration will do all they can to support every student and graduate as you pursue a career of value, meaning, and impact.

While Columbia has not made any hard and fast decisions regarding Commencement and/or Class Days, myself and the other undergraduate Senior Class Presidents have put together a survey to collect and measure student preferences about alternative graduation options.

Petition to move to upper-class dorms instead of South Lawn dorms (from students staying on campus),"Hi everyone,

I am a Columbia student staying on campus and we just got a notice yesterday that Housing is going to consolidate us into first-year dorms (quote from their email: ""buildings adjacent to South Lawn""). This would, of course, exacerbate the spread of COVID-19, as we will be crammed into using shared bathrooms (4 students per bathroom) and a massive shared kitchen, which will backfire on the efforts of social distancing. Our alternative is then to move students into upper-class dorms; with suite-style living, we can minimize kitchen and bathroom use without having much contact with other students.

I've worked with other students staying on campus to draft out emails to administration regarding this issue. We have sent the petition &amp; first wave of co-signs but we are still waiting for more co-signs! We will send new waves of co-signs intermittently. If you have a specific issue regarding your building, feel free to email res life administration directly (besides the housing email, [here's a list of contacts](https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/studentlife/staff)).

You were likely a number. A metric. A statistic. Anyone you come in contact with who gets coronavirus, whether it be a loved one or a stranger. Was a number. A metric. A statistic. 

When exactly did Columbia begin the deliberations to close? How long did it take their in house counsel to lay out the university's options. How far in advanced were they planning for this? And if it was far in advance of closure, why didn't they act sooner rather than react too late? 


And if everything was done hastily, then isn't that grotesque negligence on the university's part? 


We need to demand transparency and accountability from the university administration because in all likelihood they not only gambled with our health and lives, but with the lives of our loved ones. 

There are over 3k detected cases in New York City alone that were likely infected 1-2 weeks ago. They sent you packing a week ago, urging you to go home. To disperse from what would become an epicenter of the country. How many infected walked the halls. How many did you encounter going about your daily routine. It was probably not none. Columbia knows this.


Please, rally. Find attorneys if you get sick and be prepared to file suit. The University's response to this crisis looks more like a posture than anything else. When push comes to shove, they do not care about you. They only care about how you contribute to their bottom line.",1584666070,1,0

Update on COVID-19 from President Bollinger,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:
 
This is the message I hoped never to have to convey. I must report the first deaths from COVID-19 within our own extended Columbia community. In recent days, we have lost family members, neighbors, and now at Columbia, we have lost valued employees and one of our own students. Of course, the mortality rate nationally and globally is staggering, but the shock is always greater when the losses occur within your own home and community. I am sure many of you are suffering under the spread of the virus, being personally afflicted or caring for those who are, all the while carrying on with coursework and other responsibilities. Please know we think about you and the burden of these experiences every day.
 
This past week, I, along with Dr. Lee Goldman, visited inpatient units, an ICU, the Emergency Department, and an outpatient tent at our Medical Center. It is always remarkable to see our faculty, students, and staff in the health sciences provide such superb care to the sick under unimaginable circumstances while at the same time seeking to rapidly generate new knowledge that can help others. These are among the most challenging conditions, filled with anxiety and distress, and everyone is rising to the moment. 
 
In the few short weeks since many of you left campus, several of Columbia’s most familiar sites have been commissioned into service, including Baker Field, where the hospital is in the process of expanding its facilities. Emptied Morningside campus residence halls are now being used by CUIMC and hospital employees to ease their commutes. Our Libraries and our Engineering School are both producing face shields. All this, along with the research we continue to conduct and the additional intellectual and physical resources we expect to devote to this pandemic in the future, makes us proud.
 
And, in the final weeks of the semester, it is heartening to know that the academic work of the University continues. We are currently teaching a total of 9,622 courses online—something we previously would not have imagined possible. Continuing with this effort to maintain the functions of the University into the summer, we now expect to offer over 1,800 courses online.
 
There are two additional developments to note here: With respect to Commencement, individual schools will offer virtual Class Days during that previously designated week. And the University Commencement ceremony will be recorded and shared virtually on May 20th. We still hope to have at some later time an in-person celebration, but it is, unfortunately, not possible at this moment to be more specific.
 
Lastly, there has been an outpouring of inquiries about what each person might do to help in this crisis. I am happy to say that there is now a consolidated list on our COVID-19 website of ways you might assist and contribute to others. We expect to add more opportunities as they arise.
 
I want to return to what I said at the outset. I wish I could do more than just express our sense of sadness and loss. I do feel strongly, however, that this is a period when the strengths of universities are manifest and should be recognized. We lodge the professions within our universities, in part because we value and benefit from their expertise but also because we want to nurture a sense of public responsibility as being inherent in these societal roles. The journalist who enters war zones, the lawyer who fights for human rights, and the health worker who braves dangers of infection to aid the ill, all reflect the commitment to the selfless dedication of expertise that universities naturally nurture. As always, however, it is one thing to affirm this commitment, as we regularly do, and another to live it, as we are now seeing so vividly in our Medical Center. It is, therefore, to be celebrated, as an example for us all to follow.
 
Finally, I would say, if ever there was a time that proves, yet again, that the subjects and preoccupations of the humanities are of transcendent importance in a good life, this is surely one of those.
 
From the President’s House, Jean and I send our warmest regards. 
 
Sincerely,


 
Lee C. Bollinger",1586460994,8,0
Is it a good idea to send in a video when waitlisted,"

Librex is a private social media platform for college students to anonymously talk about anything and everything. We have over 6000 users from Yale and Dartmouth so far and are launching at Columbia this week! Some things people have posted on Librex at other schools are various confessions, movie recs, and spicy campus topics such as universal pass. As all accounts are made through school emails, all users on the Columbia page will be verified Columbia students. We have also recently launched a cross ivy page where ivy league students can intermingle.

HR program- Columbia SPS vs NYU SPS,"I’m currently enrolled in NYU’s MS Human Resources program at their School of professional studies.  However, the MS in Columbia better fits the areas I wish to study in HR, plus I work here.  The main thing holding me back from applying here is as great as the rest of the programs in Columbia are, I keep reading about SPS’ issues, and since their first cohort graduates this year, there’s no exit information to review.  So I’m pretty much taking a leap of faith to leave a degree program I have information on to go to one I don’t. 

The NYU program is pretty good but not as challenging as I’d like. The professors are wonderful and intelligent but I worry about the RoI as far as knowledge and skills gained.  I may be earlier on (4/14 courses complete) so it could get better down the line.  I’m interested in moving programs, but only if it’d be worth it. 

So my question is:  is anyone in the Human Capital Management program from SPS? What is your experience like?  Is it “worth it” as far as what you got out of it past saying you graduated a masters? 

In general is SPS properly represented in the articles speaking about its admission rates, quality, professors, etc? Or has it improved?",1586179323,1,0

Deferring Undergraduate Enrollment,"Hi Columbia Community!

I was admitted to Columbia class of 24’ via early decision. Upon receiving my financial aid package, I discovered that I would be receiving close to zero financial aid from the institution. Despite Columbia’s conclusions about my financial situation, the reality is that there is no way for my family to cover the full costs of attendance without me having to take on a huge amount of student loan debt. I went through the appeals process, but I was denied. Recently, I was admitted to UCLA (my state’s public school) and they are giving me $21,000 / year to attend. I asked if Columbia would be able to match this number, but that request was denied as well. 

My question is, would I be able to defer my Columbia acceptance for two years, do my first two years at UCLA, and enroll with guaranteed admission to CC as a junior?

Does Columbia accept junior transfers?,"I would ideally transfer for the next year (as a Computer Science major), but the thing is, my application isn't great right now.


Stats:

Stony Brook University

GPA: 3.75 (Fucked up in Linear Algebra, although it'll be around 3.9 after this semester since I have an A in all courses as of now, meaning 4.0 second semester with more credits). 

HS GPA: 93.2 (we don't do out-of-4 GPA); it was also a top HS if that makes it different.

SAT: 1550

Current extracurriculars: E-board of three clubs, one academic/professional, one community-based, one leisure/hobby based. I go to other clubs but I'm not E-board. I also applied for some CS internships but have heard back from none, and some have explicitly said they're stopping internships in wake of the current pandemic events before even considering my application (I've gotten emails from the companies before I got my application response).


Other: I few CS projects, nothing super big though.


*****


So anyways as you can see it's not really spectacular, and I'm worried that Columbia wrote:

&gt; Candidates with more than four semesters of college coursework elsewhere are not encouraged to apply.

So next year I would have completed 4 semesters of college coursework, not *more* than that (unless you include APs of which I took 5), so I don't know if they'll even consider me.


Any advice/input would be greatly appreciated!",1585934351,0,0

Any PALS scholars here? (GS full-ride),"I'm a prospective international applicant to GS. I was looking around the GS website and learned about PALS (Program for Academic Leadership and Service) in the Institutional Scholarships section. I don't want to get too pumped up just because I seem to meet all the requirements, given all I've heard about GS' lack of financial aid and that only a few (?) are awarded out each class. There's very limited info about the program and its recipients online. 

Is there anyone in this sub who is a direct PALS scholar or who is willing to connect me with scholars they know? Idk PALS sounds like both a GS unicorn and I guess I just want to understand how one becomes one and what its expectations are. Thanks!

MA advice? COVID-19 has made everything chaos.,"Hi!

Not super sure how helpful folks can be, but I recently got into an MA program at Columbia in political science. I'm really excited about it, but hesitant given the current situation with COVID-19 about pouring so much money into a one-year degree that may be partially (or worst case scenario, entirely) online. I got into a few other master's programs that are longer programs, meaning that even if this extended into the fall or later I would still get to take in-person classes for part of my degree in 2021.  


I know that everything is changing insanely rapidly, but was curious if anyone on this subreddit is in the political science grad program, or could lend some insight on GSAS at large. Have they been communicative with you? Has there been any discussion of partial refunds/tuition discounts for online instruction? Have any of you heard from admin and/or faculty about whether fall courses are likely, or still too far out to say anything meaningful?  


Likely not a lot to be gleaned given how fast everything is changed, but I figured I had to ask. I'll probably be emailing the department myself with a few questions as I need to accept or apply to defer early this month, but would greatly appreciate any insights you guys have on the ground!",1585803290,1,0
Columbia vs. Johns Hopkins,"I was recently accepted into Columbia and Johns Hopkins for biomedical engineering. I know that Johns Hopkins has an amazing program in Biomedical Engineering (ranked #1 in the world), but I am not 100% sure if I want to pursue BME. I am still considering majoring in applied math or computer science, for which Columbia has stronger programs.

I was hoping for advice about which school to choose. Johns Hopkins has an incredibly strong BME program and tons of research and internship opportunities, which I definitely want to pursue. Additionally, BME majors at JHU can easily double major in either Applied Math or CS.  I have also heard that the culture at Hopkins is really collaborative, but students in the BME program tend to be more competitive.

On the other hand, I have been taking classes at Columbia for the past 2 years (SHP program) and really love the campus. I especially like the idea of living in New York City (&gt;&gt;&gt; Baltimore), and I know that Ivy League schools have really good alumni networks. I also think that Columbia has stronger applied math/computer science programs, but with the Core Curriculum it is difficult to double major. 

PS: Rutgers Honors College is still an option, and significantly cheaper than either school. I didn't get a full ride, but would be paying $20k/year rather than $75k. Also, Honors College students have more internship/career fairs and it is easier for them to pursue research with professors. Plus, I could get AP credit from Rutgers.",1585796817,1,0

Help! Freshman housing-Furnald vs. John Jay,"Hey, everyone. I was admitted to Columbia class of 2024 and I was wondering about some of the housing options for freshmen.

I guess I'm an introvert, so I need some privacy, but I still want to hang out, go to parties, make friends, etc. What I got from most of the posts I read was that Furnald is nicer, but JJ is more social. I was leaning towards JJ, but I'm not sure about a few things: 

1. No AC at JJ, how bad does it get at the beginning/end of the year?
2. I've read a few posts about JJ being dirty/smelly, is it bad? 
3. Furnald has the ""quiet"" reputation, but some people say that's not true. Is it really that quiet? Or do floors still socialize like in other dorms?

Prezbo email suggests a three term 2020-2021 class year,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

As one of the most perplexing and difficult semesters in memory draws to an end, I write now with some updates on the shape of the summer and the academic year to come. 

Let me just begin by expressing, once again, our genuine gratitude for the extraordinary ways in which every member of the University community has responded to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, first and foremost, of course, our colleagues at the Medical Center. This has been a spring for the ages, and my deepest hope is that the goodwill and collective effort manifested in this crisis will continue to sustain us in the months and years ahead. At this very moment, I am especially thinking of our graduating classes and of how our campus would ordinarily be filled with the anticipation of one of the most uplifting and magnificent academic ceremonies on the planet. Though we will all gather virtually for these milestone events, having to forego what we wish most for will only magnify the feelings of warm connection we will have in the years to come with the Class of 2020. As I plan to say on Commencement day, these strange and frightening times have most certainly deepened our collective appreciation of the University’s many vital roles in society, beginning with the search for fundamental knowledge and carried through to the care of humanity and the world. 

As disjointed as this moment has come to feel, as filled as it is with deep uncertainties, we must move forward. I write first, then, about the state of our research. 

Over the last several weeks, we have developed an intricate plan for returning to laboratory research that has necessarily been suspended. Following the guidance of our public health experts, and pending the approvals from the State to ease stay-at-home orders in New York City, we will gradually allow our faculty and certain graduate students to return to their lab research sites, ensuring, most of all, of course, the safety of our community. It is our hope that this plan can be activated as early as June. Ira Katznelson has communicated the details of our schedule and the conditions to our researchers.

We also have been intensely focused on the general form of our next academic year. We all wish to return to in-person instruction and campus life, and our intent is to make that possible as soon as it is safe to do so. The hard fact is, however, that we just cannot predict now when that moment will arrive. Yet, we can put in place structures that maximize prospects for that outcome and offer meaningful steps along the way. Our primary goal must be to create as rich an academic experience as possible, in whatever form that will take, while preparing to bring us back together at the earliest feasible moment. No doubt social distancing techniques will be with us for some time, which, of course, complicates the logistics of the return. Taking these and other factors into account, we have made one key decision: to prepare to use the three upcoming academic terms—fall 2020, spring 2021, and summer 2021—as a unit of time in order to provide us with the greatest amount of flexibility in organizing our educational experiences. 

By leveraging a longer period of time, we will be able to de-densify our campus so that all students may experience much, if not most, of their coursework in person over the arc of the three terms. While this is just the beginning of a University-wide effort to determine the specifics of the academic year, we now have the capacity to tap into the rich expertise and creativity of our University leaders and faculty to shape the substance and content of this one-time arrangement. By July 1, Ira Katznelson, our spectacular deans, and I will have more details to share about how the three terms will be composed. 

May is always filled with the sense of exhilaration of admitting new classes across our schools and colleges. It is natural to wonder—and we have—how the understandable anxieties among our prospective students about how the current crisis will affect their beginnings at Columbia will in turn affect their college plans. Amid such uncertainty, it gives me great pleasure and pride to share that all we now know suggests we will welcome one of the most talented and formidable cohorts of new students this fall. As with their predecessors, these exceptional individuals will add immeasurably to the intellectual life at Columbia, perhaps even more than usual because they have already displayed a kind of courage and fortitude to maintain a steady course in the search for knowledge.

One can only feel a sense of humility in the face of the broad human response as we grapple with a threat as menacing as COVID-19. And one can only feel thankful for our universities and for Columbia, in particular. New York City is almost always the epicenter of crises that strike this nation, and Columbia University in the City of New York is, therefore, too. This is not exactly to be wished for, but it does create, over time, an intellectual character that is grounded in the hard realities of existence. And, on balance, inhabiting a space imbued with that character is where I would rather be. I trust that view is shared by everyone at Columbia. 

From the President’s House, Jean and I send you our very best. 

Sincerely,

Lee C. Bollinger",1589480098,15,0

Questions for Columbia Transfer,"Hi everyone,

Using a throwaway account bc well...

Anyways, I'm fortunate to have been admitted as an incoming Columbia SEAS sophomore transfer students doing math+cs (likely more on the cs side), and I have a few questions before I make a decision:

1) My main concern is classes selection. CS is pretty hot today. My current school was nice enough to let me, an underclassman, join the intro machine learning course. I don't expect Columbia to be like this as well, but it'd suck for me to have to wait until the end of junior year to take something like natural language processing.

2) Research in CS theory, ML, vision: are professors in these subfields packed to the brim with undergrad researchers/how hard is it to get a position? I plan on applying to grad school so research is pretty important.

Biochemistry major with Compsci minor (Premed) Good idea?,"Hi Everyone,

Hope all is well. I am going to be a rising sophomore majoring in Biochemistry. I was thinking of minoring in computer science (So that I could do Computational Biology research with some professor). I have NO coding experience. What are your thoughts on this? GOOD idea? A minor requites 6 compsci courses + one additional path past Calc III. I have 6 semesters left at Columbia. Also need to keep a high GPA for med school, but I really want a compsci minor.

Secondly, I have taken Calc III already, but I have just realized that a minor in compsci requires an extra math course. Should I take Linear Algebra or should I instead do, Intro into Probability and Statistics? (this may cover the stats requirement for premed. Not sure if I am good at the Probability though. Premed just requires Intro into Statistics).

I will appreciate any advice on this.

Columbia vs. Yale transfer for the arts,"Hi,

I was recently accepted as a transfer to Columbia and Yale! I spent the past year on a leave of absence from my college pursuing my professional acting and recorded music careers, which have both made me happier than I've ever been. I decided to transfer from my previous institution because there was no artistic community / available courses in acting/playwriting/recorded music, and it was too far away from LA auditions (2-2.5 hours 1 way). I have way more friends and am more acquainted with Columbia (I'm from NYC) and am now tasked with the difficult decision between the two. At Columbia, I could feasibly still audition regularly. However, would I not get as good of an on campus arts/theater/recorded music community than at Yale? Are the connections to the music/theater/film industries stronger at Yale than Columbia? Additionally, I've heard little about people at Columbia pursuing a career in recorded (pop) music. Is there a community of non-classical musicians/producers on campus?  Any advice is appreciated!!

It has been two years now and I still can't find a decent job with my (NON STEM) Columbia degree. I've been working as a front desk associate this whole time making just above minimum wage. 

I don't know where to go from here. Like most Columbia students I thought going to law school or business school would be the natural course of action, but I've seen too many people end up in debt because of it. I have lost faith in college and it's ability to prepare people for success.

Columbia vs. Yale for a transfer student?,"Sorry for the Columbia vs. X school post, but I have no idea where it belongs. I'm an admitted transfer student, who's waiting to hear back from Yale, and I think I have a pretty decent change of getting into both after speaking to an admissions officer. The issue is, I have no idea how to choose between the two, and I really don't want to fuck this up.

For some background– I got into Columbia as a senior in HS and didn't go, but decided to transfer. It would be an easier transition. I already know a few people from senior year, and there's a larger transfer population. I do have qualms with the core, but I believe it's doable since I'll be coming in as a sophomore. I love NYC as well, but Yale's residential colleges MAY be a worthy trade-off for it.

However, Yale would provide an easier academic transition. The lack of a core relieves some stress for me, and as a law-school hopeful, the grade inflation is super appealing. Although I know you guys can't speak to this, I am worried about  New Haven and integrating into the smaller transfer pool and close knit student body. 

With all of this being said, my main questions are: Have any of you picked Columbia over Yale? And if so could you share your reasoning? Do you guys think you'd trade the NYC environment for Yale's close knit campus? Is it odd for there to be sophomores in LitHum classes? Could any transfers share about their experience transitioning socially and academically? Also, just out of curiosity, have you guys heard anything about classes being on zoom vs in person during the fall? This isn't a huge factor for me, but I'd definitely take it into consideration.

I know it's premature to even debate this and hopefully, I won't have to make this decision, but I would really appreciate if you guys could give me some insight on any of these issues.",1589080787,1,0

I heard a type of hybrid semester is possible wherein half of the semester is online and the later half is in person, or that bigger lecture settings may be held online whereas smaller seminars might be in person. Just wondering, anyone heard anything similar? Also, if classes are online, how would you feel about letter grades vs pass/fail. I heard that summer classes are being taken for letter grades, so I think it’s safe to assume online fall classes would be given letter grades as well. Regardless, stay safe everyone!",1588621373,1,0
Postbac Psychology,"A little bit background about myself: I am recently graduated from a reputable university as an undergraduate majoring in Actuarial Science, administered in the business school. In my senior year, I realized that my major was not for me and I discovered a strong passion for psychology. I want to go to a Graduate School in Clinical and Counseling Psychology and I also want to do it in Canada, since Canada offers a better pathway for my future residency.

As a student who was majoring in Business, I only took 1 class in Psychology. I want to go to Columbia for post-baccalaureate before possibly enrolling in Masters/Ph.D. for Counseling/Clinical Psychology after that. My undergraduate GPA is in the range of 3.3-3.5. I was wondering what my odds are going to be and how hard is it to get into the program? I'm also very interested to get into the research program.

Thank you so much, guys!",1588593779,1,0
GS FinAid Qualms &amp;c.,"Hi all, I am a GS admit who deferred from January admission to a Fall start. Decisions around how to manage transitioning to Columbia were already challenging, but I'm having an especially tough time with all the crisis changes of late. Would love some opinions on what to do.

My motivations for GS were:to return to a more traditional undergrad program, with the option to be more engaged with a campus community, and put myself in a better position to apply to grad school. I've been working FT and going to school PT for a while and I'm frankly over it and just want to be a full-time student again for a while and finish my degree. I'm an econ major with a goal of getting into a well-ranked JD/MBA program after graduating. I'm currently 25 years old and have a 3.95 GPA. I *love* being in school despite my nontrad path and am so genuinely excited by the possibility of Columbia; it really feels like the right fit and seems like a second chance for me in a meaningful way. 

I'm able to transfer the maximum 60 credits allowed by the school, so could hypothetically finish my degree in two (potentially arduous) years. I've been offered $9k a semester/$18k year in scholarships from GS and will be on the hook for the remaining expense, less half of my housing costs as I'll be living with my partner. I recently lost my job due to covid so I am appealing my aid award, but not expecting a miracle there. 

I'm staring down the barrel of, on the max side, $30k in loans for my first year. Part of me feels this is insane (I don't come from money and the cash I do have is hard-earned), but part of me wants to invest in myself and hopes that the ROI from the degree will make this seem like bupkis to me when I'm older. With the news that classes may continue online for the fall semester, however, I'm doubly considering whether it's worth the financial risk...

TL;DR incoming GS econ major wants to know: is the degree, and the Columbia experience, worthwhile? 

PS - Also open to any advice on how many points to take as an incoming student, favorite classes/professors, ways to join in on campus life, happy stories from GS alums, etc. Could use some encouragement and help visualizing life in NYC right now tbh!",1588575285,1,0

SIPA’s 5-Year Dual Degree Program Help," Hi,

So, I am a newly admitted student to Columbia University School of General Studies (GS) for Fall 2020. 

I am extremely interested in pursuing the five-year joining degree program in International Affairs. I have looked over the admissions requirements, and I am worried that I may not be eligible to apply as I am expected to complete the majority of my major requirements by the end of my junior year. I recently received my Entrance Credit Report states that I have 28 transferable credits, thus places me in sophomore status. However, I don't know what classes/requirements the 28 Credits covers.

My anticipated major is Economics-Political Science. Based on the requirements of the program in addition to the core requirements, I feel that it would not be possible to complete a majority of the requirements by the spring semester of my junior year, even if I were to take classes doing the summer semester. My concern is if that if I enroll at GS and later discover that I am not eligible to apply for the program. 

If possible and/or necessary, I am also open to enrolling with no credits and starting as a freshman so I could be eligible to apply for the program within the established timeline.

I have received the following response from the office of admissions told me ""GS students are not necessarily titled or labeled as a 'sophomore' or 'junior' upon entering, because our students come from different backgrounds and also follow different timelines.""

The program coordinator for GS explained to me, ""it would be best after you have gone through an APS session and been assigned an advisor. As a rule of thumb, if one is considering the SIPA 5-Year Program, they should focus their studies on their core requirements and major requirements."" 

Essentially, I would have to accept my offer of admission, enroll, and hope that I will be eligible for the program.

The [website](https://sipa.columbia.edu/academics/dual-degree-programs/columbia-dual-degree-programs) literally says, ""Applicants will have completed most of their requirements for their undergraduate major *at the end of their junior year*. Most graduate-level courses completed as an undergraduate may be applied toward the 54 credits required for the MIA/MPA degree up to a total of 24 credits of advanced standing.""

Again, I am worried that if I enroll at GS and later discover that I am not eligible to apply for the program.

Has anyone been in a similar situation and has been accepted to the program?",1588504362,1,0
I need some information and advice,"So I got into Columbia for fall 2020 as a transfer. While this is a MASSIVE and HUGE milestone for me, I don’t know what to do as I feel like I’m on the clock.
Here is the dilemma: I applied to both USC and Columbia. I’m from California and USC is significantly closer to home. But they haven’t released decisions yet, but Columbia has. Due to the corona virus, Columbia has sent me an email suggesting I should enroll into the mandatory University studies course for summer semester online. I’m assuming that means that I should send in my acceptance of enrollment letter and my tuition deposit, but summer semester is starting soon and USC’s decisions haven’t come out yet. I’m not sure if I should just forget about USC at this point and go to Columbia. 
I’m a film and television production major which is why I’m waiting so patiently for USC SCA decisions but I feel like I’m running out of time for Columbia... what should I do?",1588485178,1,0
I just wanna get this off my chest,"Sorry to double post and probably gonna delete, but I've like dreamt of going to this school since I was 12 (7 years total) and I went on tours at other schools but touring this school last year almost brought me to tears. Not even to be corny but I almost feel ""transcended"" to another level of happiness whenever I'm in the area of the campus. I can identify Columbia's campus from just an image of a brick on the floor or the windows on a building. And when I decide to do my MS and PhD there's no doubt I'll be applying here again. I refresh my portal like 4 times a day, and to supplement being near campus I go over the virtual tour on the website. Like I've considered delaying the use of the AP credit I was given for a foreign language just so I could do the columbia language exchange. Even if it meant using all my free elective to do the Quechua and Punjabi sequences, taking a train all the way to harlem, in my mind it was worth it if I could study at columbia, sit on low beach, have an email, a lanyard with an ID with my C# if it meant that just for 3 or so hours of the week I could pretend to be a columbia student. Even if it meant paying out of pocket for John Jay dining hall meals, and the risk of being embarrassed when I don't adequate ""permission"" to enter butler, I'd do it. Even seeing the color, ""Columbia Blue"" makes me \~tingle\~. Every thing makes me think about columbia.

Ex when I was on campus: Gee I'm in the mood for burgers. who has the best burgers? Shake Shack. But shake shack do be expensive doe.

"Help me, please: Columbia CS v.s. Carnegie Mellon University ECE (Master's)","So here is my dilemma : I have received offers from both schools, but I cannot make a decision. 

I have a bachelor of science degree in Electrical engineering, and my interest lies in machine learning. Specifically, causality in machine learning.

Both of the schools have the courses about machine learning that I am interested in and 
the professors doing research about causality. (Though at Carnegie Mellon University, the professors who do research about causality are not from the ECE department, I heard that there's a solution to it.)

There are actually two reasons for me to choose Columbia University over CMU, which are the school rank and the name of the master's degree. 
I have already had a bachelor degree in EE, so I think it might look good on my resume if I have a masters degree in CS.

Newly Accepted Physics Student- questions,"Hello all! New to Reddit and newly accepted transfer student to Columbia's Physics program in General Studies! I hope you are all well given all that is going on. Have some questions as I consider Columbia- I've been accepted to a few schools and am still waiting to hear from a few more. 

Any info about the Physics program? I have research experience in an REU, NASA, and Brookhaven Lab so I'm really hoping to get involved. How likely am I to get support and opportunity to research, even unpaid, as an undergraduate? I am likely to take classes in Astronomy and to try to dual major in Math, so any information about these would help too. I've had a lot of opportunity for research in undergraduate and have spent most of the past year in research full time and hope to still have opportunity to continue as I prepare for grad school.

I'm also interested in and open to the engineering school's applied physics and math programs, and any information on those would be helpful. I understand internal transfer application would be required, but I applied to GS because I didn't have an engineering associates and thought it would make more sense to apply here. If I do not try this route, can I still take engineering courses as electives that I meet the prerequisites for, or is course enrollment school limited?

What is the dorming situation like? I'm an nontraditional, 27 year old disabled student with a lot of health issues so living alone would likely be ideal. If not possible, definitely in a suite where I'd have some privacy. What would be the best dorm to choose? How likely are they to be accomodating? Any advice on off campus housing? I'm from long island so I know how obscene rent is.

What is it like there? Culturally, academically, personally, socially, etc? I've never been on campus. I have a few friends who went for grad school but I'm curious about the undergraduate experience. Particularly how it is to be a GS student. I've read mixed things, such as on the scholarship situation. I still haven't received an award letter so I have no idea how tough that end will be but do have a few outside scholarships that will ease that a bit.

What do you wish you knew before you went to Columbia that I should know? Particularly for GS students or science students?

How helpful/understanding have professors or administration been given the current pandemic?

Trying to figure things out has been challenging on my own with all that's going on so I appreciate any help or advice you might have. I'm sure I'll think of more questions but I am strongly considering Columbia for the fall. Thank you!",1588369069,1,0

Is Columbia Law cutthroat? Columbia vs NYU Law,"I’m debating between Columbia and NYU for law school, but it’s been impossible for me to talk to anyone from CL. So, I’m here looking for some unfiltered anecdotal info on the law school. 

After evaluating a lot of factors, I feel like on one hand NYU Law has a more enjoyable environment in terms of the school culture and location, while Columbia has a slight edge with prestige and its network. All else comes out equal to me in terms of what I want to do in my career, etc. I recognize that law school is hard for everyone and I’m not looking for an “easy” time by any means, but I also definitely don’t want to be completely miserable. So I’m kind of in a dilemma wondering a) is Columbia also enjoyable and I just haven’t heard about it? and b) do Columbia’s pros outweigh NYU’s?

I spoke to an NYU alumn who said that when he attended law school (which he admitted was over a decade ago), Columbia law was known for being cutthroat and unpleasant. He told me a story of his Columbia friend having their notes thrown away by a classmate. I’m wondering if this still rings true? What’s the climate like at the law school?

Also, another thing that’s holding me back from CL is that the administration seems to be really unresponsive and unhelpful. I had some complications with my application for financial aid, and I never received a response to ANY of my five emails. When I called in several times I was told to leave a message by a robot, and they never tried to call me back. I tried to research housing options, but the website was down (it’s STILL down). My friend wanted to commit to CL, but couldn’t for several days bc the website was down, and when she tried to call she was left on hold for 3 hours before the automatic system hung up on her. I don’t think that coronavirus is an excuse for any of this, either, bc NYU Law has been amazing: they respond to my emails within 30 minutes, they put me in touch with alumni to talk to, etc.

None of this helps to assuage my feeling that CL is just a more difficult place to exist, and I don’t want that kind of stress while I’m trying to get through law school. Please let me know if you think I’m having an unusual experience with the administration!

All of that aside, I’d love to hear any other thoughts you guys have about the law school. What do you think its strengths are, and are you glad you chose Columbia? If you were in my position, would you choose Columbia? Thanks so much in advance for any advice, I’m lowkey having a meltdown over this.

Need help choosing between Columbia and Yale for a Masters in Statistics,"I’ve been accepted to both Columbia (MA Statistics) and Yale (MA Stats / MS Stats &amp; Data Science). I’m having difficulty deciding and need your help. I especially appreciate your insight if you’re a grad student.

So I love the idea of studying at Columbia. It’s in NYC and overall it’s got an amazing reputation. It’s also highly ranked in statistics, significantly higher than Yale. Columbia has a great tradition of investing in STEM fields and being in NYC would make networking for jobs much easier.

The thing is, everyone I speak to, and I mean everyone (professors at other schools, students from other schools, even industry people in NYC) tell me not to get a masters in Statistics from Columbia. Apparently the masters program has a terrible reputation of not investing in its student. Many courses are taught by my visiting lecturers, the cohort is huge (200-400 students??), and basically anyone that applies gets accepted, which apparently many international students use just to get a visa to stay in NYC. Are these things true? I need to hear from current students cause everything I hear is from outsiders. Is Columbia MA in Statistics worth it? Or should I go to Yale, which has a small cohort but I feel like Yale doesn’t have strong STEM resources and not being in NYC May hurt me when looking for jobs)?",1588112087,1,0

Columbia will be online,"I just said this under someone’s post but I genuinely feel certain that classes won’t be back on campus this fall. So many students coming from all over... an expected resurgence this fall... they can’t in good conscience send students back in one of the densest cities. 

I’m from NJ and supposed to start my two your program at SIPA this fall. Do I move forward with this plan and just be thankful I can save some money on housing (and yet still could visit NY when and If I want to?)??

Research Positions,"Hi all,

So I am a CS/Math major here at Columbia(sophomore). I don’t know why, but I’ve had so much trouble finding a research position at this school. It seems like every professor I have either had no space in there lab or doesn’t respond, especially in the Computer Science department.

I feel like it puts me in a tough spot, but I'm thinking I'll just have to just move out. I really do want to stay if we're doing in-person classes, but I'm not going to agree to pay a year of rent when I don't even know if I'll be occupying the apartment for half of the year.

"Need Help choosing between CMU, Columbia and JHU for 🤖!","Hi everyone,

I currently have admits from Columbia University (MS Mechanical), Carnegie Mellon University (MS Mechanical) and Johns Hopkins University (MS Robotics) for pursuing an MS in robotics, and I am still waiting for decision from UPenn.

I am actually quite confused right now about which program to go for, and also whether to wait for more admits. Because, I believe all these universities are great and have their own merits and demerits. Though, I am naturally inclined towards CMU because of it's reputation in robotics, I still can't just ditch JHU and Columbia. JHU would be offering a dedicated Robotics degree and Columbia offers the flexibility of taking courses from any school, even business. Also, Columbia is in New York!

Also, because the cost of attending all these universities would be the almost same, more or less around 100k, cost doesn't seem like a big differentiating factor. But, just to put things in perspective, the order would be CMU, JHU and Columbia in increasing order of costs.

Also, if the location would be a determining factor, and someone can elaborate on that, that'll be great. And just anything from their experience about these universities like outcome salaries, quality of work, life, etc.

For someone to help me better, I'll just explain a little about my goals. So, as of now I don't have any intentions of pursuing research in the field, but I've kept an open mind for that in the future. I have a general interest in robotics and nothing specific like medical robotics, locomotion, etc. And I would definitely want to take a job after MS, primarily to gain experience in the Robotics industry and also to repay the loan that I would take. But, eventually I am hoping to start my own venture (I have no clue about how that would pan out, or what I'll do, but that's just a raw plan).

Now, I don't know if taking professional courses (business-related) along with my MS would be helpful or not in the long run. Because, at the end it's never going to be the same as an MBA. Also, as per advice of some seniors, giving up on technical knowledge for professional courses would not be a good idea as what I'd learn in business courses would be relatively much more trivial than my specialization.

I'm so confused! I am currently inclined to go for CMU, but hoping for better insights on Columbia to make a well informed decision.",1587978225,1,0

How is the Columbia administration?,"I’m preparing to commit to Columbia in the next couple of days, but a letter I saw from President Bollinger regarding reopening in the fall really troubled me. Here’s the letter I’m talking about:

“Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:  

I am writing with another update, this time primarily to begin thinking ahead to the next academic year. Under the extraordinary and painful conditions of the pandemic, our minds are, by necessity, fixed on coping with the present. But, by inclination and by the sheer march of time, we also have to make plans for the future. We have collectively done so for this semester, and then for the summer, and now we need to bring our attention to the fall semester and next academic year. The purpose of this message is to say that this process is now underway.  

It is true that in a crisis, such as the one we are now experiencing, the almost incomprehensible variables and uncertainties that characterize the moment often make definitive decisions unwise. That said, I want to affirm that Columbia will be proceeding with the 2020-2021 academic year. Over the next two months, I and others will write with more detail about how we will do that. I have no doubt, however, that whatever form our pursuit and application of knowledge takes we will be called upon to manifest a steady and determined effort and to achieve the highest levels of creativity we can summon. We are open, but we are and will be open in new ways, including those we have not yet discovered. Some of what we will do will be new but will change back when normality returns, and for good reason, because these activities and practices have been developed and refined over centuries. I’m thinking here especially of the art of personal intellectual discussion. Other things, however, we will invent afresh, and keep, and the Columbia decades from now will be richer for them. You will hear from me soon about ideas that are emerging.  

Columbia is many parts. The colleges, schools, departments, institutes, and centers each will have somewhat different plans for the future given the different impacts of the circumstances in which they find themselves. Our central challenge, however, will be accommodating the undergraduate residential system in a period of ongoing risk resulting from COVID-19. Needless to say, we want everyone back just as soon as that can be accomplished with the level of safety we insist upon. As I indicated, we will know much more in the next several weeks. In the meantime, I have asked Ira Katznelson and Dr. Lee Goldman to expand our COVID-19 Task Force, which has been the bedrock of recommendations for the University in confronting the crisis, to have subcommittees address large issues of research, education, facilities, finances, and campus life. These groups are formed and will begin reporting back soon. I want to express our shared gratitude to the members of the administration and faculty who are literally devoting themselves to these institutional issues.   

Just one more thing. I try in these notes to add something about what the University is doing so that we can all have a fuller sense of pride in Columbia. I’d like to speak about our nearby communities. We are trying our best to help those closest to us in these dire moments. Our faculty are lending their expertise on public health and other urgent issues through a local media partnership with the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce. And our Columbia-Harlem Small Business Development Center (SBDC), which is connected to Columbia Business School, is helping hundreds of local enterprises to secure emergency federal loans. We have also offered two months in rent abatement for our small-business tenants, and we are preparing to launch a loan program, in partnership with the SBDC and the Business School, to help local shops, restaurants, and other small firms to reopen.  
   
I would like to close by saying that, while the virus continues to have its devastating effects on the lives of everyone, our medical and public health experts confirm that our policies and practices in New York City, the State, and the nation (as well as around the globe) are working, as witnessed in our own Medical Center, to reduce the escalation of severe illness to levels from which we can begin to bring our world back into some order. Especially for these individual acts of personal responsibility, we can also feel pride and hope for the future. For this, I am forever grateful.  

Again, from the President’s House, Jean and I send our warmest wishes.  

Sincerely,  

Lee C. Bollinger”

Is the administration as bad as this letter makes it seem. Who let this word salad get distributed? The presidents of the other colleges I’m considering—Brown and Williams, namely—seem much more competent. Is the quality of Columbia’s administration a factor worth considering, or does it not really impact day-to-day life too much?",1587933542,1,0
Columbia Vs. UChicago for Physics/CS/CyberSecurity," Hello! I am stuck between Uchicago and Columbia, and thought i would come here to ask for help. I'd be super thankful for any insights given. Here are some things about me:

* I love physics, applied to both schools as a physics major.
* I recently dove into cs, really liked it, and am now looking to double major. Most of my interest comes from cyber-security, artificial intelligence, quantum computing
* I like the idea of being involved in research projects with others at the forefront of development.
* I don't know much about the need for grad school for my plans, but i'm guessing it should probably part of them.
* I love having a tight-knit group of friends who I can do anything and everything with.
* I need a social life that goes beyond just school.
* I am an extremely artistic person, love music and painting, have a band of my own.
* My interests are quick to move in new directions, would like having access to an overall better STEM field in terms of diversity.

Here are my pros and cons for both schools...

**UChicago**: Applied as a physics major, looking to double major in cs.

Pros:

* Cheaper at around $13k a year
* President's Scholar, 5k summer research funding
* Has some of the leading professors and projects for quantum computing
* Recently has done a lot of investments into cs and security/systems.
* Super far from home!
* Slightly prettier campus
* Students are super collaborative (probably also true about Columbia)
* Easier access to grad school

Cons:

* Not SUPER into the whole weirdness aspect of the school, but i definitely do appreciate it.
* More isolated from Chicago than Columbia is from NYC (big con).
* Smaller student population.

**Columbia**: also applied as a physics major, also looking to double major in cs.

Pros:

* More diverse weather!
* Ivy League
* Probably better in STEM although I've heard that UChicago STEM is somewhat slept on.
* Right in the middle of Manhattan, immediate access to the city (big pro).
* I feel like i'd enjoy NYC more than Chicago, although i haven't visited either (&lt;3 corona)
* Possibly better social life?? (really idk)
* Super far from home!
* John Jay Scholar
* Has an engineering program that i could make use of, fits well into my interests of physics and cs
* Bigger student population!
* Super far from home!

Cons:

* NYC is very expensive
* Have heard it may feel slightly disconnected at times
* Much more expensive but still doable at $25k a year after appealing.

I also wanted to ask about how easy it is to double major with CS as a physics major? Thank you guys for helping me decide!",1587925205,1,0
Puerto Rican sperm donor,"I am a Columbia Law grad and I am preparing to get pregnant to start a family with my partner (who is Puerto Rican). We need a Hispanic (ideally Puerto Rican) sperm donor...in college or college grad, clean medical history. We have considered several different avenues but everything has fallen through so far. 

We would pay for all medical expenses plus travel to come to us (after covid has passed ofc) plus additional money to make it worth your while which would be a lot more than making a single donation to a sperm bank.

This may get some hate but we haven't been happy with the sperm bank approach so we decided to find someone ourselves. We want to get to know the donor (although the intention is that they wouldn't be in the child's life and wouldn't have any legal responsibility for the child).

I am looking at NYU Tisch for their stern/Tisch, Georgetown Business, Columbia University for Business. I have a couple of questions that if anyone could put in their two sense I would appreciate. 
1) Knowing that I will transfer, should I go to a community college and save money or go to another university such as TCU ( I have been accepted) and have a lot of fun for a year and then transfer? 
2) Do these prestigious colleges look at what college you come from? I am debating going to a community college but worry come transfer season if it’s between me and another applicant at a well know university, I won’t be chosen. 
3) If I were to grind my freshman year: straight A’s, good standing with professors, extracurriculars, etc what are my actually odds of these schools?",1587856474,1,0

Major to make the most money?,"Hi, I know that this kind of mindset will be frowned upon but different people have different goals, and my priority is money. It’s kind of sad but I have nothing else I enjoy or value in life and want to compensate for that with financial stability. 

Getting that awkward bit out of the way, I’m an incoming student at Columbia. I rejected some other top schools like Yale and Carnegie Mellon because I truly believe Columbia is the best school in the best city in the world. I just need to figure out what to major in.

This may sound extremely conceited, but I am very good at every academic discipline in existence. I am talented in math, sciences, writing, debate, computers, languages, you name it. The one thing I’m not good at is leadership or creativity, which is why I am not keen on starting my own business and making money that way. I need to be part of a company or establishment. 

For someone like me whose academic abilities aren’t a factor in choosing a career, what path should I go into to make the most money while having constant intellectual stimulation? The four most obvious ones are medicine, law, tech, and finance. Medicine seems fine— job security and great salary, but the downside is that it takes 8+ years to start making money. Law seems like really great intellectual stimulation for me— I highly enjoy reading and debating. But I feel like financially, law is worst out of the four. Tech seems extremely boring to me (math and coding all day) but it comes fairly easy to me and it is a marketable major. Finance is great for NYC and going into IB/Consulting makes Big Bucks but the work hours are extreme.

Sorry I know it seems like I’m complaining but if you could do any major to make money, and every academic discipline came easily to you, which would you choose? By the way, I’m talking like this purely because this is an anonymous platform— I don’t severely lack any social skills or the common sense to brag about myself in this way in front of real humans in a social setting.

Choice of classes for pre-med as an international (GS),"Hi guys! I am sorry in advance if this question has been asked a million times already, but I’m new to this group (and the American system of chosing classes all together). I am an international student who briefly attended an university in Croatia, but took some time away (blahblahblah) until I found my way to Columbia GS. In Europe, college classes are standardized for each ‘major’ and there is little to no choice involved (randomly assigned teachers etc.). 
After finishing 4 years I would definitely apply to med school (as I will most likely be a neuroscience major and will chose to take all pre med classes).
As I need to fulfill the core curriculum requirements (the pre med ones and major requirements as well), I was hoping for someone to shed some light on the ‘BeSt cLaSsEs’ I could take the first year. My aim is to hold the best possible GPA, manageable workload (with enough time to work at least 2 days a week) and get the teachers that will hopefully enrich the whole experience with their teaching.
I found that amazing webpage where students fill in which classes are the ‘easiest’ to get an A in, but I am unsure which one of these are ‘necessary’ for me to take (other than the core).
If there are any neuroscience (or similar) majors out there who took some classes other than the core (during their first year), please let me know.
I would gratefully appreciate all responses, and sorry if I get some of these ‘classes concepts’ wrong. It’s all new to me, so bare with me :)

Is the Social Life Really That Terrible?,i'm deciding between ut austin and columbia. one major reason im hesitant to commit to columbia is what i've heard about the social scene. i didn't get to visit the campus before corona so i have no idea what the vibe on campus really is. i'm not looking for crazy parties everynight but i would want a relatively good social life (going out 2-3 times a week maybe). can anyone chime in about the social scene at columbia?,1587617790,1,0
Columbia or UChicago (with merit scholarships)?,"The title is pretty self-explanatory. I’m planning to study astrophysics, but I like the broader exposure that the core provides at both schools so I’ve narrowed it down to these two. Both are highly ranked in the field and obviously have very good reputations. Although money is not a big issue, I received the University and President’s Scholarships from UChicago, totaling 50k in merit awards (10k per year + a 5k stipend for each of two summers). How much should this influence my decision? Which school would best prepare me for graduate school and give me the best overall experience, in terms of the department and the community/environment as a whole?

I’m particularly curious about how the sense of community, research opportunities, advising, and stress compare between the two, as well as your opinions on the two styles of core curricula.

These are just based on things I’ve heard; I don’t know how true some of them are so any thoughts or corrections would be appreciated:

Columbia pros: many opportunities of every kind in New York City, taking the same core classes means there is a shared community among all students, slightly higher ranked (obviously this doesn’t tell the whole story)

Columbia cons: more competitive environment

UChicago pros: residential colleges make it easier to find a community; slightly higher ranked in astrophysics, more collaborative environment, merit scholarship

UChicago cons: ”grade deflation” (I’m curious about this; how pronounced is it compared to Columbia, if at all?), pace of the quarter system

I’m still very conflicted so any thoughts about these subjects or anything else I should know will help!

I also posted this same question to r/uchicago to hear their perspectives as well.",1587609684,1,0

Columbia vs UChicago vs Berkeley (Please help),"I’m interested in biomaterials/soft materials. Not into engineering things as much (computers, roads, cars, CAD) and more into smaller-scale stuff. I picked mat sci because it can be on the smaller scale and is very versatile (physics, chem, math, bio). I want college to be fun and academically engaging. I want to really love learning again and learn how to think. I don’t want to do my classes or ECs just because. I also want to be around interesting people who are very different from me and passionate about what they do/willing to talk about it. Future: Probably PhD? Maybe not? I don’t know what I’m doing with my life?

Columbia (mat sci with bioeng minor)

Pros: egleston program (good connections with dean, advising, 10k stipend), many engineering majors, can study humanities, NYC (my dream!!!), flexible engineering major

Cons: mat sci is very condensed matter physics focused and im more into chem/bio and its also a really small major, not as community-oriented as uchicago, seems like people are very go-go-go, stress/individualistic culture, very finance-y, taking classes with grad students, idk if i can study abroad

UChicago (Molecular engineering)

Pros: the major fits my interests of applying science on a small scale and very interdisciplinary, study humanities, community/housing/traditions, into the “learn for sake of learning” vibe, collaborative, into the idea of listening in on a philosophical discussion at the dining table for 3 hours

Cons: Chicago, might not have the same interests, no other engineering majors (and i might be into engineering), not super entrepreneurial/applied, newer/unknown major that seems to be constantly changing, no special perks like columbia egleston, majorly econ, idk if i can study abroad

Berkeley M.E.T. program (mat sci + business) 

Pros: entrepreneurship/business seems really interesting/exciting (never done it before), regents, M.E.T. gives good opportunities/community, half the cost 

Cons: lack of course/major flexibility (eg not many biomaterials courses i can fit in and the mat sci courses aren’t as interesting to me), won’t be able to study humanities as much, want to try something different from california, very tech-y 

I change my mind every 30 minutes so any thoughts are appreciated. Questions:

\-- How do u like Columbia and its culture?

\-- How engaging are classes and how good are the professors? Do you feel you learn a lot from your peers?

\-- How diverse is it actually?

The final showdown: Columbia vs. Brown,"(I was inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bihiuy/columbia_vs_brown_please_help_me/) that debated between Brown and Columbia.)

First, thank you to anyone who helps me out with this! The past month, I've been conflicted over which school is a better fit for me: Columbia or Brown. Starting the college admissions process, I thought Columbia was my dream school, but I also fell in love with Brown's community. Columbia seems to have more ""prestige,"" but I'm not sure how far it takes me into a career/post-grad plans.

I want to go into economics and/or computer science (possibly fintech, software engineering, or consulting. IB isn't at the top of my list). However, I also want to explore philosophy, English, and maybe political science, journalism, or public health. Additionally, I never got to explore entrepreneurship in high school and I would love to start in college. 

**Columbia pros/cons:**

* **pros:**
   * **the CORE:** it encapsulates almost all of my interests (philosophy, English) into several courses, so I don't feel a ""need"" to take extra philosophy/English courses outside of the core. I had a pretty classics-heavy education (learned Latin, read a ton of Greek philosophy/Aristotle's ideas on tragedy) and I would love to continue that into the core + expand my understanding of other works. Additionally, I'm an externally-motivated person and kinda need ""required"" courses to push me to work. The most rewarding classes I had in high school were the ones I was required to take/in a competitive environment because it pushed me intellectually.
   * **the environment (?):** this is a pro and a con. I work well under pressure/with lots of deadlines, but I don't want to be in a place where everyone just brags about their accomplishments or tries to one-up each other. My high school environment was like this, and I felt pretty uncomfortable.
   * **on-campus housing/food:** I enjoy privacy, and Columbia's singles (although small) is good enough for me. I had the chance to eat at Alfred Lerner Hall a couple of years ago and liked the food (not sure how much this ""impacts"" what school I want to go to, though)
   * **location:** New York City. I feel like there's a lot of potential for me, ranging from making connections to exploring the city's culture. Additionally, I heard that recruiting at Columbia is big because of its proximity to Wall Street. Also, because part of my family lives internationally, it's a lot easier for them to visit me.
   *  **interdisciplinary:** philosophy of economics is one major. I read a lot of Adam Smith and Nussbaum during high school, and I want to continue that into university. Best of both worlds for me but not sure how ""transferrable"" that is to careers.
* **cons:**
   * **not as much undergraduate focus:** this is particularly concerning to me. I do well with face-to-face discussion and staying connected with professors. I'm not sure if I'm going to do research, but I'm concerned that if I want to go to grad school or get undergrad research, a lack of a connection might hurt me in the end.
   * **stress culture** = I don't want to become overly stressed. This probably depends on who I'm around, based on other r/columbia posts I've seen on stress culture. 
* **questions:**
   * How much does Columbia help in helping students get internships/jobs post-grad? For anyone going into Econ/CS, how was your experience at Columbia? Where do CS students go in the future?
   * Are there people who do internships during the school year? How busy are they?
   * How difficult is it to maintain two interests/get a degree in both? (I'm planning on doing CS and Econ)
   * What are things you don't like about Columbia?

**Brown pros/cons:**

* **pros:**
   * **academic environment (the OPEN CURRICULUM)**: I love the flexibility it offers. Personally, if I was going to Brown, I would want to take courses in Russian Lit and public health just to enrich myself. There's a lot of flexibility at Brown, but I'm worried that my ""lack of discipline"" will prevent me from pushing myself intellectually. (Brown is also pretty relaxed on dropping classes and taking things as pass/fail, and grade inflation helps make Brown's environment not as competitive). 
      * It's also a big plus that CS-Econ is a joint concentration, and I can do a double concentration in CS-Econ and another filed of study.
      * some other great things: Brown has a 5th-year masters program in some of my interests (computer science, public health). I have no idea how this impacts my career plans or if it's ""worth it"" for my specific situation.
      * I believe Brown students can petition to cross-register into Harvard courses. I found that pretty interesting, but I probably won't do it because of the commute.
   * **a strong undergraduate community:** I thrive off of one-to-one interaction with professors, and I think that research opportunities won't be as difficult. Socially, most of my experiences with Brown students are positive. They seem pretty happy/not as stressed as other students. It seems somewhat polarized by academic interest, but I'm not sure if that's a major draw for me.
   * **location:** I love the ""college-town"" feel Brown has, and its proximity to Boston is a plus for me (it's one of my favorite cities)
* **cons:**
   * **housing/food =** I heard that Andrews is one of the better dining halls, and I've heard some negative reviews of the Ratty. I don't particularly like how Brown is mostly doubles, either.
   * **ability to get internships?** How much does Brown's ""name,"" people's alumni connections, or connections they've built over college impact what internships they get? I'm somewhat unclear on how it works. 
* **questions:**
   * to Brown econ or CS students, how is your experience in the departments?
   * How do you maintain internal drive in a laid-back school like Brown that's very flexible academically?
   * What are some things you don't like about Brown?",1587407795,1,0

Questions for those who've lived Claremont 7 person suite?,"Hey everyone, 

Our housing group is currently deliberating on where to live for the coming fall and we were wondering if anyone had answers to the following questions regarding Claremont 7 person suites:

1) How large are the common areas/is there much of a common area at all? From the floor plans, it looks as if the kitchen area is essentially the common area. Is this true? If so, is there much space for the whole suite to gather in an area to do work/chill etc?

2) Are there other public access toilets in the building outside of the ones in the suite? Since there are seven people to one bathroom, we were concerned that maybe multiple people will want to use a bathroom at the same time.

3) Do you have any recommendations on which floor to go for? Do higher floors have a better view or is it easier living on a lower floor without having to rely on elevators?

Tuition as a veteran,"Greetings everyone! Im looking for some advice/information for columbia. Im a veteran and i just got accepted to GS for Fall 2020 (as a transfer. I will be transferring with 60 units) and I am super happy about this as i would be the first one from my family going to an Ivy League university. One thing I am not super happy about is the obvious money issue. 

From a simple google search, the estimated annual tuition for 2020-2021 will be $71,460.00. I have the GI Bill which I have partially used for one semester of community college (I am not sure if this will be an issue of how much the GI bill would help me out if I used my benefits at a different school). I just looked on the VA website and the GI bill will pay for $24,477.00 annually, which is great but it definitely wont cover all. The yellow ribbon program will pay $24,476.79 annually (i think... im not quite sure how this program works), which will also help significantly. Assuming that those numbers are accurate, I would have to pay $22,506.21 out of pocket annually.

I ended up at that number because I am not a resident of New York but a resident of California and I am really not sure if I would qualify for financial aid as someone mentioned in a different subreddit. Can someone explain/help/let me know how I could potentially graduate from columbia debt free? Maybe there's another benefit for veterans that I am not privy to? Please help!

Can anyone tell me more about the MS program for Applied Math?,"Some background: I’ll be finishing my undergrad in ECE/Math from my state school this spring and will be working at a trading firm in NYC this fall (barring any further unforeseen circumstances). 

I’ve heard that Columbia’s masters programs are mostly cash cows and offer no financial aid- however, my company is willing to reimburse part of my tuition so I figured that I might as well pick up a degree that’s relevant to my job.

I couldn’t find much online about the MS applied math program, so I have a few questions:

CS/Econ or Civil Engineering.. deciding between Columbia and Cornell,"Hi everyone, I was recently accepted to Columbia (SEAS). At the time I applied, I was interested in civil engineering, but in the past few weeks, I've had time for some self-reflection and realized that it may not be my thing (yay for social distancing?). Currently leaning towards CS instead, and I might double major in econ or switch to econ by itself. I do realize that this would require me to switch to CC -- would this be an easy switch? 

I am currently deciding between Columbia and Cornell. I'm not really interested in working in finance, which I know is a huge advantage to studying in NYC. Regardless, though, the networking/internship opportunities generally seem much better at Columbia, even though its CS/engineering program is not as renowned as Cornell's. 

One thing I am worried about, however, is that Columbia seems to lack the traditional college experience; the cohesive feeling that Cornell offers (athletic events; Greek life; cheaper forms of entertainment like hiking, snowboarding, etc). While I love being in the city, I'm worried that I won't be able to enjoy it as much as I'd like since everything is so pricey... thoughts on this?

Also, Columbia seems more focused on its grad students rather than the undergrad population, but please correct me if I'm wrong. 

Feel free to share any personal experiences/thoughts on student culture. It's tough to decide on a college without visiting, so hopefully this can make up for it!",1585613154,1,0

Freshman Summer CS Advice,"Hey everyone,

I hope you guys are staying safe and healthy. Like many of us, I have been trying to find something to do over the summer. I applied to a bunch of internships via Handshake, but I, unfortunately, haven't heard back from any of them. 

Although I recognize that freshman internships do not matter much anyway, I was hoping to at least find something productive (particularly CS related) to do over the summer. I'm signed up for two Columbia summer classes and have plans to try out some free online ones, but everything is still up in the air. 

So, do you guys have any recommendations on what I could do?  I've taken up to Honors Data Structures, so I already feel pretty comfortable with languages like Java.  Should I be prepping for coding interviews on websites like Leetcode or AlgoExpert or maybe learning other programming languages?

P.S:

Even though it may seem like it, I don't really consider myself to be a competitive, pre-professional person. I know freshman summer stuff doesn't really matter much, but I'm more worried about just finding something productive to do over the summer.

I remember there had been an admissions related megathread where all the admission questions are posted there. Is this no more?



Frankly this sub is getting a little bit annoying recently.",1586697975,40,0

Are there average people at Columbia?,"I shouldn’t be roaming this sub and getting my hopes up especially since I’m only in HS, but I hope you still entertain this post!

I haven’t visited Columbia before and it appears I won’t be able to for a while. 

However, on the surface level looking at statistics there seems to a lot of student and faculty diversity that I really appreciate.

I know it’s a private school so the average family income is naturally high...but does this contribute to a sense of elitism in this school in any way? Or are people just generally down to earth?

Lastly, other than demographics and wealth, are there average people in the sense of intelligence? This is a really dumb question as Columbia is a super competitive school that garners the best talent throughout the world, but I can’t help feeling behind in the midst of all this.  I imagine majority of the student population were either NASA interns, published research, won international competitions, or some variation of excellence in HS. Are there any “regular” (for lack of a better word) that got into Columbia?



I have a one in a million shot at this school so it probably super premature to ask these questions. I wish I could visit the school instead and experience the campus and ask these questions in person, but I’ll take this as a second choice! 

Also bonus question! —from your experience at Columbia, what type of students do you think Columbia looks for?",1586682578,0,0

Is debt for Columbia CS worth it over a full-ride to a reputable state school?,"I haven't committed and I am very conflicted over which school to pick. If I attend Columbia, I will have  roughly $45k in debt (High-end estimate). On the other hand, I can attend my state school (UMD, which is T-20 for CS) with a full-ride. Considering this, would you say it is worth it?

Fall 2020 Columbia GS Questions," 

All,

I've been accepted to GS for Fall 2020. I'm currently an active-duty soldier who will be ETS'ng this summer. I've applied to several other schools, including Cornell, Yale EWSP, and Brown RUE. I'm leaning towards GS because of the academic program for my major and the opportunity to apply for the joint BA/MA program. I have read many other articles, Reddit posts, and even the Columbia  Spectator on student's experiences at GS and understand the issues surrounding sounding the university, especially with financial aid. I do have some questions about life at GS I was hoping I could get some insight.

Finical Aid: I know it's horrible at GS. I am 100% qualified for the Post 9/11 GI Bill and will also have the Yellow Ribbon. However, depending on the number of points I take for the class semester (15, or 16), I would still have tuition I to pay out of pocket. I might be eligible for the Pell grant, but I'm not sure how to estimate how much I would be entitled. What are your experiences with this?

On-Campus Job: To help pay for GS, I'm not against getting a campus job like working at the bookstore or library, how difficult is it to get one? What is the average salary?

Housing: I know it isn't guaranteed**,** and the sooner I apply, the better chance I have at getting it. I plan to make my decision on Columbia by 30 Apr before the second wave of admission decisions are released, so if I chose to accept, I'll apply for housing. I ABSOLUTELY NEED a single room. I've had horrible experiences with roommates and honestly can't bear to experience it again. I can do with a private bedroom with a shared common area for the first year, but CAN NOT/WILL NOT be in the same room with another person. What are the apartments like? Can you choose preferences on what type of room and/or suitemates you can have?

I'm not against living off-campus, but I know NYC is expensive, and with $3,366, MHA during the school year is not going to cover everything. But I am curious what are some decent apartments near campus that are at least half the MHA?  

Gay Scene: I'm gay and a minority. What is the dating scene like at GS? I know there is an LGBT Club for GS students, but aside from that, what else is there?

GS is in my top 3, and I am seriously thinking about accepting my offer and going, any insight you can provide will greatly help me in making my decision.

Thanks,",1586607495,1,0
