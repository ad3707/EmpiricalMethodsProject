Roommates for graduate students (Smeal College of Business),"Hey everyone,

I am going to be attending Penn State this fall for a master's program and I was wondering what the room/roommate selection process is like.  Any recommendations on finding housing (on or off campus) as well as the roommate selection process. 

While I'm writing this post, I'm also wondering about the activities to do in State College.  I've visited the campus and it seems huge, but at the same time rural.  I play tennis, am generally active, and outgoing.  I'm wondering if there are indoor courts and other good places to hang out (trails, restaurants, other places, downtown?)

How's the SRA major?,"I got an acceptance as a transfer student to the World Campus. I would have done IST, but more of my credits count towards SRA so I think I will stick with that and maybe pick up an IST minor. I just wanted to ask if an SRA degree can get me a technical job, as I heard the classes are not technical enough? I definitely know it's more for consulting/risk management.  I can't do CyberAnalytics because I live out of state and it's not offered at World Campus (which is my only option for attending PennState), and IST would require  more time. So if you have an outlook of jobs in SRA, please let me know. Thanks.",1580086701,1,0

Idea for buying electronic textbooks collectively,"Perhaps too late for this semester, but maybe useful for the future. I don't know why we don't do this more often already as students. If you're in a relatively small class (&lt;40 people), and pdf/ebooks work for your class, you can find a site like MyShopify (or others that offer textbook downloads) that sell books for much cheaper than on other platforms, get everyone to pitch in just a tiny bit, download the pdf just once and then share it with everyone. This is for those books that can't be found for free, of course. I just bought a pdf version for $25 and it's a regular pdf download...if a bunch of people would've gotten together in the first week of class and agreed to this, it would've been less than $1 per person and then everyone would have the pdf. Consider this for future semesters if you're just buying electronic versions for higher prices. Don't ever spend more on textbooks than you have to!",1579878183,1,0

Swimming lessons/Swim buddy,"Hi, 

&amp;#x200B;

I just started taking swimming lessons recently offered by Campus Rec in the McCoy Natorium thing. I'm finding myself to be struggling in my class (of the 3 people that signed up for it it seem like I'm the worst swimmer since I didn't even know how to float while the other 2 seem to be able to do that at least). So I was wondering if anyone who regularly go to swim be it in the White building or McCoy would be interested in either giving me extra lessons so I can practice more outside of class (I will be more than happy to pay too, depend on the rate), or just be my swimming buddy, like let me know when you are going to the swim and I will go practice with you, it's nice to know someone when you are at the pool because it can be really intimidating.

3. Approx. how much does it cost for the entire session (including tuition, room &amp; board, and meals)

4. How rigorous &amp; time consuming are the classes you take, and do those credits you take during the summer exempt you from credits you must take during the fall/spring semester?

I know i asked a lot but any and all responses are greatly appreciated, the summer session is a huge factor on whether i will choose to attend or not. i also have a few friends that will be doing the summer semester as well.

RIP Taco Bell,"I just have to rant for a little bit. 

It is so frustrating to me that a funny little thing that Penn State students did to make ourselves laugh is being twisted in a grotesque way by almost anyone else that sees it. There is constant criticism involving the likes of Jerry Sandusky and the lack of vigils held for the victims. 

This really bothers me for a number of reasons. First, none of the students currently at Penn State were even here when the scandal broke. It is not current students responsibility for the vigils of victims or lack thereof. Secondly, there WAS a candlelight vigil held for the victims. Students are not associated with this scandal in any way besides being bystanders. It is so tiresome to constantly be fighting this battle with everything we do under a microscope. 

What Jerry Sandusky did was absolutely despicable and should have been stopped. I feel for the victims and their families. Unfortunately, there is nothing that current students can any longer do at this point to ease that pain. However, we are still viewed as responsible for it.

It just feels like we can never do anything right. If something bad happens, even if it‚Äôs just at a place you go to a school, you are constantly associated with it and critiques in the same light as it. 

Sorry for the rant, but frankly, I‚Äôm fucking tired.",1583153440,1,0

Code of Conduct Violation Leading to Suspension - Please Give Me Some Advice/Insight,"Some quick background: I have diagnosed Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Panic Disorder, Bipolar II, ADHD, Opioid Abuse Disorder, and Acute-Moderate Insomnia. I suffered a grand-maal seizure in November 2018 during my senior year at Temple University. Got taken out of school on a medical leave of absence and took the 2018-2019 school year off. Transferred to Penn State Main for the 2019 Fall semester.

Last semester I very stupidly committed a crime (nothing violent or aggressive). A few weeks ago I went to court, I'm being put on ARD, and am in huge debt to my mother who‚Äôs paying for all of this. I‚Äôm fully aware of my utter stupidity throughout this entire ordeal and I‚Äôm trying to compartmentalize everything while staying on top of my school work. I don't need a lecture on how or why I did what I did, I've taken full responsibility for my actions.

Today I met with a case manager at the Office of Student Conduct to explain my side of the story. I was expecting to be put on some form of probation through the school as my lawyer had told me. I was forthright with the case manager as she was very nice and understanding. I told her about my background, my interests, my major, how much I enjoy PSU, and everything I could regarding the actual case itself. I did not lie or specifically state anything I didn't personally feel just so she could hear what she wanted to hear. Told her I deal with anxiety on a daily basis but that my anxiety/mental state had nothing to do with the reasoning behind my criminal activity, and that I‚Äôm extremely remorseful for what I did. I‚Äôm being very proactive in attempting to fix my wrongdoings, pay for what I‚Äôve done, and move forward with my life. I'm attending counseling twice a week and see a psychiatrist.

She then came to the decision that she is going to sanction that I be suspended from school for this spring semester, which I was not expecting at all. I immediately had a panic attack/breakdown in her office and the younger girl that was shadowing her was crying the entire time. She suggested I have someone come and meet me at the office to bring me home or I go to the hospital/student health center, which I declined.

Afterwards, I went back to my apartment and since about 5pm I've been sitting in silence, crying, and cutting myself. I contacted my lawyer about what to do and he hasn't gotten back to me. I know I fucked up. I know I'm an idiot. I currently have A's in all of my courses and in the Fall I finished with the best semester GPA of my entire college career. I live 3 hours from State College, so home is a pretty far drive, and I simply cannot afford to be suspended this semester. The credits that transferred over from Temple went almost entirely towards my Gen-Eds. I switched my major when I transferred (still in the same field - Health) so the majority of my courses are required for my new major. 

I'm going to choose to do a sanction review in an attempt to lessen the punishment of suspension in hopes of some sort of probation. For this, I have to write a letter to the dean of Student Affairs and explain why I believe the punishment is too severe and ask for a different penalty. I'm not at all trying to defend myself regarding my case. Given my past history, I know for a fact that a semester suspension would be detrimental to my mental health and general well-being. I'm not just saying that as an over-exaggeration because this just happened today, but because I know how my brain acts when I'm severely depressed. 

Has anyone else ever been in a similar situation like this before? Does anyone know the likelihood of the sanction punishment being less severe after I write a letter? If you have any experience in dealing with the Office of Student Conduct for any reason please please let me know. I'm having a very difficult time keeping myself together right now.

"looking for interns for a PAID [$15/hr] peer-to-peer startup internship. If you're involved on campus, a little gritty, and are contemplating a startup one day this is a perfect opportunity.","Greetings to all skimming this.

I work at a startup called [Stache.com](https://stache.com/) which is a peer-to-peer storage company - think ""Airbnb meets Storage."" Aside from the obvious glamour associated with the storage industry, it's worth noting we collectively spend $40bn per year on storing our stuff. Pretty ridiculous. That's where we come in.

The company got its start as an affordable solution for college students to store things over the summer. Hosts are typically grad students, other undergrads, faculty or neighbors near campus. Everything is insured up to 10k. Pricing is significantly less than what gets pushed by the big players in the space b/c ""sharing-economy"" woo. Basically we have no cost but interns + the platform for a college launch.

Dm if you‚Äôd like to learn more, are interested in potentially managing a $1000-5000 marketing budget with our help, and adding something to the resume this spring in a growth, biz dev, ops type of role. You'll essentially be the campus version of what marketplace companies (Airbnb, Uber etc) call a GM. If you're feeling brave we'll give you a 4 figure marketing budget and lessons on what worked at Stanford, Cal,  UCSB and Vandy. Then you go make it happen with our help. It's basically the closest you're gonna get to being paid to learn on the job if you're thinking about starting a startup one day. 

It entails some simple stuff like flyering dorms (20%) along with more digital growth work related to managing local online channels + any other crazy ideas we come up with. The opportunity is paid ($15/hr), hours are flexible and will take 2-4 hrs per week with potential to extend into the summer as well.

Help support vulnerable students at your university!,"Hello! I‚Äôm a reaching out on behalf of [NoFailNation](https://nofailnation.firebaseapp.com/), a student organization dedicated to spreading awareness of alternative grading systems being considered by higher educational institutions across the country in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

As the world attempts to slow the spread of coronavirus and universities scramble to move their courses online at a moment‚Äôs notice, students and professors alike must quickly learn to navigate unfamiliar territory in both their personal and professional lives. That this novel and unforeseen situation has affected every one of us goes without saying, even for those of us who are healthy and have a safe home to return to. Unfortunately, many have not been so lucky, and for those students the recent surge of dorm closures, mass layoffs, resource shortages, and health risks will be the most devastating. Under the current circumstances, any measure of academic performance will be heavily tainted by massive discrepancies in individual privilege. 

Many schools initially responded to this crisis by adopting an opt-in pass/fail system, such that students can select which classes they would like graded as pass/fail at any point in the semester. Although this system may help to mitigate undeserved damage to an otherwise successful student‚Äôs academic record, it does very little to address the stigma that students who choose the pass/fail option will inevitably be subject to‚Äîan issue particularly concerning for students applying to medical, law, and graduate schools (many of which have already released statements indicating that pass/fail grades will *only be accepted from schools with universal policies*). Most importantly, an opt-in pass/fail system will further potentiate the many inequities students of low-income and marginalized families already endure. As we lose access to our campuses, dorms, libraries, and many other resources which serve as academic equalizers, bold steps must be taken to protect the most vulnerable among us.

Originally proposed by the Yale University student body, the movement dubbed [\#NoFailYale](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nofailyale&amp;src=typed_query) on Twitter has since evolved into a national conversation, prompting an abundance of students, professors, and administrators to petition for a **universal pass** grading system at their own institutions. Among the many proposed variants of the universal pass system, two models‚Äîeach with their own pros and cons‚Äîhave been endorsed most frequently by university administrators: 

# 1. Universal Pass Model

***All students*** **receive a grade of P on their transcript, having no effect on their GPA.**

* Proponents of this model argue that in these unprecedented times, students should be protected from negative academic repercussions without being unfairly granted a competitive advantage over their peers.
* Critics of this model argue that the complete abandonment of letter grades disregards the work completed before the pandemic and shuts out many students (often graduating seniors) who were counting on this spring semester to raise their GPA.

# 2. Double A Model

***All students*** **receive either an A or an A-, determined at each professor‚Äôs discretion.** 

* Proponents of this model argue that a double A grading system allows the hard work of able students to be recognized without significantly penalizing those who are not.
* Critics of this model argue that universal A‚Äôs will undermine the belief of many that an A signifies truly exceptional performance and reinforce the stereotype that professors ‚Äújust hand out grades‚Äù.

The arguments for and against a universal pass system have been very compelling on both sides, and new ideas are sure to surface as the nation adapts to this rapidly changing situation. While each institution has unique challenges to face in order to best serve the needs of their students and faculty, we believe that the top priority for *all schools* should currently be to protect the most vulnerable and affected members of their community in a time of global, unforeseen hardship. Students should not be forced to *choose between their grades and the safety of themselves and their loved ones*. 

Reading through so many articles, petitions, and student testimonials, one thing has become very clear: student voices have been a major factor in college/university policies! That‚Äôs why we decided to set up a landing page to collect petitions for individual universities as well as other sources of relevant information and updates. We‚Äôve also included a [petition made by students at your school](https://www.change.org/p/students-change-penn-state-spring-grades-to-be-pass-no-pass-and-counted-as-major-requirements) (Penn State University) below. If you‚Äôd like to join our cause or ask any questions, you can message us here or on Twitter.

Pennstate (Hons) Vs Purdue for Data Science,"I'll start off by providing some background information. I'm an Indian student from Dubai with a strong academic background. I applied for a BS in Data Science to many universities in the US.

As of now, I've to decide between Purdue University and Pennsylvania State University (Hons)

Pennsylvania State University

I've been offered admission to the college of Information Sciences and Technology for Data Science at University Park Campus. I've also been offered admission to the Schreyers Honors College. Some benefits of the Honors College are as follows

‚Ä¢Access to Integrated Undergraduate Graduate (allowing completion of undergrad and grad concurrently and permits students to use the honors thesis for the graduate thesis , as well as using some courses towards both degrees)

‚Ä¢Honors housing
‚Ä¢Specially Trained Honors advisors
‚Ä¢Priority registration for scheduling classes
‚Ä¢Access to Senior Faculty
‚Ä¢$5000 annual scholarship
‚Ä¢Small class sizes
‚Ä¢Fellowships ( Better internship and research opportunities)
‚Ä¢Scholarships

Purdue University

I've been offered admission to the College of Science at Purdue University for Data Science. I've heard that you cannot go wrong with Purdue as it is a solid choice especially with regards to engineering. A lot of students from Dubai opt for Purdue, so it may seem to be a more familiar environment for me.

Additional Information

The fee structures for both universities are similar (around $48K a year). Furthermore academics is the priority between these two colleges. I'm an INTJ, and not a big fan of partying or Greek Life. However I look forward to participating in various clubs recognised by the university.
I'm currently undecided on whether to pursue a grad degree after undergrad or work for a bit and then pursue a grad

I appreciate any constructive input on the above matter.",1585425070,1,0

Seeking Help/Advice: Transferring to Architecture from ArchE,"Hey guys!

Hope you're all staying safe and healthy during this period. My brother's a freshman at State College with the initial plan on going into Architecture Engineering, after going through it for \~2 semesters he's realized he'd rather be in the Architecture program with the aim of getting a B Arch. The Arch advisors have been all but impossible to reach, but the one thing he's gotten from them's that he can't apply to start it this fall and would have to start Fall 2021(he's junior year). Would appreciate any advice I can pass on to him on the application process(portfolio, grades, etc. ) , if it's possible to take some of the required Arch courses in the mean time without being in the school yet, if not what could he take, and then any general advice or past experience.

Note: he's planning on getting a minor in ArchE and/or something else at SC, maybe Engineering Leadership Development or Real Estate Analysis and Development. 

Really appreciate any response I can gather.

"Join me in sending emails to UP to ask that pass/fail classes are made mandatory throughout Penn State, not optional.","It‚Äôs understandable that a college cannot expect a student to give 100% during this time. There are many factors to consider, such as available technology, home environment, adequate nourishment, etc. This led Penn State to give students the option to choose whether to keep grades or to use a pass/fail grading system on them. 

I don‚Äôt think the university thought this through fully. Harvard Law School initially adopted the same plan as us. However, the college faced strong backlash from students claiming that when employers see the pass/fail grade on your transcript, they will automatically deduce that you wanted to take the ‚Äúeasy way out,‚Äù and thus your application would lose value. That all changes if Penn State mandates only pass/fail. 

I think we can all agree that these times are unprecedented and all affecting us one way or another. I think it‚Äôs completely unfair for an employer to view your pass grade as ‚Äúthe easy way out‚Äù when in reality we are going through a time which is hard for all of us. If online classes were more effective for us, we would all have taken those through the world campus in the first place.",1585256926,0,0

Update to grading policy," Taken from  [https://sites.psu.edu/virusinfo/faqs/](https://sites.psu.edu/virusinfo/faqs/) 

At the end of the spring semester, once students receive their letter grades, they will have the option, on a course by course basis, for those grades to remain as letter grades or to appear as one of three options on a new satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading scale.¬†¬†

We want to provide our students every opportunity for success during this unprecedented time and recognize the change in their learning environments and the need for a rapid adaptation to remote learning. The key is that this is optional for students, and we encourage all students to work closely with their academic advisers to makes these decisions. More details on this policy will be available soon at [remotelearning.psu.edu](https://remotelearning.psu.edu/).

*Details about the scale:*¬†Students will have the choice to receive a ‚ÄúSAT‚Äù notation (in lieu of a letter grade of ‚ÄúC‚Äù or better); a ‚ÄúV‚Äù instead of the letter grade ‚ÄúD‚Äù; or a ‚ÄúZ‚Äù instead of a letter grade ‚ÄúF‚Äù ‚Äî all with the notation on transcripts indicating the extraordinary circumstances we all are dealing with this semester. The alternative grades will not impact a students‚Äô GPA in either direction but will still count toward credits achieved and progression of semester standing, which will help in the continuation of our students‚Äô academic careers. This is important for helping students navigate many processes, from maintaining financial aid to maintaining a certain semester standing when purchasing student football tickets.¬†¬†

This alternative grading option is available to all undergraduate students, including World Campus students, and those returning from study abroad. This does not apply to graduate students and undergraduate students enrolled in IUG programs cannot use this option for courses that will count toward their graduate requirements.¬† The Graduate School is examining options on grading and will be sharing more information soon.¬†¬†",1585180272,1,0

Don't Want to be Threatened in Zoom by Your Professor Regarding Your Microphone/Webcam/Screen?,"[https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/communications/teaching-remotely-with-zoom-faq-and-instructions/#hlsnav-recording](https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/communications/teaching-remotely-with-zoom-faq-and-instructions/#hlsnav-recording) 

Here 's Havard Law School's guidline for teachers that might record a Zoom session including webcams.

&amp;#x200B;

""If I record my class, how can I take steps to safeguard my students‚Äô privacy? 

First and foremost, let your students know that the class is going to be recorded and explain why you are recording the class and how the recordings may be used.  Also tell them their options. If they do not want to be identifiable in the recording, let them know they can turn off their webcam and they can discuss with you possibly changing their display name. If they do that, then they should tell you what their display name is and you should remember to use it when referring to them during the recording.  Another way of thinking about the display name is similar to how students use name placards in class.  In addition, explicitly state to your teaching assistants and students that they are not to share the recording links or copies of recordings with anyone outside of the class."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Now ask yourself, does your professor have the legal knowledge of Harvard's Law School Department, or are they giving you a hard time because they don't have the training and understanding of the tools provided to them, and might be abusing their authority over you?",1585169993,1,0

I don't want to go part-time for Fall 2020 because I'm still not even 100% sure about transferring to main. My question is, is there any possible way to actually transfer to main even if you exceed the credit window? Do my credits for Fall 2020 count towards the credit window as well considering it's the same academic year?? Because if not then I'd be within the limit.

I have the option of taking Math 250 or 251 and was wondering if I could have some advice on which one to take and why.

I am honestly not okay,"Sorry if this isn't the right place to post, but I didn't know where else to put this.

Honestly this corona situation is destroying me. I can't adapt to these online classes. I just failed my last final and had to late drop a class for the first time. A lot of the grades for my other classes are dropping as well. I never imagined having to do this and I feel like I've basically thrown away any chance of getting into a good grad school or any grad school period. I'm getting so depressed over this and am just digging myself a bigger hole by putting off work and grovelling pathetically. It's so humiliating that I can't even face my profs/instructors. There's also a lot of arguing going around in my household and I just can't find some peace.

I think I'm getting robbed and idk if I'm okay with I? +$6000 for 4 credits???,"Okay actually, I feel trapped and I don't think I have many options besides spend the money. 

I'm currently a sophomore and I need to take MATH 251 as a prerequisite to some classes I'm gonna take in the fall. I decided I'll take a virtual one through UP over the summer. The thing is, it's a 4 credit course and I'm out of state. That +$6000 for a single online course. I feel like I'm crazy to even consider taking it, but I have to take it now if I want to stay on track. I don't know if I have any other options. 

Yeah, yeah, it's my fault for choosing to go out of state, but there was no university in state for me that had the major I wanted, so please don't be too harsh on me about that. Although I am grateful for the experiences and friends I made, at this point I strongly regret not going to a satellite campus or community college for my first two years. 

It's so ironic that Penn State seems all about diversity, but when it comes down to it, you have to be privileged to be an average student and attend here without stressing financially. Sure there are scholarships and I'll look into them, but the fact that I don't think I can do it without some form of financial assistance should be a problem.

The reality is, I don't feel like its worth more than even $3000 for me to do the course. If any of you have taken or heard of an online substitute for MATH 251 I can take through a community college, please, please let me know. Thank you.",1586292507,1,0

1-As an international student I‚Äôll be paying full tuition so I would have preferred a private medium-sized university in say Boston or DC. 
2-I only know of 1 person from my school who went there and heard he had a miserable life (he‚Äôs not a outgoing person ) so I wouldn‚Äôt really take his word . 3-I would have liked a cosmopolitan school with a large selection of students from around the world . 
Greatly appreciate if anyone can help me out with these questions : 
Is it easy to make friends at such a large school?
Do students get the right amount of support from teachers and advisors ? 
How big are class sizes usually ? 
How are the dorms like ?

some questions from a prospective PhD student!,"hi all!
I‚Äôm still waiting to hear back from some other schools and about funding, but PSU is my top choice so here goes!


1. Housing options/housing search
I‚Äôm looking for a studio or a 1 bedroom. I guess closer to campus the better? But I don‚Äôt mind walking ~20 minutes or taking public transport. What are some of the popular options for housing? Which apartments/areas are recommended? Which should be avoided?

2. Where to adopt a cat
As a PhD student, I know I‚Äôll be spending a lot of time alone at home. I‚Äôll be moving from a different state, so I won‚Äôt have my close friends with me and I feel like I‚Äôll be lonely &amp; a pet could really help. I would like to adopt a cat (or even a hedgehog or ferret! A guinea pig! Any fuzzy pet really except a dog as I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to take it on walks as frequently as it deserves) I know there‚Äôs a big adoption agency nearby, but they only allow citizens/perm residents to adopt &amp; im an international student so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll qualify. Any suggestions?

3. Performing Arts Groups
Music is a big part of my life, and I‚Äôve been in so many different types of PA groups, from orchestras, bands, choruses, musicals, etc. I‚Äôd like to continue singing especially (a cappella). I have been classically trained, but have been singing in a cappella group(s) for the last 8+ years and have perfect pitch. I was wondering if there are any on campus or off campus groups that I could join?

Annual THON Blood Drives: Help Raise Money for THON!,"The American Red Cross is hosting its annual THON Blood Drives!

The American Red Cross partners with THON each year to raise money and awareness for pediatric cancer. So, The American Red Cross will give a $2.00 donation to Four Diamonds for all presenting donors at each blood drive, and this money can be credited to the THON organization of their choice.

They will donate the $2.00 whether you donate, or are deferred. As long as you try to donate, they will send a donation! Many people are concerned about iron levels, but it won't matter, $2.00 will still be donated just for you trying!

**We are also experiencing a blood shortage, so we NEED donors!**

Walk-Ins are accepted! But you can also make an appointment by downloaded the app, or by following this link: [https://www.redcrossblood.org/give.html/drive-results?order=DATE&amp;range=10&amp;zipSponsor=16802](https://www.redcrossblood.org/give.html/drive-results?order=DATE&amp;range=10&amp;zipSponsor=16802)

Grade Adjunction and Mediation Question,"Hey all, newish Penn State student looking for advice if anyone has gone through this before. After the fall 2019 semester, I had a few issues with my grades and I'm wondering if anyone else was able to successfully mediate these.

1. I ended the semester with an 88.89% and looked to have it rounded to a 90% so my grade would go from a B+ to an A-. Has anyone successfully litigated this and if so how? So far I reached out to the professor and escalated through an academic concern request, but no luck.
2. I missed the start date for the semester and submitted a week's worth of assignments late which resulted in zeros across the board. The professor has been no help, but beyond these lates everything else was on time and without these zeros my grade in the class would be an A+.

My friends and I made a minecraft server for students in quarantine!,"Hey guys!

We have started a Minecraft server just for university students! Since quarantine is looking like it may be going for a while, we made a new Minecraft server and Discord community to help us get through it with a little more sanity. Minecraft University is a Spigot Minecraft server dedicated to giving the community the closest Vanilla-feel as possible. Our server runs on **1.15.2** and whitelist is **enabled.**

If you want to join us, go to our [website](https://minecraftuniversity.net/) and get verified. You can also join straight in to our Discord server at [https://discord.gg/TcMzT7P](https://discord.gg/TcMzT7P)

Because we are exclusive to university students, we do verify that each player is a university student. All you need is your .edu email and your usernames for Discord and Minecraft, then just go to the get verified page on our website. If you have any questions, feel free to send us a DM.

We look forward to playing with y‚Äôall!",1588462361,1,0

"Hesitant to sign an off-campus housing renewal lease for fall, anyone else?","BTW; I'm at the Harrisburg campus, not UP. The other reddit is dead. Anyone else in the same boat?

move-out from all campus residences so that it will take place over the

leases and as tenants they are allowed to be at their properties whenever
they want‚Äîhowever, both PSU and the borough are trying to work with
landlords to coordinate efforts to the extent possible.

the official end of the term and virtual graduation), looking to see that
people are complying with the stay-at-home order. Again, if you see parties
that you think do not follow stay-at-home order guidelines (until May 8:

I would like to study Industrial Engineering (IE)
I am an outgoing person who mainly focusses on academics. I would like to have a balanced University Life, but would definetely want to find a job right after graduation.

Penn State: 
Pros: close to northeast/ midatlantic region (great job opportunities), located in a better surrounding place, great campus, around %67 4 year graduation rate, closer to me (I'm an international student), great alumni network around the east side, many fairs for engineering, easier to form/join clubs, better dorms,

Cons: a bit more expensive, 2 year of general engineering as opposed to 1 year general engineering at Purdue (1 year loss for internship), ranked 8# in IE, ranked worse in engineering, gives credits but not much for my ib lessons, 

===== equal salaries after graduation =======
Purdue:
Pros: little bit cheaper, 1 year of general engineering as opposed to 2 year general engineering at Penn State, ranked 3# in IE, ranked better in engineering, more credits per my ib lessons, great recruitment 

Cons:located midwest (not somewhere where I would like to spend the rest of my life with), slightly worse campus, sub %50 4 year graduation (yikes), far to my home country (turkey)

Open Letter to the Class of 2020,"Dear 2020,

I sit here at 4:46 am pondering my life and wishing for some closure, that I don‚Äôt think any of us will ever receive. There were so many experiences and goodbyes that were supposed to happen before graduation that won‚Äôt happen. We‚Äôve all worked our god damn asses off to make it this far, and many won‚Äôt be commemorated for it. My heart yearns for everyone feeling the same way I do right now.  Some may have jobs lined up, grad school plans, or have no clue what tomorrow is even going to look like.  We‚Äôve been tossed into this abysmal plain of life that carries so much uncertainty and it sure as is hell scary. 

College may have meant something different to everyone, but I believe that most would agree it‚Äôs supposed to be the best years of our lives. Honestly, who the fuck wants to work for the next 40 years? These last few months were supposed to be a time of closure and reflectance. A time that we could use to close this chapter of our lives and begin preparing for the next ... and it‚Äôs gone, in an instant just like that. 

I can‚Äôt stop constantly thinking of all the relationships and memories that I‚Äôve curated over the past 4 years. There‚Äôs something magical about State College and Dear Old State when your with the people you care most about. Hell, even just walking through campus and being in awe of where I actually was. I‚Äôll forever appreciate the memories, friendships, and life lessons that I‚Äôve received from my time at Penn State. This feeling is like none other that I‚Äôve ever experienced. This feeling of qualm that comes with this abrupt end to our college careers, hurts in a way like none other. 

Memories of game days, going to the bars, and daylonging with friends when you should be doing homework will always be carried and treasured. Our daily interactions with co-workers, and classmates will never be there again. Seeing that weird kid in class or the person you might use as an example of what you should be doing, will never happen again. All of these things that I took for granted, are all gone in an instant. 

My heart yearns for the Class of 2020. Life is so fragile and precious. Appreciate everyday you wake up and can say that everyone is happy &amp; healthy. Appreciate what you had and not what you don‚Äôt have sitting in front of you. It‚Äôs better to have experience it and had it taken away, than to never experience it again. 

And with that, I‚Äôll sit in hollowed house in State College. Wishing my friends and roommates were still here to share some more memories with. Carry on Dear Old State and make sure you drink a fucking beer for the class of 2020.

Question about the learning factory/ 3D printing?,"Hey all, just had some questions. I'm getting into 3d printing, and I want to use the learning factory for tools to use, like a wood burning pen if they have one, sanding tools, paints, etc etc. I've heard you're not allowed to use the 3d printer there since its only for funded/ class projects, but I'm curious as to if I'm allowed to use the other tools for personal projects, or if anything is free game as long as you go through the training for the tools needed. 

One more thing, for any 3D printer I'm allowed to use, I know I get 250g of filament to use to start, but after that do I need to pay for more or can I buy my own and use it? Thanks",1582127330,1,0
Smeal or world campus for Penn State?,"Smeal has Masters of Accounting, but World campus has Master of Professional Accounting.

Question About Joining A Fraternity,"Hey everyone, I just had a quick question about the greek life. So basically, I got into the 2+2 program where I would do my first 2 years at Altoona and the last 2 at University Park. There was a frat I was interested in joining during my sophomore year but the chapter is at University Park, not Altoona. My question is: Can I join the University park frat as a sophomore at Altoona? If not, would it be too late to join this frat once I become a junior at university park and would I miss out/would it be harder to join because I couldn't join during my sophomore year? If anyone could let me know, I would really appreciate it. I'm considering committing to Penn State and I've had my eye on this particular frat because some of my cousins/other relatives had joined at their chapters at other universities and told me that it really enhanced their college experiences.

Deciding between Internships and negotiating offers,"Background info: I'm currently a freshman studying EE and I recently got an offer from Leidos for an Electrical CAD internship (notified by email; no official letter).

From the information that I have gathered, the position at Leidos is more of an office job while the other position involves a bit of traveling as most of the work will be done at the job sites.

I have looked at reviews online for Leidos and they seem to vary quite a bit. Can anyone comment on what it was like to intern at Leidos (atmosphere, pay, benefits, workload, etc.)?

Also, how long can I take to respond to the offer from Leidos? Can I ask them to give me two weeks to decide?",1581962150,1,0

"If I received a warning for an academic integrity violation, are my current and future professors notified when I enroll in their course?","Posting this on my throwaway because, ya know. So last year during fall semester finals, I was accused of cheating on a final exam **that I did not cheat on.** Essentially, the person next to me literally copied my entire god damn test and of course the professor noticed our answers being absurdly similar. I could write a r/nosleep story on the two month process of proving my innocence to both my professor and the board of academic integrity, but I'm fairly sure they believed me due to ridiculing the professor's idea to not scramble a multiple choice test being taken in Thomas 100 (anyone could see another student's test in their peripheral vision considering the desks are 6 inches apart). Thankfully they took my word and I did not receive any punishment (I was scared shitless thinking of worst case scenarios), but I was wondering if my current/future professors can see that I have received a warning? I really hope not considering I would like to maintain a good reputation with my professors and I don't want them to think I am a shitty or entitled student who got away with cheating.",1581883372,1,0

Leave of Absence affected Entrance-to-Major year,"Run down is I entered college at one of the branch Penn State campuses in 2015, so I have been going to school for close to 5 years now. I planned on staying at the branch campus and just finishing my degree, but felt this might be my only chance to actually experience Penn State for how it should be and so I applied to University Park. 

My application was rejected and I was about 50% surprised I got denied since I meet the Fall 2015 entrance-to-major requirements, but wasn't surprised there was something that resulted in me getting rejected for my change of major/campus as something always happens. I reached out to the IST Director of Academic Advising and she stated since I took a Leave-of-Absence in Spring 2018 that my entrance-to-major year now changed from Fall 2015 to Spring 2018 which has a credit window and as such I am over by a few credits.

I am writing this to warn anyone that is doing the normal 2+2 program and for whatever reason has to take a Leave-of-Absence that this could possibly affect you. Resulting in your entrance-to-major requirements year to be the year you take that Leave-of-Absence which could prevent being able to transfer into University Park.",1581754650,1,0

I'm still tossing PSU up... any advice on this situation?,"Tl;dr- My main question is how is the PSU environmental science program? I am having a really tough time deciding between PSU and the University of Maine for this major.

I was accepted to PSU, and narrowed it down to one of my two top choices for colleges. However, I am conflicted with whether or not I am going to attend PSU or the University of Maine to major in environmental science. I was wondering if anyone on this sub would be able to help me weigh out the factors for my decision. (Weighing factors and major parts of my decision are at the bottom)

Can anyone advise me on based on how the PSU environmental science major is? I really haven't heard a ton about it, especially in comparison to how much Umaine has been informing me about it.

I do realize that it's not up to anyone else to make my decision, nor that it's possible for anyone else to be able to know the context of my decision/factors, but any advice would be greatly appreciated, as it is so late in the decision making process.

Weighing factors:
-PSU holds a lot more weight/can make me more connections
-Umaine is giving me more money/financial aid than PSU (by a relatively considerable amount) 
-Umaine is in the woods, which is favorable for an environmental major
-Umaine is smaller (I can handle a larger school, but prefer the size of Umaine over PSU)",1589742527,1,0

Advice on transferring,"Hi everyone, 

I apologize if this isn‚Äôt the right place to post, but I had a really tough freshman year socially and with my mental health at PSU. I really did try to love PSU but I guess I didn‚Äôt connect with it as much as I thought I would. I joined a Thon committee, some cultural clubs, and clubs for my major- and was pretty active with them but I always felt out of place with the people I met and the school, even though PSU is an amazing school. 

I applied to transfer to another college, and got in, but I‚Äôm still hesitant because of the hassles of transferring and I have to change my major completely (Bc I didn‚Äôt get into engineering at the transfer school and can‚Äôt change it). I‚Äôm also really unsure and may want to give PSU another chance. 

I wanted to reach out and ask if anyone else had similar experiences, but were able to bounce back/have better experiences after freshman year? Or if anyone had advice in general about this situation, I would appreciate it. 

Thanks! :)",1589691531,1,0

A few comments about SGL 176,"I want to comment on two posts that were recently put up regarding SGL 176, otherwise known as Scotia.  

You can mountain bike and hike throughout the year except on the designated hunting seasons in spring and winter. However, mountain bikers are restricted to only biking on approved trails which are labeled with green signs.  These are also the same signs horseback riders must obey.

A commenter recently implied, incorrectly, that one can mountain bike in SGL 176 wherever they want as long as its not during one of the two restricted seasons of winter and spring.  The commenter also implied that you can clear existing trails.  To my knowledge, this is not the case.  If a tree falls down on an approved, green signed, trail, you do not have authority to cut and remove this tree from the path.  This is different than clearing new trails, as was recently illegally done behind the shooting range.

Furthermore, one commenter was partially correct; a judge threw out cases brought before the court regarding mountain biking in SGL 176. Harrisburg PGC warden's procured mountain bikes and patrolled the woods during the non-restricted season in search of mountain bikers on non-sanctioned trails. The warden's would set up on non-sanctioned trails pretending to have bike troubles.  Mountain bikers would stop to help and then the warden's would fine them.  The fines were taken to court and the a judge thru them out.

Recently, there was a case of trail clearing of fallen trees on private land near SGL 176.  Several hunters heard about the clearing and complained to PGC but upon further investigation, PGC discovered the work was done on private land only and it turns out the hunters were hunting on private land.  This upset the land owner greatly who discovered that many hunters have been hunting on his land for decades thinking it was SGL 176. 

In short,

&amp;#x200B;

1. PGC can fine you for hiking and biking in the woods during the designated hunting seasons.
2. Outside of these 2 hunting seasons, you can bike wherever you like. You are only supposed to mountain bike on green trails, but a judge thru that out.
3. Many are under the impression you can remove downed trees from existing trails, you cannot do this. The only thin you can take from the woods is game and litter.
4. Be sure when you hunt, you are hunting on SGL 176 and not private land.",1589294203,1,0

During our Saturday ride, we saw signs for the shooting range so this morning we decided to try them out.

At the shooting range, we ran into several people and asked them about biking in the area and none of them had a problem with it and many of them also mountain bike in Scotia.  After a while, we went up to the administration house and ran into a very friendly Warden.  He said as long as you stay on trails which are already blazed, do not make any new trails, and stay out of the woods during deer season and spring turkey season, they have no problem with bikes back there.  We saw a lot of litter and a downed tree around ""the ruins"" as he called it and we asked if we could pick up the litter there and clear the downed tree.  He also said he had no problem with this.",1589221066,1,0

National Merit Scholarships,"Does anyone here have experience with National Merit scholarships, specifically the PSU-sponsored ones? (not the one directly from NMSC or the corporate-sponsored ones)

&gt;Full-time students who list Penn State as a first-choice school on the National Merit application by February are considered. Award amounts vary with a maximum amount of $2,000 per year with up to four years of eligibility. 

(I did list PSU as my first choice on the NM app before February, and I paid my enrollment deposit about a week ago)

So my questions are:

1. Does PSU grant a NM scholarship to all finalists who fill out the form appropriately (and who don't get another type of NMSC award)?
2. If not, then how many NM scholarships does PSU award? I just want to know what my chances of getting one would be.
3. If I were to receive one, when would I be notified?",1584406568,1,0

Lastly, I saw the option for a Business minor in the liberal arts dept. and wanted to know if that was useful for anything either, as if I could minor in business while majoring in Econ that would be great but Only as long as it‚Äôs worth it and relatively reknown.

Summer Research Opportunity - Summer Translational Cardiovascular Science Institute (STCSI),"**Who is this program open to?**

This program, sponsored by the American Heart Association, is available to undergraduate students with a demonstrated interest in cardiovascular science who have completed more than 60 credits and have a grade point average of 3.25 or greater.

Priority selection will be given to students who have contacted a potential mentor from faculty members participating in the STCSI, but who have not yet started research projects, and to students with long-term (more than two years) commitments to their mentors‚Äô laboratories. Penn State students are required two additional semesters in the lab after the completion of the STCSI summer program. For non-Penn State students, the student can work with a mentor at their home institution but the training plan and outside activities must, in spirit, be similar to those at Penn State. Priority is also given to students who demonstrate a strong interest in cardiovascular science and those that have been accepted as trainees in participating faculty research labs.

**When does this program run?**

This research will be conducted during summer 2020 (10 weeks from May 26 to August 7) under the direction of one or more faculty members.

**Will a stipend be provided?** 

Yes. A stipend of $4,000 will be provided for each student.

**What is required to apply?**

1. 1-page research description/proposal

2. Official transcript

3. 2 Letters of recommendation

The Discord server and a discussion on academics and value,"So today some unfortunate events went down in the r/pennstateuniversity discord that led to an unfair ban by one of the mods. The mod in question is Michael Cao (mikex#9999 on discord). Before I get into the actual details of the events and the resulting ban, I need to share some background information. 

I am currently a CYAOP student in my junior year with a 2.18 GPA. Ever since grade school, I have struggled in school. It is a miracle that I even made it into college. After struggling a lot in academics (and still continuing to do so), I realized the current standardized academics do not help everyone, only the one‚Äôs deemed ‚Äúgifted‚Äù or ‚Äúsmart‚Äù. Ridicule and vitriol is projected at those who can‚Äôt meet the arbitrary academic standards. Being one of the people who is on the receiving end of this, I‚Äôve taken a stand against the current academic system and fight for those that society deems ‚Äúdumb‚Äù. So how is this all relevant?

Today, in Discord, I was talking about my viewpoints towards the current academic situation and how it determines a student‚Äôs value simply by a three digit number and some letter grades. Michael and some other members decided my opinions were stupid and dumb, and ridiculed me for that. Instead of having a civil discussion about it, Michael decided to slap an unfair ban onto me, just because I didn‚Äôt happen to echo his opinions on academics.

And while we‚Äôre talking about academics, let‚Äôs talk about the toxic academic mentality that is buried deep within Asian culture (as well as other cultures, but to a lesser extent) and how it negatively affects mental health and well-being. This mentality where your grades and GPA defines your worth in this world is what drives many students to depression, and unfortunately, suicide. The only solution to this is to remove ourselves from this mentality, whether you‚Äôre Asian or not Asian. Everyone has value, and your academic performance does not affect that. A 4.0 GPA student has the same value as a 2.0 GPA student.",1582353900,1,0

Bouldering at PSU and in Central/South Central PA?,"Hi folks. Considering heading to PSU for my grad program.

Anyone know of outdoor bouldering within a reasonable drive from campus? Thanks!",1582316625,1,0

Decision without visiting,"With the corona virus shutdowns happening, I cannot visit the campus. I have been accepted to PennState main campus. Can anyone tell me what the physics and math programs are like? Is administration easy to reach when needed? What is campus life really like? Some of the other schools I have been accepted at have issues with administration or a relatively boring campus and surrounding area. I‚Äôve heard some great things about PennState, but I was hoping I could hear from some people with first hand experience rather than just rumors.",1584592163,1,0

To the graduating class of Spring 2020,"Hey all, PSU employee and townie here... I would just like to say my heart is absolutely broken for all of you. This is the strangest thing I‚Äôve ever lived through and I just want you to know that everything you‚Äôre feeling; sadness, anxiety, anger, frustration, whatever, is 100% normal and valid. I cannot imagine leaving one day and saying to my friends/roommates ‚Äúsee ya in a week‚Äù not knowing it was potentially our last time being together on campus. 

I hope they get commencement rescheduled, but they‚Äôre probably waiting to see when this slows down to even throw anything out there. Hang in there. Reach out to a friend to talk if you need it or think they might. This is really hard on everyone right now. 

Remember, you could have access to student care and advocacy resources: https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/studentcare. And if you‚Äôre able to give, please do that as well. 

And remember this now more than ever, WE ARE",1584568878,2,0

Just a reminder that ILLIAD is amazing,"Being the scatterbrained undergrad I am, I forgot to bring two important textbooks home with me when campus was closed. It wasn‚Äôt worth driving back 13 hours to pick them up and I was seriously considering buying them again until an alum on discord told me about inter library loaning services. Thankfully psu illiad had my back and the chapters that I requested were electronically delivered within 2 days. Take advantage of the resources psu offers before pulling out the plastic people.",1584566458,1,0
August Graduation,"I heard an idea and was wondering what others thought. Since there is already a graduation in August, at a minimum should we give this springs graduates the option to ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù in August since it is widely believed things will be under control by then? That way they still have the option of experiencing commencement...

I really don‚Äôt see why this would not work unless this graduation was also cancelled. But I do not see the harm in letting these grads just piggie back on another ceremony if they earned it and want to take part.

EDIT: I think this idea makes particular sense since many schools that have rescheduled their ceremonies, rescheduled for August and we conveniently already have a ceremony at this time",1584566277,1,0
