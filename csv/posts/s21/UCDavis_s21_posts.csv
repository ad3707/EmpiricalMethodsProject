I ask because I don't really *need* to take 9D over the summer, it would just be nice to have more space later on, so I feel like the prof might end up being a deciding factor.

"UCD, UCB, or UCLA???

I also got into UCLA which has made choosing a university very hard for me now. I plan to take psychology and from what I hear, both UCD and UCB have good psychology programs. 

But I'm still conflicted. I want an academically challenging school life but not too much that I can't have a little fun. I do have depression so that is why I am wary of UCB. But I feel turning down UCB would be a mistake because of the many connections and opportunities it brings.

Undergraduate Research Position Available,"Hi there, 

We are a lab here at UC Davis located in Tupper Hall. Our research focuses upon the molecular mechanisms of retinal degeneration. As such, we do extensive work with knockout mice. We‚Äôre currently looking for students that would be interested in assisting our mouse husbandry and genotyping work. The tasks involved would include mouse care (weaning litters, tagging mice, setting up breeding cages, etc.) and PCR. 

Ideally, we would like to find 2 students to help split the workload. So if you‚Äôre uncomfortable with working with mice, but are interested in learning PCR and other wet bench techniques, still feel free to apply. Of course, students that are able to handle the workload well will be offered participation  on active projects at the discretion of our PI and lab manager.

We would prefer students that would be able to attend over the summer, but this can be discussed. In terms of expectations, our lab doesn‚Äôt set any strict time requirements so long as work is completed and are flexible with scheduling around your classes.  However, a realistic expectation in terms of how long work takes to finish is 10-20 hours a week depending on how busy it is.

If you‚Äôre interested please send me a pm and I can schedule an interview with you.

Thanks.",1615959423,1,0

GAME THREAD: #23 UC Davis Football at #2 Weber State (Noon),"Game 2 is finally here! UC Davis takes on the reining conference champs Weber State, AKA Utah's most underrated football team. Weber has known to have suffocating defense in the past, but the Aggie O looked positively on fire last week in a win vs Idaho, and Weber's first and only game involved them allowing an uncharacteristic 21 points.

The Aggies will look to continue playing decent defense -- doesn't have to be great -- while finding ways to move the ball against a stout Wildcat squad. Watch to see how junior QB Hunter Rodrigues manages the offense against a team looking to capitalize on his inexperience as a starter. Meanwhile, the Aggie defensive backs led by returnee Devon King will try to shut down Weber's passing game and limit their ability to catch up with the vaunted high-octane Aggie O.

Prediction: UC Davis 28, Weber State 24

Do any other Fall '20 junior transfers feel like 2 years here isn't enough? Especially with the pandemic and how in-person might open next year?,"I came in with the mindset of: ""I need to plug and chug as many credits as possible to get out in 2 years"", (to avoid debt, my parents are helping me out) and that is beginning to reflect poorly on my winter quarter grades and mental health. The turning point for me was when I missed the deadline for a professional organization that I was really interested in joining. I panicked because I realized I would not have another opportunity like this to network in college, or at least fully reap the benefits of UCD if I graduate next year. I mean, it literally feels like we just got here...and now in person classes/activities are potentially opening up in Fall '21. I tried mentally planning out and squeezing in everything I'd want to do next year, and it feels damn near impossible. I really want to go to graduate school, and my grades are decent but I really need more time to build work experience/professional references for my intended field.

Shincheonji activity at UC Davis,"There is a cult at UC Davis and at other colleges and universities within the Sacramento, Vacaville, and Davis area and nearby regions like the San Francisco Bay Area that claims to be Christian, known as Shincheonji (SCJ). Shincheonji has been and is still active at UC Davis, as well as at other colleges and universities within the Sacramento, Vacaville, and Davis area and nearby regions like the San Francisco Bay Area. Shincheonji recruiters will not initially reveal the name of their campus ministry or group until people have progressed in the the Bible studies with SCJ. SCJ recruiters will also not tell anyone that they're part of SCJ until one has completed all the lessons with SCJ. There are several ways to identify SCJ-affiliated groups:

\- The Bible studies begin with introductory lessons, followed by small class lessons (lasts about 6 to 9 months), followed by large class lessons (lasts about 1 year)

\- The Bible lessons mention about ""history, moral teaching/instruction, prophecy, fulfillment""

\- The Bible lessons are heavy on parables and on the knowledge and understanding of parables, and teach that one must know and understand the parables to receive salvation

\- There are Bible lessons about ""the Language of Heaven"", meaning parables

\- Bible lessons are in classroom format, with teachers and students. The teachers will occasionally use whiteboards or pieces of paper to write notes and draw pictures of what they're teaching. The Bible lessons will generally be in one direction only (teacher to student)

\- Notes are to be taken, but only through handwriting. Taking pictures of what's on the whiteboard or the piece of paper is forbidden. One also can only use a physical copy of the Bible

\- ""Hand clapping for God"" at the end of each Bible lesson is a custom everyone must do at the end of the closing prayer

\- Bible lessons talk heavily and frequently about spiritual harvests, spiritual food, fields, birds, vines, among other things

\- In later Bible lessons, there will be more weird unbiblical teachings, such as teachings about the ""Promised Pastor"" and about the ""New John."" These two terms refer to the leader and founder of Shincheonji, Manhee Lee. Additionally, they will also teach later on when one goes further in the Bible studies that lying is okay under circumstances and take various Bible verses out of context to justify lying, despite the fact that the Bible clearly teaches that lying is a sin (I never got to this point when I studied the Bible with Shincheonji members, but this is based on my research on Shincheonji and its affiliated groups after I left NorCal Missions, which is the current name for one of SCJ's groups in the Bay Area and nearby regions and which is the group I studied with for 6 months before leaving it)

\- The Bible study group teaches that one cannot be sure of their faith or that they were truly saved until they do everything Jesus tells people to do in Scripture, according to what the Bible study group teaches, in addition to knowing and understanding all the parables

\- Teachers and leaders don't let any student learn most Bible lessons individually nor do they explain certain lessons to students individually because they say the lessons can only be taught in the small class or the large class

\- Discussions and questions about the Bible or any theological concept are generally discouraged or even forbidden unless if the student agrees with what the teacher tells them. Otherwise, the teachers may accuse students of stirring up doubt or of wanting to argue or debate with them, or they might stop talking to those students

\- Members of the Bible study group will claim that it goes over the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, but in reality they only go over snippets of verses and passages of Scripture, based on the lessons

\- At the end of each level (beginner, intermediate, and advanced), there is a test to be taken by the students

\- Recruiters, teachers, and leaders claim that a cult is merely where there is no truth in it, nor is God present in it, without realizing a cult is not just that, but also where there are some extreme or bizarre beliefs and teachings, manipulation and other types of abuse especially from teachers and leaders, and several other characteristics of cults like being secretive, unquestioned obedience to the leaders, cutting off contact with ex-members and non-members and even discouraging or forbidding genuine friendships within the cult. These characteristics are all present in Shincheonji

\- There are a variety of events held by the group or  campus ministry itself, such as seminars where only the main speaker speaks and everyone else listens

Additionally, SCJ-affiliated groups will occasionally change their names to avoid being exposed as being affiliated with SCJ or once those groups have been exposed as being affiliated with SCJ. Shincheonji in the Sacramento, Vacaville, and Davis area and nearby regions have a church or mission center called the San Francisco Zion Church. Within the Sacramento, Vacaville, and Davis area and nearby regions such as the San Francisco Bay Area, SCJ groups are currently known as NorCal Missions and True Vine SF, and SCJ also runs a website called Bible Study For All. Other names that various SCJ-affiliated groups went by in the Sacramento, Vacaville, and Davis area and nearby regions like the SF Bay Area include Ignite Ministry, True Vine Ministries, Religare, Global Light, Revive Sacramento, Zion Missionary, and Christians of NorCal. One other group in the Bay Area that I found out online that I suspect was another SCJ group is Revival SJSU.

Shincheonji is currently recruiting UC Davis students, alumni, faculty, and staff through Instagram and other social media platforms due to the COVID pandemic and restrictions and all other activities are online due to the pandemic and restrictions. They especially target Christians, and have been trying to recruit people from Intervarsity, Cru, the Newman Center, Bridges International, and other campus ministries. In addition, Shincheonji is also recruiting people who are neither students, alumni, faculty, nor staff of UC Davis within the Sacramento, Vacaville, and Davis area and nearby areas, in person and online.

If you are studying the Bible with an SCJ-affiliated group like NorCal Missions, quickly leave that group and encourage anyone in an SCJ-affiliated group, including those you know to leave that group. Shincheonji-affiliated groups such as NorCal Missions are not healthy Bible study groups for anyone, whether or not they're Christian, and they will not help Christians grow in their faith in God.",1614893256,48,1

PTD Question!,"Hi everyone, I recently met with an advisor from the letters and science Dean's office and talked to her about receiving a PTD for one of my classes this quarter, and she explained the process to me and basically said that because of my circumstances it would likely be approved as long as I had documentation. I did not have the PTD form filled out back then, but now that I do, I have a few questions going forward.   


Do I simply submit the form and wait to see if it is approved? Or do I need to make another appointment with her in order to go over the form after I submit it? If anyone has any experience with getting a PTD, how long does the process normally take? Thank you so much in advance!!",1614730517,1,0
Questions about a campus ministry that's affiliated with the International Christian Church (ICC),"Hi there! Have any of you at UC Davis encountered a campus ministry that is heavy on discipleship and has told students that they can't become Christians until they disciple people, give up things, follow and obey everything that Jesus said in the Bible, and get baptized into their church, and that they can't be saved unless they do these things and do other works? Have any of you been approached by members of that campus ministry if there is such a ministry at UC Davis, and if so, do you know its name?

Such a campus ministry is likely affiliated with the International Christian Church (ICC), a cult which split away from the International Church of Christ (ICOC). The ICC has a branch in the Sacramento area known as the Sacramento City ICC, and they have other branches like the San Francisco Bay ICC, the San Diego ICC, and the City of Angels ICC within California. In addition, they have campus ministries named Disciples Reaching and Evangelizing All Mankind (DREAM) at several universities such as UC Berkeley, San Francisco State University, Sacramento State University, and San Jose State University, among other campus ministries at other universities across the United States. Many students at other universities have noted aggressive recruitment tactics of ICC-affiliated groups like DREAM.",1614728445,1,0

[Academic] Luxury Fashion Survey ( People who have purchased luxury fashion items),"Hi Guys!

My name is Matt and I'm a senior university student studying Fashion Merchandising. I'm new to this subreddit and am conducting a survey for my senior thesis. I would love your to hear your responses on how brand loyalty¬†habits towards luxury fashion brands during the global pandemic has affected intent to purchase. We conducted a descriptive research design between some of the top designer brands regarding the some following factors:

1. Product Quality
2. Scarcity
3. Social Media Engagement
4. Economic Consciousness
5. Brand Loyalty
6. Intent to Purchase

First-year student: Should I quit my internship?,"I'm a first-year, and I know it can be hard to find internships, especially with only a little (relevant) background. That said, I recently got hired on the spot as a Social Media Intern (unpaid) for a small ""startup."" The owner is the one who manages everything-- I'm literally the only other person working with him in creating digital content. There's literally just the two of us in his business. This position appealed to me because I wanted to see how the business would develop and learn about managing a business and whatnot. However, it just feels so unstructured and I feel like I'm just reusing my skills from past projects. I'm also not feeling the overall vibe of the owner ~~and KINDA regret saying ""yes"" because I sort of have this inability to say no to work bc I feel like I'm not utilizing the opportunity~~. 

Now I just got accepted into another Marketing Internship (also unpaid) position for a different company. The latter feels more welcoming and structured with the opportunity to work with other female entrepreneurs. I also have five other scheduled interviews for other internships/volunteer positions coming up that are remote or around the Davis area and I just feel overwhelmed. &gt;.&lt;

Laptop recommendations?,"Hi, I'm going to major in linguistics but I may switch to international relations. Both majors will be language/reading-heavy but that's about it. Will mainly use a laptop for homework, research, checking email, applying for stuff, zoom meetings, and occasionally binge watching anime on \*cough\* perfectly legal sites. 

I'm getting the 64GB ipad air and the apple pencil which will be my main devices for note-taking and possibly textbook reading and video editing. I'm wondering if that will be enough to replace a laptop but there are a lot of files that I would prefer to store on a laptop as well. 

Looking to spend $600-800, preferably lower if possible but I don't want to compromise on features I need. I'd like a solid battery and processor (should be quite good, as a college student I will be using it very heavily but I don't need a beefy processor for gaming). Display should be good too, but idc as long as it looks decent and I can see it outside. Not really picky about ten thousand different colors. Would prefer to get Windows bc idk how to use a Mac lol. Also it doesn't have to be super lightweight but I should be able to carry it around in my backpack all day without problems. 

Also, are chromebooks really a bad idea? The site didn't recommend them exactly but the main thing is it comes with the Google features and is a bit limited on some programs. They can be cheaper though sometimes.

Sublease Single Room at Pinon Apartments,"Single private room available in a 3 bed 1.5 bath apartment at Pinon. You would be sharing the apartment with 3 other guys, although one person is moving out soon as well. 

The room is 13.5 feet x 9 feet, and it has additional space for a small walk in closet with a full length mirror. The room itself will not be furnished. The bathroom, kitchen, and other living spaces are shared. The entire complex has a shared laundry room and you pay for laundry with an app. Its in a great location, being a 5 minute walk away from University Mall and being really close to campus.

Room available from May 17 to August 31. Rent for May would already be paid; only June-August would need to be taken care of. Rent is $730 a month which includes wifi and water, but does not include electricity costs. Parking is included; however Pinon is a gated community so there is a $20 deposit for one of the gate remotes (which you will get back upon returning it).

Manifest: Local Networking Web Application For UC System,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRW-w\_UIjYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRW-w_UIjYk)

The best way I can explain this app is with a Spongebob metaphor. In this episode, the krusty krab is the university/college system of clubs, resource centers, etc. and the bulletin board is the Manifest app. Manifest brings a bulletin board abstraction of messaging to the abstraction of the Krusty Krab, which is actually the entire university system of clubs, resource centers, and institutional orgs (thus currently working with UCSC Resource Centers and the rest of the UC system for this pitch).

We may hope to see Manifest as the community bulletin board machine of great good, so long as it is free from unlawful censorship and has community standards that facilitate amazing and inspiring interactions.

Here is a more formal pitch for a web app I'm working on called Manifest to connect clubs on campus within UCSC (my school) and the rest of the UC system (including UC Davis):

* What is the Manifest app? Messaging for local communities.
* What is the problem it solves? Sharing information between locals quickly and efficiently.
* So what, who cares? It may help to streamline events, activities, and more in real-time within the local area. There are so many steps to joining a club, promoting events, and emailing groups‚ÄîManifest was created to unify these activities in a local platform.
* Demo link: [https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)

Here are the instructions to install the app on any smartphone home screen by going to the demo URL ([https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)):

1. Have location services enabled via Privacy &gt; Location Services (on) &gt; Safari Websites (Ask or Allow)
2. Have location services enabled via General Settings &gt; Safari &gt; Location &gt; Ask/Allow, you can add the app to your home screen via the Safari app on iPhone.
3. Once added to the home screen, it should work as a native iPhone app.
4. After location is enabled, here are similar Android instructions to add on home screen: [https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en)
5. Note: to enable location on Android, it is required that Google Chrome settings allow for the location to load, and this must be adjusted via Chrome or the default browser.

The url to access the site and add to home screen is: [https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)

The main bet behind Manifest is the idea that locals can share contextual information more quickly and efficiently than anywhere else on the web.

Not really liking this.,"Tl;DR why can't I get the full **loan** amount at once?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, so I was awarded a pretty generous financial aid package. My school will be paid for via grants, which is great.

I also noticed I was offered loans. I'm planning on only taking out the subsidized loan ($4,500) since it's basically free money (no interest intel 6 months after grad) if you invest it properly. Before you try to tell me how student loans are evil and to not take any and blah blah just please don't waste your energy typing it out. Lol. But the reason I'm posting this is:

&amp;#x200B;

I understand Davis splitting up the grants into 3 quarters, as I know it's not smart to give the average college student $15K at one time, but why are they splitting the loan up? Can I talk to the financial aid office to see if they can pay me the full amount for just the **loan**? Anyone here know before I go ask? Thanks :)

The U Apartments Lease Issue,"Hi guys, I have very bad news,

Back in december when I first moved in to the U Apartments I took over a lease for a double up which was 500 bucks without a roommate. I thought that was a really good deal because I could get the whole room to myself. This was my first time renting an apartment for myself and I wasnt aware of the whole process. After a month of living here, I received an email about a lease renewal but I didn't sign it because I thought it was a littile early. A week later, they told me that they increased the price to 600 and then the next week they increased the price to 700 which made me panic and sign the lease thinking the price would skyrocket. A couple months pass by and my roommates planned to move to another part of davis and I'm stuck with this lease. I called the management to see if I can cancel and they said there is no cancellation policy, I would have to find somone to take over the lease. I thought this was really messed up but I started finding people on facebook to take over the lease. Then the U apartments started to decrease the price to 590 for the double. So, I called them again to see if I can have someone take over the lease for that price and they said no because they would have to charge 590 instead of 700 for all the current residents if they do so. Now, I'm stuck here trying to get someone to take over a lease for 700 when they can simply go on the apartment website and get the exact same room for 590. There is almost no way I could find someone to do that. What should I do???",1621131380,1,0

path 4 is a more advanced pathway for people who are already very familiar with college level writing &amp; forming long research papers.

So I checked out the [1 page](https://registrar3.ucdavis.edu/graduation/MultiTerm.cfm) that had dates/links/info... and it looked like it was unfinished or something. Well, I thought I would ask you guys my questions because y'all have been there for me before :)

1. For graduating in Fall 2021, when should I file/register via the official application? Should I apply during the 'Summer 2021: Jun 01, 2021 - Jul 23, 2021' window?
2. When will said application open (unless it already is)? Will we be emailed reminders and such or is this purely our own responsibility to learn about?
3. Is there a difference between filing early (say end of Spring 2021 if that is possible) or later (I assume Summer 2021 or Fall 2021)?
4. Does filing to graduate cover all minors and majors?
5. Why is this so convoluted with so little instruction available on any of the university's websites?

[https://imgur.com/a/9skonf7](https://imgur.com/a/9skonf7)

And I'm like.... wth? Health at every size? That seems like a really dangerous idea for people to have in their heads if they're actually overweight. Like if you are medically obese and you have health complications - that's not health at every size. 

Even if you've only gained a few dozen pounds over the course of COVID (which appears to be pretty common based on survey responses from earlier this year), and you're not medically obese, its still a problematic heath policy.  It is probably really unhealthy for Americans to be gaining on average, 29 pounds of undesired weight and think it's okay to just hide behind the curtain of lies we tell ourselves to keep us from crying at night? MOST AMERICANS are really unhealthy and we cant just lie to ourselves about being healthy at every weight.

Like, does this not seem absolutely weak-minded and illogical? Just lie and make some of us feel better so no one gets offended?  It's like taking away actual useful data (like a scale) for these people who need help, in an effort to lie to you about being healthy?

Let me know if I have something mistakes or break any rules. I got accepted from UC Davis and I am on the waitlist of UC  Irvine.

I have really deep consideration to decide on which to go between **UC Davis and UC Irvine**. I want to make sure that I don't want to take either one college down.

I already deposited at UC Davis, but I have been still waiting for the result of UCI. Suppose I would get accepted on UCI later. I am posting this on the UC Davis page, so I want to ask about what good things are if I would keep going to UC Davis. 

Here is my info.

My major is **Biology**, but for my dream, I have been **interested in Biomimicris** for making inventions, medical devices, and meds for humans. Despite my major is Biology, I am into the **Biomedical stuff**, so **I also have considered being pre-med.**

&amp;#x200B;

I want any advice or recommendations, or ideas to help me decide to choose between two colleges.

\--&gt; If there is something you need to ask about my stuff more, then you can ask me.

Professional Writing Minor,"Hello!

I wanted to reach out to all you Professional Writing minors. What‚Äôs the minor like? Is it worth it? The classes, at least to me, seem really repetitive (even across the 101/102/104 classes), so I was wondering, are the classes enjoyable despite how repetitive they seem to be?

I‚Äôm trying to choose between the English major, English minor, and Professional Writing minor and wanted to know your guys‚Äô thoughts.

UC berkeley student could use a favor,"So I have kind of a weird request. Let me set up the situation; My partner, a PHD student of history at UC Berkeley, is presenting on a book titled 'You Are All Free: The Haitian Revolution and the Abolition of Slavery' on Monday. I tried to be helpful by ordering the book from the San Francisco public library last week, but it was held up along the line and now seems that it will not arrive in time for him to thoroughly engage with it before his presentation. The UCberkeley library copy is checked out. We have tried to find a digital copy that can be accessed right away, but have had no luck. Ordering online *may* get us a copy at the last second. I noticed the UC Davis has a copy on their shelf presently. I contacted the library, and they said that the copy is in, and that the library is open...but only to Davis students. Normally, my partner would be able to make a card since he is a uc student, but covid means they aren't issuing cards to non-davis students.
the only thing the librarian could suggest was that *a ucdavis student would have to check the book out on our behalf*. We don't have any friends at Davis tho, since we only moved to the state after covid times. So, we were wondering if there is anyone at the school who would be willing to check the book out for us. I know its a big ask to trust two randos with a library book, but if anyone would be willing, we would be happy to talk out the details beforehand.",1613765809,1,0

I am a current freshmen at CC studying Political Science and I need some advice. I want to transfer to Berkeley or Davis (and would like to study political science and specialize in International Relations but Comparative Gov't seems interesting too). I'm hesitant about a lot of things though.

Do you all feel that CC prepared you enough for Berkeley or Davis (because from what I know but schools are very hard)?

What do you feel that what you did during your time at CC that helped?

What should've you or your professors done differently that would've helped?

What extracurriculars do you recommend?

I've taken US gov't, microecon; taking International Relations, America History, and will take Comparative Gov't, Philosophy, Sociology, and macroecon; I am trying to connect all my classes to political science in some way :), because I feel it will help me more.

Any suggestions on books, documentaries, movies, etc I can watch to enhance my knowledge in the field?

How much do you guys actually like your current major? Should I switch mine?,"It‚Äôs past midnight and I‚Äôm having another crisis about my major. I‚Äôm a 3rd year EE and since the beginning of my second year I would always get those moments where I just want to switch to applied math and minor in quantitative bio/bioinformatics but never did it.

Would I be crazy if I switched now? Is it normal to have disliked like half of the classes you‚Äôve taken so far related to your major?

I think... I've quarantine found my limit on focusing.,"So I've a been trynna do this paper for the past WEEK. It's due Wednesday. and I just can't get my damn brain to focus and write. heck, I can't even get my brain to process the information from the paper that I need to \*read\* for it. I've always had problems focusing, and usually listening to video game music helps. But it's just not working this time. I've tried music. I've tried coffee. I've tried tea. I've tried working out. Heck, I've even had a cider in my efforts to focus and write this paper. I've cleaned the whole house. I've gone to work. I've read two whole ass books (which I haven't done in years...). I've done \*every\* little task that could possibly pop up as a distraction, and yet I still \*can't focus\*.  


**Any advice for focusing when you're stuck in your apartment?** I've been avoiding going to the library, because I've been playing it safe bc covid.

Any older transfer/re-entry students feeling a little out of place?,"Hey friends. I'm 26 (graduated HS in 2012) and my community college experience was rather...stretched out. I went from 2012-2018 with some gaps in between, and only just started at UCD last fall. Basically I was struggling with my mental health through that whole time and taking a lighter load in CC most of the time so as to not overwhelm myself, while going to all types of therapy and improving myself and doing my best to hold a job. Also, I had no clue where I wanted to head in life, so a lot of time was spent taking courses to figure out what I enjoyed. I also took an involuntary gap year last year bc I accidentally missed the application date when I was finally ready to transfer. 

I feel like the vast majority of people have been blessed in having a much more linear, and ""normal"", experience than mine. I didn't realize how weird it would feel being in classes with people almost 10 years younger than me. I never had very many friends in HS, but now there's almost this generational gap between me and the ""kids"", making me feel like even more of an outsider. Everyone has been really friendly and welcoming so far; I think it's more of a long-internalized impostor syndrome that keeps confirming my fear of socializing with my peers.

GAME THREAD: UCD Basketball Saturdays are Back! (WBB vs UCSD and MBB @ UCSD both at 2 PM; links in post),"Haven't done this for a while and feels good to be able to put another game thread together.

UC Davis has made a triumphant return to the court this week! After taking a hiatus due to COVID cautions, both teams are now facing our brand-new conference rival UC San Diego. Here's what you need to know:

**Women's Basketball vs UCSD**

**Stream:** [bigwest.tv](https://bigwest.tv)

**Summary:** The Aggies have won the last four conference championships and look to make it a fifth with this year's abbreviated schedule. They crushed the Tritons on Friday with a school-record-tying 17 three pointers. Watch for senior Cierra Hall and juniors Sage Stobbart and Kayla Konrad to look to guide a still-young team continue its early-season momentum to sweep its first week in conference play.

**Men's Basketball @ UCSD**

Stream: [ESPN3](https://www.espn.com/watch/player/_/om-navmethod/mens-college-basketball%3Agamehq/id/e7a44bd6-1828-41ad-aef5-19c6d91d4c75) (may need ISP or cable login)

**Summary:** The Aggies suffered a rough 89-69 loss on Friday, with its four-guard lineup scoring well but unable to stop the momentum of the Tritons. The Ags are a defense-minded outfit so Coach Les will be looking to clean up that performance and pull out a weekend win in a hopefully more low-scoring game. At the same time, he'll probably be hoping to see similar double-figure performances from guards Ezra Manjon, Damion Squire, and Elijah Pepper -- part of the Ags' promising young core last year who will need to take control on the court if we want to have any chance in conference.",1611440139,1,0

Should I come to UC Davis for semester exchange?,"
I'm going to the USA on exchange from Hong Kong and I'm not sure which college to choose. 

I'm studying sociology and prefer universities that are good in humanities with inclusive culture (I‚Äôm an Asian girl who‚Äôs slightly introverted). I‚Äôd love sunny, and non-humid places which are near the city. 

I have to choose from:
- University of Notre Dame
- The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
- WUSTL
- University of California (any of the campuses)
- Rice University

Understanding the Davis rental market,"Hello!  I am planning a move to Davis, and was wondering if anybody could give  me a sense of how the rental market works there. I have so many  questions, but here are a few important ones that I came up with:

1. What  is the ""rental season"" in Davis? It's mid March, and there are a fair  number of units listed on the usual websites (e.g., craigslist, zillow,  etc.). However, there are fewer than I expected given my experience  living in other college towns. Am I bit late in my search for housing  right now?
2. I'm  sure this depends on the area, but what are ""fair"" rents for a 1  bedroom apartment? It seems like one bedroom apartments start at \~ $1400  and can get up to $1800. From what I've seen, a lot of the cheaper  units appear to be concentrated downtown, with the more expensive ones  located in newer complexes spread throughout town.
3. More  generally speaking, are there any areas, apartment complexes, property  management companies, or landlords that I should avoid?

I'm looking forward to hearing your insights. Thank you so much in advance!",1616001406,8,0

I think I'm failing all my classes because I'm drowning in my personal issues. What should I do?,"I just need some advice because I'm super overwhelmed. Next week is the ""anniversary"" of something horrible that happened to me. I don't want to get too much into it, but it's been haunting me. I'm doing pretty bad in all of my classes because of it. I have multiple panic attacks throughout the day, I wake up multiple times throughout the night because of the nightmares it causes, and top of that I've lost three loved ones this year to various reasons. When reached out to my TA and professor about this for one class, they basically told me a two day extension on an assignment is the best they can do. Even on weeks where I'm feeling super good, giving it 200%, I still fail ever exam and get Fs on every homework assignment.

Here's why I'm panicking. I'm in a history GE and I'm supposed to be watching lectures asynchronously, taking notes in discussion, and taking notes in the readings. I have been to two discussions all quarter and have done 0 work for the class. Our ""midterm"" is to turn in all these notes. All the notes I don't have and it would take me three all nighters probably to finish. I was thinking of just half assing it and turning in as much as I can, but it's obvious I need help and I can't just keep doing the absolutely minimum to keep my head above the water.

My question is, what the heck do I do? How do I salvage my GPA? How do I avoid academic disqualification? Who should I be reaching out to? I literally can't afford to get kicked out school.

What is my chance of admission to UCD with this scenario,"Good morning guys,

A little bit about myself. So I'm a CC student in the Bay Area. I have applied to UCD for Fall 2021 for Computer Science major. In addition to the UC application, I have also applied for TAG and it has also been approved. I'm well aware that I must complete the following series with a GPA of 3.40 or higher for Computer Science major:

* Mathematics 21A/B/C
* Engineering Computer Science 20, 50, 36A/C ¬†

I have completed the Math series and CS 36A, and got As for all of them. Now I'm taking equivalent courses to CS 20 and CS 36C at my CC. I need to get an A in either of them and B for the remaining one in order to maintain a GPA above 3.40. In the worst scenario, which means that I may get Bs for both of those courses and drag my GPA for the Engineering series down to 3.33, will it disqualify me from being admitted to UCD under CS major?

My overall GPA currently is 3.95 btw. Thanks for any helpful answer.",1612380752,2,0

Hello Students!
 
As you might have read in an email or in the Student Life newsletter, UC Davis will begin automatically enrolling students into Duo multi-factor authentication (MFA) after Feb. 5, 2021.
 
Once you‚Äôre enrolled, you will need Duo to access OASIS, the Advising Appointment System, MyDegree,  and several other campus services protected by CAS. (What‚Äôs CAS? See https://kb.ucdavis.edu/?id=0527) For the short term at least, UC Davis Canvas will not require Duo.


After you are enrolled, you will receive an email announcing the change, with a link to instructions on how to enroll your device in Duo.

Cog sci and sociology - good double major?,"So I'm currently majoring in sociology and cognitive science (computational emphasis) and I was wondering if I could get some feedback on my major choices. I love sociology and I think it's incredibly valuable as a means of understanding how social forces shape our perspectives and opportunities. However, I'm aware that it can be difficult to get jobs with a B.A. in sociology.

I chose cognitive science because I was passionate about psychology but I appreciated the more scientific / objective nature of cognitive science. I chose the computational emphasis because I'd had some previous experience with coding and enjoyed it, but I'm honestly not that familiar with the major. I was undeclared for a long time because I was interested in so many things, and I love how cognitive science combines so many disciplines into a single field of study. I'm definitely excited to take more classes in psychology, philosophy of mind and linguistics. 

I know graduates tend to go on to work in artificial intelligence / neural networks which \*seems\* interesting, but I have very little experience with those. It seems like the coding experience would be a plus, though.

I'm also really passionate about art and illustration, and was planning on becoming an illustrator before I went to college. After doing some research, I realized that degrees aren't really necessary for illustration careers, and that I'd be better off just getting a degree in something I'm passionate about to ensure financial stability. I'd love to eventually pivot to a full-time art career, but that's just a dream for now. 

Am I doing the right thing with my major choices? I often hear that I should choose a major based on what I'm interested in / the careers I can get with that major but it's hard to choose with so little experience.",1617927012,1,0

New Club: SUMMIT at UC Davis!,"Hi guys! I‚Äôm beginning a new club on campus and wanted to gauge interest. While I found clubs on campus that were specific to certain sports, I did not find a club geared towards overall physical exercise/health. Whether your goal is to lose weight, gain weight or just implement healthy exercise in your life, please consider joining. 

Summit at UC Davis will be an organization committed to enabling students to reach their highest potentials regarding physical health. Our main objective is to explore different types of physical exercise in order for students to find the exercises that feel enjoyable to them, in hopes of motivating students to incorporate daily exercise as part of a sustainable lifestyle. The club curriculum will consist of exercise knowledge for those looking into beginning a fitness journey, gym education for new goers in order to tackle common feelings of gym anxiety, and group workouts over zoom ranging from intermediate to advanced levels. Of course, when in person classes restart, I hope to make this club even more engaging with club hikes, bike rides and much more as requested! 

Below is the interest form, open to general members with no deadline, but if you would like to become an officer, the deadline to submit for evaluation will be May 9th! This club will be active AFTER spring quarter 2021, so that we have the time to plan activities for a (hopefully) in person fall. Thanks everyone!!

STEP Program,I was confused about UC Davis's STEP program requirements. It says that I would need to apply to both 2020 and 2021 FAFSA applications but I only did the 2021 one. So do I just go back to the FAFSA website to do the 2020 one right now? The problem is that there is a question in the 2020 one where it asks about college for the year 2020-2021 which is my senior year of high school so I can‚Äôt answer it.,1617901327,1,0

"Questions from an incoming freshman (car, classes, etc.)","Hi!

I‚Äôm an OOS incoming freshman looking to major in genetics on a premed track at UC Davis and here are some concerns I have regarding the college. So, I was hoping to live in Sacramento and commute to campus and I need a car for this but I‚Äôve read freshmen are no granted parking passes under most circumstances. Does this mean I must live on campus without a car? Secondly, I am planning on taking some courses at my local CC this summer in microbiology, general chemistry, and technical writing. Does anyone have experiences with transferring OOS dual enrollment/ CC courses to Davis? If so, was it difficult to transfer the courses over? Lastly, what courses would be recommended for a freshman‚Äôs first quarter in the college of biological sciences? Are there any specific professors I should avoid or look to be in their class? I have no experience in calculus, some general biology experience, and I‚Äôm looking to take a general chemistry. I also have AP Credit for CSP, World, Human Geo, Env. Sci, and Physics 1. 

Tldr: 1. can I get a parking permit if I‚Äôm a freshman living off campus? 2. Should I enroll in CC courses this summer and what experience have you had with transferring DE CC credits to UCD? 3. Classes to take for fall quarter to minimize graduation time and what professors to avoid/take?

Thank you! Any help would be appreciated:)",1617859792,1,0

"Campus Doorways, a poem by Celeste Turner Wright, 1937","&gt;Bright in the April sun our portals wait‚Äî  
Doors that swing lightly to the eager hand  
And corridors down which the careless foot  
May bound unheeding. Here perhaps an eye  
Kindles with thought; and there a youthful voice  
Grows earnest mid the laughter of the throng.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Onward they troop, the joyous and the grave‚Äî  
Endless the pageant as the years revolve;  
And many April suns must warm these walls  
And springtimes quicken in the veins of youth  
Before we know who loved our portals best  
And bore from them the richest gifts away.

&amp;#x200B;

I  found this poem on the walls of Wright Hall years ago and loved  it so much I pulled out pencil and paper and copied it down by hand. Today, the month of April called it to mind again, and I felt an intense nostalgia for campus, for that sense of connection with both the past and the future. Someday we shall return.",1617858615,1,0

My parents are moving out of state before I attend UCD,"Hello. 

I'm going to be an incoming Freshman at Davis. I've lived in California for about 8 years, and I was never absent in the state for long periods of time. My parents too. However, now they are planning to move to Washington State in the summer before I attend UCD. I am still their dependent, however. And I will be keeping my current address when I start school. The question is: Will I be able to keep my residency tuition for 4 years if I enter as a resident in my Freshman year? I really don't want to pay OOS tuition :(. I have emailed the deputy office but they have yet to reply to my email. 

'tis quite the sticky situation to be in, unfortunately. I would appreciate any advice that you all have for me. Thank you.

As dramatic as it is, if I can‚Äôt bring him I don‚Äôt really consider the school. He‚Äôs very noisy but he isn‚Äôt a troublemaker or aggressive.. does anyone have any advice with pet keeping (off or on) campus?
2: how is the public transportation? I see a lot of people on bikes and I also saw a lot of buses and shuttles ,, i haven‚Äôt biked in years and if I decide to go, I‚Äôll try relearning again. so I‚Äôm just wondering if the buses and such are efficient and good?
3: are the art programs good? I‚Äôm planning to major in zoology, but I‚Äôm thinking of minoring in art or just taking a couple of art classes. Do they have a good program? Does UCD have a diverse art community/academics? Are there any cool opportunities for artists off and on campus ?
