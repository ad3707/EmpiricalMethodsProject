Comp Sci Weinberg (CO’25),"Hey! I got accepted into NU for chemical engineering at Mccormick, but after more research, I’m planning on switching to CS at Weinberg (I’m a fan of the more well rounded humanities curriculum.) However, I have VERY little experience (Only know the bare basics of python and html, I was planning to try and get a small understanding of java over the summer) do you think it’ll be a huge issue or should I not major in Comp Sci if I don’t have that prior knowledge?",1611604562,1,0

Is Weinberg ISP worth it?,"I have been considering applying for the ISP program (due March 1st), except the qualifications are kind of scaring me. They recommend that you take AP Chemistry, AP Calc, and AP Physics, along with the subject tests of Math II, Chemistry, and Physics. The issue is that being in the IB program, I only took AP Physics, which I managed to come out with an A with, but screwed over the AP exam with a 3. In addition, due to COVID, I never got the opportunity to take the subject tests (I won't be able to take them until May/June even if I could)  Being in IB the year where IB freaking decided to change their math curriculum, I never got to take AP Calc AB or BC either, while I am currently finishing my second year of IB Chemistry (higher level chemistry in IB takes two years).

I am currently an incoming student at Weinberg in the field of biological sciences, with an interest in pre-med. I am hoping to major in the concentration of biochemistry. I was wondering if for someone who hates math already, would it be worth it to overload myself with an intense math-focused honors program like ISP, or do the benefits outweigh the cons? Does anyone here well-versed with the program know whether this program would be a good fit for someone like me or not? 

In addition, would anyone know any other honors programs open for incoming freshmen that would seemingly suit me better? The only other one I know of is the MMSS program, something I for sure don't think would want to be in. 

Thanks so much in advance!",1611525960,1,0
Difference between Weinberg and McCormick CS,"I want to double major in CS and Economics. I assume that is easier to double major within Weinberg (rather than econ in weinberg and cs in mccormick) since there are less requirements to fulfill.

Track Your Homework Using my iOS App,"Hey there, I am the developer of B4Grad, a mobile app I started developing while I was doing my undergrad.

[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/b4grad-your-student-agenda/id1352751059?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/b4grad-your-student-agenda/id1352751059?mt=8)

B4Grad has since grown and we got a major boost by the pandemic that the world has been facing.

We are looking for students to test the product as we launch several new features this upcoming semester including our note editor. You can send us the feedback via email or write a review on the App Store. That’s it.

And in exchange, we’ll give you the premium version of the app for free. It’s that simple. Just email us on the App Store page or you could message me here on reddit.

So a little more background here- I actually built B4Grad with the intention of making school simple to organize. I always felt like every professor in my program had a different style of doing things, and I thought an agenda wasn’t good enough of a tool.

I hope that B4Grad can serve as a good solution to that problem for some of you. Let me know if it has.

I just finished my first 5 weeks on a college campus and I realized that I still haven't had a threesum with 38 different women unlike you guys, so I know I'm coming from behind, do you guys think its too late for me to still feel the touch of a woman on this campus???!!?

Edit : Do you guys think is happening because I sit and eat on the virgin tables at sarge (the high ones made to sit alone) what are the ultimate dining hall/seating combos to get laid FAST ???!!?",1613423367,1,0

Is the MS MFT Program Worth The Tuition?,"I have an interview for the Master of Science in Marriage and Family Therapy program in about a week and a half, and looking at tuition I'm not sure it's worth how much it costs.

I'm wondering if anyone has completed this program, and if it's worth the $136,000 total that it'll cost to go there. I know it's a great school with an amazing reputation, but all of the other school's I've interviewed at and been accepted to are well below $100,000. It seems a little financially irresponsible for me to go there (if I were accepted) but it's my dream school and the program looks exceptional. I also am wondering if there's any financial aid available (I've already applied to the Harris Scholarship which is the only one on NU's website, but I don't think I'll get it as I'm not in the target demographic for it), because I'm completely on my own for funding my graduate education.

New Northwestern Career Advancement Advising Page!,"Hi!

[https://www.reddit.com/r/NUCareerHelp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NUCareerHelp/)

My name is Liam. I am one of four students in a DSGN 305 class working on a human-centered service design project to improve the Northwestern Career Advancement service. I'm a junior right now, so I understand the struggle to find internships, write cover letters/resumes, apply for research grants, find the field of study you want to pursue, etc. This page will eventually be moderated by NU Career Ambassadors (students who work and are paid by NCA), but for now, it's moderated by myself and three other students. While we have experience in ""career advancement"" in our own lives, we want your input on what topics should be discussed, some FAQs, what the structure of the subreddit will be like, etc. Please start asking questions!

The point of this site is to not only receive NCA endorsed statements and advice but to also connect students with similar interests and to have alumni and older students share their own experiences and advice. I've also found that sometimes I want to ask for advice but it is tough to try and schedule an advising appointment, especially if it is a time-sensitive issue. NCA can also be a bit intimidating. This page will not replace advisors. It will supplement them and create a great community full of wisdom! If someone who is not a career ambassador gives a great piece of advice, the Career ambassadors will ""endorse"" that post/comment by giving it a certain award.

We are still in the early stages of prototyping so please give as much feedback as possible and please start to engage in conversations and ask questions! One of my professors once said, ""Feedback is a Gift."" Well, in this case, it could not be more true. My birthday isn't until June but I could use some nice feedback gifts. Thank you all and stay tuned for more developments!

I was wondering if anyone whos in it maybe or knows about it can shed some light on it for me? If it's worth it to go for a master's even (I would either get one in sport management, marketing, or communications which is why I think IMC would be perfect for me)?

When you’re on Northwestern’s campus do you feel like you’re in a city?,"I’m a prospective student making my college list, and one of my biggest things I want the colleges on my list to have is a “city vibe”. By that I don’t necessarily mean like an NYU style campus where you don’t have a campus (though I would be open to that), but a kinda campus-in-a-City style, like Columbia/Harvard/Georgetown/UMich if you’ve been to any of those campuses. 

Northwestern looks like a beautiful campus, and I really like how it’s right on the water, but after looking through google maps/NUs virtual tour it’s difficult to see what the surroundings around campus are like (which is a problem I’ve had with many schools). So, I wanted to ask you guys if NUs campus is fairly separate from Evanston/Chicago, and if not is it easy to walk to places like restaurants or stores off campus? Does Evanston have a “downtown area” that northwestern is connected to? How far is campus from the L?

Education (congregate child care, pre-K through 12th grade): Teachers, principals, student support, student aids, day care workers

Food and agriculture: Processing, plants, veterinary health, livestock services, animal care

Manufacturing: Industrial production of goods for distribution to retail, wholesale or other manufactures

Corrections workers and inmates: Prison/jail officers, juvenile facility staff, workers providing in-person support, inmates

U.S. Postal Service workers

Public transit workers: Flight crew, bus drivers, train conductors, taxi drivers, para-transit drivers, in-person support, ride sharing services

Grocery store workers: Baggers, cashiers, stockers, pick-up, customer service

Shelters/adult day care: Homeless shelter, women’s shelter, adult day/drop-in program, sheltered workshop, psycho-social rehab

It's crazy how much NU goes out of the way to really bring transfer students into the fold from the very start to finish. Even among other students I have never once been made to feel different or less than because I started my freshman year (or sophomore year in some cases) somewhere else. NU has plenty of shortcomings, but I think the welcoming culture around transfers speaks volumes about this institution.

Don't worry I am well past my honeymoon phase. I just know that being a transfer student is not always the easiest transition especially at other schools this level.

I run track, so getting recruited is fairly straightforward as a freshman - if I run a certain time, coaches will be interested. Is it the same as a transfer?

I could not get recruited since I picked up a few injuries in my junior year in HS, which created issues. I'm doing much better now, and can train and stuff without any issues.

Although I did not get in as a philosophy major, I want to give it a try when I am in college as I am particularly interested in political and moral philosophy.

I was accepted into Medill but I'm not 100% sure if I want to be a journalist,"I was recently accepted into Medill and so far the advice everyone has given me has been ""if you know that you want to pursue journalism/be a journalist 100% then go to northwestern."" However, I'm NOT 100% sure whether I want to be a journalist...I'm currently the editor in chief of my school's paper and while I've enjoyed my time in that class, I don't enjoy the journalistic writing style (ap style)-- it's very dry and formal, and I enjoy writing creatively a LOT more. If I do proceed with journalism, though, I definitely want to take the magazine journalism route which is less formal and more creative, so ig that's not much of an issue BUT I'm worried that I won't enjoy my classes at Medill much. I'm also planning on double majoring in either poli sci or international studies and minoring in film studies, so my question is: if I change my mind about journalism and transfer to weinberg, will an education at northwestern still be worth it? The biggest selling point to nu right now IS medill, but if I change my mind about journalism for whatever reason, will northwestern still be worth it? And if I decide I don't want to be a journalist, would pursuing a journalism degree be helpful at all?

I'm currently deciding between northwestern and my state school who has offered me full in-state tuition (my financial aid at nu is not much different than my state school, but idk if it'll significantly over the next four years).

If you're a current Medill student, some follow up questions are: what are the classes at medill like? what kind of assignments are you given? what percent of your classes are medill based? how much time does medill work take up?

However, there is no doubt social life is bigger at U of M and I do not want to be constantly stressed and never go out during undergrad because I have my whole life to do that and both schools are amazing so there isn’t a huge reason to chose one over the other.

The Holy Readings of Sarge 3rd Floor GroupMe,"&gt;Counter-psa: It's been a while since I've had a good old fashioned battle of wits. Sargent could use some fun pre-covid drama, anyways, no? I miss shenanigans. As the war proceeds, keep in mind this is all in good fun and I harbor no real resentment. We can even get lunch tomorrow if you want (assuming I'm not expelled by then). So listen here, you spineless sack of jello. If you have something to say to me, you can say it to my face like a man instead of dishing for moral validation from your 5 hive minded drooler friends on social media. If you were to contact me privately, I would probably have just apologized because this really isn't worth the trouble. 

&gt;But because you felt the need to make a scene, I'll be having fun with this. It seems inevitable that a small subset of very vocal automatons who say a lot of works but speak nothing of substance will no doubt call me an asshole. And granted, I probably am. But their boo's won't faze me, because I've seen what they cheer for. In fact, I'll relish in the name. I'd also like the court transcript state that nobody buys you were simply providing a ""nice"" and ""gentle"" reminder. You were being passive aggressive, distasteful, and uncouth. As I recall, it was a rather forceful ""You have to have your mask on!"" as I remained a comfortable distance away. 

&gt;Then you proceeded to blackmail me with the threat of reporting me on the snitch app to daddy Morty under the guise of compassion. So thank you my wise overlord, so very much, for making the magnanimous and ""gently"" decision to spare little ol' me. If [Name Redacted] were to ask me to put a mask on (as it is technically his job to do so), then of course I would comply. But not even he does that, because he has an iota of functional brain power and can understand the difference between necessary rules (ie: don't unleash 10 emus into the dorm) and being an unjustified jackass (ie: chastising strangers for not putting a cloth on their face in a cultish ritual that makes no scientific sense whatsoever).

&gt;And I must have missed the ceremony, because I don't remember anyone bestowing to you the title of Mask Nazi Warden of 3rd floor. If I need to fill up a water bottle or take a piss, I'm not going to ask for your permission. You're not my mother. You will not be taking my iPod privileges away or telling me what I can and can't wear anytime soon. Regardless, I'm vaccinated and you have that option, too. Even if I weren't, I would still choose to live life with the imminent danger of contracting a virus with a .01% death rate. You are more likely to die from growing in the bathtub, getting hit by a car, and even getting the flu in our age group

&gt;Don't think I haven't seen you in the dining hall eating without your mask on in a large group of friends, either. Not only are you a sissified, ill-mannered prick who is so fueled with compassion for his fellow man he has to constantly tell other people what to do, but you're also an anti-scientific, cemeteries headed hypocrite too. If you learn anything at all from your self-indulgent holy crusade against germs, let it be this [Name Redacted]: Mind your damn business. And yeah, fuck off. 


As a mod, I will stay neutral except to say I disagree that any rule against unleashing 10 emus in a dorm is a ""necessary rule"". Guy must be Australian.",1618725231,1,0

Prospective Asking About the Student Body!,"Howdy! I’m a high school junior and during Spring Break I managed to get up to Chicago and walk around Northwestern’s campus. First off, the water is so pretty and I love the architecture so much and it snowed while I was there and omg it was so whimsical! The one thing I’m wondering about is the student body, since most of y’all weren’t there while I was walking around.

I’ve read online both that y’all party and that y’all are nerds. Where do y’all really fall on the scale? I also noticed that there are a lot of fraternities and sororities on campus. I’m used to Southern big Greek life which can involve a ton of social hierarchies and popularity contests and just a lot of party culture. I know most Greek life isn’t like that and there can be many more positives. What’s the Greek life like at Northwestern? Are you expected to go to tons of parties all the time, or are they more of an optional thing on the weekends? And if you don’t join Greek life, are you still able to easily find friends and go to the occasional party? Or is the entire social scene built around Greek life?

Sorry for the block of text questions! I just really loved the campus so much and Northwestern is such an amazing school and from the limited interactions I got to have with students, people seemed nice. I just need to learn these last few things before I fall completely heads over heels and do a binding early application. Thank you!",1618551190,1,0

First sexual experience thanks to Sargent Dining Hall! (NSFW),"Hey guys,

So recently I've been frequenting Sarge and my eye caught a qt 3.14 girl and then everytime I went there she was also there and we always got one of those boxed milks they have there at the same time everyday.

After about 2 weeks, we got to talk as I handed her the last chocolate milk they had and grabbed a vanilla and said ""I'll have a vanilla today I guess haha"" and then we got to talking and I realized how pog her body was. From then on she was all I could think about, and we got to hang out a few times and last weekend I got super wasted and invited her to my room and I don't remember much more from that night.

Well all said and done, I wake upto a huge pair of bo\*bs(boobs) and my first reaction is ""THIS IS SOY HOT"" and then I S\*\*\*\*\*\*u\*\*\*a\*\*c\*\* them just to realize only problem is she isn't there and the boobs are actually on my chest. 

Anyways now I'm walking around with 3DDD's and contemplating life but still got to tou\*ch and fe\*l boobs,  thanks to Sarge only having Soy Milk.

Incoming freshman here. How bad would it be if I cancelled my AP Physics C Mechanics exam?,"Hello. I’m an incoming freshman majoring in computer science in Weinberg. My AP Physics C teacher is rather abysmal to the point that I am one of like five people left taking the exam out of around 50 at our school. We did our first practice MCQs of the year today (the exam is in a week) and I scored terribly on them which really made me want to cancel the exam. I’ve been scoring, like, ok.... on the practice FRQs (like middle 3-lower 4 range). If I put in the hours between now and next week I could like probably maybe potentially score a 4 on the exam but a 5 is pretty out of the question.

Should I cancel this exam? Apparently I can get one credit in Weinberg for a 5 on it which I’m not getting anyway. There’s a chance I might want to switch to CS in McCormick in which case I have no idea what the test could get me. I think if I were to take some physics courses at NU I would start at the first-level class anyway regardless of whether I take the exam because I still know nothing about physics. I could also just take the exam without studying and get a 2 on it because who would care but in that case I would rather cancel it for the refund.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you, and btw I’m like extraordinarily excited to become a wildcat next year like you have no idea I literally can’t wait!!!",1621296964,1,0

Vaccines required,"Dear members of the Northwestern community,     

As confidence increases in the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine and the supply has met the demand in Illinois, Northwestern will require students to be vaccinated against COVID-19 for the 2021-22 academic year. At this time, faculty and staff will not be required to be vaccinated.

COVID-19 vaccines are the most important tool to help end the pandemic, and requiring students to be vaccinated will best support the health of our community and position us for in-person classroom and co-curricular activities for the Fall Term. We will provide information about how to share vaccination status in June.

We understand that some students cannot take or are hesitant to receive the vaccine, in some cases for medical or religious reasons. Information about seeking an exception to the vaccination requirement will also be available in June. Students who have not been fully vaccinated or have not received an exception may not be able to register for fall classes. 

We also understand that our international students have additional considerations. Students who are unable to secure vaccination access in their home countries will be able to request a temporary exception and be signed up to be vaccinated upon arrival to campus. Additionally, international students who receive a vaccine in their home country that is not authorized in the U.S. may be eligible for a medical exception following guidance from Northwestern Health Service.

Based on responses to vaccine clinic invitations and vaccine self-disclosures, we estimate that more than 75% of Northwestern’s students are currently fully vaccinated or in the course of vaccination. Students who still want a vaccination are encouraged to fill out this simple form, and the University’s vaccination team will contact you to provide options for receiving a vaccine. Students and employees may also email vaccine@northwestern.edu with questions about scheduling a vaccine appointment.

COVID-19 testing updates

Because we do not currently have comprehensive information about students’ vaccination records and a portion of the community remains unvaccinated, all students must continue COVID-19 testing for the remainder of the spring, regardless of vaccination status. This testing, which is supported by our public health and clinical partners, will help ensure the campus environment remains healthy as vaccinated and unvaccinated students interact in person with increasing frequency.

For the past two and a half months, we have offered Color tests and Abbott Rapid tests side-by-side, with more than 100,000 total tests over that period. After analyzing the data, we have experienced amazingly consistent performance between the two tests — in fact, we have seen more positive cases and higher positivity identified from the Abbott tests than we have the Color tests. The Abbott Rapid tests also have the benefit of giving immediate results, allowing us to separate positive cases from the community and completing contact tracing quickly.

Given the performance of the two tests, and the positive impact vaccination will have on campus, our medical experts have recommended that students start completing two Abbott Rapid tests per week, removing the need to complete a Color test. Some students have asked that we simplify the testing protocols, and we hope that completing only one type of test will make the experience easier. As previously shared, students are able to complete as many Abbott Rapid tests as they would like, and we encourage them to do so. 

There will remain a limited number of Color tests available for those who want them, but students are no longer required to complete these tests. Students can ignore any automated messages from Color about tests being due. 

Final decisions regarding testing requirements for the summer and fall are in review, following recent updates from the CDC and feedback from public health agencies. We will closely monitor the data as more people are vaccinated, and await initial results from a few important studies about vaccination and testing. Students receiving a COVID-19 vaccination waiver as noted above should expect to have increased testing protocols in the fall. Protocols for vaccinated students are expected to be significantly reduced and will be shared this summer as they are finalized.

Please reach out to NU-COVID-Testing-Support@northwestern.edu with any testing questions.

Updates to mask requirements

Following guidance from the State, Northwestern has relaxed mask requirements outdoors on campus for those who are fully vaccinated. These individuals do not need to wear a mask outdoors unless they are participating in a large outdoor gathering or event. If you are not fully vaccinated, you should continue to wear a mask outdoors if you are engaging with other people. 

Masks are still required indoors in alignment with the guidelines that have been previously issued, regardless of vaccination status. 

Capacity and gathering limitations

As you may be aware, the State of Illinois will move into a plan called A Bridge to Phase 5 on Friday, May 14. When that happens, we will adjust Northwestern’s capacity levels for indoor and outdoor spaces, particularly to support opportunities for more in-person engagement among students, faculty and staff. Please check the On-Campus Activities section of the COVID-19 website for the most current information about support and guidelines for on-campus events and gatherings. 

Thank you for all that you have done, and continue to do, to maintain a healthy campus environment. We will share more updates with you as they become available.

Sincerely,

Kathleen Hagerty

MVC Placement Exam Question for Freshman,"Hey guys! I’m super excited to be coming into Northwestern as a freshman this fall. I plan to study mathematics, and am considering doing the BS/MS 4 year program in applied maths through McCormick.

Throughout high school, I’ve taken Calculus I - IV, Linear Algebra, Diff Equations, and some other math courses such as discrete math. While I have college credit for the math courses I took my senior year, and a 5 on the AP Calc BC exam, I took Calculus I - IV through my high school, and thus didn’t receive college credit for it. 

I know I’ll have to take the single-var and multi-var Calc placement exams, but I’m a bit worried since I haven’t taken single-var since my sophomore year and MVC since my junior year... I feel a bit “rusty” on some of the topics in Calc IV since I didn’t utilize them that much this year. How much do these placement exams matter? Will I have to retake MVC if I do poorly on the exam, despite having succeeded in differential equations and other classes that build on MVC? Is it worth studying for these exams, or should I just wing it? Thanks so much all!",1620528225,1,0

Have any premeds here taken chem 171 vs chem 151? If so, can y'all tell me how it went and how you'd compare them??

Northwestern vs Cornell vs GT,"Hey guys! I know this is really late, but I'm still completely torn between Northwestern vs Cornell vs GT, would love to hear any thoughts on the matter. I crossposted this to the Cornell subreddit (so I could hear both sides). Thank you so much in advance!

intended major: likely engineering; leaning towards either cs or meche right now. If I do decide to do anything outside of engineering, it'll likely be something either in business or econ

**GT**

Pros:

\-Cheap

\-I'm from Georgia so I know a lot of people going to GT

\-Great at pretty much all engineering

Cons:

\-Focused on engineering; heard that their business/econ programs are not that good because they're made to rely on their engineering program

\-Stressful (at least that's what I've heard from their reputation, but I've also heard that their classes are easier than the ones at my current school)

\-Heard that job recruiters don't actively recruit on campus

**Cornell**

Pros:

\-Cheap as well (for me)

\-Great at STEM

\-CS ranked marginally higher than GT (but I don't think rankings really matter)

\-Great at econ

\-presidential research scholar program

\-ivy (but I don't think this means a lot, esp. since the other schools are also really good)

Cons:

\-Stressful

\-Transfer system for schools (but I heard it's not too hard to switch)

\-Rural area and weather (but tbh I don't really care about the location and weather as much)

**Northwestern**

Pros:

\-Tight knit community (especially @ the Garage)

\-Murphy scholar

\-easy to transfer and switch majors

\-Very well rounded (great at music, sports, and journalism - tho these are all things I don't think I would do)

\-Not as stressful? (at least non-competitive, but the quarter system seems to be stressful)

\-very social (I'd like to think I'm pretty social but I'm kind of a stemlord - NU would be a new experience for sure)

Cons:

\-7k more than the other schools

\-not as good in engineering as Cornell + gt

\-very social (stemlord)

I'm an incoming freshman '25 and have been looking through the info about picking dorms and stuff and saw that there's a housing prepayment due May 1st that you have to do to ensure you get fair consideration when you actually rank your dorms. I was wondering how you access that payment and how much it is?

I applied ED so I already did the $200 housing deposit back in January and just wanted to see if that's what it's referring to, or if there's another payment that you have to make that you have to access.

Should I try transferring sophomore or junior year?,"So I’m a high school senior rn and I didn’t really get any of the options I wanted to get into. I did get into UIUC for computer engineering, but I’m OOS and they gave me terrible aid so attending probably won’t be feasible and I’ll most likely end up at my own state school which is not terrible but also not amazing. I still want the chance to attend a top university because of the opportunities it can bring so i want to try and transfer and I’m looking into NU as a potential school I might wanna try to transfer for. I was just wondering if I would have a stronger application applying for sophomore or junior year. My high school application (although my grades and test scores were great,) had pretty weak ECs up until my senior year so I’d rather try and minimize the impact my lack of high school ECs have on my app if they matter at all.

Some questions from a prospie,"Hello! 

I am a prospective student and I got into NU and another school. They're equal to me in all the important ways except for community and community service, but only because I couldn't find this info about NU. 

**This is going to be a lot, but please bear with me!!**

*What is the community like?* One thing this other school touts is how they're ""like a family"". Is this true, somewhat true, or not true of NU? I really want to go someplace that's very supportive (and not just academically). 

*What is the community service like?* Obviously there's going to be community service everywhere, but I mean, is it something that is pushed or something people just do because reasons?

*What is the alumni network like?* Are alumni bending over backwards fighting to get you to where you want to be or apathetic (or somewhere on that spectrum)?

Finally and kinda unrelated, but *is chem actually as hard as they say??* It seems crazy to me that there are people at NU that are taking an entire two years of a class that is out to get them and somehow still going to or wanting to go to med schools (I'm a premed, just for reference).

Communication Technology: Dual between Engineering and Communication,"I was recently admitted to the Dual Degree program of Engineering (I applied for applied math) and Communication (Ratio/TV/Film), as well as Murphy Scholars.

I know Northwestern's School of Communication is one of the best in the country. But as I asked many current students who are in soc, it seems they are mostly dedicated to performing arts, film making or theatre. This is not really what I am trying to do--I am more on the STEM/Tech side of media, rather than careers in journalism/ entertainment etc...

1) Has anyone done this? What/how was your experience? If you haven’t dont this in CS but for some other major, I’m also interested in your experience.

Campus residences- down and dirty,"Hi everyone. Hope you’re all enjoying spring quarter so far. I’m going to be an incoming freshman this fall, and I was hoping to get an inside perspective into the different campus residences. Now, I’ve spent my fair share of time researching them all- the residential services website, the spreadsheet detailing all the amenities and features of each hall, the housing guide, north by northwestern, youtube videos of the dorms, and just about anything I could find within the google search “northwestern residential halls” and similar variations. The North by Northwestern housing guide gives provides a few student opinions and a social rating, but the 2020 guide still warns “This information was last updated in 2017.”

What I’m really hoping for is just to hear from people what it’s all like. The research I do can only go so far, when what can really help me out is hearing student anecdotes, experiences, opinions, and perspective. How social is everything (broad, i know), are there practical locations to study, is the walking load significant, what type of students surround you, is there a nice view, does it smell bad, are the facilities operational, is the laundry always occupied, can you cook (reasonably), are the doors locked overnight, do you ever feel isolated, do you ever feel overwhelmed, is the dorm crazy, is the dorm dead, is there tons of movement at weird hours, are rooms an ample size, is the closest dining bad/too far, are faculty constantly around, what furniture is provided, are there quiet hours, do you ever feel unsafe, can beds be rearranged, does noise travel, is there something that bugs you about it, are there constantly too many people, what’s the visitor policy (pre-covid and during covid), are there constant maintenance issues, etc etc etc. Basically any info I could get from students, but I won’t find advertised anywhere.

I think the above questions are amongst the most valuable, because having lived in these places you probably have the most reliable perspective on it, yet unfortunately, the questions I have are the type you would ask your older brother two years above you at the university, or that you would ask your friend’s cousin who just graduated from Northwestern. It’s the kind you just need people’s opinions on- facts can only go so far. Nevertheless, coming from a really small town I know absolutely nobody from NU so there’s really nobody I can talk to about getting this kinda insight. I also can’t visit and see for myself, for obvious reasons. Perhaps then, I could ask all of you what you think? You can be 100% honest, and that’s what I’m hoping for. Give me it all, bad or good. I really appreciate anything info you can give me- south or north, residential colleges, halls, anything- I just want to hear what your take is so I can hopefully make a good decision when ranking my living for the next year. Any tidbit about any dorm you may be aware of or have experienced, feel free to share.

[Rejected ED Applicant] Please critique and suggest improvements to my Why NU essay going forward for transfer admission,"I wish I would have done this before submitting it, but please give feedback in the context of someone who wants to write a new and greatly improved Why NU statement to transfer from CS+Economics at another university to Weinberg Economics after a year at that school. While I understand that the specific academic opportunities and extracurriculars that attract me to Northwestern will be different after spending a year at another college, I still think that feedback on this essay would be valuable since Northwestern's transfer application prompt is the same as this one and I'm sure that some opportunities (EconLab, MMSS, Policy Debate) and similar classes to the one mentioned will still interest me a year later.

Link to the essay is below. Thank you so much in advance-your feedback is truly invaluable!

Room Selection,"I am a freshman, about to go through this for the first time and I’m slightly confused. I’ve also heard that we get our priority numbers tomorrow, so I might need to make some last minute changes if necessary. This is my plan so far:

I most definitely want to be on South campus. I also want a single, preferably in Allison, 1838 Chicago, or Shepard. Location is probably more important, so I could live in a double instead with a compatible roommate if it comes to that. However, because I’m almost certain that I want a single, I have not reached out to anyone about being roommates next year. 

Depending on what priority number I get, should I be concerned? Are we choosing specific rooms? If that’s the case, should I go visit all the dorms and see what the rooms are like if I’m able to?

I haven’t been in the residential area of any south campus dorms, so if anyone can give me a quick rundown, I’d appreciate that! I’ve exhausted the information on the websites, so looking for insider information :)

I don’t particularly care about the social atmosphere, as long as there aren’t constant parties going on. I prefer good soundproofing so that I can’t hear conversations in the hallway clearly (or if nobody ever talks in the hallway that’s fine too), cleanliness, easy access to laundry, bright natural light.

I feel like everyone on the Facebook page already knows there majors and minors but I don’t know anything except that I will be doing pre-Med. Is it true that they don’t really guide you at NU when it comes to career choices and etc? I feel like I’m going to fall back at northwestern because of how everyone seems so motivated and have everything figured out already. Is NU even as hard as other Ivy leagues as well? And how is the grade inflation? Are the teachers actually helpful? And I come from NY so does Chicago have as much opportunities as the city if not close? I want to pursue a modeling gig as a side hustle on Chicago but I don’t know how Chicago compares to NY. How important is a room mate? Is it diverse or is there low key racism/homophobia? Is it worth double majoring and does it cost more money if you do? Anything you would like to say in regards to what I have said or just anything at all, please lmk.",1620310826,1,0

2. Are premed classes hard because of the material or because professors curve badly?
3. Are Northwestern premeds more collaborative or competitive?

Quarter system - how do you know which classes are easy and which are difficult when registering for them? I’d like to create a well balanced schedule.

Joining frats - I’m not stereotypically fratty. I’m sociable and like to party but I’m middle class, don’t dress fratty, and I’m also really bad at playing and talking about sports (which I’ve heard is a fairly large part of some frats). Is it difficult to fit in to Greek life without fitting a certain standard? 
(I know there’s been some chaos with Greek life at the school recently but I still plan on rushing I think)

Money/culture shock: I got great financial aid here so I’m lucky enough to be able to afford it, but I do come from a middle class background. I don’t wear name brand clothes and I will have to be a bit (but not excessively) frugal. Will this make it hard to fit in?",1617140878,1,0
