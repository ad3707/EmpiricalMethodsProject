Which Housing should I 'settle' for?,"Hi all,

Off-campus housing sucks, and I'm really gonna miss my Nike 4/2 (rock solid 80mb/s internet). Even the communities with great reviews here get terrible reviews elsewhere (looking at you, Tivoli).

I'm looking for a 3-4bed/bath with direct access to campus (either walking distance or shuttle) that's near, or less than $800. I have a short list of Glenn, Tivoli, Knights Circle, Plaza on Uni, and Northgate lakes. All of these are around the same price, with Tivoli being \~$100 cheaper.",1613864641,1,0

Reflections Kiosk,"Hey guys, I’m hoping some alumni can shed some light on the [Reflections Kiosk](https://www.ucf.edu/location/reflections-kiosk/) on campus. Today, it’s home to Toppers ice cream. I’ve always found the little building to be interesting, but what I find even more intriguing is the fact that little historical information regarding this kiosk exists.
UCF’s campus history is relatively obscure. The Student Union, which is now renovated and full of boring Aramark food options, used to host Toppers ice cream, along with other classics such as Wackadoos.
According to [this article,](http://knightnews.com/2015/01/nom-nom-bowls-opening-up-in-ucf-reflecting-pond-kiosk/) the kiosk was home to Salsa 2 Go from 2006 to 2014. Next, Nom Nom Bowls was the tenant until eventually Toppers moved out of the Student Union and into the kiosk.

Can anyone share information about the history of the kiosk? Perhaps there are some alumni on the subreddit that remember Nom Nom Bowls, Salsa 2 Go, or even older tenants. (I cannot find any pre-2006 information about the kiosk.) It seems as though maybe it was once a visitors information kiosk before converting into a walk-up food place? The structure’s architecture matches the rest of the area (library, Millican hall, Howard Phillips Hall, etc.) so it must have more history to it than I can find available through internet research.",1613763223,1,0

For her first exam she chose to use the Respondus  Lockdown Browser. I have no issue with professors trying to prevent cheating and that is not the reason not to take this class. Instead I have an issue with professors that decide to give their class 0s because they started late, but for the students who actually were caught switching tabs and cheating she only gives them a warning. This is absolutely ridiculous. The exam was 46 questions in 46 minutes and we were given a time slot of 1.5 hours to complete it. Something that many people missed was an announcement saying that if the exam was not started within the first 5 minutes you would be given a 0. This was not stated in the syllabus and came as a last minute surprise. This class is also treated way more seriously than needed . The professor teaches as if we are all biology majors, but there are not any bio majors in the class. So unless you are in bed with Biology do not take this class with Dr. Hararuk.",1613602676,1,0

Feb 14th positive lab test

I wake up with a pounding headache for the last 5 days (maybe a week idk time is an illusion)

Still fatigued but tasks are doable and keeping up w school work and my internship (which is also my place of employment) all from home.

I’m wondering,after calling the UCF Covid Line and being told that pcr tests positive for 90 days that I should trust the rapid test. And push fluids. And take Mucinex/Robotussin.

Was given a phone number to set up telehealth appt thru (UCF I guess?) I have appt already scheduled w my general practitioner tomorrow for a med refill so I will probably run it by him.

Should I also set up telehealth thru ucf ?

The Station Alafaya or The Retreat East (new)?,"I recently got accepted into grad school here so I am looking for a place under $900/mo. In undergrad (Alabama), I currently live at a very similar housing complex compared to these two and have had no issues besides the wifi going out occasionally. After doing some research, it looks like both of these complexes are run by the same management group and are basically identical and have similar rents, the difference being The Station is on the north side of campus and their new complex (Retreat East) will be close to The Lofts and Orion. Most negative reviews about The Station mention the wifi, incompetent management, and shoddy construction (which I am used to). I am somewhat intrigued about The Retreat East as it would mean I would have a new apartment without a few years of wear and tear from previous tenants. 

For those who have lived at The Station, what was your experience living there? Specifically the maintenance, wifi, and general safety. For those living in the Lofts or Orion, is the area safe/decent around there?

Edit: For those that say neither, what complexes would you recommend that are under $900/mo?",1614851745,3,0

Rant about UCF FinAid and Student Accounts,"Sorry ahead for this rant but I am just fed up with how FinAid and Student Account deal with the students... like for real in a day I got like 3-4 emails to tell me about my “outstanding amount”but I have try to get responses from FinAid and it takes them more than a week if they ever respond... After three separate meetings to try to figure out as to why my loan that I had accepted for this semester disappeared and why last semester one lowered... none could help me except to tell me that I’m not considered in “need”... the most pissed I am is that they reduced the one for last semester, which was paid full by the loan and part my pocket. Then I go down to student account after three useless meetings for the course of a month, to then be told that yeah they cannot give me a payment plan because the dateline is close, like I get that I understand that but cannot do some digging and try to help a broke college student out? Nope they cannot because they rather ask you for the money than to help out... and then seeing people that are probably need less the help financially getting a respond for the COVID relief for like $800+ and for sure I won’t probably get any.... and my friend was told that they probably won’t help him out upcoming semester because there is no funding. 
Like it feels that they really do not care for any of us or any situation might have shown up... it is either you pay or you pay no way to help you out... I even asked if there was a document or form to fill out if I’m turning 24 soon since I know for fafsa that could help a lot... and they were like “oh yeah that could help for next fafsa” and I’m like I asked for now not for next one....

"incoming environmental eng. major, need some advice","Hi! I was accepted into UCF for environmental engineering for this Fall, and honestly I just need some advice. I was accepted into Gator Engineering @ Santa Fe, but it's a program that doesn't allow for much major flexibility and if I decide I don't like engineering at all, I'd have to drop out/transfer. I also just like the vibes at UCF more. The only thing that I'm worried about is the accessibility of good internships/job opportunities when either an upperclassman or after graduation. I know that one of UF's big recruiters is Procter and Gamble. I guess my question is, is there an abundance of local and national recruiters for EE and just engineering in general? Is it more local companies? More national? Are there big names like P&amp;G or Frito-Lay? I don't really plan on living in Orlando for the rest of my life. Obviously like when I'm an adult adult that's different, but I'm talking more about straight out of college. For environmental engineering and just engineering in general.

I am a Health sciences major, he is an anthropology major, both rising sophomores. We have been bestfriends for about 3 years now and originally are from Miami. I like to go shopping, sleep, and watch tv shows. Ryan likes to play video games, watch movies, and play guitar &amp; piano. We are both night owls but are respectable and won’t be loud or bothersome to others. 

Overall, we are chill and just want some good roommates, gender doesn’t matter . All we ask that you be at least a bit considerate of COVID and clean/pick up after yourselves, alcohol friendly, is respectable of others and their property. We don’t care about guests staying overnight, just as long as it’s not a huge party or all the time. 

The rate is $770 for a bedroom with a walk in closet &amp; private bathroom. Utilities are included with $40 electricity cap per person [overages split equally between roommates]. There is a pool and gym as well as free printing and computer use by reservation.

FAFSA W/O parent’s info?,"Hey all, so I’ve been pretty bummed about not being able to receive the government money from the school since I don’t have a valid fafsa on file. I have a mother who refuses to fill it out for me bc of her own selfish reasons. I’m a self-sufficient student who pays  their own bills and tuition. Last year I still filled it out, but it was automatically rejected bc there was no parent info and I don’t meet any of the requirements to be considered independent. I read that there is a way a student can be considered for unsubsidized loans without parent’s info, but it’s completely up to the school’s financial aid office. I was thinking about calling the financial aid office Monday to see what my chances were, but knowing ucf’s financial aid office, they’re pretty shitty and careless. I just wanted to know has anyone else been in this situation and was able to qualify for the unsubsidized loans w/o parent’s info?

"Student-Athletes of UCF what's life like for you, socially, academically, physically, mentally, and emotionally?","I'm in high school right now, and I'm feeling stressed out with a lot of things in my life and wondering if I should drop baseball instead of seeking out an athletic scholarship. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents want me to get an athletic scholarship but that's so I can get into college because we don't have enough to pay tuition, I don't want to play major league and I actually want to focus on my career related to software development or engineering. I know that if I'm a student-athlete I'll have less time for things because of training and sports. I want to have time to focus on my art, and actually have a social life that I can enjoy. I'm not sure if I can do all that if I become a student-athlete, let alone focus on my academics. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I do enjoy baseball, its just not my passion. But I face numerous problems if I drop it:

1. a heartbroken father who got me into baseball since I was 3 years old training in an old gym in Jamaica
2. I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to pay for college, I'm terrified of having student debt that I won't be able to pay for and having it pile up and ruining my life.
3. I'm trying to maintain the A-B Average I have right now and am terrified of getting anything below a B
4. All of my courses are career orientated and I'm scared that if I drop one it will affect how colleges see me
5. On the flip side of 4, 2 of my classes are really stressing me out, one of them I'm severely behind on

The only side of dropping baseball is that I'll have more time to focus on my art, programming, and learning about electronics than I do in my free time. Plus it will take the stress off of having to come home at 6 or 7 pm and not worrying about not having time to study or complete an overdue assignment. I should also mention that I've been homeschooled for 7 years and haven't really had a social outlet. I have Instagram and follow old classmates from elementary school but we don't talk anymore. and my 2 best friends who lived in separate cities for 5 years left me last year so I've been really lonely. 

&amp;#x200B;

So just from a student-athlete perspective, what is life like for you on the student campus, I know everyone's experience is different but I just want to know if it is worth pursuing and if there's any benefit for me even though I'm not planning on playing major league.",1611629220,1,0

Where Do People Go To Make Friends?,"I'm transferring from Seminole State in the fall for computer science, and I was just wondering where people go to make friends in the area?

I know about Lib and Pub, but those places are kind of gross even without covid going around. I like gaming, cars, reading, astronomy, ice hockey, etc...

I'm not asking for pity, I'm hoping that I can be pointed in the right direction. I know reddit isn't a great place, but I'm not sure of anywhere else to ask this question.

Don’t live in Knights Circle.,"Just posting this now so future UCF students know not to live at Knights Circle.

My girlfriend started a small fire in the kitchen the other day (there was something under the burner while she was cooking and it caught on fire), so she used the fire extinguisher to put it out. No big deal, right? Well, maintenance is now telling her that not only does she need to pay $100 to replace the fire extinguisher (which was already close to expiring), but she also needs to pay $200 to clean out the stove from any possible extinguisher residue. So I guess “she should’ve just let the building burn down” is the message they want to send? Also, wouldn’t removing the residue be maintenance’s job? I genuinely don’t know what the point of having KC maintenance is; they can only accomplish the most minor tasks and the other 90% of things you ask them to do they just give up or fuck things up even worse than it already was.

Tl;dr: Knight’s Circle maintenance is extremely shitty and management doesn’t give a shit about actually putting any money back from your relatively expensive lease back into the complex. They’ll also squeeze every penny out of your wallet for the most bullshit reasons you’ve ever heard. Live anywhere else.",1611345141,1,0

Dynamics with Nader,"So, I’m currently taking Dynamics this semester with Nader, and thus far the class has already been a fucking horrible time. 

His lectures are so unhelpful, I barely get anything out of them. So I go to the textbook for some help... and it’s even more confusing to me than his lectures, so great, no help there either. Then, his homework problems are awful, and I’m always so lost on how to do them. 

And I just bombed the hell out of the first exam for the class... so yeah that’s fun. 

There also doesn’t seem to be a lot of outside resources to help with dynamics material so it feels like I’m shit out of luck with a better way to understand the material. 

Which leads me to my question:

Can anyone please give me some advice for how to survive this class??? 

I felt so confident walking into dynamics this semester because I took Statics with Zaurin and I excelled in his class and got a high A, I frankly thought that class was easy so I felt prepared walking into dynamics this semester, but holy shit... it feels like I crashed into a brick wall here with Dynamics... and it’s super fucking depressing.

At this point I don’t know if I should stay in the class or drop it. I don’t want to drop it if I don’t have to, but since I don’t need this specific class to graduate I would be ok. I’m worried that if I stay in the class that I’ll end up failing it because of how his teaching and communication is. How bad does a drop/withdraw grade look on a transcript? I’m not planning on going to grad school, but I’m worried about employers or if I apply to something.",1612320126,2,0

Looking for other female friends to go scuba diving with!,"I know there's a scuba club at UCF but I also know that not a lot of people know it exists.

Heck, sometimes it's a very male dominated hobby so I'm honestly hoping to just increase the amount of fellow female dive buddies I have regardless of age lol

The main reason I'm asking is also because I'm planning ahead for Spring Break. I want to (responsibly) have a good time going to the beach, diving, etc. My parents have a beach condo on the east coast so I'd like to make friends with responsible people that I could invite over during that time :)",1612284137,9,1

Residency question,"I'd like to confirm that I'm correct in how I'm understanding a portion of the Florida rules for residency requirements for my son who's starting at UCF this summer.

We currently live in Florida, and have lived in Florida for the past 7.5 years.  After my son starts school, my wife and I are moving out of state for work (end of summer).

I asked the question to UCF and the State University System of Florida, and they've only directed me to this document: [http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App\_mode=Display\_Statute&amp;Search\_String=residency+for+tuition&amp;URL=1000-1099/1009/Sections/1009.21.html](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=residency+for+tuition&amp;URL=1000-1099/1009/Sections/1009.21.html)

I'm no lawyer, but section (4) states this:

&gt; (4) With respect to a dependent child, the legal residence of the dependent child’s parent or parents is prima facie evidence of the dependent child’s legal residence, which evidence may be reinforced or rebutted, relative to the age and general circumstances of the dependent child, by the other evidence of legal residence required of or presented by the dependent child. However, the legal residence of a dependent child’s parent or parents who are domiciled outside this state is not prima facie evidence of the dependent child’s legal residence if that dependent child has lived in this state for 5 consecutive years prior to enrolling or reregistering at the institution of higher education at which resident status for tuition purposes is sought. 

The way I'm understanding that section, is if my son has lived in Florida for at least 5 years consecutively prior to starting at UCF, he will have no trouble qualifying for in-state tuition.

Can I get a second opinion on this, or maybe some feedback from anyone who's had a similar situation?

After realizing that, I went over to log out of webcourses and turn off the laptop to make sure it wasn't cheating, however when I signed out of webcourses on the laptop, it also did the same with the PC. Causing me to restart the computer, to boot up Lockdown browser again, and get back into the exam. After finishing the exam, I called the professor to let her know the situation and that I wasn't cheating, and on top of that, emailed her so she could understand the situation better. How much should I worry that they might still accuse me of cheating? She said she made a note on the report, and thanked me for telling her.",1612196984,99,0

"With a return to a (mostly) normal fall semester, I pose this question: Will you still wear a mask?","So, since UCF announced last month that they plan for a nearly full return to face-to-face classes and pre-pandemic operations, I still have to wonder, do you think you will still wear a facial covering? 

Personally, I really don’t mind the mask. For about a year now I have not gotten sick with anything, haven’t even felt so much as a sore throat or a stuffy nose, due to widespread masking and physical distancing, and I know that me masking up individually has helped keep me free of respiratory viruses. 

I think back to about January of 2020 (Spring 2020) when it seemed like *everyone* was sick... like goddamn. Any lecture hall you went into there’d be a good bit of people coughing and I would hear so many people with the sniffles/stuffy noses in my classes and in a lot of buildings I went into. It’s insane to me that in the pre-covid world we were completely fine with letting people who were very obviously sick with something come to a packed lecture hall, sometimes sitting shoulder to shoulder with others, spreading whatever respiratory virus it is they had around like a damn wildfire. Just disgusting to think about how people would so casually cough/sneeze into their hands and touch so many commonly used surfaces (door handles/knobs, railings, etc.) and people who wouldn’t fucking wash their hands after using the restroom. 

I’ll admit I might have been guilty of some of these gross pre-pandemic behaviors, but I hope all of us will still continue to practice basic hand hygiene and be mindful of others if you are sick with something. 

Anyway, I know I’ll always still be rocking a mask in the future during cold/flu season, especially if i’m in a crammed ass lecture hall or really any crowded indoor environment with little physical distancing and poor air ventilation. 

Do you all feel similar? Interested to know your thoughts.",1617909091,1,0

Bio 2 and Anatomy,"This might be all over the place but i’ll try to make it short and easy to understand:

-Im a health science major possibly working towards being a PT or Registered Dietician, and was wondering if i HAVE to take bio 2? Advisor said i should take it over this summer but i didn’t mention that i wanted to be a PT OR RD and i don’t think bio 2 is a requirement for being either one of those. It’s definitely on the health science catalog under common program prerequisite but not sure if i HAVE to take it. 

-Another thing is if i don’t take bio 2 over the summer, i’d replace it with Anatomy. Is that a crazy move to take that class over a 12 week period with Tina Dow? (Id be taking anatomy and medical self assessment this summer) 

-Does it matter if i take anatomy before physiology?

Chemistry Fundamentals II (CHM 2046) Professor,"Greetings 

I have a question for **CHM 2046** this Summer, I have 2 professors: **Matthieu Baudelet** in a V section for Summer C, and **Swadeshmukul Santra** for Summer C as well. They both have bad rates at ratemyprofessors (which I don´t use as a bible but as a aid tool). 

The issue with rate my professors is that Baudelet has 9 rates for CHM 2046, all of them with 1 out of 5. Moreover, Baudelet does not have a book registered in the bookstore, meaning that he will or would not make us purchase a book; however, if I don´t have a book and he explains as bad as those 9 rates say, then I would learn without any support.

Santra, on the other hand has like 90 rates (the majority of them are like 1 or 2) but they are from people who take CHM 1020 (Concepts in Chemistry). Santra has the book and some program with excercises from Pearson.

Now my question is:

Whom should I take, Baudelet or Santra?

I don´t care if I have to learn everything from the book, but I would like to know which professors seems to explain better, I could have taken Julie Donnely; however, I cannot take her since I´m also going to see MAC 1140C (Pre-calculus) 

If you haven´t taken these professors, you can reply as well, I want to know the option of everyone. 

For those who may have taken classes with one of them or both, I would be more than perfect to read you opinion

Music Transfer Question,"Hi guys! I think if no one here is sure I'll contact the school of music as well to try and find out more info.

Anyway, I'm wondering if I transfer in from Valencia with an AA into one of the music performance degrees, if it'll still be a four year program? As in four more years tacked onto my AA? I'm taking some music prerequisites at Valencia but I won't have a ton at the end of my AA (this December), due to my education being really fragmented over like 7 years being in and out of school and switching focuses. 

The main reason I ask is because I'm also learning a second language and hope to work abroad, but the advice I've received in that regard is that the bare minimum to be relevant as a hopeful VISA recipient is to have at least a Bachelor's.

Honestly I'm about to be 25 and being in school for another 4 years is not really what ideally I'd want, but I gotta do what I gotta do if I really want to work abroad. 

I'm just hoping to get a better idea of what amount of schooling I'd be looking at if I were to transfer from Valencia with an AA into the music program (performance specifically, but maybe it'd be shorter if I just went for a regular BA in music?). Would I still be in for 4 more years bc of program specific stuff, or would my AA actually still cut down some of that for me?

ME Graduate level courses difficulty?,"Hey all! I am a Mechanical Engineering senior that is about to enroll in the accelerated BS-MS program. For those of you that don't know, the program allows undergraduate students to complete part of their MS degree by taking those graduate level courses alongside their undergraduate ones (saving time and also a little money). I sent out my request for a Senior Design 1 code with my projected schedule a couple days ago, and just got an update saying: 

""**Note: You may not be approved for all three graduate courses (in spring 2022) as (they) are expected to be TWICE the course load of an undergraduate course. ... EML 4502C: Senior Design II contains a significant time commitment, as well. ... \[Additionally, it is VERY rare for students to be approved for a 6XXX Graduate Course in their Undergraduate program.\]""**

Each of the graduate courses I plan on taking in the Spring 2022 are 3 credit hours each, and I meet the prerequisites for all of them.

Here's what I'm wondering:

1) *Are Graduate Courses TRULY twice the load?* A few of my friends have started their Graduate programs in other types of engineering/stem (Civil, Environmental, Materials) and from what I understand, they are doing essentially the same course load as their undergraduate, only with more specialized topics.

2) *Don't graduate students typically take 12 credit hours per semester?* Since I will be completing my Undergraduate program at the end Spring 2022, wouldn't I just be continuing on to taking 4 Grad level courses the next semester?

The online training resources will teach students how to better protect their accounts.  The simulated phishing messages students may receive will mimic real phishing emails but are completely harmless.

**Why is UCF InfoSec doing this?**

We want to help our students stay secure online!  University students continue to be targeted by scammers, and we want to give students the tools to spot these phishing attacks.

We’re starting with a small group at first to see how effective a program like this can be.  Our goal with all of our awareness efforts is to help students protect themselves online and be able to spot phishing emails that may try to steal their money or passwords.

&amp;#x200B;

Notifications will be sent via email soon.  Not included in this first group?  Want to participate if space opens up in a future group?  Fill out our interest survey here: [https://ucf.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_3pKylel3oUrUC8e](https://ucf.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3pKylel3oUrUC8e)  (you’ll need to sign in with your UCF credentials) and we’ll let you know if space becomes available!

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions about this program or information security in general, please contact our office at [infosec@ucf.edu](mailto:infosec@ucf.edu).  Good luck on your final exams, Knights!",1619107895,1,0

Early Graduation Help,"I'm sorry in advance that this is dumb, but I've never been good with figuring this stuff out and I haven't been able to get in touch with an advisor so here I am. Basically, my friend figured out I'm on track to graduate a year early. I've got about 8 more classes to complete and I'll have the requirements for my major and minor. The thing is I'm not sure if I want to graduate by next spring. My program has a portfolio you need to turn in a semester before you graduate and that means I'd have to work my ass off during this fall to complete it. Plus, my tuition is pretty much covered so I wouldn't really be saving money. 

I looked at my excess credit hours and it says I have a baseline hours limit of 144. With that in mind, I'm not sure if I should go ahead and try and get a second minor so I have more time for my program and portfolio or if I should just take some random fun classes since I won't end up going over the hours. My brother went to UCF and he thinks I should just take some random classes. I just need to make sure I have four classes per fall and spring to keep my aid. I know this sounds dumb but if anyone could help me figure out what I should do or if what I'm saying even sounds correct that would help a lot. I've just never been good at understanding credit hours and program requirements.",1617041822,1,0

Aerospace Engineering or Physics (BS)-Astronomy,"Hello. I will be attending UCF in the fall and I am registered for Aerospace Engineering. I chose this major because I have always been passionate about space and heard this degree is the best route to working for NASA or SpaceX and becoming an astronaut, which I aspire to do every day. However, I have always been more interested in understanding the fundamental laws of the universe and how things interact in the cosmos, like space-time, relativity, etc. I am more into the theoretical side of things. I am worried that engineering will be more practical and applied-based (mechanical), which I never have really been passionate about. I have always loved math (calculus) and science (especially physics and astronomy) and I am wondering if I am making the right decision? Should I switch my major to physics-astronomy or should I stick with aerospace engineering? Like I said I dream to go to space and become an astronaut as well. Another thing is I am thinking about becoming a pilot in the air force after college if this is helpful. Though I am not into building aircraft or spacecraft, I have always been interested in piloting them.",1616980868,1,0

Palm Beach State College or Broward College,"
I’m not from Florida so I have no idea about any of these places. 

My first priority to transfer would be UF then UCF next. I was thinking about Valencia but not sure if Orlando is for me. 

Palm beach would be at the lake worth campus 
most likely and broward would be the south campus at Pembroke Pines

I’m leaning towards broward just because of the proximity to Miami.

I would most likely be pursuing the honors program but I have no idea what the school is like, the students, amenities etc",1620187515,1,0

Vegan/ Vegetarian options at the heart of campus,"I am super disappointed with the vegan/vegetarian options in the Union. Quodoba is awesome as they have options; however most other places don't even have a meal option. I can get white rice and steamed broccoli at panda - that's not a nutritious meal. They have a tofu dish, but it's not offered here. I wish that every restaurant would offer one real meal. I'm not asking for variety from individual restaurants - just one option so that the union as a whole has options. 

Steak and shake could do one impossible burger option, Huey Magoo's could do fried tofu fingers. I'm just asking for one protein substitute per restaurant. 

I was super excited when I heard that a vegan place was opening on campus in the fall - purple ocean superfoods bar ... But after looking at the ""food"" they serve, it's basically unblended smoothies. I want a HOT MEAL ... Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful for the option ... I just wish there were more. 

Also. I choose to eat how I eat. I don't find meat gross taste wise, I just don't think the amount we eat is sustainable. I have friends from other countries though who dont eat meat due to religious reasons and may also find the thought of eating it repulsive. Why can't those people have just one option from each restaurant??  

Am I being ridiculous? Do you agree? Do you think this could ever change? Should we start a petition?",1620148470,1,0

Unsure How I should proceed Summer Semester (Mechanical Engineering Student),"So currently I am taking EGM 3601 (Solid Mechanics) and EGN 3343 (Thermo) for Summer 2021. Nothing wrong with the classes. However I have not taken Dynamics yet, and was planning to take it during the summer with Thermo but I heard very bad things about the instructor teaching Dynamics. The problem is if I do not take Dynamics in Summer 2021 with Thermo, I will be behind one semester and will have to take Heat Transfer during Summer 2022. I was hoping to reserve Summer 2022 strictly for internships.

Is it worth the risk to just take Solid Mechanics during the fall and take Dynamics with Thermodynamics during Summer 2021? Thanks",1621279077,1,0

How hard is it to work your school schedule around a 9-5 for an undergraduate degree?,"I have searched for this topic and have been unable to find anything with this exact question.

Basically, through doing a coding bootcamp, I was recently able to get a job as a web designer and make pretty swell money. They also offer the benefit of reimbusing you for your classes if you choose to go back to college. I am a few courses away from my AA at a local community college that has Direct Connect.

My work schedule for my job is 7:30-4:30 M-F, and the commute from there to the main UCF campus is about an hour. 

My goal is to get my bachelors in Digital Media and minor in Computer Science.

My question is, how easy is it to make your schedule flexible with classes? Ideally, I would like my courses to be online, but Digital Media is not a program that is listed as fully online. Are there plenty of options for night and weekend classes for UCF? I am nervous that if I get later in the program, I am not going to find classes that work with my work schedule which is inflexible. 

PS. I'm not sure if this is relevant but I plan on taking my time with getting my bachelors. I don't plan on overwhelming myself with courses, since I plan on staying at this job a while and it's pretty secure. Also, sorry if the flair is wrong, I wasn't sure which one to use.",1621199636,1,0

Feeling a little lost. a very long tirade,"I've just finished taking Orgo I online this past spring semester, and though I ended with a B I'm starting to think that it was more of a curse than a blessing. 

I had a really difficult time this spring semester, and I was (still am!!) really grateful for my Orgo I professor. They ended up implementing one of those incredibly rare exam replacement/drop systems that literally moved my grade up two letter grades after the final exam. I AM genuinely glad that I passed that class and that that professor was as kind and helpful as they were, but I fear it has set me up completely for failure. The double-edged sword of easier online classes and good grades leading to decreased understanding of future class content is starting to rear its ugly head pretty early, I suppose.

I did end with that B in Orgo I. But I also had a test average of around 54%. There was an exorbitant amount of extra credit for those of us who attended the lectures. A chunk of our homework answers were in the back of the textbook and reused verbatim on exams, which meant that even if I could not understand my homework answers, if I could remember and recognize the answer when I saw the question again on an exam I could answer it properly. Honestly, if my professor had not used old homework questions that I simply recognized, my already abysmal 54% test average would have (and should have) been even lower. 

The realization that it took about a year for me to go from being a driven A-student to being a student who was resorting to just memorizing homework answers just to scrape out 50s on exams has been kind of horrific. The fact alone that I was thankful to be taking Orgo online during the pandemic, knowing I would not be experiencing the horrors described by previous students should have been a red flag. I don't really know what I was thinking being so happy to latch onto an easier online version of an important class. 

Anyways, that was the spring semester. Getting that B in Orgo did not delude me into thinking I had finished with a proper understanding of the content of the course, but I still have to move forward. With UCF's only Orgo II summer professor being less than ideal, and the thought of taking Orgo II in a normal semester at UCF in person being absolutely mortifying given my Orgo I experience, I decided to enroll in Orgo II at Valencia for the current summer semester.

Week one isn't going well. My UCF Orgo I professor's leniency, though I loved them for it, is showing me just how much I truly do not know. What seems like the absolute basics of Organic Chemistry are not familiar to me in the slightest. I went from UCF this past spring not requiring mastery of basic drawings of anything from resonance structures to mechanisms, etc., now to this professor at Valencia who is requiring handwritten, hand-drawn submissions of mechanistic steps and our reasoning for each step for every homework assignment. I am not capable of this in the slightest. 

Please do not think I am complaining about what Orgo II is asking of me - I recognize (and feel terribly for) the fact that those of you who really did take and properly suffered through Orgo previously absolutely had to master these concepts, at the very least. This is the way the class should have been taught to me, and I'm sure if I had taken Orgo I in person at UCF I would have originally learned it this way. For those of you who did so, I think you are absolutely incredible. I also realize that although my previous professor did not require this understanding from me in order to pass, I could have assumed and tried to teach myself these mechanisms. But I...was not prompted to learn this way. This past spring, there was no way for an Orgo professor to individually grade the drawings, steps and reasoning of 300+ kids at UCF during the pandemic's online semesters. The concepts behind Orgo have hardly been the problem but...I cannot draw. Anything. I do not have a proper understanding of substitution and elimination reactions, deciphering different projections, the rules of mechanisms and stability, and the like. And that understanding is the bare minimum of the content you have to have mastered in order to succeed in Orgo II. With weekly homework, quizzes, and assessments due in this fashion already beginning in this first week, I don't have time to actually teach myself and learn all of Orgo I before I will start failing this Orgo II class before it has truly begun.

I don't know what to do? I'm kind of just tired and miserable. While Orgo is the worst example of this situation I've encountered, it isn't even the only course giving me this sort of trouble during the pandemic. I almost wish I had always performed more poorly so that this low wouldn't feel so suffocatingly low. My parents and the medical professionals in my family telling me how proud they are of me pulling at B in Orgo I is so undeserved and makes me feel disgusting. I can only imagine how they'd feel about me if they knew I actually got by with that angelic exam replacement. I can't catch up on the content from Orgo I in time to do well in Orgo II. I also found out I apparently can't even retake Orgo I to try to actually have it taught to me because apparently the B grade I recieved is too high to allow a retake like that. Haha. I ""did too well"" to retake it? The irony of that one stings pretty bad tbh.

Regardless of whatever has happened or will happen, I can't avoid having to take Orgo II. I'm quite sure the effort will be fruitless but I am still going to stay in this Orgo II class and do what I can. I don't have too many semesters left where I could squeeze in a retake of this class, but I think I am just going to have to so hopefully even if I fail Orgo II now so I will learn something to help me on the next time around? Hopefully. I'm not really looking for any advice, I guess, but I don't have anyone to vent to or ask for help, especially for something like this. If any of you do have any advice or some kind words, though, I would always appreciate it. If you've made it this far through my rambling, thank you for even reading this and I hope these upcoming semesters are safe and less stressful for you. If any of you are going through something similar, I wish you the very best.",1621191146,1,0

Cant get off waitlist?,"I have been on a waitlist for calc2 this summer since the day I have been able to enroll and I am still on it.

Dropped a class on accident.,"Hello everyone. 

I accidentally dropped my college algebra class for summer yesterday. I misunderstood if it was on campus or not and it turns out it’s all online. Of course there’s a waitlist and when I tried to re join the class i’m now number 14 on the waitlist. 

Is there anyone I can email or am I just screwed?",1621121645,1,0

Off-Campus Housing Advice Northgate V. The Verge,"My roommates and I are looking for off campus housing for fall of 2021 and we are torn between Northgate and the Verge. I was wondering if anyone had any input on the two to help us weigh the options. The Verge is currently running a discount where if you sign a lease within 24 hours of starting the application they'll give a $65 rent deduction per month. 

Main concerns: 

Safety, noise, proximity to UCF, and cleanliness.",1614289306,2,0
Looking for a D&amp;D Group! (More specifically a DM.),"Hello! My roommate and I both go to UCF and are looking to start an LGBTQ+/BIPOC friendly campaign. I have experience playing, but not DMing. We're looking for a DM and for some people who'd like to play as well, and I thought looking for people in the same college would be a really fun idea. We'd play mostly online due to COVID. Message me for my discord if you wanna chat!

Thanks :)",1614288461,8,0
"UCF, FSU, or UF?","So i’m a senior in high school and I’m trying to decide which school I want to attend. My top are UF, FSU, and UCF. I intend on majoring in nursing. I haven’t been able to tour the campuses in person but from my research here’s my pros and cons for each one. 
FSU: 
pros- nice campus, great school spirit
cons- most likely would have to have a roommate (but don’t get me wrong, the dorms are nice there), about a 7 hr drive away from me
UF: 
pros- best academics, great school spirit 
cons- location, dorms (same with fsu but less nicer dorms), not much diversity 
UCF: 
pros- location, nice dorms (more single dorm options), more diverse
cons- the school spirit isn’t like uf or fsu, large school

I think school spirit is big for me since I really want to feel like I’m a part of something. However, I also want to be able to do things outside of campus. UF decisions hasn’t came out yet but UCF is the only school that offered me aid. Anyways, I’d love to read you guy’s pros/cons for each school!! If you know anything about the nursing programs that would be great too :) Thanks in advance!",1614286621,5,0

Not Eligible for On-Campus as a Returning Student?,"So I know that usually UCF has their housing applications really early in the semester. I had forgot about it and tried to apply today, but it shows no options for eligibility for returning students to the main campus. Was this because I was too late to apply or is this because of the pandemic and the first-years getting housing priority for Fall and Spring?",1614274702,3,0
