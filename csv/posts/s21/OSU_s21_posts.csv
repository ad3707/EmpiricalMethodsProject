to the underclassmen - walk around off campus right now to see which realty companies clear their properties' sidewalks and those are the companies you should consider renting from :-),"I'm honestly not sure if realtors are required to clear their sidewalks but I think it definitely sets them apart if they take the time to do so.

just thought of this as I nearly fell on the off campus sidewalks for the 192803713th time over the past few weeks. I am a senior and don't remember the sidewalks being this bad last year, but for weeks there have been huge patches of thick ice everywhere making it extremely difficult to walk.

I'm through north steppe and the parking lot is literally just a block of ice. maybe others could comment with their own experiences to help out younger buckeyes!!",1612795796,1,0

As some of you may have heard, many of us have our OPT application documents delivered to the lockbox more than 90 days ago and haven‚Äôt heard anything from the USCIS ever since.

Maybe it's just me but the libraries are frustrating this year.,"I completely understand having a designated food area in libraries like 18th and Thompson. I get that it's important to keep COVID under wraps.

But when there's nowhere to sit because a) tables are dirty and they won't be cleaned (this is a huge problem in the Union that I've seen too), b) the ""only sit here when you're eating"" rule isn't enforced at all, and c) it's like 10 degrees outside, I shouldn't have to choose between leaving the library and standing in the snow to drink my coffee, or being able to sit down in the library and work while I caffeinate. When I mentioned this to the guy who told me to throw my coffee away or leave, he shrugged me off and said ""go outside then"". It's just so frustrating and makes me not even want to go to the libraries anymore.

I don't have a solution, since I know that stuffing the cafe full of tables and by proxy people is a terrible idea, but it doesn't make it less frustrating. I'm afraid to take water bottles places anymore.",1612458272,133,0

Freshman Housing Questions,"Hi, I am attending OSU next fall and have some questions regarding housing. My roommate and I both committed in early December, and we were thinking of maybe rooming in a quad with two other people. We aren't exactly sure what part of campus we want to live on, but we are leaning towards North. 

1. If we were to request a dorm on North Campus with 4 roommates, would we most likely get a not so nice dorm since sophomores have first pick? 
2. We want the best shot at a nice dorm so would we have a better chance on North or South campus as freshmen? And would we have a better shot as a group of 2, or as a group of 4?
3. The way housing contracts work is confusing to me, if me and my roommate both committed in December, and hypothetically receive our housing contracts fairly early does that mean we have a better chance at a nicer dorm? Or does it just mean that our contracts were signed earlier and our dorm will be completely random?",1612433404,1,0

If you‚Äôve always been involved in intramural üèäsportsüèä, you may want to hitüëä the court, üèëfieldüèë or gym again. Or maybe you‚Äôve missed üí∫sitting üí∫ down ‚§µÔ∏è with üÖ∞Ô∏èaüÖ∞Ô∏è big groupüë• of friends üê∂üê∂ at Sloopy‚Äôs or K-Comm.

The truth is: I wishüôè all of this for you (and me), too.

The infection rate among these üéístudents üéí üà∂has üà∂üà∂ doubled in just one1Ô∏è‚É£ week. This hasüà∂ led usüáªüáÆüáªüáÆ to increase‚ûï testingüíØ to twice weekly for residential students üéí üîõonüîõüîõ the Columbus campus. Increased üìùtestingüìù allows the universityüéì to identify cases ‚ûïmore‚ûï quickly, isolate those cases and quarantine their at-risk closeüòö contacts.

The universityüéìüéì is taking this stepüö∂ because we haveüà∂ ‚ûïincreased‚ûï capacity in our Applied Microbiology Services Laboratory (AMSL) and üé≠actingüé≠ now will üíÅhelpüíÅ ensure the successful completion of the semester and no ‚ùé interruptions to studentüè´ organizations‚Äô ability to come together in small üë•groups üë•.

"Dear Melissa Shivers,","As a fourth-year student graduating this semester, I have sat here silently as we all have received your emails throughout the past year. Time and time again, I am constantly discouraged with the leadership and petty, childish, and petty threats towards the student body, YOUR student body, more and more with each email. This newest email has struck a new chord for me, for several reasons. It is so incredibly insulting to go out of your way to type out statement after statement of a future for the ""normal"" semester that we all crave, topped with an incredibly baiting subject line such as ""As You Wish."" How tone deaf must one be to start off an email painting pictures of an in-person graduation (a once in a lifetime opportunity that will likely be taken from me), teasing first year students of opportunities that they missed and will continue to miss, and reminding people that they cannot do 99% of the things we have been able to do, only to be followed up with the same useless, baseless, hollowed reminders to wear a mask and distancing. The fact that your tactic to convince students to be prudent and safe is to dangle the past reality of campus and student life and activities in front of our eyes, while knowing the reality of our country's situation is facing a new reality that we will not have anything close to normal (like a spring concert! Why would you even include that as an example?) within the near future is an embarrassing thing to see from someone who is supposed to be a leader for the students. You are insulting and dismissing every single student that hasn't seen some of their best friends, those who have had a decrease in mental health, those who have been prudent and persistent in staying safe.

I understand that your position is limited. I understand that you can only do so much to help our position as a student body. But we need you to stop being lazy and manipulative and start behaving like a leader. Your emails have done nothing but provide a laugh time and time again, shadowing the same information that we have heard, like you said in this email, ""a million times."" You are so painfully aware of the repetition and uselessness of your emails, yet you refuse to say anything helpful or even encouraging to the student body. In this email, you have instilled hopelessness to those that need hope the most, and capitalized that things have gotten worse. Not anywhere in this past email have you acknowledged the incredible toll this has been to those who have been masking, who have been social distancing, who sacrifice our college experience, only to walk quite literally across the street to hundreds and hundreds of students lined up shoulder to shoulder to enter bars and clubs. Not anywhere have you mentioned the ignorance of those hosting and attending house parties, or the obnoxious lack of enforcement of the same rules you've been regurgitating to us for the past 7+ months. Not anywhere have you mentioned any mental health resources, in a time where it is needed more than ever. 

Your unprofessional, threatening, and once again baseless ""Together As Buckeyes"" email series that was prominently seen closer to the beginning of the year and through the winter hinted to me that you look down upon the student body you lead, and that you choose time and time again to use your position to break us down instead of truly coming together as a community, and this most recent email confirms it. 

You even said it yourself, we don't want another message like this from you. We want one that acknowledges the true reality of our situation, not mocks it. We want you to acknowledge those being irresponsible and holding the community back. We want you to acknowledge the lack of enforcement or consequences for the oh-so-important rules that you double down on every email. We want better communication and to not have to guess what you are doing for us. We want informative emails so that we don't have to sit around with no clue and wonder if my A Cappella group is even allowed to sing. We need you to be useful to us. We need you to do your job to unite the student body and provide a hopeful and realistic picture that we can identify with for the rest of the semester, not to dangle unrealistic, drastic fever dreams of what this semester can become. Treat us like the adults we are and start working for us, instead of talking down to us. 

We need this.",1614904808,589,12

Details about the recent double robberies at 16th and Indianola,"Hey Bucks,

As many of you probably heard, on March 1st around 8:30pm, two separate but potentially related robberies occurred off campus on 16th Ave, one of which was a felony robbery and the other may have had a gun involved. If you saw the neighborhood safety notice, you'll know that OSU PD was of absolutely 0 help providing information that may help nearby students in identify the suspects.

So, I went and requested the police reports from those incidents. The reports include suspect descriptions (height, weight, race and clothing descriptors) that I believe may have been very useful for nearby students to know at the time of the first alert to this crime (at 9pm via OSU\_EMFP twitter, only 30 minutes later).

# So, in the interest of transparency within our community, and the fact that I apparently have to do OSU PD's job for them, attached below are those police reports.

I realize not much can be done 3 days later, but perhaps you live in the area and saw these suspects fleeing that night and getting into a vehicle. Or maybe you're just disappointed in OSU PD like me, and are curios to see the reports....

It will all work out.,"I'm sure that there are some people out there who need to see something like this, at least I know I would've wanted to last semester or even before that. I'm a senior CSE major wrapping up my time here at The Ohio State University. A lot of thoughts are buzzing in my head, and I am not good at verbalizing my thoughts on paper so I will try my best. Honestly, this will probably end up being me just blurting out a bunch of things.

I'll add examples for some thoughts to flesh them out more.

It will all work out. We can't control things like a pandemic affecting our lives, and no one could have really seen it coming. It sucks, but we really can't do anything else but keep moving on through it. Examples to convey vibe: Internship was canceled because of COVID? Well, that sucks, now move on and go find another one. Weren't able to get into a more intimate relationship with someone because you were sent home for spring break? Stop thinking about that opportunity and make more opportunities now.

You will find something to do in life. Even if it is not in your major's field, keep in mind that you are going to be graduating with a degree from a well-known university, and in today's world that can mean a lot. 

Don't ever let yourself feel like you're underprepared (for classes, internships, jobs, etc), because the truth is that you probably are! We're only starting our careers, and every bit and piece of the experiences we have are shaping us and molding us into who we will be. Good or bad, we are growing from those expereinces. Examples to convey vibe: If you're a CSE major applying for internships and jobs, do not let imposter syndrome rule your life! Feel underprepared for interviews? Do some LeetCode, practice some behavioral, take that interview and don't look back! There's no point. You are valuable regardless of if you feel it or not and in this life you need to make yourself king. 

Please take care of yourself. Get out of the house, take a walk, eat some delicious food, hang out with your friends, ask them how they're doing, do your laundry, etc. You've got this, you got into this great school and that means something.

Please do not hesitate to PM me if you have questions about the major, the field, where I am at in life (new grad questions, job search questions, etc).",1614792317,179,2

I had a couple of questions as an incoming freshman enrolled as a pre-CSE major. My nerves are starting to act up as I slowly edge closer to graduation from highs school. So I hoped the people of reddit would be able to give some guidance.,"This is my first ever reddit post, so I apologize if I don't have reddit etiquette. 

So, I am planning to go to OSU as a pre-CSE major, and I had some questions about OSU (in general) and the specific major as well. 

Overall:

1.) I got rejected from the honors program, and so I was wondering it would be worth trying for scholars and what program (I thought that STEM Exploration and Engagement or is there another that might be more beneficial)? Or does scholars offer no real benefit for CSE?

&amp;#x200B;

Specific:

1.) Is the CSE course made for people who have little to no coding experience? (I am currently taking AP CSP (python), I saw a similar post to this one but it was made 3+ years ago and wanted to know if anything has changed) 

2.) Right now, I only know python, but I want to learn another language over the summer, is there a language that is recommended to learn?

3.) I have heard that the waitlist for the CSE courses is really bad, is this true or is it overly glorified?(This would decide if I want to apply for scholars and try to get that priority scheduling)

4.) What would be the best laptop to get for the CSE courses? (I saw an old post taking about how apple might be the best, but I wanted to hear from recent students and what they think about it)

5.) My second choice for a major was accounting (I know the two are vastly different, but I do love finances and accounting). So, IF I find myself not really enjoying CSE, would it be difficult to change majors from CSE to Accounting or Finance? 

Again, I am sorry if I didn't follow the reddit etiquette, but I would greatly appreciate if you guys could provide some feedback.",1611595963,1,0

"Seasonal Depression is real, better days are always ahead.","I'm not sure why I am writing this but it may be helpful for someone else or someone who can relate to it.

I knew my sleep was a concern when I fell asleep during a zoom meeting. I tried telling my parents I was depressed but my dad wouldn't listen and told me I wasn't being grateful or appreciative, my mother on the other hand was very good at listening. Flash forward two months later and my motivation is at an all-time high, going outdoors has made such a difference.

Error in Scheduler Removed A Class and Now im 34 on a Waitlist,"Recently was scheduling for my next semester of classes and had enrolled in 2 different ECE 2020 courses.

Well I got into a Systems 2 class and removed the ECE I no longer needed but the system removed both my labs so now I just had an ECE with lecture only which I was 3 on the waitlist for. I talked to my advisor and they said they could not add just the lab component and ""it shouldnt be possible to have a lecture without lab"" so they re-added me to the class and I am now 34 on a waitlist and said theres nothing they can do about it, so I will not be getting in to ECE 2020 next semester now.

After lots of research I am still debating what type of freshman dorm is best.

I think I've already decided on north campus because of the air conditioning and close proximity to engineering classes but I want to make sure I make the right choice for the dorm type. I'm still a little confused on how dorm selection works because OSU's website makes it look like I can choose any available dorm at the time of selection down to the room number of a building but people on the reddit say freshman have basically no choice. I've also seen lots of people complaining about the 4 X 4 suites but then they say the 4 X 2 suites are the way to go. OSU's directory for all dorm types lists building that have the better 4 X 2 suites but then when I check the buildings they don't have that option in all the room types. I've also seen people say you want the least amount of people so doubles in the right buildings are what you should go for. Can anyone clear this stuff up for me?,1613869521,1,0

The only one I would be comfortable with dropping is BUSML 3380, just because I want to take ACCTMIS to catch up on my graduation path and while the workload of a 3 hour, BUSMGT has the cost of a 1.5 hr. Again, any feedback/thoughts would be greatly appreciated!",1613748512,1,0

Flopping calc 1 and my future...,"It‚Äôs only like week 6 I think but lordy I am doing absolutely terrible in this class, and now i‚Äôm starting to lose motivation to do the work...I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm gonna make it through and I honestly don‚Äôt think I will. The problem is that as a stats major, I need this class to reach calc 2 which is a pre-req for all major coursework...so at this point I am considering changing majors because the stress of knowing I need to pass this in order to stay on track is absolutely soul-crushing because it affects the entirety of my future. Distance learning could be affecting this but I can barely force myself to do the lectures and the work anymore, it‚Äôs really getting harder to focus...I do believe that if I really tried I am definitely capable of learning the material and passing this class, but emotionally‚Äîmentally, I CAN‚ÄôT. The stress is only gonna get worse and I don‚Äôt want this to ruin my mental health and the rest of my classes. The other problem though is that I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm supposed to do for the remainder of the semester cuz it‚Äôs too late to drop it, but so do I just keep pushing through?? It‚Äôs 5 credits and absolutely gonna bring my gpa down and that is just making this all worse........ literally any help or advice is useful...I just, it‚Äôs almost comical, I‚Äôm struggling!!!!!

For now though(until I talk to my advisor about this), if anyone has any group chat or SUPPORT group for this class that I could join that would be great !!!!

I also do have interest/experience with coding, so the CE side appeals to me. I'm hesitant just because I feel like I may not have interest in the core EE classes just because they're hard, and I feel like the CSE classes are hard too, so it would be a dumb reason to switch. I don't know if it would be better to just get through 3010 and 3040 even if they're hard and just only do the digital tech electives, or if it would be better to switch.

OSU MATH 4547 and MATH 4548,"This is a post hopefully someone going into these classes will find useful. Before I took the analysis series at OSU I was not able to find a post talking about the classes, so now that I have finished them I can shine some light on what they are like. 

Firstly, I took 4547 with Hafuta who had in person lectures with online hw and tests and 4548 with McNeal who was entirely online, no zoom, just uploaded pdfs. 

Before going into details I want to touch on some overall ideas and tips for succeeding in the class. If any of you were like me, you are probably extremely worried about going into analysis. I think stressing over it is certainly bad, but you should also be prepared to try the hardest you ever have in a math course. Analysis is going to challenge you in ways you have not been challenged yet. Calculus, in many ways, is just implementing algorithms after being presented with a problem. Most of you can probably grasp a calculus concept after reading it one time, and master it after a little bit of practice. Analysis will not be the same, it takes an all new way of thinking to approach problems. You will have to get used to the idea of reading the same thing over and over, not getting it, learning how to solve a few problems, slightly getting it, moving on with your partial knowledge until a few days later it will mostly click. I think the majority of people who have made it through analysis will agree that a true battle to be fought through the class is learning not to give up and be demotivated, just keep trying no matter what and you will most likely succeed in the courses. I would also like to say that at this point professors do not seem to care if you are using online resources or any other resource for the homeworks. The important thing is that you are learning the material. Googling is a skill you should of hopefully picked up by now and will certainly be a huge part of your work through analysis. Seeing a solution once can really help you understand theorems. However, you will be confronted with solutions that still don't make sense. This is where the class can really challenge you and you will have to get creative with your ways of making sense of the solution. We used Bartle's book. The textbook will present a theorem and then prove it. Bartle will make some steps seem as if it should be obvious but this is not the case, do not be demotivated by the lack of insight Bartle gives on certain steps in a proof; it is hard. The proofs of theorems is worth reading, but the homeworks are just about implementing theorems so I would say the implementation has more value than the proof when it comes to doing well in the courses (not so for mastery of the topics). McNeal would tell us if he would ask the proof of a specific theorem on the exam. I will now shine some light on the specifics of each course. The grader for both courses was named Elizabeth and everyone felt as if she was very harsh. The hws will take you a long time but are only out of 10 points. She would only pick 2-3 problems to grade so it was very easy to end with a 6/10 on a HW. You must be very sound with your proof language to score high on the hws. 

4547: I personally found myself struggling more in this class than that of 4548 (the content is not easier). At this point your experience with proofs is most likely coming from 3345. This being the case, you will probably begin to struggle a lot with deciding how to approach a problem and it may also be an issue for you on understanding what is being said by the problem. Really the only approach to solving this is what you have been told in the past. Re-reading everything, speaking with classmates, and discussing your problems with the professor or tutor. The class mostly covers set theory (easiest part), absolute values (very easy), sequences (hardest), and series (hardly explore past what you learned in calc 2). 

Hafuta: I should start by saying I stopped attending the in person lectures about halfway through the semester. He would copy exactly what was in the book except he would skip threw it just making it more confusing than the actual book. The HWs were very fair, although everyone had issues with the grader. He gave us one midterm for 48 hours and the final for 24. The midterm was exactly that of the practice and the final was similar but had increasing difficulty in the questions. The questions of the hardest difficulty almost seemed impossible, but this was the case for everyone. As long as you can float around the average scores you will be fine. 

4548: This class made more sense to me. You are now mostly concerned with functions instead of sequences. This being the case, you can use the derivative, IVT, MVT as tools to determine things. This was not the case with 4547. In 4547, if you wanted to show a sequence was increasing, it was really dependent on what the sequence was but it would involve induction or some other method. For me just taking the derivative of a function made things much easier. The proofs of theorems also seemed to flow really nicely. This may of been more of the case because I was only reading the proofs of theorems that McNeal told us to read. The class begins with continuity (easy with Lipshitz Theorem), derivatives (not too bad), integrals (the Riemann sums were hard for me, rest not bad), then you conclude with sequences of function and their summations (these really aren't terrible either once you put them into practice and are also very cool to learn about). 

McNeal: McNeal is aware of the difficulty of analysis and will be friendly with you about discussing its difficulty. I think he can get upset sometimes when people don't answer his ""easy"" questions, but in general he wants to help. The HWs again are pretty fair although one homework may take a day and another may take 4, you still have just one per week. What I liked less about this course was it was 3 midterms an hour each and a final for 100 minutes. I really dislike tests, so having 4 felt like a lot. The tests, however, are not terrible at all. McNeal likes to ask inequality questions that have neat tricks to the solutions like using algebra to see some new function f(x)&gt;0 and once this is true so is the inequality. These problems are not bad by any means. Also, per each test there will be a ""prove x theorem"". You can combat these questions by straight up memorizing the proofs he tells you to know and get some free points on the test. This course felt more like a calculus course but required you to be creative. Never underestimate the value of adding 0 or multiplying by 1 to solve your problem either. 

Final words: Analysis is hard, but by no means impossible. Panicking over it will help you as much as it did me, not at all. Its really best to approach it level headed and work your ass off. I believe in you. If you have any questions feel free to DM me, I may or may not respond. I will be making a post on abstract algebra once I finish those two next. Best of luck.",1620163996,1,0

Rec sports and covid testing,Saw somewhere on here that JO North is gonna still be used as a testing site. Does that mean that ARC will still be used in its place? If so another year of not being able to use the soccer fields? This is getting ridiculous now. Everyone willing to has gotten the vaccine.Autumn would be the 6th semester affected by covid if we count  summer semesters. Not everyone goes out to clubs and parties. Rest of us need Rec Sports man. Open them up already. All the courts the gyms all that. If your still scared of covid after the vaccine and all that just don‚Äôt come. University has all these resources for mental health none of which I see are more effective then letting people meet up and get some exercise. Only thing I liked about this university were the facilities and we can‚Äôt even use them.,1620160602,1,0

We know you have projectors, we've seen you use them for outdoor movies before COVID. Why not use them now? Set up additional seating sections on South Oval, Fisher Quad, and other grassy areas on campus so EVERYONE who wants to can get to experience the candlelight ceremony with other graduates and members of the OSU community. The university doesn't do much for commencement week, but this is such a cool event and feels like a rite of passage into being an alum. It's beyond frustrating that OUAB and the decision makers at OSU didn't seek out every possible path to allowing as many people as possible to share in this experience.

Got an extremely bad grade on a final exam immediately following personal issues with the professor - extremely confused,"I'm piss at summaries.

I took a math class (it being math is important later) this semester, hated the professor, struggled with the material, and barely stayed afloat the whole time, even with tutoring. By the time the final came around, I had a solid C in the class. 

The final exam had more than its share of roadblocks due to a Carmen issue (if you were in the class you know what I mean), which the professor rectified but not after multiple emails, student complaints, and many attempts on his part.

I emailed the head of the department after the final to bring some of my concerns to his attention, including but not limited to what happened on the final exam, as well as issued I'd seen with him over the semester (him verbally berating students during Zoom calls, not showing up to his own office hours with no forewarning, etc.).

The dean's response was to directly forward my email to my professor, with my name and everything, leading to my professor emailing me to say ""hey so-and-so forwarded me your email, sorry that you felt that way, do you want to retake the final today?"" and I declined, because I had three more finals that day and was in the process of moving, preparing for a wedding, etc.

I check my Carmen grades and my grade for the final is a 17%. We submit things through Gradescope, which is where they provide feedback and detailed ""here's where you lost points"" since they don't do that on Carmen. There is nothing on Gradescope - no rubric, no grade, no feedback - nothing that indicates it was even looked at.

Now, I've done pretty bad on exams before, but my exam grades have been on an upward track, I studied for days, I went to tutoring, and even the questions I didn't really know how to answer I provided at least *some* work. I feel like I should have, at least for the *work*, gotten partial credit, because that's how it's worked in the past - if your work looks good, even if you don't get the right answer, you at least get *some* credit.

I emailed the professor expressing my concerns about my grade and that I'd like to see my feedback, but idk if he's going to respond, because he has not responded to my emails before. I'm so, so worried that my email to the dean affected how he graded my final.

\*\*\*I do want to say *I will pass this class with a C* with the final grade I have now. I'm not jaded because I'm going to fail - with the curve, I have a C right now, and that's all I need to pass. I'm fine with that. But a 17% when my last *four exams* have all had passing averages - it just feels off to me. I felt really good about the work I did on the final, so this is devastating.\*\*\*

I just figured even if I could prevent even one other student from following the same mindset they'd be a million times better off.  Go Bucks.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey y'all,

As a graduating senior this semester, I felt like I really had some things to share here before my time is up.  This is mostly because looking back, I was very rarely genuinely happy about being in college, and the things I've learned were not things my parents ever emphasized to me growing up.  So without further ado, let me explain where I'm coming from and how I think my story and experiences will help those going down a similar path.

Anyways, as a kid, my parents always emphasized a few key things to me that actually ended up sticking pretty well:  do well in school, and stay away from drugs.  Simple enough.  For the record, I'm NOT saying that's bad advice; in fact, it's great advice.  As such, I went into my experience here at OSU very focused on my studies.  I did attempt to join a few clubs, so I figured I was doing great!  However, naturally the workload ended up being far more than I could have ever anticipated, and so I unfortunately never found the time for clubs and things like that.  It never occurred to me that going all-in on this advice could be seriously detrimental.

What I know now is that this mindset can also be dangerous.  Let me put this into perspective:  every year except my freshman year, I lived alone.  Why?  You guessed it; easier to get my work done.  I always jumped at the chance to get the big flashy single rooms on campus, and when I moved off campus, I did the same thing.  If you haven't already noticed a trend, let me go further.  I also frequently sacrificed nights of video games if I didn't feel completely caught up and prepared for what was coming up in classes.  I didn't go to campus events (career fairs, etc) because I'd often have to skip a class.  Just to reiterate, this is (for some reason) how I interpreted what I was told, so I kind of just did it thinking I was doing the absolute best thing for me in the long run.

Naturally, I almost never made genuine friends.  Sure, I was great at making friends in the classroom (probably because I was always reliable and would submit high-quality work), but never once did a friendship that began in a class go beyond an academic setting.  For some reason during my junior year, I felt like I could solve my sociability issues by just popping on a dating app, so off to Tinder I went!  I'm a fairly average looking guy, so I figured that plus my personality could result in something.  And... it actually did!  I met a student here, and two weeks later, we met in person and I couldn't have been happier because I felt like I finally had that balanced life of school and personal enjoyment.  We hung out, watched movies, went out for fancy dinners, and interestingly enough, my grades didn't fall at all, so I was genuinely happy.

Let's fast forward to today.  Three weeks ago, that relationship unfortunately came to an end.  I was not expecting it to end so abruptly, but I guess life is full of surprises.  It was then that I realized all I accomplished by dating this person was putting a bandage on a much, much larger problem.  I still didn't have any friends here.  I still honestly kind of just devote every waking moment to school and homework.  I never networked, so despite the grades, I don't have a job lined up.  Weekends roll around, and I sit alone in my room playing the same video game in the evenings while parties literally surround me.

This is getting kind of long, so to bring it back to you guys, I think the main takeaway here is that while focusing on schoolwork is absolutely priority #1, it still \*has\* to be taken in moderation.  I realize this is obvious for most people, but if this story seems to resonate with you even a little bit, let me just tell you this:  If you don't take the initiative and just assume everything will just work out in the end like I did, chances are you're wrong, and you'll graduate from here without any friends, memorable experiences, or a job.  All you'll have to show for your time here is a number on your transcript.",1612144400,240,3

I see emails urging me to fill out the ScholarshipUniverse thing, but idk. Is anyone else just not doing it? It's not like we need to right? I probably sound spoiled and like I have enough money to not worry, and that's definitely not the case, but scholarships always feel like a scam to me, where the work rarely gets a result.",1612141618,12,0

Questions about housing from an incoming freshman,"Hey everyone! I'm super excited to be going to OSU and can't wait for this autumn. I have been looking at all the different residency halls and dorms, but I have a few questions about housing that hopefully you guys could help clear up for me. If you could answer any of these that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

1. When is the housing contract available for me to sign?

2. Do you create roommate groups when signing the housing contract or is there something else I need to do in order to make a group?

3. I am planning on making a roommate group of 3 people with 2 of my friends and I am aware there are very few 3 person dorms and they all are not the best quality, so I was curious if my group could be in a 4 person dorm and have a random 4th person join us or if we need/should get a 4th person instead of a random.

4. Normally lottery numbers for incoming freshman are assigned by the date they payed their acceptance fee, but how would that work for roommate groups if they all get the same lottery number?  Would they get the lottery number of the person who made the group, completely random or something else?

5. Once we are assigned lottery numbers and it is our turn, do we get to pick whichever dorm we want that is not already taken or is our decision limited to only choosing which campus we live in, or which residency hall we live in?",1612096623,0,0

Marked as no-show for MSLC tutoring over the break even though there was no indication that it was still on?,"I'm fully aware that I'm probably in the wrong here but I wanted an outside take on it.

I do tutoring through the MSLC every Tuesday morning around 10am, and every Monday they send me an email with a Zoom link and a reminder that it's tomorrow. 

This Monday, the day before our break, they didn't send me an email or a link, and I have no idea how to get ahold of my tutor (they don't provide me that information, for some reason), and the tutoring website doesn't have any way to get ahold of someone as far as I'm aware.

The lack of communication and the fact that I figured since it was a ""break"" they wouldn't be doing stuff like that made me think that it was canceled for that day. I didn't get an email that day like they usually send if you don't show, so by noon when I didn't get a ""you're a flake"" email, I didn't think anything else of it.

Well I just got an email from a &lt;no-reply&gt; email, so still no way to get ahold of someone, telling me that I was a no-show for Tuesday, and if I do it again they're going to stop letting me do tutoring. I still have no idea how to get ahold of the MSLC, my tutor, or anyone. What should I do?",1614276457,7,0

I don't care anymore.,"I used to be optimistic about the future even when things looked down. I would shrug off if I lost a friend and say I'd find another, I would look at a failed test and tell myself to hunker down to do well on the next, I would see I wasn't excercising and tell myself to pick it up in the future.


But just before Covid I began to not care about the present or the future. My grades started slipping and I shrugged it off because if I failed it's just another thing on the pile. I started to bore or anger my friends and I just didn't care because I'm intent on being alone after graduation. I laughed when I let myself go (not that I was in good shape to begin with) because it was just another thing on the pile. When I would get denied by jobs and internships I would just say, ""I don't blame them"". The one job I had I slacked off on to the point where my boss had to politely ask that I quit. Then Covid hit.


Now I just feel ill all the time, do nothing but sleep all day, don't show up to 90% of classes, fail virtually every test, and rarely care about my own hobbies or social life (again, not that I had much to begin with).


There's no real point to this post, I already know the solution to my problems (work on one thing at a time progressively until I'm back on my feet) but I don't care enough to do it. I'm practically minutes away from graduating and I just keep pushing it further away by failing everything.

"I am pre-cse, and I had a question about math 1151 and Physics 1250.

And I just had 2 questions about it.  (For reference, I am currently taking ap calc AB, but I highly doubt that I will do well that exam.)

The problem is because my high school went online, I haven't been able to learn a lot of the content I wish I could have for Calc AB and Physics 1.

1.) So, In year 1 Autumn, you can see that it has Math 1151 (calc 1), and I learned that this class is a weed-out class. So, since I am going into cse , should I take math 1151 or try my hardest to test out of it by getting a 3+ on my AB calc exam?

2.) I know this question might be better suited for an advisor, but I still have not been connected with one. So I am hoping that the users of r/OSU will be able to help me out. So, I see that you have to take Physics 1250. However, I am currently taking AP Physics 1 (which is like physics 1200)  in high school, and have already taken AP chemistry , and got a 4 (so that is equivalent to chemistry 1210). The pre-req for physics 1250 is, and I quote, ""1 entrance unit of physics or chem"". Would my chemistry score be able to satisfy that or do I have to well on the pysics 1 exam?

I've applied to a few research and development internships at some pharmaceutical companies but I'm realizing that it's probably a dead-end after an interview I had yesterday. 

I know a lot of people find research opportunities through professors and the like but I haven't been able to create any meaningful relationships with any of mine due to everything being over zoom. I haven't had the opportunity to get properly involved at OSU since the pandemic hit right when I started getting comfortable. I've spent hours looking for opportunities but to no avail yet. I put in a lot of work for school (3.9 GPA) and I have potential but it's lack of experience that's killing me. I just think I'm not looking in the right place. Does anyone know where a good place to start is? Or even better, does anyone know of any research opportunities at OSU for students like me?",1614099143,4,0

AU21 Online Asynchronous Class - ENGL 2150 Career Preparation (for All Majors),"ENG 2150: Career (Life) Preparation 
Who are you? What do you want? What might your life look like?

Explore these questions and more in a class featuring a holistic approach to life planning. This course offers students of all majors the opportunity to reflect on their strengths and preferences as they explore and map out post-graduation careers and paths that may complement these. We will examine specific work environments (e.g., corporations and non-profits) as well as graduate or professional school options, and discuss the role that internships, undergraduate research and networking play in career development and advancement. In addition, we will look at how to organize and manage an internship/job search, how to put together strong resumes, cover letters and portfolios, and how to interview well over the phone, via Skype and in person.

This online, asynchronous, three-credit-hour class is offered in the Second Session of the autumn semester‚Äîmid-October through early December. It has no meeting times, so it should be easy to fit into your existing schedule.

Carmen-Compatible Tablets,"Hey.

Can I just go off on the stop lights here for a second?,"It seems like nearly every walk sign I encounter randomly decides if/when it will turn to, ""walk"". For some intersections I just look at the lights for when cars are legally allowed to turn or go because I know if I wait on the walk sign I could be there for an hour.


Speaking of the lights, some of them are ratioed really strangely. For instance, the intersection of Neil and Lane has got one of the longest red lights known to man for the Neil cross. Now, I know Lane has much heavier traffic most times of day, but it's not like the Neil side has no traffic; it's one of the main roads out of campus! You'd think with an intersection that busy they could put a time dependent ratio on there (for instance, I know from anecdotal observation that there are consistent times in the morning where the number of cars at the Neil cross is far higher than those at the Lane cross; why not have those times adjust the wait time ratio accordingly). Also, the turn indicators (for the intersections that have them) seem to be playing the same coin-toss game the walk signs seem to be playing. Sometimes it will indicate that it's turn only, sometimes it will skip the turn only and go straight from red to green.


This all is coming from someone born and raised in New Jersey; practically the Nation's capital in shitty intersections. Don't get me wrong, I've really liked Columbus during my time here, and your pot hole and road rage situations are better than Jersey's, but man, I don't know what happened with the design of the intersection lights.",1621209536,1,0

Anatomy 2300 Unfair Final Exam. Need Help.,"So I am currently in Jennifer Burgoon‚Äôs Anatomy 2300 class and the entire class is basically being screwed over and we don‚Äôt know what to do at this point

To give some background, this is a fully online 4-credit hour anatomy course. There have been issues from the very beginning of the semester with the workload and study time being easily 20-30 hours a week. The lecture videos are equal to typically 8-10 hours per week, which is WAY more time than would be spent in class if we were in person. But, most of us just fought through it and maintained a passing grade so far. 

Now, we are being forced to take a standardized 100 point exam ( that wasn‚Äôt even created by the prof. ) It is also proctored and closed book/notes, when all of our quizzes throughout the semester have been open note/book. The biggest issue with this is that those who took the EXACT same class last semester didn‚Äôt have a final at all, putting them at a HUGE advantage over my class. We have raised our concerns MANY MANY times, sent countless emails and even made a petition that amassed 500+ signatures from those in my class section and all of these things were completely ignored. 

My prof responses were dismissive and rude, and it is very clear that she doesn‚Äôt care about the well being of her students at all. I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. We have reached out to the head of the anatomy department and they have done nothing as well. I feel as if these is really unfair and Prof. Burgoon is a terrible example of OSU. The absolute worst class i‚Äôve ever taken and the worst prof. 

What should I do? Who should I contact? Any tips on getting students voices heard? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",1617936468,1,0

Questions about Public Affairs and Nonprofit Leadership Certificate Program,"Greetings,

I wasn't expecting this, but I got accepted to the Public Affairs and Nonprofit Leadership Certificate Program beginning in May 2021.

I know it's not a long program and it's relatively cheap, but it's something I've wanted to do to help better serve my community and learn new approaches to how I conduct myself professionally. I've worked for a county government in Arizona for almost a decade and I believe the program is online?

This is for an Environmental History paper and my professor encouraged ""crowd-sourcing"" via Reddit, so, uh, here I am. Any stats or stories about OSU recycling (or the lack of it) that you can share, it'd be much appreciated.",1617854487,1,0

Engr 4191 - Is it worth it?,"Accepted a co-op out of state and was recommend to take sign up for this co-op ‚Äúcourse‚Äù. It‚Äôs officially called professional development and will show up on your transcript as a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory.

Got the bill today. The university wants to charge me $300 for a ‚Äúclass‚Äù that has no meeting times. It‚Äôs 0.5 credits which I understand it‚Äôs cost but with a tacked on $100 distance learning fee. I think this is overpriced. 

Personally, I find this hard to believe that I‚Äôll get $300 worth of benefits from it. I‚Äôm looking at dropping it now. I could really put the money toward rent. 

Is there any downsides I‚Äôm not considering?",1617850210,1,0
Reuse high school graduation apparel?,"Is it common to reuse an old graduation gap and gown from highschool for college graduation? I'm not sure how many people actually buy one for high school graduation and end up saving it until college graduation.

Would there realistically be any difference in appearance between an old gown and one from B&amp;N? 

Note: I'm planning to buy my college-specific colored tassel from B&amp;N.",1617849203,1,0

Rant about Chem,"I feel so burnt out and stupid for not doing well in gen chem rn, esp as a premed student. I am doing great in all my other classes but 1220 is kicking my ass. I thought I was going to be struggling with physics this semester but chem is the class that I'm not doing well in. It's not even the content or the assignments, I am just awful at the exam format the chem department chose. I don't understand why they don't let us go back to our questions after we submit them, it just makes it 10x harder because we aren't able to go back to hard questions or the ones where we have to type an answer and do them later. I also don't get why they don't tell us the questions we got wrong so we can review them before the final :/ No matter how much I study I still do awful on the exams and I just don't know what to do at this point. With the last midterm tomorrow I'm just extra stressed now :'))",1617832992,1,0
