pre med/student life at columbia,"hello! i'm really curious about premed at columbia and wanted to ask about both premed and the general experience (sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, lmk if there's somewhere better to put this!!) because I almost nearly have my heart set on ED-ing here, but some things i've heard about premed and stress culture are giving me pause.

1. how is the curriculum? are any of you guys premeds or know premeds who completed their major reqs, med school prereqs, AND core stuff in 4 years? i know that some people have, but how common is it to do so?
2. on that note, what majors are possible to complete? premed definitely limits things, and i am for sure NOT a hardcore stem person (no chem/bio major), so I was thinking public health, sociology, medical humanities (?) etc. if it isn't typically possible to complete med reqs/core/major in 4 years without a core stem major, then I would reconsider my plan to ed. 
   1. as far as minors, I assume I wouldn't need one because the core covers my interests already (humanities, writing, foreign language), but are minors even possible?
3. premedical/prehealth advising... I haven't heard amazing things about it. Would you say there's strong counseling/advising, or at least that the advising didn't *harm* you?
4. can you balance EC's and school? the student organizations here look awesome and I definitely want to get involved. on that note, what are the opportunities outside of school like? anything to be aware of or that's super cool, EC-wise?

more generally, though:

1. school spirit? how much is there? I haven't heard awesome things about it. While I do value a bit of unity, pride, and general happiness (yeah I'm a school spirit sucker sometimes), I don't absolutely need like crazy levels of it. since sports games and things like that aren't common things that draw the student body together... is everyone generally content? how would you rate student body 'closeness'? and what other aspects of student culture and school spirit exist that bring the student body together? I like independence, but I don't want a fully individual experience if that makes sense. 
2. on THAT note‚Äì‚Äìmental health? stress culture? i'm used to high-competition and high-pressure environments, so I'm fine at tolerating this kind of thing, but how is mental health taken care of by admin? stupid wording, but I don't get super 'warm and cuddly' vibes from columbia, and with student strikes happening, etc etc, I'm curious about the stress culture, general closeness of the student body, and attitude of the admin. 
3. is the campus large enough? I can't visit before I apply, unfortunately, even though that is the one thing I think could answer a lot of my questions about environment. I love the fact that NYC is NOT a college town and is lively, but Columbia still has an insular, calm traditional campus. Is this enough of a balance?

Sorry this is so long, and if you take the time to answer even one of these, thank you!!!",1614913456,12,0

[BREAKING] Ivy Elkins announces she has finally demystified the PhD,"Wed, Feb 3 ‚Äî SEAS Students across campus let out a collective sigh of relief late last Tuesday as Ivy Elkins announced that, after nearly a decade of research, she had finally demystified the PhD. 

Chad, CC ‚Äô24, who hopes to work at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, or maybe Google one day, said that his unique aspirations make this news mostly irrelevant. ‚ÄúA what?‚Äù he asked, before opening gmail to update his spam filters. Chad currently has a B in Data Structures and could not be reached for further comment.

Speaking with reporters at a press conference on the condition of anonymity, Elkins noted that their work is far from over ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at you, dissertation,‚Äù she exclaimed around halfway through, to audible moans. When asked about fringe topics, such as how students are supposed to graduate if they can‚Äôt even get off waitlists, and how the university plans to keep 5,000 individuals safe in the middle of a pandemic, Elkins explained that she was ""not at liberty to demystify those,"" and referred people back to Bollinger's latest word salad.

Speaking to our reporters later in the evening, Lucas, SEAS '23, explained that he was overjoyed at the news. ""Every time I would get those emails I would wonder, has the PhD been demystified yet? I was starting to get worried. This is f*king huge"". 

A second student, William Cortez, noted the very personal effect this has had on his life. ""I always thought I wanted to study theater, become an actor, and follow my dreams, but after the forty fifth 'Happening now!!!' follow-up email I decided to get a PhD in Combinatorial Differential Geometry. I hope more students can see the light"".",1612377521,228,6

Why are GS students at Columbia always made to feel like they are a problem through presenting them with problems?,"So I have to write a cordial letter to my French teacher explaining that no, I do not party on the weekends, in fact, as a cook, I have never had a Saturday/Sunday off in my working life; I am 30.

I work a very stressful job that typically involves ten or twelve hr shifts. I have pursued alternative avenues of work, after that was suggested multiple times. 1. pushing a problem onto me.

I am going to go into specifics apart from that.

&amp;#x200B;

But when I started looking at classes last semester at GS, I saw this very strange thing.

Most classes are one or two hrs three or four times a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that this is fine, I'll do the homework before everyone else.

But now I'm finding teachers expect us to be studying over the weekend. I know that's fair, but I believe it surfaces this reality that GS students are kind of jamf%$$ed into the schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to now each week write a letter explaining my circumstances, and I feel almost like a criminal having to explain myself.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been making me very depressed this semester, as I finished my assignment due on Thursday for UW on Tuesday, but I still have hw and a quiz for French on Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand why the onus is put on me to explain this, when their should be college-wide rhetoric that prefaces GS students and the challenges they face. I shouldn't be made to feel like an impostor by needing to ask for concessions at the outset.

&amp;#x200B;

The depression is getting worse as I care about my grades but I'm beginning to realize I am not in control. I do not have time to study sufficiently. I used to study biology notes at 3am on the train back in flashcards, but I am finding that harder to do. 

So come each successive Monday I will do bad on my quizzes as I will have had only a half a day to study, and my compositions will be late.

&amp;#x200B;

My teachers will continue to complain that my essays seem unpolished or rushed.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh well. It's time to start accepting the people that do well are the ones whose parents pay for their room and board, their clothing, their food, their tutors: these people will do better than me, and there is nothing in my power to go against that.

Re. It's Katznelson's Letter,"Is it normal for an institution being struck against to write letters like this? Just to focus on the tone: he is clearly on the defensive, with phrases like ""despite literally hundreds of hours of negotiation"" and ""we reached the agreement, a very good agreement."" These seem innocuous enough, but with the full context of the letter it is clear there's emotion behind each phrase which just strikes me as needlessly sensitive for such a large institution in such an asymmetric position; I can't think of a reason for this behavior other than to obfuscate with rhetorical hysterics the true nature of what's going on with the graduate students. 

What's more troubling, I've read Ira's scholarship, and it's great: highly sensitive, nuanced, empathetic, and intelligent. He's certainly in an awkward position. But that makes his defensive tone all the more startling. He must be being asked to adopt it? That dissonance is hard to reconcile.

I was recently accepted into the MPA in Environmental Science and Policy at SIPA. I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs anyone here who can comment on the program.

"Wow the NYC housing market really has a way of sobering you up from the ""I just got into Columbia"" euphoria-- please help","I'm a 1st year GS student attending school remotely, and as more pharmaceutical companies are rolling out covid vaccines, I'm thinking that it's probably time I look into housing. I figure I won't be able to attend remotely forever, and I don't want to. I can't wait to be on a real campus.  


I know Columbia one of the best universities in the world, and I actually love a lot of things about how the curriculum is structured. I'm well aware of the opportunity that I have by being able to pursue higher education at Columbia. But looking at the housing market in NYC is disheartening.  


GS housing seems like a gamble at best, and unless I'm missing something, living anywhere near campus means living with a roommate (or 2 or 3). I'm not entirely opposed to living with a roommate, but I'm in my early 30s so I'd rather live in a 1 bedroom if I can.

Switching majors junior year?,"Hello, I'd love to hear some insights from people who had similar thoughts or experiences on the matter.

I'm doing okay in the Core classes but unfortunately, I'm not doing too well in my major classes and I wouldn't be surprised if I get a failing grade this semester. The thing is, I'm 1.5 years deep into the major and I only have a few semesters left until I graduate, so I'm not sure if it's feasible to switch majors at this point. I'm trying my hardest to learn the concepts on Youtube and other resources, which I do understand, but I still feel lost when it comes to homework/tests because I think they go way more in-depth and because the tests or homework are personalized, you won't find solutions online since they are uniquely made by the professor/department so it's hard to know whether I'm doing things right.

Could I get rescinded over this?,"I dropped a semester-long discrete math class for a comp sci class during my high school's drop/add period in October. Both classes are the same level of rigor/GPA weight/all that. I made the change simply because the comp sci class was what I had originally wanted, but it had been full when we first requested classes over the summer. In the ""senior year courses"" section of the common app, however, I put down my original schedule, since I didn't know if my drop/add requests would be accepted at the time (eventually the changes were made to my schedule mid-November.) Newly admitted students to Columbia are required to inform Jess Lee (director of selection and outreach) of any changes made to the schedule, so I sent her an email explaining everything and she responds back with ""As you know, changes in a student's schedule require approval and are only approved in extenuating circumstances."" She then asks me if the discrete math class I dropped is no longer offered at my school. 

What should I do? I sent a pretty lengthy email and she responds with just two sentences, basically ignoring everything I said, and it feels mildly threatening. I mean, my whole point was that I *didn't* know that this would be a stipulation once you got in. I can't exactly change my schedule back now. I wouldn't get rescinded over this, would I? I get good grades and I'm a fairly good student. I honestly didn't know this would be an issue. 

Sorry to be a bother, but I'm panicking a little bit. If anyone's been in this situation and knows what to do--I'd really appreciate some guidance. Thank you!",1611004949,1,0

"Professor acknowledged a cheating problem ""in the department."" Meanwhile, my grades have not been so good. Will I get a free pass?"," 

Throwaway account as I don't want to reveal any PII. Hi everyone, I am a 2nd semester Master student in SEAS. My entire program is 3 semesters long. I did not pass one course in my first semester, and now I am scared I might not pass another course this semester. Not making any excuses but a combination of my potential lack of preparedness combined with the drudgery of online learning has dented my academic performance significantly. I used to be the one student who went to (physical) office hours at every chance, and shot the shit with professors. The dynamics are all different now. It was my dream to come to Columbia (relocated from far away) and now it's become my nightmare.

The program told me as long as I stay above a certain GPA, I should be fine, and I think this will be attainable. Even if I don't pass a 2nd course. On the other hand, my high GPA hopes are out the window and I haven't found any internships. Those are the least of my worries at this point. 

I just want to survive the program and graduate. 

BUT, a deep dark corner of my mind always entertains the possibility that I will do abysmally, get very poor grades, and get kicked out. I am 33 years old (a senior citizen by class standards) and my wife might be pregnant, so I have a lot of anxiety some days, can't sleep, can't focus, and it seems like I'm going in a downward spiral of negative thoughts. This whole ordeal has given me TWO white hairs in my otherwise noir head and has been a thorn in my side constantly. On top of it, I recently experienced a tragedy in my personal life (have proof). Hence my sharing my  deepest intimate details with Reddit.

Curve ball. Cue one day last week where, for the first time, one of my professors has acknowledged cheating ""in the department."" The only other time any professor acknowledged that anything whatsoever was ""off"" about online learning and fall A/B was when another professor last semester fleetingly said ""things happened in fall A/B which we should've had more foresight about."" This is something we all thought about since online learning commenced, but the professor said it. On Zoom. Recorded.

Now it's real. My professor said that people have been caught cheating in the context of warning \*US\* not to cheat on our unproctored midterms. He asked us to turn our cameras on, but with about only 1 of every 4 students having an avatar picture on their Zoom profile, less than 50% of students even showing up to class twice a week, and with literally 2 students actually turning on their cameras regularly, how is there even any accountability? Who are these drones of people showing up for the midterm who I've never even seen before? 

Studies show that the higher the education, the more at stake, and the more likely cheating occurs. Our professor(s) have literally said ""we trust you."" 

Finally, my question. In my defense, if I fail to keep up my standards in the school and perform poorly, could I possibly use the cheating admission as a counterargument to prop up my own standing and vouch for my continuation in the program? 

My main rhetorical question is: How do I know if, had people not cheated and raised up the average, that my scores wouldn't have constituted passing grades? I think this is a valid question. Back in undergrad, seeing a 50-70% average on engineering midterms was totally normal. This time around, we literally saw 80-90% on midterms. WTF?

What does everyone see coming out of all this, in my situation, and in general? Will Columbia be lenient on the cursed class of 2021? Thanks for reading.",1616896887,1,0

"Better to withdraw, or gamble and risk failing the class?","Sad to say but I'm not doing well in one of my major classes. I'm failing everything from homework to midterms.

They say it's hard to fail at Columbia, but I'm sure I'm at the bottom of the class. I heard raw scores don't matter but given how I'm only averaging 50% in my homework and *seriously* bad on the midterms, I doubt the curve could even save me. I've already emailed the professor and the head TA to talk about my current standing and asking for advice but I have yet to heard back.

Does anyone have any experience with withdrawing? My advisor told me I have until the 15th to decide. I've accepted that I'll be losing time and money by retaking the class next sem, but I just realized it might seriously throw me off sequence, and that my future classes will need replanning.",1616890879,1,0

Masters in economics: Columbia versus NYU,"
Hi everyone! I‚Äôm a senior in undergrad and have recently been accepted to NYU and Columbia‚Äôs masters programs for economics. Everything I find has them ranked somewhat the same and it looks like the coursework is very similar. 
I am drawn to NYU because of the neighborhood but my mom claims this is not a good reason to go there. I just love nyc and know the area pretty well so it draws me in mire than the area of Columbia. I am unsure of what I want to do after getting my degree but am considering staying in academia and maybe pursuing a phd. I‚Äôm also really interested in game theory and econometrics specifically. (I am a double major in Econ and math so I‚Äôm not opposed to lots of math). 
Additionally, money should not be much of a problem, not that it matters cuz these are both so expensive. 
Does anyone have any experience with one or the other? Are professors at one school more prestigious than the other? I know Columbia has the Ivy name, but how much is this worth/is it worth it?

Columbia vs. NYU?,"The title may seem like a WTF question, but hear me out. I am aware that there may be biases, hence why I'm asking this question in both subreddits.

I was admitted to Columbia College (through QuestBridge) and NYU CAS to study (pure) math. I am a commuter which means that my financial aid is pretty much covered for Columbia, with a potential $2k in refund a year. However, NYU would give me about $10-12k in refund a year because I got a big scholarship. Both are refunds not including work-study or loans. Both schools are obviously excellent for math and I don't know which to choose.

The distance to both is quite long. NYU is about an hour and 10-15 minutes away whereas Columbia is an hour and 25-30 minutes away. Yes, I understand this may be impractical but these two schools are pretty much my only options.

Scared to commit,"I was accepted into the class of 2025 and so far Columbia is my first choice but the more I think about committing, the more I doubt my abilities and my ability to succeed in an Ivy League environment. My high school was very easy for me: not competitive at all, tight-knit community with teachers and faculty, and no honors or AP courses available. I was able to get through all of high school putting in only a little effort and still getting good grades. I know I have a good work ethic but I'm scared that my lack of experience with a competitive environment and with heavy coursework is going to make Columbia extremely difficult for me. 

Anyone have any words of wisdom or advice as to how to get over this fear and what I can expect going into Columbia?",1617903574,1,0

MSW: Columbia or NYU,"Hello!

I am hoping to complete my MSW to become a child/adolescent therapist, and I have applied to only a few schools.  CSSW is the only one that I haven't heard back from yet, but I should be hearing within the next week (hopefully).

I have already been accepted to NYU (both Silver and Steinhardt).  By the time I hear back from Columbia, I will have to make a very quick decision, as the NYU deadlines are right around the corner.

was just admitted to CC 2025! idk if i should commit!!!,"hello everyone! i'm an international student who was just accepted to Columbia College and i'm feeling super thrilled to have this opportunity. however, i'm having a bit of trouble trying to figure out whether i should commit to Columbia or not. frankly, i feel very anxious about coming and not doing well academically, not making great relationships, etc. though i also know that these are common fears of incoming freshmen anywhere. 

i've also seen some tweets/posts by current students about their poor mental health and not feeling happy at Columbia. i'm just afraid of making the wrong decision after making a big move to NYC. 

i would appreciate all thoughts and opinions concerning this! for some context: i'm a prospective Middle Eastern Studies/Creative Writing major (and Columbia's departments for both of those areas are incredible) and i'm hoping to later on go to a great grad school + explore careers in education, publishing, and writing. i know Columbia is a great opportunity and i'm not sure if my anxieties are worth paying attention to.

Columbia vs MIT for CS (please read before commenting),"I‚Äôm very lucky to be admitted to both of these schools, but this is a very hard choice for me. Columbia has been my dream school since middle school, but after an MIT summer program, I switched over to MIT. I applied EA and was admitted, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll attend. I live with a single mother and my little sis is going off to a private boarding school(same program i did). I don‚Äôt want my mom to be by herself so I applied to Princeton and Columbia on a whim so I could stay close by. I was admitted to both but I like Columbia way more. 

I‚Äôll be blunt, I want to achieve the greatest financial success for my family since we are low income(20k a year) and in extreme debt. The main thing pulling me to Columbia is the fact that it‚Äôs so close to home and I‚Äôm able to stay by my mom while my sister goes off to boarding school.

CS MAJOR ADVICE,"Hello! I just found out that I got accepted into Columbia University's class of 2025 as a CS major. I didn't think I would get in and kind of worked hard on kissing up to my second choice school (NJIT) so that it would be an easy transition for me if I were to go there. Now that I could possibly go to Columbia, I have a couple of questions and it would be great if anyone could answer them! 

1.) I'm currently dually enrolled at NJIT and I was wondering if Columbia accepts dual enrollment credits. I took and passed Calc I and I'm currently taking CS100 AKA an intro to python class. 

2.) How much do students typically pay for tuition including the financial aid?

3.) As a CS major, what computer should I get? Windows or Mac?

4.) Is it easy to receive mentorship? At NJIT, I was accepted into EOP and they have a wide connection amongst students, mentors, and job recruiters. Does Columbia have the same type of connections?

5.) How are the dorms at this school?

6.) Would it be possible for me to study abroad as a CS major?

Rescinding offers for internationals (IB curriculum),"All past/present Columbia undergraduate students,

Hi I'm a senior in high school, and I just got into Columbia recently! As a background, I am a high school student living in the Middle East and I attend an IB curriculum school (in a region where IB exams are not cancelled and do not seem like they will be anytime soon). Obviously I was ecstatic when I received my admission letter as I am sure all of you were too - I actually jumped up so high in excitement, I hit my head on a fan :).

But as the initial excitement is wearing away, I am unbelievably, absolutely, completely scared to my bones about my offer being rescinded. As I said, I attend a private IB school and I have a predicted grade of 44/45. FYI international schools' IB scores usually higher than US schools as for international schools, the IB curriculum is the graduating exam and so everything you do for 4 years is essentially just geared toward that (i.e. I won't receive a diploma like from my high school, it will be from the IB board). 

Due to online school, multiple health issues that I contracted, friends/family getting corona, I am positively sure I that I would score approximately only 38-41 in the actual IB exams. So, that's a 3-6 point drop. But I will say once again, this isn't a case of senioritis. I have been working harder than I ever worked in my life, but I had to switch to online school due to minor health complications while everyone was in person and help my friends/family as they got corona, and just yeah this year has not been easy.

And looking online, apparently Columbia sends warning letters when you even receive Bs. Given the whole corona thing, I think Columbia may be a bit more lenient, but I'm not sure if they'll even accept a score of 38-41 in the IB after someone received 44 predicted. So obviously, I'm scared out of my wits. Can someone please tell me when Columbia usually rescinds offers for IB students? And would that change due to corona and all?

&amp;#x200B;

Please, any and all help is GREATLY GREATLY appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

FYI, a bit dark, but my mom was on the verge of suicide before this, and I'm not even exaggerating here, but my Columbia acceptance has stopped her. So if I get rescinded, it's really not gonna be fun to watch how things unfold.",1617779754,1,0

From what I understand, I can study *anything* at Columbia like a normal student, while getting instrument lessons at Julliard for 3 years. Then I have the option of doing MM and BA. 

I just wanted to clarify that I'm not restricted to a BA at Columbia in this program: some sources say yes but others say I can study anything. I would be interested in doing something like mathematics/science at Columbia and simultaneously having lessons at Julliard - is this allowed?

[BREAKING] Columbia to offer interim housing this week for the period between Wednesday and Friday,"In a highly generous (and unexpected) move, Columbia has agreed to provide interim housing to students this week in the period between Wednesday and Friday. Many students have complained that this is called ‚ÄúThursday‚Äù and was already included the contracts we signed eight months ago; however, Bollinger reassured the community in a press release on Tuesday that the decision makes a lot of $ense when you think about it. 

If their late-April test run is successful, the university plans to expand interim housing to include even more fringe dates, such as the ineffable, completely unmanageable period between Sunday and Tuesday, as well as the time between when you take a shit and flush the toilet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about accessibility‚Äù explained Bollinger, as he signed off on the $300 nonrefundable interim housing fee from his townhouse in upper Manhattan.

Students who do not register for interim housing will be expected check out and then check back in 30 seconds later, before completing 53 covid gateway tests and filling out 518 travel forms. They will also be placed on conditional probation. As a condition of their probation, students must register for interim housing.

Good luck ducking under now! 

Super-spreaders everywhere were in shambles Thursday morning as a Columbia unveiled an all-new compact update that‚Äôs sure to stop COVID this time. 

According to the updated website, 'students who attempt to get in and out of the dining hall quickly to minimize time spent indoors where COVID spreads easily will now receive an educational 300 volt shock.

Daniel Gold, one of the lead architects behind this system, explained that although the university considered giving vaccinations to every student for free and providing masks at entryways, they wanted to address this problem at its core. ‚ÄúI think this does that.‚Äù

Now, what worries me is that I've seen a damn plethora of people here on reddit and other websites just saying how incredibly hard SEAS can be. How little free time they have for other classes besides engineering requirements and how little free time they have in general.

If anyone from SEAS or specifically from ME (or even from CC idc) can give me absolutely any advice I'd great greatly appreciate it.

Bollinger Email: Statement on the Verdict of the Derek Chauvin Trial," Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:  


Having devoted much of my professional life to the law, and to the ideal of the rule of law, I find the verdict in the killing of George Floyd by police officer Derek Chauvin to be both heartening and depressing. Justice has been met in this case, but it cannot erase the decades and centuries of injustices to Black people. Our collective awareness of this harsh and continuing reality seems‚Äîsadly and shockingly‚Äîto ebb and flow. If we learned anything from the Civil Rights Movement centered around the Supreme Court‚Äôs unanimous decision in *Brown v. Board of Education*, it is that only persistent and painstaking efforts will bring true and comprehensive justice. I have waited for legal judgments before, but none has been more important than this one today, in a state court in Minnesota, to recommitting the society to removing the practices of invidious discrimination against Black Americans.¬†

Swarthmore vs. Columbia,"Hello Columbians,

I was recently admitted to Columbia College (RD), and I've narrowed down my choices to Columbia and Swarthmore. I am immensely greatly for these opportunities, but I've been having a tough time trying to determine what school would be best for me. I know these are VERY different schools, but May 1st isn't going to arrive any later, so I was hoping to share my pro/cons list, see what current students think, and ask a few specific questions at the end of this long post.

Just for some background, I‚Äôm a prospective history or philosophy major, but there‚Äôs a chance that this direction will change, so nothing is set in stone.

**Swarthmore**

Pros

* Intimate class sizes
* Frequent professor contact
* Close to Philadelphia
* P/F first semester + 4 P/F classes later on. Great for adjustment
* Close to home
* Student culture seems friendly and collaborative (but very stressed). I would probably feel more ""comfortable"" here

Cons

* VERY intense academics. My mental health will probably suffer, just as it will with any of these top colleges.
* Allergies...
* Much less name recognition for getting jobs out of college. Career services absolutely suck, apparently. This school is designed for prospective graduates, and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm totally set on graduate school, though there is a solid chance that I‚Äôll eventually go to graduate school sometime in my life.
* If I end up not fitting in with the kids, I'll have less opportunities to make new friends

**Columbia**

Pros

* The location is phenomenal
* An immense amount of resources and unparalleled opportunities. Probably the best job prospects of all three choices right out of college
* Small classes for core curriculum classes
* High chance for a single dorm freshman year
* Prestige :I
* The Core really excites me and I think it‚Äôs a great vehicle for creating a more cohesive community in a place of little cohesion
* 4 P/F classes will be helpful

Cons

* I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll become lonely in such a large school and I don‚Äôt want to seep through the cracks. A more supportive community will probably be best for my mental health, though not as fruitful for my general growth/personal development
* Huge classes for introductory and STEM courses. TAs will be very frequent
* With 20,000+ graduates, professors care about research/graduates first and undergraduates second, so professor contact will be infrequent and I fear they may be more unapproachable than the professors at a small liberal arts college.
* Seems like a pressure-cooker environment that isn‚Äôt very friendly. Academics will be tough like Swarthmore, though it doesn‚Äôt seem as collaborative

**General Questions about Columbia**

* The intensity of both these schools just seems abstract to me, and I don‚Äôt think I can really comprehend just what I‚Äôm getting myself into. Maybe I‚Äôm reading the wrong comments, but is it true that you‚Äôll need to read about 100 pages every day of the week to keep up in a single class? I guess a better question would be whether I should let the intensity of these schools deter me from enrolling. Any thoughts on the stress culture, workload, or etc. are welcome.
* I know this community will probably have bias toward Columbia and won‚Äôt really have sufficient information to answer this question, but is the LAC experience overidealized? Sure, the class sizes are small and you‚Äôll get more professor contact, but to what extent is that really going to affect your educational experience?
* How isolating can the campus feel if you don‚Äôt make friends? How difficult is it to make friends? I understand this may vary, but I just wanted to hear some individual perspectives
* Does the fact that Columbia is primarily a graduate research institution affect the quality of your education? How often do you wish you could have more contact with your professors?
* Does a college's ""fit"" need to be the most important factor you consider in a college?

As a closing note, I want to bring up something Professor Gareth Williams told admitted Columbia students earlier today that really resonated with me. He said something along the lines of, ‚Äúit would be a disappointment if my undergraduate experience was a reaffirmation of the person I was when I entered college. I want to be stretched and become someone who I am not.‚Äù Swarthmore and Columbia will both certainly stretch me academically, but I think Columbia provides more potential in terms of personal growth. Yet, Columbia is a school where you only get out as much as you put in, and I fear that I'm severely overestimating my abilities to act on such opportunities.",1618883774,1,0
Swarthmore vs. Columbia,"Hello Columbians,

I was recently admitted to Columbia College (RD), and I've narrowed down my choices to Columbia and Swarthmore. I am immensely greatly for these opportunities, but I've been having a tough time trying to determine what school would be best for me. I know these are VERY different schools, but May 1st isn't going to arrive any later, so I was hoping to share my pro/cons list, see what current students think, and ask a few specific questions at the end of this long post. 

 Just for some background, I‚Äôm a prospective history or philosophy major, but there‚Äôs a chance that this direction will change, so nothing is set in stone.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Swarthmore**

Pros

* Intimate class sizes
* Frequent professor contact
* Close to Philadelphia
* P/F first semester + 4 P/F classes later on. Great for adjustment
* Close to home
* Student culture seems friendly and collaborative (but very stressed). I would probably feel more ""comfortable"" here

Cons

* VERY intense academics. My mental health will probably suffer, just as it will with any of these top colleges.
* Allergies...
* Much less name recognition for getting jobs out of college. Career services absolutely suck, apparently. This school is designed for prospective graduates, and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm totally set on graduate school, though there is a solid chance that I‚Äôll eventually go to graduate school sometime in my life.
* If I end up not fitting in with the kids, I'll have less opportunities to make new friends

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Columbia**

Pros

* The location is phenomenal
* An immense amount of resources and unparalleled opportunities. Probably the best job prospects of all three choices right out of college
* Small classes for core curriculum classes
* High chance for a single dorm freshman year
* Prestige :I
* The Core really excites me and I think it‚Äôs a great vehicle for creating a more cohesive community in a place of little cohesion

Summer Internship," I'm honestly so lost on how to get internships. I'm Columbia '25, majoring in cs with a apma minor. When I got in, I was happy but now I'm just so fucking stressed. I don't know what I'm supposed to this summer. I tried finding internships the past few months but didn't even receive 1 interview, forget about offers.

So instead I managed to find some informal research w a prof, but I don't know how that will turn out/if it will even be resume worthy. A lot of people have been saying I need to make a project, but I really fucking hate making independent projects. I'd rather be in a structured program like research/internship or be studying coursework. But it seems like its not possible to get an internship without a project, so it's something I'm gonna have to do.

But the main issue is wtf I'm supposed to do for summer 2022. Applications for tech stuff come out in August right? How do I even have a chance of getting in. My resume is so garbage right now. I couldnt even make USAMO (fucking 3 points off). My only work experience is teaching middle schoolers at a learning center. Like how the fuck is anyone gonna hire me off this?

But tech isn't what I want to do long term. Its just for 2022. Eventually, I want to be a quant trader at Jane Street/Citadel/Two Sigma etc. But, I know its impossible for freshman, so thats why I desperately need a tech internship freshman summer. Sophomore summer, I think it's at least *theoretically* possible to get into one of the quant firms, but still hard, so I'm fine with doing tech that summer if necessary. But junior year I definitely need to break into a top quant firm otherwise I don't know how I'm supposed to live with myself.

But anyway, that quant stuff is a little ways away. I won't have to worry about applying for at least a year. But tech, tech is soon. Like *very* soon. Anyone have any tips on how I can secure one given my background thus far?",1618871967,1,0

We will provide religious and medical exemptions, as we do for the influenza and measles vaccines, in accordance with New York State public health laws.

&gt; The vaccine mandate for students will be integrated into our Columbia Community Health Compact, an agreement all students are required to sign in order to access campus facilities.

Re-Using Letters of Recommendation in Re-Application?,"Apologies in advance if this is not the correct sub for this.

I remember reading for a different school at Columbia (can't remember which one) that the recommendation letters are valid for a year after they're received and can be used for a re-application as long as it's within that one year (I assume they remain in the system?).

on the ‚Äòdifficulty‚Äô of GS vs CC admissions,"Something I‚Äôve seen discussed quite a bit recently is the difficulty of GS vs CC admissions, and I feel like this is worth clarifying:

Indisputably, the academic stats of the average GS admit are lower than those of the average CC admit (although this could partially be attributed to the size of the respective applicant pools). 

However, GS serves an entirely different student body. If the only significant difference between GS and CC was that GS is easier to get into and ‚Äúa backdoor into Columbia,‚Äù GS would be filled with 18-year-olds fresh out of high school. It‚Äôs true that based on academic stats, many GS students ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt have been accepted out of High School,‚Äù but GS doesn‚Äôt exist to serve students coming from high school- *serving nontraditional students is the main point of the school‚Äôs existence*. (And as for GPAs once at Columbia, the school averages can speak for themselves.)



p.s.

Petition for A GS Moderator,"There's been a noticeable influx of anti-GS trolls recently, and some of the comments are still dispersed on the sub, despite being reported days ago. I'd like to request that the r/Columbia mods consider adding a GS moderator since: 

1) Several of the current mods on this forum are inactive/unresponsive 

and 

2) GS accounts for a sizeable portion of Columbia's student body as well as a pretty substantial percentage of active users on this sub. 

Normally it wouldn't be a big deal if a few people make offhanded comments, since the perpetrators of these falsities are clearly out of touch with reality. However, the fact that they've been able openly disseminate blatantly fictitious assertions about GS (on top of their general contempt for the GS student body) is problematic because it can deter prospective GS students from embarking on a highly rewarding, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 

I hesitate to go into further detail about my uniquely personal experiences as a  GS student due to the desire to maintain a semblance of anonymity; however, I will say that as someone who transferred from one of Columbia's peer institutions, I have zero regrets transferring to GS rather than electing to return to my previous institution or transfer to other programs I was accepted to. This is my first year as a GS student, and I've already been accepted into two nationally competitive STEM program opportunities that I hope will open even more doors in the future. 

Is GS perfect? No - the financial aid isn't great, which is my biggest gripe with the program. However, that's something that students and the administration are looking to change, and the benefits thus far have outweighed the cons for me personally.

2. Does Columbia focus more on graduate students?
3. What has your experience been like as an engineering student at Columbia? Is there anything you wish you knew before attending? Do you regret your choice?

5. What resources does Columbia provide to help students find internships and jobs?

1. **What does a 12-point semester of grad-level CS courses feel like in terms of difficulty?** Seems a little intense, especially given the caliber of students. (The MS in CS portion of the program requires 30 points to be taken over a 3-semester period, which students typically break up into 4 classes / 4 classes / 2 classes.)
2. To complete the program, I'd have to take 45 points' worth classes over six consecutive terms: F21/SP22/SU22/F22/SP23/SU23. **Given your experience with taking courses at this school (and they don't have to be CS-related), how does this sound to you?** My primary concerns are maintaining mental health and preventing burnout.
3. **What is your experience with CS professors here?** Do you like them?

I'm deciding between Columbia's and USC's MS CS programs, and my fear of burnout at Columbia is what's making me lean toward USC at the moment. Any and all advice would be awesome! Thanks for your time :)",1620016288,1,0

Does anybody know anything about Columbia NY/Paris Porgram and if its worth it? Especially for a student at a Liberal Arts college thinking about doing this.,"The Shape of Two Cities: New York/Paris Program is for undergraduate students and recent graduates from colleges and universities around the country. The program‚Äôs goals are to introduce the fields of architecture, planning and preservation; encourage their exploration in the contexts of history, theory and practice; and identify and analyze their interrelationships, especially in regard to the making of cities. The in-depth course of study is suited to students without previous academic experience in design who are interested in architecture, planning or preservation as a career, students in the liberal arts who are interested in approaching urban and historical issues from an architectural and urban planning perspective, and students with previous design experience who would like to develop additional studio skills in preparation for application to graduate school.

Directed by the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation of 
Columbia University, the program offers a two-semester cirriculum whose
intention is to immerse participants in the rich physical and intellectual urban 
environments of New York and Paris. Instruction draws on the resources of 
Columbia University and its faculty and the architectural communities of 
New York and Paris.

which internship do I go forward with?,"Hey friends, 

I am so lucky to have a few options for the summer, and would like some advice on which of the two internships I‚Äôve narrowed down to to go forward with. 

To provide some background, I‚Äôm a chemistry undergraduate (class of 2022) who was recently accepted into a 4+1 express masters chemical engineering program (originally planned to start fall 2022) at Columbia university. However, I‚Äôm changing that to a 3+1 more or less. I‚Äôm going into my fourth undergraduate year but because I‚Äôve completed all my requirements, I‚Äôve started my masters requirements with the hopes of using my undergrad financial aid to complete my masters during my fourth undergraduate year. 

Just yesterday morning, I was offered a business intelligence internship with a fertility benefits management company. As part of this role, I would get the opportunity to learn and work with SQL, Python, and dashboarding tools such as Cognos, and Power BI for data analysis. I was told that the pay would be $40/hr bc I‚Äôm a masters student, but was later told that the executives decided to go with the undergraduate pay of $20/hr for all interns. That was a bummer... I‚Äôd have the option to work remotely or in-person. I plan on working in industry post-graduation and because my resume is currently severely lacking in professional experience, I think I‚Äôd gain a lot out of this internship. 

With that being said, I also have the opportunity to intern with a mass transfer systems company. To my understanding, my main role would consist of fact-checking technical information on their new website. Although I‚Äôm not particularly excited about separations processes ‚Äî not yet, at least‚Äî I like that it‚Äôs very chemEng related, local to my hometown, and I‚Äôd probably get to learn and work with various different projects if I asked. This would also be a great opportunity for me to see what a purely chemEng role looks like, and again help me build my resume. 

I‚Äôm currently leaning towards the first option bc it would be unlike any experience I‚Äôve had.

Incoming Freshman: SEAS to CC Economics,"Hey everyone, I recently committed to Columbia and am a prospective undergraduate Operations Research major at SEAS. At the time of application, I was set on pursuing Quant Finance after college, but my interests have shifted greatly during my senior year, with my interests now leaning towards the more social / fast-paced and less technical jobs on Wall Street (e.g. PE, VC).

Thus, I'm considering switching from Operations Research to Economics or Financial Economics. Another reason for this move is that I'm worried about the difficulty of the OR major and SEAS in general (I've never been a fan of physics or chemistry and would like more flexibility to pursue electives, as well as time to network and pursue internships during the school year).

With that said, is it possible to switch from SEAS to CC before starting my first semester? and if not, could I switch before my second semester? I'd appreciate any help! Thanks!",1619820806,1,0

I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this,"But try watching your lecture recordings at 1.5 speed. 

I started here during the spring semester of 2020. While we were in person I had no problem focusing on my lectures and keeping up with everything. A year later, I‚Äôm burnt the fuck out. I cannot focus on my lectures at all. My apartment is not conducive to learning. I‚Äôve been trying my best to attend every lecture live, but missed one this week. When I was watching the recording I tried to speed it up and holy shit. I can actually focus on this, I can pay attention again. The slow drawn out lecturing is great for me in person when I can sit and focus, but inside my apartment my brain is smooth. I need the speed. 

In addition to being able to focus, I give myself more time back. I can do this whenever, and with it being sped up I get through it quicker. I am sure people are already doing this, but consider giving it a shot. If you‚Äôre too straight edge to skip class like I have been for the past year just try rewatching some of your lectures at max speed that you had trouble following.

Summer Before Freshman Year," Hey guys, do you have any tips on how to make the best use of the summer before college? I know that it's a good time to relax and have fun, and while I will do that, I can't do it that much because I get depressed if I'm wasting my time.

I've been thinking internship or research is the way to go. But the former seems almost impossible. I basically first applied to places online even though I met none of the requirements, and never got a response back. I realized that wasn't working, so resorted to cold emailing random companies near me, both big and small. I did this by:

1. finding a company near me
2. looking on linkedin to find an employee who works for them, preferably one part of talent aquisition
3. determining the company's email format using rocketreach
4. Emailing that employee

This was definitely better than applying online, as I at least got a response back a good amount of the time (around 20% of the time). But, they basically all just said ""you're too young"".

Eventually, I got fed up with this and went beyond my local area and emailed random companies about remote internships. Again, either no response, or I'm too young.

In all, I applied/emailed almost 100 companies with nothing to show for it. Am I doing something wrong? What can I fix?

If internships aren't feasible, is it possible to do research? The thing about research is that I dont think it will even help for future internships/job prospects, because I will be able to do research once I actually enter college anyway, whereas an internship this summer will help me more easily get one next summer.

Also, if you have any ideas other than research or an internship, that would be great.",1614030941,1,0

Don't get me wrong, I support promoting equity in education.  Not to focus on race but just to provide some easily found stats: Columbia is already more diverse than the country it exists within, with white people now being very underrepresented (the country is 60% white, but Columbia is 30%)

I've had to lean on being a first generation student just to have some sense of ""diverse"" and it seems like complete nonsense.  At what point have we gone through enough doors and can agree everyone in such a selectively diverse group (Columbia students) are equally meritorious?",1614018528,1,0

People claim that it is a cash cow program, and that the quality is not upto the mark.

**I'm an international student and my utmost priority is employment after grad school**. *When I looked up the alumni on Linkedin, I noticed that the most of them were unemployed.* Some even had to return to their home countries. I was so disappointed because even after ferreting for accomplished alumni, I could barely find anyone. Would really appreciate if the current students of the statistics department or graduates of the program shed some light on the issue- Is it a cash cow program? What kind of career support is provided? How much does the brand name matter? Are the courses industry based, so as to be directly applicable in jobs?",1613974302,1,0

Oh and btw a significant portion of the graduating class probably isn't anywhere near campus this semester anyways, so that's another nail in the coffin.

I'm going to call Columbia tomorrow, but is the current plan an online graduation + mailed diplomas? Will there be any reason to be here in person?
