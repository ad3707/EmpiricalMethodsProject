applying to research as a frosh?,"heyo!

a couple research assistant positions for a major i'm interested in have recently opened up, and i'm quite excited to apply to them. however, i'm a bit worried because i don't have any previous research experience, which i suppose would make me a tough sell compared to other students with actual research experience (though i'm very willing to learn ofc!) also, we have to upload our current resumes, but so far most of my notable work was from high school ... so i'm a bit worried about that too.

can someone articulate why online school is so bad,"**also, am i the only one that feels this way?**

i thought i had a fine digital spring quarter, but when it came time to enroll in classes for fall and winter, i balked. like, i got cold dread in the pit of my stomach. although it was for a unit count that i have done on campus previously (with some difficulty but overall no sweat,) the prospect of doing that unit count at home just like ...... sent me into physical lockdown.

there is also the side factor that these units would have been in classes that all felt pretty meaningless/purposeless, which may have been why i felt so much less motivation than on campus. also, i am doing way more extracurriculars this year.

but i think it was more than a workload thing. even if i'd been committed to less stuff, i still wouldn't have wanted to do it. 

but objectively, for me, now is the best time to take hella units. i have no commute time to classes. my ""dining hall"" is steps away. accountability measures are lower than ever because of e-learning. professors are grading more leniently for the same reason. for some lectures, i can just log into zoom and then mute audio and go do homework for other classes.

so why does e-school feel like so much more awful than in-person school? does anyone else feel this way?

is it because the social interaction between classes makes everything feel more worth it? is it because of the whole ""everything's digital"" thing, so our eyes can't take a break? is it in my head?",1612249910,10,0

Where is the love for Stanford small businesses?,"I'll try to be ambiguous so that I don't ruffle the wrong feathers (I'm one of a select few undergrads taking classes at the GSB), but I can't help but notice how a certain Stanford-led startup has been gaining a lot of unwarranted criticism in the media as of late.

To say that I am disappointed by the lack of solidarity from the Stanford community, would be an understatement.

I implore you to think about our equal moral worth as human beings, and more than that, about our shared claim to the Stanford experience. Have we not all studied in Green Library, snuck onto the roof at MemChu, ate a delicious hot dog at Caspar dining? Does this mean nothing to you?

The vitriol and anger currently circulating will engender harrowing consequences for our institution and for the free market system. If left unchecked, I fear this company’s IPO may be blocked, and they could even face delinquency. Need I remind you of how Stanford has [fallen so drastically short](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ps2PNZh) in recent global metrics? Think about how our collective action problem will reflect upon all of us and upon our endowment.

You may ask why we, the Stanford community, are obligated to act, to which I say in response: If not us, then who? If not now, then when?

Just wanted to put this out there,"I guess this is me trying to express what I'm feeling in an effort to give me a sense of relief; that these feelings don't exclusively exist within me, that they're somewhere out there (albeit on a hard-drive on some server). Although I'd appreciate any advice or comments, soliciting them isn't my intention.

I'm currently living on campus with my friends. I love them all; they're incredibly chill, full of energy and fun to be around. But as an international student, I feel out of place. There are so many references that go over my head, like the cartoons and TV shows they watched growing up, the music hits of middle school and vines that I've never been exposed to. It feels really hard to relate or contribute to conversations. Often, I feel like I have no opinions about things. My friends would debate which Miley Cyrus song is the best banger or which Disney channel actor/actress turned to be the hottest as they grew up. I've never really thought about those things, and don't understand the circumstances that would force one to, yet my friends seem to have immediate strong opinions about these things and have come up with lines of reasoning explaining their positions. Coupled with the fact that half the time I don't know what they're debating, it always feels like I'm just an observer in the friend group. I feel like they forget I exist, and by extension I feel like an outsider.

It doesn't help that I already have issues with active listening, vocabulary recall or expressing myself on the spot. English is not my first language, and I've only been conversing in it for a few years. This is also exacerbated by the fact that 18 years of living with a manipulative, hot-tempered mom has taught me to be agreeable and actively seek to please the people around me. I often just nod, smile or laugh, not knowing what for. These reflexes seem to be programmed in me. Whenever I try to overcome them, try to be true to myself, I'm hit with self-worth issues. Nothing about my life, at least to me, seems worth sharing. I don't have any funny anecdotes, while my friends always seem to have something funny that's happened to them recently. Adding to that, I hate my body, every bit of it. Although I know that my friends don't view my as ugly per se, they always throw around the word ""fat"" negatively. It makes me question if that connotation carries in the way the see me.

Perhaps the only time where I'm truly able to be ""me"", is when I'm drunk or high. So whenever I have the chance to, I always get really drunk, and try to get everyone around me to be drunk. It's the only time where I know I have an excuse if I say something that people would conventionally deem stupid or of no value to the conversation. Heck, my friends would just laugh because they're drunk. It's the only time where I can say the word ""like"" six times in the same sentence because I don't know what the English word for the specific thing I'm trying to describe is. People would think I'm just too drunk, that I'm not dumb. This has been very unhealthy because drinking alcohol or smoking weed seem to ruin my mood for the next few days.

So, even though I'm surrounded by people I love and admire, who I know I can count on, I feel alone. I don't know how I'd ever bring this up to them. Hell, saying this makes me question if they really see me as a friend or they just keep me around because I'm a ""generally nice person"". And the thing is, I know they're good people, but I also know that they wouldn't know how to respond or act if I ever told them this. I don't even know how to begin expressing myself, like would I call a ""friend group meeting"" and put myself under the spotlight? That just seems too dramatic. Even if I manage to do that, I know the moment I start to speak, my entire vocabulary will just disappear, my thoughts and feelings will no longer feel valid or worth listening to. I can't bear the feeling of making anyone feel even a little bit bad or sad. My whole life prior to Stanford was walking on egg shells trying not to trigger my mom, not to have her throw shit and break shit, not to hear her scream and stop talking to me for days on end.

All of these things, and many other things, compounded with school work and fucking PWR2 (that seems to incorporate even more work than a normal year would have) serves only to fuel sixty different voices in my head that I have no control over. I can't stop thinking. I can't stop hating myself, hating the circumstances that made me the way I am, hating every piece of my existence. Closing my eyes, and imagining my existence melt away is the only thing that brings me peace. I don't know what to do with myself. I've been trying so hard, but there's very little left in me. I'm depleted.

What Track to Apply for ICME Masters?,"Hi all,

I'll be applying to the ICME masters program next year, and I am looking for advice on whether I should apply to the data science vs. computational finance track. I am a CS/Stats major with SWE internships, so my profile is much more suited for the data science track. However, I am seeking a masters because I want to transition into quant finance, so my top choice is comp. finance, but I have 0 prior internships in finance.

Some questions I have are:

1. Which track should I apply to, given that (i) my top choice is the finance track, (ii) I have no finance work experience, and (iii) my profile is much more relevant for data science?
2. Is it possible to switch tracks once you're in the program? If so, I am thinking it might be a good idea to apply to data science, but I've also heard there are far more applicants for DS than there are for finance, so I might have better chances applying to finance in this case.

She says that i misinterpret. This is  strange because in my hometown of India when a woman compliments you , it means a lot of times that she want to make love to you. I am a freshman who recently got into campus and i have not been with a woman in a long time due covid. I want to understand from the older people who studies here how to flirt with woman. american woman, especially those in campus , are very shy and not much open to intimacy. can you guy explain the steps you took to make love to a woman in this school (consensual).",1611797325,0,0
How to ask for extra time on quiz,"Hi guys,
So basically my class has like 45 min times quizzes which is pretty short time frame for about 30 questions or so... I was recently diagnosed with ADHD this fall but I didn’t know I would need to add it in to my OAE letter. I already have an OAE letter for extra day accommodations on assignments and Ik my OAE officer said it is too late to add something on to the OAE letter for the ADHD. 
He said that special circumstances can ask for more time... I’m just wondering what the best way to ask for more time is?! 
I don’t wanna like email him like Btw I have like major ADHD but it was too late to get it into an OAE letter (prob bc Of the major ADHD) would it be possible to accommodate lol...
Lmk if y’all have any thoughts on how to ask this",1611788822,3,0
CS Professor here – AITA for informing my TA (24F) that she couldn’t date one of my students (22M)?," Hey Reddit,

I’m the instructor of record for CS 169 on Algorithmic Game Theory, and I was hoping to get some advice about an interpersonal conflict that seems to have been going on in my class for at least the last two weeks. My course is pretty small compared to comparable classes (166, 168) and I’m generally on pretty good terms with most of the students taking my course, so I was surprised to receive a call alleging inappropriate behavior between the whistleblower’s TA and one of their classmates. I don’t remember the entire conversation, but it sounds like she called his code “beautiful”? What concerned me most was the claim that the offending student sends 5-6 private Zoom messages PER CLASS, all of them talking about his TA’s “thickness” (or they might have said “sickness” – It’s true that she contracted COVID a few weeks ago).

I sent my whole teaching team a bit of boilerplate about permitted teacher/student relationships, but I'm concerned that I might have to file a Title IX to get out ahead of this whole fiasco. So Reddit, AITA?",1611783103,0,0

Bay Area: On a gap year looking for people to hang out with!,"Hey everyone, 

Currently taking a gap year and have been trying to find other people sharing a semi-similar experience (C/O 2024 btw). 

I’m working in the Bay Area as a mechanical engineering intern at a robotics company for the year and am hoping there are some people who want to (..distantly..) meet and hang out! 

Elephant in the room: I know. I go to Cornell. Buuut Cornell is on the East coast and I’m on the West coast.. My attempts at finding fellow gap year students around here from Cornell haven’t been too fruitful, so I figured Stanford would be a good place to check to maybe find like-minded people.

Anxious about my major,"Hey so I'm a soph who wants to be a designer in the tech industry when I graduate. I'm really wanting to major in art practice, but lately I feel anxious about this decision. I think this is mostly because of social pressures/Stanford's CS and engineering culture, and my parents, who have somewhat indirectly said ""Why would you go to Stanford to major in art."" (yeah ouch.) 

This is a classic situation where I love my coursework and feel fulfilled by it, but am kind of haunted by the ""practicality"" and future implications of choosing this major over CS-HCI or product design. I do not feel passion for those engineering majors but objectively speaking they probably have higher ROI for my future career.. I'm FLI so I feel anxious about money and employment after college.

Career Transition After College,"Hi all,

I will soon be graduating either this quarter or the next. However, I feel that my likely career after college, software engineering, is a bad fit for my temperament and personal strengths, even though on paper I look very qualified (internships, good coursework and projects). To that end, of those here who have graduated, is your current job related to your choice of major, and if not how did you successfully make the transition? For example, I'm thinking that getting a master's degree towards a career I'm more interested in after working a couple years in software is the most sensible option at this point.",1613641695,1,0

Practical personal financial decisions -- Intro to Financial Decision-Making,"Professors Michael Boskin and John Shoven and I put together a new course last year about personal financial decision-making--Economics 43 (you can check it out on explorecourses). I hear a lot about students wishing their education prepared them more for the real world. That's what this course is intended to do, probably more so than any other course offering at Stanford. We talk about investing, taxes, insurance, social security, housing, among other topics--all practical and directly related to your future financial decisions.

We had huge enrollment last year, over 360 students. We want to maximize the benefit of this course for as many students as possible at Stanford, so I wanted to get the message out again. The course will be offered again for Spring 2021 quarter with uncapped enrollment.

Here's an article about the course: [https://siepr.stanford.edu/news/its-prime-time-financial-literacy](https://siepr.stanford.edu/news/its-prime-time-financial-literacy)

Ps. I know that SF is nearby but I have a disability and I am SO AFRAID i won’t be able to take public transport and do the trip. I’d rather take an Uber to events.

a small rant,"some TAs are super helpful and amazing, and some TAs really suck. I don't really want to make generalizations, but I've found that a lot of male TAs are a lot less empathetic and compassionate than female TAs. With that being said, I've had good male TAs before. Im just currently in a class that I've had negative experiences with the male TAs in the sense that they get frustrated if you don't immediately understand the concepts, they don't ever write down anything to show you how a procedure is done, and they really just don't empathize at all. I went through a bit of a snafu with the latest midterm for this class and the male TAs kind of just made me feel a lot worse about what happened, but when I emailed another TA, who happens to be a female, she wrote back and was really understanding and told me things would be okay. She happens to be the only TA whose OH I go to now since she really takes the time to explain concepts and go over problems. Shes amazing. 
I know it's kind of a dumb rant but it reminds me about how stupid I felt when I first got to Stanford. I would go to CS office hours (I forgot what they called that) and I was really struggling with a certain concept and I got assigned to a dude who was treating me like I was so stupid for not understanding after he explained it to me twice. I later got a female TA who helped draw the concept out and was really patient and kind with me. There was another time I went to an OH for another stem class and the TA (a guy) started also getting frustrated with me when I couldn't visualize what he was talking about. I feel like I'm a person who needs to visually see concepts and when people describe things to me I don't really know what they're talking about. I also just really hated the way those TAs made me feel about not immediately understanding what they're talking about and making me feel stupid for even asking... 
I'd like to hear you all's experiences with TAs. I'm once again stating that I'm not really trying to make generalizations. I know there are good male TAs, I just happen to have way more positive experiences with female TAs than male ones.",1614127146,46,0

Most important and most in demand majors in 15 years,"My guess:

1. Statistics
2. Mathematics
3. Computer Science (with a focus on ML)

Software engineering will likely become less important due to advancements in ML models like GPT-3 and in the No-Code field in general.

However, data will increase more and more! And there will be a huge demand for people who know how to extract the most value out of the data!

Of course, I expect all of the above to have great programming skills.

Thoughts?

These past several months of starting university have just made me more lost and confused than ever. I realized that I truly have no idea what I want to do in my life and I have no idea why I do the things I am currently doing. I feel like I completely lack direction and clarity, and I do not know what I want to study or what I want to do post-grad. All I want is to feel excited about something and feel like I am doing the right thing with my life. Coming into university, I did not really have a plan-- I thought that I would figure things out as I went along which is what I have done for the past several years of my life, but that has not worked on for me this time. 

Has anyone experienced a similar situation and does anyone have any advice on what to do to gain some sort of clarity at this stage? Part of me just wants to take some time off from school to really try to figure out what I want, part of me just wants to just pick something and go with it.

What graduate housing is amenable to hosting semi-large  gatherings (\~30-50 people) on a weekly basis? If I want to host events  like these, do I need to live off campus?

3. Another  opportunity I've been looking into is co-buying a property with other  students.

New Rule Proposal: no unsolicited requests,"Hi all! This is something I've been noticing more lately in this sub that I wanted to bring up: non-Stanford students posting asking Stanford students to send them Stanford-only resources like books or syllabi. I completely understand the motivations behind why people ask, but quite frankly, it's annoying, these posts often don't get many, if any, replies, and they take away from the purpose of r/stanford, which is for Stanford students and alums to discuss Stanford stuff. There is often a reason these resources are behind a Stanford firewall, and they should be procured officially through the university.

**What I'd like to propose is a new rule: no unsolicited requests**. This isn't unprecedented (college subs like r/Harvard already have similar rules) and I think it would improve the quality of this space. The wording I'm thinking about (modified from r/Havard's) would be something like: 

""No unwanted or unsolicited requests for library books, course syllabi, or other information that requires a Stanford login. If you are a student at another institution and need access to a Stanford resource, please pursue that through an official route directly with the university.""

is this a common experience (for people of any race or gender?),"i'm an asian girl and i find that even over ZOOM i'm always being confused with other asian girls, even in seminars with &lt;20 people (scratch that ESPECIALLY in seminars with &lt;20 people). it has happened many times over the course of this last quarter alone and i tried to not let it get to me, but it's starting to really bother me, especially after some more incidents that happened today. it can be as little as classmates/professors attributing what another asian girl said to me or vice versa, and it can be as large as being directly addressed by literally the wrong name. 

i'm usually not that agitated when i get confused with other asian girls in person. it's a fact of life. i try to brush it off. if i got angry at every little micro-aggression i would be one hell of an unhappy person. but i'm really starting to lose my cool. we have our fucking names tagged onto the bottom left corner of our zoom tabs. i literally don't understand why people can't put the effort in to try to get our names right. 

i'm asking whether this is a common experience (being perceived as a homogenous blob with people of your same race and gender) at stanford. i'm just a freshman so i haven't been on campus, but if it's this common over fucking ZOOM i can only imagine what it's like in person. i was a nobody at high school, yet i was rarely confused with other asian girls.

Time requirement for a master's student?,"Hey guys

I am about 3 years  in my profession and realize that I do not want to work towards the corporate ladder because I am not the right material for that.

I have decided that I will go learn cool things in engineering. I have lately been fancying electronics, so obviously masters of electrical and / or mechanical engineering would be the right thing for me.

I have chosen that because I want to learn how to build real things - you know it would be cool. But one of the most important things to me is my family and I want to be able to give them as much time as I possibly can while exceling in school. Other than that I don't really have a lot of distractions like friends because I really don't have any of them.

So 2 questions:

1. How much time is required of a masters of engineering student at stanford or a similar engineering school of equal stature? (time that I HAVE to be in school for - If I can do it at home then dont include that here)
2. Do I HAVE to go to engineering masters school to learn how to build electronics or can i learn it at home? I have some basic first year university knowledge in physics . BUT THATS IT.",1615424480,1,0

ChemE vs BioE major?,"Hello! '24 here thinking about what to major in. As a preface, I plan to go to med-school and work in the life-sciences industry (pharmaceuticals, biotech startups, etc.). Given my interest in life sciences and creating/building things, BioE seemed like the natural choice. However, I've heard lots of mixed opinions on BioE as a major. Many say that it's too broad (and hence you don't really gain that depth of knowledge you should have as an engineering major). Looking at Stanford's undergraduate curriculum for BioE, I kind of see it? There seem to be a few core courses and most of it is random electives (please correct me if I'm seeing it wrong though!). On the other hand, ChemE addresses the fact that my major sub-interest within life-sciences/engineering is cellular/molecular stuff. I'm less interested in imaging technology, biomechanics, etc, and more interested in things like drug development. But, ChemE seems like quite a difficult degree (lots of core courses, etc.) and there looks to be a lot of stuff regarding pure physical chemistry that I'm not really interested in (given that I'm not looking to be a pure ""chemical engineer"").

How to get people to work on cool ideas with you,"Hello, 

I am currently a remote frosh and had a couple questions. An obvious reason why I came to Stanford was to learn from some of the greatest minds on Earth in the classroom, but another major reason was to find people to work on cool things with (like really embrace the Stanford 'culture' you know?). I am not talking about class projects or something. More like some big, bold, and seemingly foolish ideas. I have lots of them myself but I can't feasibly build them all myself and would love to either: help people with their ideas or form a group to build my ideas. 

I don't have much connections with classmates due to being at home this year and I am hoping that once everyone is back, these connections can form fluidly. But in the time being, is there some sort of group, club, community, organization that is Stanford related where I can introduce my ideas and get people to help build them with me? 

To give some more context, some ideas are pretty much entrepreneurship related (i.e. like a startup) others are fun side projects. 

Also important info: I am a CS major so pretty much all projects would revolve primarily around some technology (but there is a lot of non-cs parts involved with some as well). I also got rejected from the two primary entrepreneurship club programs in the fall if that helps. 

Feel free to drop any advice you may have :) 

Anything is greatly appreciated.

The argument to wait for engr40m is to take it in person -- I imagine engr40m being an ee class would benefit more from being in person than cs110/111.

Masters in CS Advice,"Hi! I am a current high school senior who will be majoring in computer science as an undergrad. I was considering Stanford, but I can attend a ""CS Big Five"" School at a significantly lower cost. It doesn't have a name outside of CS, but I like the school and, aside from some lack of individualized attention, its opportunities seem in line with those at Stanford.

I have taken many AP classes and math classes beyond the AP level, so it seems doable for me to get my BS CS at my undergrad school in 3 years without significant overload. Though I know plans can change, I would like to plan out what I would do after those three years right now. 

I could get my MS CS at my undergrad school (\~1.5 years), but I also was wondering if I should also work on being a competitive applicant for MS CS programs like Stanford's (\~2 years) just in case my future self finds that another school is more aligned with my interests. For context, I do not plan to get a PhD. I hope to instead pursue either traditional tech or quant roles in the industry.

I don't know anyone in tech, so I would really value this sub's advice. The TLDR question is ""Does this make sense, and, if so, do you have any advice?,"" but I have also broken this down into a few more specific questions:

1. Is an MS CS just a ""cash cow"" (does it make sense to instead enter the industry after 3 years)?
2. How do non-Stanford undergrad + MS CS opportunities compare to those available to students with a Stanford co-term?
3. What does a competitive Stanford MS CS applicant look like? What steps should I take/when should I take them to apply to the MS CS program?

Columbia vs Stanford,"This week, I have been accepted into Columbia and Stanford, and I'm struggling with making a choice. I want to study to computer, but I'm open to other STEM disciplines. Also, please don't say go to Stanford because they have a better computer science program. I got a likely from Columbia and accepted into the CUSP program, but Stanford was my dream school up until this year.

I'm queer, Black, and from the suburbs of Missouri, and I want to experience something new. I'm a bit of an introvert, but I generally get along with most people. Activism and diversity are also very important to me.

If you go to/graduated from Columbia, can you answer these questions?

* For cs students, how big were your intro classes?
* Is there mental health support?
* For Black people (especially women), how did your peers treat you?
* Do you feel rushed with the quarter system?
* And anything else I should know about the school.",1617929001,1,0
would it be a good idea to just drop cs106b right now &amp; take it summer quarter (on my flex term)?,"hey!

so, as the title suggests, i'm considering dropping cs106b right now and just taking it summer quarter. i'm currently at 20 units, and i feel waaaaay overwhelmed. that being said, my one concern is -- all my other classes really have nothing to do with any specificed major (lol) (except for one THINK class i'm required to take, so there's that lol) (&amp; one class that i want to take for a subject i'm considering minoring in!) whereas cs106b would obviously be necessary for the CS major, which i am considering looking into.

so, i'm a bit worried if i drop cs106b right now i'd be way behind on completing the CS major (especially since there were people who came right into stanford &amp; took cs106b right away), or that i'd have to stack up on a whooole bunch of CS/engineering/science courses during my later years at stanford. (so far, the only relevant courses i've completed include math 51 &amp; cs106a. &amp; i've never taken physics before, not even in high school lol). idk, on one hand i feel like i'd get more out of 106b if i just took it in the summer (&amp; i'd be less overwhelmed too....lol, that is also something to consider.) but on the other hand i really don't want to fall behind. so any thoughts on what i ought to do would be much appreciated!",1617923502,1,0
Graduate School Funding,"Hi everyone,

Have any of you had to consider rejecting a Stanford offer due to financial reasons?

For years I have postponed my graduate studies for many reasons. I have a very unique and time-sensitive research thesis project in mind. I am an older independent student and not in a position to take out large loans. I have applied for some grants but I will most likely have to decline.

UCLA or Stanford??,"Hello!!!!! First off, I just wanna say how extremely happy I am to have been accepted to Stanford's Class of 2025!! This is truly such a huge honor for me and my family, and I wanna be upfront when I say the people who attend Stanford (at least in my experience) are so incredibly freaking smart. Seriously, you guys are crazy intelligent and I hope I get to join you all next year :-)

Really quickly, I was wondering if anyone can give me any insight into what I should do. I have received admission from Berkeley, UPenn, Brown (for PLME too!), and UCLA, and atm I'm currently debating between UCLA and Stanford. For context, I applied as a linguistics/bioengineering major (almost certainly Pre-Med) to these schools, but that can be subject to change. 

The main reason I am debating which school to go to is because of finances. Neither UCLA nor Stanford offers me any financial aid, but being a CA Resident my cost of UCLA will be half of that of Stanford. I understand that I will be totally happy at whichever school I attend, and that I am so incredibly grateful to have such amazing options, but I would really appreciate any insight anyone on this sub can give. On a quick note, does anyone have any tips on negotiating/appealing financial aid at Stanford? Or the feasibility of working while studying?

"Congrats, ProFros!","I think undergrad decisions come out in under an hour, so am posting a little in advance so this gets approved on time. If you’re here before decisions are out: really good luck, and come back in a bit. :)

First and foremost, huge congratulations to those who got in. It’s an amazing achievement, and as upperclassmen, we’re super excited to have you on campus—(hopefully IRL campus by the sounds of things)! I think I speak for a lot of us when I say freshmen make up most of my favourite people on campus every year. And freshmen year at Stanford is really special and wonderful for many students here, so I hope you love every minute of it.

If people are happy to talk to ProFros with questions, maybe those people could comment below—or mods, maybe we could make a bigger thread for that purpose?

Secondly, some advice to those who got in—(everything below here is my opinion, so feel free to ignore it.) 100% celebrate your achievement, but if you come from a more privileged background, do try and be humble and aware of the background that helped get you here. I’m sure you did a ton of work to get to this point, but there’s often a lot of privilege and/or luck involved too, and that’s totally fine—many of us (including me) are here because of unfair advantages we had in early life, and it’s normal. People at Stanford will like you more for being actively aware of this, I promise. You’re also not an imposter, whether you come from a privileged background or not. You all belong here as much as any of us.

(Last piece of advice: remember that some other people are less happy than you right now—colleges can’t accept everyone, and it seems like acceptance rates were especially low this year—so publicly flexing all the Ivies you got into on social media might not be the... kindest thing to do. Again this applies even more if you’re from a more privileged background. And “Should I go to Stanford or Harvard, wow, such a hard decision...” definitely counts as flexing, I’m afraid...)

To those who didn’t get in to their dream school, Stanford or not: I’m so so sorry. Be aware this system is definitely unfair, biased, and random, so a rejection is very much *not* a statement about you. Everyone says this, but it’s definitively true: the application system is just not at all good. Several Stanford students I know were rejected from every Ivy we applied to, and there is absolutely no reason we could not have been rejected by Stanford too—we were just the lucky ones. So go nail your undergrad, and come back to Stanford for grad school. Then rub it in all the undergrads’ faces. :)",1617834284,1,0

CS 103,"Hello people!

I am a freshman in CS 103 right now and am greatly struggling--struggling because the content is very difficult for me and the amount of work given. I did well in my previous CS classes (non-theory, systems core classes), but really am just not having a fun time in 103 and therefore my grades on psets have been less than preferable so far. 

I know I needed to get the course done anyway since I want to major in CS so I didn't drop the class in hopes that I'd be able to rebound. 

I find the workload insane and kind of ridiculous--FOUR midterms means no weekend breaks half the quarter and PSETs 10+ pages long EVERY week including midterm weeks. I understand the grading system during Covid seems a little more relaxed than maybe it might have been in person but boy am I still struggling. I find myself not really interested in the topics as opposed to 106B and 'programming' classes. I am also particularly just struggling with proofs in general and this is my first time doing them. 

Any advice or words of wisdom anyone has for me? I want to pursue a career in CS (either industry or research in software and/or AI) and feel that not doing well here might hurt me. How true would this be in the long run? Would I have the benefit of the doubt given that I am a frosh, we are in a pandemic, and that anything I plan to apply to in the future will most certainly not be related to theory or discrete mathematics? Would a pass/fail for a core class be bad? 

I also don't have a partner so I am basically at a pretty big disadvantage somewhat.

A friend of yours seeking advice,"I'm humbly seeking for an advice from experienced people about admission to Stanford. Let me start off by introducing myself. I'm Bigo, a civil engineer from Turkey. I graduated from an average  highschool with an average grade 75/100 got into and graduated from an average university with an average GPA (3.28). For the last three months, thoughts of transitioning into software has been eating me inside while I worked in the construction field in the largest construction site in Turkey, my workplace. 

Then, I had the chance of getting accepted to Code In Place, a community service provided by the excellent Stanford instructors and students that aims to teach CS106A to thousands of students around the world. While solving the first assignment I bawled my eyes out as I have not enjoyed anything I did the last 4 years as much as I enjoyed building those columns with that stupid fucking robot. The professors are amazing, they are the most passionate and amazing people I have known. Well, unfortunately right now I got the bug in me and I want to get into Stanford more than anything in my life. I did my research about Stanford alumni, as far as I can see, I do not fit any of the types. I need advice. Real, solid, cold advice on how to get in. If it is gonna take me 10 years of volunteering, playing rec sports, interning, whatever you name it. I am ready. My problem is I'm stuck with a high school grade and a gpa i can do nothing about. To top it off I got literally no extracurriculars not because I was a lazy bum because we didn't have access to anything while in middle and highschool. How can i boast about my orchestra experience when in reality my highschool didn't have a music room, laboratory or a computer classroom. A shitty early life lead me to a shittier adult life and I finally realised what was going on at my 3rd year of college, getting 3,42 3,91 and 3,94 gpa in the last 3 semesters, while studying as an exchange student for one semester in Poland, however this is not enough for what I want. 

What's real about me is I got a hell of a potential. I can sing, even though I can't document my heartwarming solo performance in the non existing choir of my highschool.  I have been lifting weights for 6 years and I'm in great shape even though I can not show you my medals in sports as I have never competed in any of them. I can write a hell of a research paper, but can't prove it to you as I got paid to write them for other students. As a summary, please help an average but potential to be savage brother out, if not at least I got it off my chest.

TL DR: Average dude, got no evidence to show my true self, asking for a realistic way to get into my dream school.",1619120043,1,0
Stanford requiring COVID vaccination for all students in the fall (w religious &amp; medical exceptions),"Dear Stanford community,

As we look ahead to fall quarter, I am writing to share an update on the crucial role that COVID-19 vaccines will play. As a reminder, we are planning to welcome all undergraduate class years to campus, including many who will be in residence for the first time in college. Our student housing involves congregate living. And we are looking forward to resuming the social activities and cultural and sporting events where we gathered before the pandemic.

Stanford’s COVID-19 Vaccine Governance Committee has been reviewing conditions and developments around vaccination against the virus, including an increase in supplies of vaccine and greater availability of appointments. Public health officials at the county, state and national level encourage all of us to be vaccinated. As CDC Director Rochelle Walensky has stated, “We continue to encourage every American to get vaccinated as soon as it’s their turn, so we can begin to safely take steps back to our everyday lives. Vaccines can help us return to the things we love about life, so we encourage every American to get vaccinated as soon as they have the opportunity.”

Based on these recommendations from the CDC and from our Vaccine Governance Committee, Stanford plans to require all undergraduate, graduate and professional students coming to campus this fall to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19. All students will be asked about their vaccine status prior to their arrival on campus for the fall quarter. We will work to help arriving students obtain a vaccination if they have been unable to obtain one at their home location.  

We will accommodate those who cannot take the vaccine for medical or religious reasons. Students in these situations will be able to request an exception and, once it is approved, will be required to undergo regular COVID-19 testing. Other requirements may also apply.

We know you will have questions about this policy and the details of how it will be implemented, and we will provide more details in the coming weeks.  

Stanford is also continuing to evaluate the vaccination situation for faculty and staff, and we expect to provide an update soon. But we want to share this information now with students and prospective students as they make their plans for the fall.

We believe this approach to student vaccination is necessary to support health and safety this fall. Vaccinations are a critical component in our efforts to mitigate risk and protect one another’s health within our student environment. We expect that other public health safeguards will also continue to be in place in the fall. These will be determined by public health rules and conditions at the time, but as one example, we expect that mask wearing, particularly indoors where others are present, will still be a part of campus life in the fall.

We encourage students to get a vaccine as soon as they are able. For students who are seeking vaccination now, please view this recent message about making an appointment, and consult healthalerts.stanford.edu/vaccinations for additional information.

Thank you for doing your part to help us renew – safely – the activity and vibrancy on the Farm that we have missed for the past year. And, as a reminder, the virus is still very much with us today, and highly transmissible variants pose an additional danger. We strongly encourage you to continue following the health protocols, including physical distancing and wearing of face coverings, that have enabled us to proceed with optimism and excitement for the fall quarter.

Sincerely,

Persis Drell

International Visiting Student Researcher fees,"Hi everyone!

I have been lucky and I have been awared with a Fulbright grant for doing a research stay at Stanford.

I have talked with other colleagues that are going to Berkeley and other universities, and the fee is much cheaper (for instance 1500$ for their whole time there). 

Am I missing something? It seems quite expensive. Have any of you had the experience of being an International Visiting Student Researcher? I would love some advices!

trying to make real connections," 

**I came to stanford expecting to meet people who wanted to work really hard and really try to change things in the world and help people and i’ve been so disappointed. None of my friends have any real passion and it’s so disappointing. I’ve been trying to meet new people (joining clubs, socializing with my dorm, reaching out to people to grab lunch etc) but I can’t seem to find anyone who is super motivated to maximize their life. When I’ve taken classes with upperclassmen, I’ve definitely found this passion, but I haven’t found it in any frosh. And I’m not sure how to become friends with upperclassmen in my classes especially over zoom. Does anyone have advice on where to find these friends? I know they exist, I just don’t know where to find passionate people to be friends with. And I’m not trying to say I’m better than any of my friends or the people I know - it’s just that I want my time with friends to be studying and talking about our careers and futures and the purpose of life, not getting fucked up or gossiping like so many of the frosh I know.

Help! Between Stanford Harvard and MIT,"
Hello!

I’ve been really lucky to have been accepted to these three schools, but I’m torn because they’re all great in their own way. I’m leaning towards going to Boston since Stanford seems to be in a very rich bubble. I’m low income and first gen so I’m a bit worried about that. 
I’m interested in either going into industry and working as a software developer or working with Google, working with NASA, or working with non-profits to develop devices for developing countries (I’m a bit undecided and all over the place). I love math and science, but I’m also interested in history and Latin American studies. So I’m either planning to do environmental engineering or comp sci with a minor in something to do with public policy.

Regarding MIT, I’m scared I won’t develop the soft skills I need in life in case I want to move up in the business world or in the world of non-profits. In addition, I’ve spent the majority of my high school just studying. 

I am a hard worker, some even say a workaholic, but I would like a more or less balanced college experience where I know I can find friends to have fun with, go into the city, shop, eat food, have silly conversations with. 

I’m extroverted compared to introverts but quite introverted around extroverts.
Besides that, I live in the south so I’m a bit afraid of the cold although looking for something new and exciting.

Am I Wrong?,"Hey, so, I have literally 25 hours to decide where I will go to college... Have been thinking about both Harvard and Stanford for a while now but even after talking to some 10 alumni and browsing the respective subreddits, I am not close to a decision.

Ultimately, my asian immigrant east coast parents are encouraging me to go to H for the slightly bigger name, particularly in finance and consulting. And, well, even if that is wrong, I get a lump in my throat when I think about not taking my H offer--I thought it was my dream school for a while.

The truth is, I am a really reserved person, so the role Final Clubs and similar orgs play at H are a little scary. I am interested in studying CS to make it to a big tech company, which I have heard is easier at S. S actually costs slightly less than H, and S will accept a 2 quarter's worth of AP credits unlike H.

Given what I said in the previous paragraph, do you think it is obvious where I should go? I know this post may be a little annoying, but if someone can affirm whether or not S's CS recruiting/education is actually stronger than H's, then I would be a lot more comforted in making my decision.

Stanford or Stevens,"It's probably pretty late now that I only have a few hours to change enrollment plans, but oh well. Would still be interested to see what y'all would advise in this case or any interesting insights on either the schools or the professional world, etc. 

Stanford would cost $80,000 a year, while Stevens would cost maybe $10,000 (room and board, minus a stipend). My parents can afford Stanford, but it would eat up a sizable chunk of their income, making the full-ride still very, very appealing.

I get that in global prestige Stevens can't compare with Stanford, but it seems there are still many appealing fields where that sort of prestige isn't necessarily a prerequisite or even too much of a benefit? Right now I'm just worried about making a decent income with a good amount of leisure time, and for this Stevens works (at least currently), right?

I'm also afraid I wouldn't be a good fit at Stanford, and a bunch of psychological hurdles and risk-averseness would prevent me from making good use of the opportunities here. At Stevens, it might be easier for me to feel comfortable both for the obvious reason and also because of the sort of leg up they gave me for nice research opportunities with the scholars' program. So right now, I'm wondering if it will be better for me personally to just go to Stevens. 

I'm intending to go into some STEM major but I currently have no (productive) experience in STEM (almost all my activities up to this point have been in the ""fuzzy"" category, yet my writing is weak so it's not like a Stanford humanities major would be ideal either), and that contributes to some of my wariness about going somewhere associated with prestige and seen as a STEM powerhouse like Stanford. 

Any advice? Does anyone here have any knowledge of what it's like at Stevens? (It seems that many on the unofficial Stevens reddit are pretty negative about the school, but they might not be totally representative, not to mention that the scholars' program might make my experience there atypical anyways?)

urgent university decision help please:,"I am currently contemplating between going to Stanford University this fall (costs $370,000 overall as an intl), or attending UNC Chapel Hill with a full ride merit scholarship (not the morehead scholarship, a diff one). As an international student aspiring to major in economics and enter the finance or economic policy world, would you say that the prestige level, networking, and opportunities of a university like Stanford would significantly help me and be worth the cost compared to unc chapel hill? My parents are also supportive of me attending Stanford as we can somewhat afford it (its 1/4th of our savings and I have a sister in 10th grade). BUT if I go to UNC they would give me $160,000 just to keep, which I could use for my masters, buy a house, travel, etc. Also if I went to Stanford and graduated with a good job, I'd have to pay my parents around 20K yearly, whereas if I go to UNC I'd instead be $160K in profit. However, Stanford is Stanford and it's hard to say no to my dream university that has manageable rigor, great networking and resources, good weather, social life, etc. Which university do you think would benefit me the most?

CSS profile questions for students on financial aid.,"Hey everyone, I'm an independent undergrad who receives financial aid (scholarship + food and housing allowances). I'm currently filling out the CSS profile and was wondering if someone could provide insight on some questions (I've emailed fin aid, but sometimes they take a hot minute to respond).

In the CSS profile section ""Student Expected Income and Benefits"" we are asked to provide our expected earnings for the 2020-2021 academic year, as well as our expected taxed income and total untaxed income. Should I include any financial aid that I expect to receive for housing and food as part of my expected taxed income or untaxed income? (I ask because I paid state and federal taxes on the financial aid I received this year, but I know some consider it untaxed). Or do these fields only pertain to any income I may receive from internships and TA jobs, for example, and not financial aid? 

In the ""Student Resources"" Section we are also asked to include our expected earnings from ""employers, (i.e. tuition benefits), including their parent's employers."" Should I include financial aid as ""tuition benefits"" or is this something different?

\-introverted

\-dont mind cold weather

\-i like math (well, as far as i can tell having taken up through multivariable calc and 0 proof-based classes)

\-am interested in industry-minded CS  or industry-minded Stats, but then again i basically have 0 experience except some scripting in R for some data analysis during an internship w/ the IMF so ig i cant discern if im truly interested

\-is there a difference between CS or Stats recruiting btwn the schools? the vibe im getting is that there is a difference, where S is better for CS and H is better for Stats but idk

\-def won't party; prob won't drink

\-stanford costs 45k and harvard costs 50k so not huge diff, especially taking into account that i currently already live on east coast (DMV area)

Deciding between Stanford and Brown,"I'm having a lot of trouble deciding where I want to go (with only a couple of days left to make a decision...). Brown is one of my top schools whereas I applied to Stanford not really knowing much about the school. For context, I'm interested in the neuro/cog sci area (and also pretty interested in East Asian Studies, particularly Korea, which I hope to maybe minor in). I'm considering pre-med, but not entirely sure yet.

Brown pros:

* Has really good neuro/cog sci departments. Multiple people have told me the faculty is amazing.
* Open curriculum. I'm really looking to explore and not be held down by any requirements (besides the major requirements).
* Relaxed/chill environment. I was looking forward to this because I come from a pretty competitive high school so I wanted a change in environment.
* Grading scale has no pluses/minuses (which I thought would be better if I choose pre-med)

Brown cons:

* East Asian Studies at Brown seems to be pretty lackluster
* Unsure if the financial aid award I got will stay the same for all four years (I negotiated it to a lower price for freshman year so that it matched with Stanford's)

Stanford pros:

* I looked into some of the courses offered about Korea, and they all seem really interesting/taught by cool faculty
* I feel that Stanford is overall solid in everything they have to offer. All the courses I've looked into seem so interesting and the faculty also seem really amazing. (also I guess the Stanford name carries a lot of weight)
* My financial aid award was really good. I'm not sure if it will stay the same for all four years though.

Stanford cons:

* No neuro/cog sci major??? I thought that I could major in psych and do a neuro specialization, but it says here that the neuro specialization track is retired: [**https://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofhumanitiesandsciences/psychology/#bachelorstext**](https://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofhumanitiesandsciences/psychology/#bachelorstext)**.** I looked into the neurobiology track for bio majors as well but it seems too bio heavy.
* Duck syndrome. I've heard a lot about this, and I've also heard that Stanford has a huge startup culture. It also seems like a very CS school. I guess that could be nice because I was hoping to take some CS classes, but I'm not sure if the student environment is what I'm looking for (seems kind of intense?).
* A lot of general requirements. Do all the Ways requirements and such prevent flexibility in choosing courses? I was really hoping to take a lot of different classes and explore, but I'm worried that all these requirements will prevent me from doing that (plus if I choose pre-med, there would be even more requirements to fulfill).
* Grading has pluses/minuses

Honestly, most of the cons are really just questions that I have about Stanford that I haven't been able to find the answer to, so if anyone could help me out that would be amazing. Everyone's been telling me Stanford is the way to go, but no one's really given me a solid reason of WHY Stanford would be a better choice than Brown (besides CS, which doesn't really apply to me...).",1619645031,1,0

I want to go to Stanford but I fear the cost of graduate school/Master’s degree will make me regret not taking Umich’s scholarship offer. As I ponder, I heard that most large companies would fund my master’s degree, is that accurate? Also, would the internship opportunities at Stanford offset the costs?

Advice for a future transfer applicant from Wisconsin,"Hello everyone! 

I'm thinking of applying to Stanford as a transfer student after  I spend two years at UW madison. (ig I regret not applying here)

What kind of grades do you think I'll need to maintain? I assume all A's would be necessary.  

Is it expensive if your parents didn't make that much, etc? UW madison is providing me with a full ride, so yay for that! 

I want to attend Stanford is UW madison is literally where I went to high school, and it was my ""dream"" school until I looked at all I was missing by not going to a school on the west coast! 

Is it expensive if your parents didn't make that much, etc? UW Madison is providing me with a full ride, so yay for that! diversity. UW Madison is frankly very white and I was fine with the level of diversity until I started looking at someone's youtube videos from Stanford and realized that I was missing out on something great. I am actually kind of depressed thinking that I'll be attending UW Madison, with the things I am aware of about it. 

Party Culture here is obnoxiously big and honestly, I don't think I can ever maintain that kind of social life, it's just not it for me.

I want to be around that Stanford -kind of- innovation and energy, I just don't think I'll find that here.

Of course, when I was applying to different schools I didn't really plan on getting into (or had the stats) to achieve a spot in an institution as prestigious as Stanford, but from my point of view, I thought going to college would be a drag for me and yet I am going to UW Madison.

I'm a fellow transfer student to Stanford.

I may need to leave this school because this is a horrible place to fail.,"I really like Stanford. I do. When I got here it felt like I had sleeping for a long time and finally woke up. I loved the quirky irreverence and the accomplished peers. But I can’t stand the pressure and lack of empathy just because you go to Stanford. It’s a horrible place to fail. I may need to leave because of it but before I do - has any one found a way past this? It seems like a serious issue that we never talk about. Posted this on Cardinal Confessions but it’s not a place for serious discussion. I need some advice on what to do. Do I stay or should I find another place where I can heal?

I suffer from severe suicidal depression and tried to kill myself. I got hospitalized. I suffer from PTSD after having been in an abusive relationship. I got kicked out. I tried to seek help in my hometown. I told a therapist about my attempted suicide, she felt sad. But when I told her I went to Stanford. She told me to perk up because my life wasn’t so bad because Stanford has a lot of opportunities. I could get a good job and find a spouse and that’d be the end of it. She told me people would be so impressed that I’m a Stanford graduate. When I told my psychiatrist I was worried about my grades (bottom 5%), she told me I shouldn’t worry and that I (a low-income student of color) was being another entitled Stanford student for worrying about grades so much. She told me that the Stanford name was so prestigious and everyone would want to hire a person with a fancy Stanford degree. She told me that Stanford people will always get jobs. I later went on academic probation and had my first internship rescinded because I didn’t meet GPA requirements. When I told my TA I was having trouble turning in assignments and going to class because I couldn’t get out of bed and was still adjusting to the odd impacts of extremely potent medication. He talked about how much harder his undergrad (Berkeley) was. He went on and on about how Berkeley was superior because there was no hand-holding and I was a privileged Stanford undergrad who cries because I can’t get what I want. He told me that the only difference between Stanford and Berkeley is that Berkeley had actual bite and that I would be kicked out of Berkeley had I gone to Berkeley instead. He told me that if I couldn’t take insults I should leave engineering because real engineers tell it like it is. He told me I should have majored in something like the humanities where people are always handing out compliments and only say positive happy things.

The culture is always happy. No one talks about how they’re struggling. I find it hard to make friends once they know the shit I’ve been through. One person told me “We can’t be friends because you are mentally ill and don’t have your shit together”. I told some people that I was thinking of killing myself and they brushed it off as me trying to seek attention. It’s as if people just want to be friends so that can network for prestigious careers later on. When I was doing well and had a future, I benefitted from this but when I need real friends to cry with - there’s no one. It’s as if this entire university is built for networking into flashy careers. Fake smiles and fake California valley girls abound. This place is a go-go-go atmosphere for the best students. There is no room for anyone else. We have grade inflation and support but the mentality is very much “You have so much so people dictate that you should be not just doing well but really, really, really on top of the world.” I get no sympathy from my peers for my struggles. I was an engineering major. I struggled in it but pushed on believing that it was for me. I was in every office hours. Spent 20-30 hours on so many of my problem sets. When I told students and professors this, they told me to start earlier and that I was being lazy. Professors are resentful of our safety net. I once asked a question and the professor told me Stanford holds my hand a lot but this question is so stupid that 99% of real engineers would have googled it up before asking it. Professors and graduate students hate the shit out of undergraduates. They’re generally awful teachers because they’re human beings going through a brutal and inequitable system. My friend TA’ed for a professor and he told me that the professor would take photos of undergrads who failed their exams so he could laugh at it and feel better about himself when he was going through a hard time. There is no real development. You really have to do it on your own. Only the very prepared kids can take advantage of Stanford. There’s safety net and you’ll graduate but it just feels like I’m grinding and barely staying afloat but not really getting any mentorship. I stayed 48 hours for one of my projects. I saw all the wrong signs but failed to steer clear because suffering is social currency in engineering departments. I had a professor chew me out for showing up late to lab because I couldn’t get out of bed. I went on academic probation because I couldn’t get out of bed to take any of my finals. I knew a kid who passed out from heart palpitations for drinking too much Red Bull and staying up too much. No one wants to do any spontaneous. Everyone is always busy.

I am a low-income student of color who grew up in the projects. My parents are refugees. I worked throughout all of high school to help our family stay afloat because my father became disabled and couldn’t work. I grew up thinking gunshots in the night are normal. I dressed so poorly - that I received donations in my backpack one day because concerned teachers were worried that I was going to become homeless. When I was okay, Stanford felt amazing but when I wasn’t okay (which is a lot of the time), Stanford felt god awful. Before I apply for additional quarters of financial aid, I wonder if I should because Stanford is such an awful place to fail. When I tell people I got to Stanford, people are impressed but people really assume that my life is set. This kills me. My life is not set. We talk about how privileged Stanford kids are but it hurts because I don’t feel like a human deserving empathy because I have the Stanford name. To them, Stanford means that I am a privileged elite whose life is set. As if going to Stanford can undo the trauma of being a poor person of color in America. I seriously wonder if I can pick myself back up again. Stanford was home for me but I think it might be for me. We talk about privilege but don’t talk about the serious detriments it on healing and failure. I wonder if I should do it here or elsewhere. I don’t really don’t have much to look forward to in life. I am irreparably damaged.",1611298229,1,0

I'm currently a senior (i've taken a few gap quarters so i still have time to apply for coterm) majoring in symsys (hci) and was heavily considering coterming in cs (also hci).

The only problem is my cs gpa--im more or less a straight B's student in cs, so it's basically a 3.0. I think (if this quarter goes well) i'll be able to secure all 3 recs from cs professors and can also write a mad essay, so i was wondering what yall think? By the end of this quarter if i can get an A in this one cs class im in, i would have a 3.1 or 3.2 cs gpa, if that is of any note. I just feel like im grasping at straws trying to figure out a path to pursue (grad vs industry) and the tryhard in me kind of feels reluctant to give up, even if that might be the clearer option.

Wealth was something some had and some didn’t but it wasn’t the overriding criterion of anything.  You were judged by a lot of factors above and beyond money."" 

Among my alumni circle from the 1970s-80s, how rich you've gotten isn't very important, what's important is that you are successful in whatever field you chose and continue to achieve (lifelong duck syndrome even if you've become fat as a goose). 

Does that attitude still hold among current students and recent alumni? Or has the rise of Silicon Valley and venture capital turned Stanford into a place where making it rich is the primary goal, hence the great concentration of CS majors?",1611177708,2,0

what to do about severe social anxiety and participation grade?,"(i tried asking about this on more general subreddits but the most common response i got was: ""what kind of college grades you on how many times you talk in class?!??"" so i came straight to the stanford subreddit to get more direct advice. i'm sorry if it isn't really relevant). 

just to be concise, i have severe social anxiety. it's a miracle i was able to get into stanford given how severe it is (at the beginning of high school i could barely write emails). throughout hs, i got several b's and a-'s directly due to my social anxiety and inability to talk to teachers (ie: one teacher fucked up inputting my grade, but i was too scared to tell them). none of the teachers who wrote my recs knew me at all (they basically made me tell them what to write). the only reason i was able to get in was because i excelled in a couple of solitary activities. 

i thought that in college, i wouldn't be graded on participation anymore, but that isn't true. I've only been here for one quarter and have already lost a decent bit of my GPA due directly to not participating in Zoom calls (I tried really hard though, talked as much as I could :( ) all my classes this quarter grade on participation (my dumbass took introsems/seminars). it's really been taking a mental toll on me. i shake during all my zoom calls, get terrible nausea all throughout the days i have class. 

i've never believed in contacting my teachers to tell them about my social anxiety. i've always thought of it as my disease that i should take accountability for and that i don't deserve accomodations for my deficits, but honestly i can't really take it anymore. i've been getting professional help for a while now but nothing is working. i've been really hard on myself and pushing myself to get better, but it's not enough. the participation grade does not push me to talk, it just agitates and depresses me even further. 

i'm wondering if i should contact my profs/ta's about this or if it's highly unfair and inappropriate. obviously social anxiety is a larger problem that destroys my life and i need to seek deeper help, but for now, it would really help if i didn't have to live with the constant pressure of needing to participate in class.",1611098778,2,0

Question on Summer 2021 from a confused frosh,"Hey everyone,

I’m a Frosh and pretty confused on whether the university plans on allowing all Frosh and sophomores back on campus this summer to enroll full time (obviously barring deterioration in the COVID situation in Santa Clara), or if the Flex term/ Experiential Learning Opportunities rules still apply for everyone. For example, as a frosh, if I enrolled full time remotely during the fall, winter, and spring quarters, would I be able to enroll full time and take classes while on campus during the summer, or do I still have to take a flex term and have an experiential learning opportunity (ELO) to get on campus? 

I’m pretty sure the summer class schedule this year is much more extensive than previous years so I think it would be possible to enroll full time, but I’m wondering if I’d be allowed to do so. If not, time to rush to get an ELO lined up lol. 

In my eyes, it would make sense for the university to try to get all or most frosh and sophomores on campus (pandemic conditions allowing) for at least one quarter of the academic year. Not to mention, they won’t have any high school students on campus this year, so that can potentially have an effect on the university’s on-campus capacity.

My teammates and I have designed a sound-based virtual coworking platform and we're looking to evaluate its effectiveness and usability with undergrads and graduate students who have experience visiting public spaces with others around (libraries, coffee shops, etc.) to study or do their work.

If you're interested in volunteering, you will participate in a two-part research study. The two sessions will take place on separate days, and each session will last up to 1.5 hours max. You will be asked to complete three different tasks while using the virtual coworking space and a comparable system. With your permission, we will also ask you to take a screen recording and screenshots while using our system for a small portion of the session. At the end, you will answer questions about your experience with using our system.

Does anyone know how to turn off (or break) the radiators in the highrise apartments?,"I apologize if this is not the place for this post, but I'm blaming any and all poor judgement on the unnatural temperature of my apartment actively melting my brain. 

&amp;#x200B;

It continues to get hotter outside and for some ungodly reason my radiator is still putting out insane heat. I generally have a pretty high tolerance for hot temperatures but I've been sweating like a pig all day and I'm nearing my breaking point. I have no idea why the radiator is set to be going at full force right now with the weather being what it is, but my roommate's radiator isn't on so that makes me think there must be a way to stop it and I'm just too stupid to figure it out. The thermostat in the kitchen is set to 60 but doesn't seem to do anything.

Dating in grad school?,"Hey folks, I'm a second year grad student here! I've been super excited to finally be living on campus since January.

I did my undergrad in the American South East (tryna be vague b/c I'm sure someone here knows my real name :) ) in which many folks 1) had that undergrad, ephemeral, unhealthy relationship vibe or 2) didn't know what they were looking for.

In grad school, especially at Stanford, my classmates/labmates/etc. seem much more grounded and know themselves and their relationship/friendship 'wants' a lot better. In general, how would you say the folks in Stanford grad programs view dating? I know tons of folks who find their life partner here and go on to do great things together through a happy relationship and mutually-beneficial professional support system.

I am interested in someone who works in one of my labs. (We don't work in the same project/scope/bubble and I **don't** want to make things feel weird for us.) We've been friends for a few months, chatting on and off, finding a time to hang out in the next week or so. What do you think the best way to approach this situation would be? I would like to be friends regardless.

What Makes Stanford Unique To You?,"Hey everyone,

I'm just a kid that's really interested in Stanford, and I wanted to get to know the place on a better level, (something I can't really do physically due to the current situation).

This leads to my question; if you don't mind sharing, what are some of the things (clubs, traditions, events) that you think make Stanford unique?

We all know that Stanford has a million opportunities to enrich oneself and all, but you can find most of those anywhere if you really search hard enough. What makes Stanford different (culturally, individually, and value-wise rather than academically/sport-wise) from every other place in the world?

As an example, I really love cooking (among scientific research, computer science, french, etc.), so something like ""Cottage Cheese"", where I can meet new people and practice my cooking skills, is an event native to Stanford that I'd resonate with.

I know that there are other things floating around like ""The Marriage Pact"" and whatnot, which are also pretty fun.

Bad to Take Two Math Classes Pass Fail Back to Back?,"Hey guys,

So I’m a freshman and I took Math 21 pass/fail last quarter. In hindsight that was a mistake because I ended up doing okay, but they didn’t curve until the end of the class so oh well. 
I’m taking Math 51 right now and I am bombing the class. I have never studied more for a class in my life but although I love math, it has just never come naturally to me. The online format definitely isn’t helping.
I want to major in some combo of CS and MS&amp;E and I hope to eventually go on the business school. Would it be a bad idea if I took 51 pass/fail, especially since I took 21 pass/fail last quarter? I’m not sure how that will look on a transcript, but I don’t want this class to destroy my GPA.

As a side note to any CS majors out there, how important is Math 51 to the major? I feel like I understand all the concepts, but as I said I just don’t have an affinity for math. Will this be a problem going forward in the CS major?
