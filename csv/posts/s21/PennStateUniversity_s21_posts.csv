Wellness Day is a Failure,"The first Wellness Day is tomorrow, a Tuesday. My only class I have tomorrow is PHYS 251, which is supposed to be a synchronous class, but the professor decided to make it 90% asynchronous anyway. This means lots of videos and busy work. 

I still have things to do for this class TODAY and Wednesday (despite neither being on the assigned Tues/Thurs day designated by LionPath). I essentially have to do things for this class  early EVERY DAY despite only being present on my schedule for two days. Wellness Day should account for this, but it does not. This is just one example, but I know lots of other students have this type of issue.

Seriously, Wellness Days are a flop and don‚Äôt work at all. They should have pushed back Spring Break into Week 11/12 and made the time after that remote only. What a mess.",1612805886,1,0

Class Changing Days of Asynchronous Lectures on a Weekly Basis,"I was wondering, does anybody else have an experience where their professor changes what days they expect you to watch their asynchronous lectures and do assigned work for them on a weekly basis? I scheduled my PHYS 251 class for 1:35-2:25 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, my professor has us watch the lectures on days other than this. For example, this week, we were expected to watch lectures on Monday and Tuesday, instead of Tuesday and Thursday like I scheduled. Next week, we are supposed to watch the lectures on Monday and Wednesday.  All this does is force me into doing more work on days that I specifically scheduled not to have more work on, and I feel like this is not fair.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I was not aware the class was going to be asynchronous when I scheduled it, as it did not say ""Web"" like my other asynchronous classes have before, and gave me specific times and days to have it put into my schedule.",1612320033,4,0

"Wellness Days Concerns, Exemptions, and Violations","tl; dr: Concerns about Wellness Days? Email Dr. Seymour ([ems22@psu.edu](mailto:ems22@psu.edu)) and myself ([StudentLifeChair@psu.edu](mailto:StudentLifeChair@psu.edu)) or use this form: tinyurl.com/PSUSenateForm but email is preferred. Some classes have exemptions. 

Mods: A mod reached out to me to make sure I was legit. I told them I am. I still am. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am speaking personally and not on behalf of Senate or the University, but I wanted to share a few things about Wellness Days. There seems to be some miscommunication about how they work, specifically regarding exemptions. I am one of the people who receive the complaints/concerns about potential violations. All but one complaint thus far have been about classes with exemptions. The emails usually include something about how it is unfair to have class on that day, etc. If you have class on a wellness day, or if you know someone who does, they are welcome to send an email to Dr. Elizabeth Seymour ([ems22@psu.edu](mailto:ems22@psu.edu)) and/or me ([StudentLifeChair@psu.edu](mailto:StudentLifeChair@psu.edu)). If you prefer anonymity, you can also use this form:   

[tinyurl.com/PSUSenateForm](https://tinyurl.com/PSUSenateForm) (Sorry, there is no dedicated @psu page for the form; I'm trying to get this to happen)

You can use this form for all sorts of concerns about Faculty Senate rule violations (e.g., having assessments worth more than 10% on the week before finals; not receiving a syllabus), but you can also use it for wellness day violations. You do not have to leave contact information unless you want to be contacted. It does require you to be signed into PSU, but we are not collecting email addresses. 

Please know that the form is rarely used, so I sometimes forget to check it. Using the above email is the fastest way to reach us about wellness days. 

Concerning the process. If you email us, you will receive a response with some basic information. Exemptions were handled at the unit level, so we generally forward your email to the appropriate contact in the appropriate unit and CC you on that. We do have a list of all exempted classes. 

The email you receive will note that the ""exemption process is rigorous and granted only in cases where either student learning and progression in future classes would suffer, or it is required based on accreditation."" 

Some lab sections are exemptions because only one group of students would miss lab that week. For example, if there are labs on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday but the Wellness Day is a Wednesday, then one group would miss lab. Some exemptions are due to accreditation. I know that some nursing courses, student teaching, and a few other courses will fall under this exemption. 

I can try to answer questions if you have them, but please know that I had nothing to do with establishing Wellness Days. I cannot give you a huge amount of background on that.  I just volunteered to respond to emails.",1612290362,13,0

Student Employee Opportunities?,"Hello! 
Sorry if this question has been asked before! I'm a prospective student and am curious if anyone can tell me about possible jobs available to students at Penn State.

How is Penn State World Campus? Any online students here?,"Hey, I graduated high school in May 2020 and because of the pandemic I took a partial gap year. Planning to do my whole undergrad online (personal reasons, I enjoy online school).¬†

Question about certain majors,"Hi, I'm applying to PSU university park as the class of 2025, and I had some questions about certain majors/academic plans that I can't seem to choose between. I was hoping some people on this sub could give me some advice/personal experience on them so that I can be more informed about my decision. The ones I am looking at are listed below in no particular order, with a brief description of why.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Astrophysics: Always have been interested in doing research and learning everything there is to know about space, I love everything about it. I have also looked at what an astrophysicist's job consists of (writing code, analyzing data, reading and writing research papers, giving lectures and teaching) and all of that stuff sound like things I would love to do. The drawbacks as I see them are that you practically need a Ph.D to actually do any of that stuff, so I would have to go to graduate school. I'd love to go to grad school for astro to do research, and totally would, but I would like to know what I could do with a B.S in astro in a scenario where that isn't an option.
2. Physics (Electronics or Computational track) Just like astrophysics, I am very intersted in physics in general, when I looked on PSU's website for more info about physics majors, I found that there were two academic tracks that immediately caught my attention, computational and electronics. If I majored in either of these, Id like to most likely go on to grad school for physics and work on quantum computing. I'd like to know more about both of them if anyone has any experience taking either of them, what are the classes like, what do you learn and do, what are you doing/planning on doing after college with your degree?
3. Computer engineering: chose this because I want to learn more about computer architecture and design, and how code interacts with hardware to make computers work. Love working with circuits, building PC's, and programming, so I definitely think that I would enjoy computer engineering. I was wondering what the classes were like in CMPEN and if it's more software focused like computer science or more hardware focused like EE.

Practically any info on any number of these majors helps a lot (enjoyment, what classes are like, where you are right now if you are/were in the major)

I'd also like to know if anyone would recommend double majoring/minoring in something if I choose one of these majors.

Note: I am going to apply to SHC if that makes any difference.",1612037137,1,0

Kashrut at PSU Harrisburg - update,"I am the OP of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/l703g8/is_anything_on_the_standard_psu_menu_kosher/). I got an update from the university:

As you can see, the campus has absolutely no items that are certified kosher, which radically sets it apart from the example set by UPark. While this doesn't affect me as much as it could - I have the privilege of living in the dorms that have kitchens - I think this isn't appropriate.

While making the entire kitchen follow kashrut is simply unreasonable as it would place the strict limit on all meals prepared on it, it may be a good idea to search for a solution that would allow Jewish students enjoy a meal at Stacks along with their friends.

I am posting this update to **inform** any future or current students of PSU Harrisburg that the dining options on campus do not follow kashrut laws - and maybe bring in any ideas on how this problem may be solved in the future.",1611940011,1,0

What happens if you don't get tested for covid?,"According to PSU, all students planning on living on campus or attending in-person classes need a negative COVID test. Ok, makes sense.

I am near a campus but all my classes are online and I will not be going to campus (probably ever again, since I am graduating). 

PSU says students who do not get tested will not be able to move onto campus or participate in on-campus activities until they complete the testing process.¬†So why do fully remote and World Campus students need to be tested if they were not going to campus anyways? Does the office of student conduct become notified if you don't get tested, like they did in the fall if you skipped random testing?

Cata buses should warn us when they‚Äôre taking a break / stopping for more than a minute,"Scenario 1: you‚Äôre waiting at a stop because it‚Äôll cut a few minutes off your walk to take the bus and the bus is only a few stops away. It‚Äôs taking a while but you stay there because it‚Äôll still be quicker than walking. It‚Äôs still not there so you check the tracker and it hasn‚Äôt moved from the previous stop. Now you have to run to wherever it is you‚Äôre going and you‚Äôll probably be late anyway.

Scenario 2: the buses run in loops so overall you‚Äôre on the bus a greater distance than you would‚Äôve had to walk, but it‚Äôll still get there faster so you‚Äôre on the bus. The bus drives halfway around its route and stops, meaning you‚Äôre now further away from your destination than you were to start. They‚Äôre taking a break but by the time you realize it, you have to decide if you‚Äôre going to wait it out and see if you still possibly make it on time, or get off the bus and run, knowing you are definitely going to be late.

I get buses aren‚Äôt perfect and I understand drivers need breaks but these random periods where they just stop and sit there for 15 minutes while we have no clue is wildly inconsiderate. At least tell us if you‚Äôre not moving for the next 10 minutes so we can get off and run as fast as we can??? There should be some indicator on the tracker apps or something. PLEASE",1613872579,0,0

Professors making everything harder because they assume we‚Äôre cheating over zoom while not allowing open notes / giving us the benefit of the doubt and keeping existing procedures the same,"Ok I totally get that cheating goes on sometimes. However, why do we sign academic integrity contracts / complete the modules at all if the way classes are structured is meant to assume that we are cheating and thus they make everything as convoluted as possible to outsmart the few who dare to use the Internet when they‚Äôre not supposed to? My one class has historically selected one problem exactly from each of the homeworks to use for weekly quizzes, just to make sure people are keeping up with content, but with the pandemic, they got rid of that and pull problems out of thin air so that we can‚Äôt ‚Äúcheat‚Äù?? If we did the homework and can demonstrate we understand how the problem works I don‚Äôt understand why this policy needed to change / how anything is different with the pandemic to make everything more difficult.

The people who do the work to do well in a class are ultimately gonna do well in a class while the people who don‚Äôt are ultimately not going to do as well. Wasn‚Äôt there a statistic somewhere that even with the pandemic and everything being moved online, grades did not overall improve / inflate and the distribution of averages largely remained the same as in previous semesters? If everyone was suddenly getting straight a‚Äôs I‚Äôd get these measures but it just seems unnecessary.

Yes, I also understand that a good understanding of course material should mean none of the changes should really impact you that negatively but why make things more arbitrarily difficult than they have to be just for the sake of trying to catch the dishonest few off guard?

TL;DR: We sign academic integrity papers to say we won‚Äôt cheat but then they make classes harder than they have been in the past because of the assumption we ARE cheating. How does this make any sense?",1613774325,1,0

After looking at some rankings, it is consistently in the top 5 across several lists I have looked at. Should I enroll at PSU, the alumni network would frankly be one of the main reasons I would do so. All of this considered, my main question to you guys is: how big of a help has the alumni network been for students/alums in landing internships/jobs/promotions? Do you think that you have ever gotten an internship/job/promotion because you went/go to Penn State? Also, if this applies to you, do you encounter a lot of Penn State alumni at work outside of the state of Pennsylvania? Thank you for any help I really appreciate it!",1613403126,1,0

"I Was Told Straight to my face to reconsider my CS degree by a CS Graduate/Late Undergrad student, should I do so?","I was recently told the following in response to a comment i made on a forum, I am a quire inexperienced programmer who only knows basic java and other basic concepts. I recently was accepted into Penn state's School of engineering, in order to pursue a computer science degree. I took 2 AP CS classes in high school and thought it was right for me since I had aced both of them. Though i have to stress my knowledge compared to a grad school student and a professional is minimal. I know how to use java (Write Methods &amp; Classes, Use Recursion, Understand Linear and Binary Search and have a basic comprehension of Sorting Algorithms like Mergesort and more.) But i have basically no experience in any other languages. I'm clearly a beginner and need a lot of time to learn and grow. I'm clearly not the best right now. But I do try as hard as i can. 

While talking on a forum, one which was not related to CS, and I made a comment about how a lot of cool things have been done with CS such as finding prime numbers for keys, or finding answers for the Traveling salesman problem. (I was listing stuff off to sound cool. I was just trying to mention cool things about the internet and computers in general I had learned from others, I will admit it partially was nothing less than a horrific attempt at a flex, but the other reason i made the comment was because i was genuinely excited about how the subject of Computer Science and particularly deep learning was brought up at the time in conversation. A lot of people liked the comment. I've since deleted it however due to one person, a CS graduate/late undergrad responded said that AI could do anything if you had the right software/hardware, and i responded no. (The subject was about AI being used to design roller coasters of all things) The summary of my response what that I told him that The creativity needed made the task difficult or impossible, considering you have to work with the the amusement park building the roller coaster... as well as the fact that much of coaster design also uses specific elements and manuvers. (Hills, Loops, Barrel rolls, and other specific track maneuvers) Although preset moves and elements could make it easier to design a coaster, an AI must be trained to use these preset moves, and build the track to follow them, as well as fit within local height and building regulations. However, he felt I did not know what I was talking about (He was right in the sense I was inexperienced) 

""You clearly never heard of GPT-3. And you in general don't seem to have a solid grasp on what neural networks do and how they do it. You are indeed just a guy who is going to study computer science. So why do you make such a solid statements without even using language like ""probably"" and ""in my opinion""? Computers are not creative... get a load of this guy! The defining features of AI as a problem solving tool is being outrageously creative and having unlimited capacity for thinking outside the box. Let's be real, you know absolutely nothing about AI. Can you even program in C++ or Python, can you make something practical that's not a compilation of cs grad memes? And you have to ask yourself, why did you choose this studying/career path if this isn't a topic of your interest, considering you aren't already proficient and knowledgeable on your own?""

So, should I change careers, How much CS experience do I need to start it first year? Should i know more coding languages? What should i do to help myself? How correct is he? Again, I'm inexperience and about to start as a 1st year undergrad. I still want to have a career? But am I really Better off mopping floors? I want to work in STEM? But am I Not cut out? Any advice is fine! I just want to know what to do here...",1613351768,1,0

WHY DO THREE-HOUR CLASSES STILL EXIST?!,"Seriously?! I have a once-a-week 3-hour LECTURE on zoom and it's the most useless type of class I've ever attended. I mean absolute no disrespect to the professor because he takes an effort to be as engaging and meticulous in his teaching. We've already had a month of school but every session we have, 5-6 people out of a leave around the halfway mark. Why not split the class up into 1 1/2 hour classes for two days a week so students could actually participate the full length of the classes? It's clear that students are leaving because they can't take a minute more of the same subject for more than 2 hours, and if they don't leave, they might as well be afk or on their phone during zoom. This makes me frustrated, even though it might seem like a minuscule problem, but I want to learn the best way I can. Hopefully, I'm not alone in this frustration.",1613220108,1,0

State Paddy‚Äôs Day Question,[deleted],1614435571,0,0
Should I graduate a year early or stay to complete a thesis?,"Junior pure math major here. I am in a dilemma over whether to stay an additional year to complete an honors thesis or to complete a couple of major-specific courses over the summer that will allow me to graduate two semesters early, albeit without the honors designation. Any advice from those who have been at such a turning point and have chosen either route will be appreciated.

So by the end of this spring semester I will likely have 129 PSU credits to my name with all the upper-level honors credit requirements met and only a couple of electives remaining to take. I can possibly take CMPSC 451 and MATH 484/486 over the summer to meet this final requirement toward completing the credits required by my computer science minor and math major respectively. Both of these courses have been listed in the summer 2021 catalogue; thus, scheduling is a non-issue. This option, which I deem 'route A', will save me around 55K that would otherwise be required for an additional year at PSU (I'm an international student and so the tuition costs are higher) and not to mention that it will help me graduate a year early. However, I will not be able to graduate with the honors designation if I go down this path.

The second option that I have, let's call it 'route B', is to finish up my thesis proposal this semester and work toward completing a thesis over the entirety of next year, which would possibly include the summer. I believe having a thesis to place on my resume will be a plus if I were applying to graduate schools. Since I have been taking some graduate level classes over the past year, the option of applying to math Ph.D. programs is still open for me but I am unsure if I will be able to say the same if I were to choose 'route A'.

I am not terribly fond of the idea of doing research and staying as an undergraduate for an additional year solely for completing my thesis, primarily because I am going to have to take out a loan to pay for tuition and other costs. I have also begun to have second thoughts on whether I really want to go into Ph.D. programs for math since I am quite burnt-out from cramming a lot of math classes into the past few semesters. But since I do not have any internship experience, which I suppose is of paramount importance for job-seeking in the US, and looking at how my country provides few, if any, opportunities for math majors, I cannot see any reliable career-options to select from other than to go down 'route B'.

Thus, I would greatly appreciate any advice from those who are or who have been in a situation similar to mine. Did you choose to complete your undergraduate thesis or were you sated graduating without the honors designation? Why did you select your particular route?",1614427149,5,1

&amp;#x200B;

\- **How do I find out about events going on around campus?**

For career/academic events, keep an eye on your Penn State email. Your college and most organizations on campus are pretty desperate for people to go to their events - so go to them! You'll probably get emails from your college, Penn State Today, the Multicultural Resource Center, and more on a regular basis. You'll also find flyers in your residence hall, commons buildings, and almost every bulletin board on campus.

For other events, most organizations make a semi-decent effort to publicize their events, and by signing up for some email lists at the involvement fair (please go) you'll end up on their lists for event outreach. Don't be that dude who signs your friend up for every single club's email list, though.

Lastly, restrooms in the HUB, residence halls, and certain other buildings have event-related newsletters posted in each stall. Some nice reading while you do your business!

&amp;#x200B;

**- How do I connect to \[x\] WiFi network?**

For students, go [here](http://wireless.psu.edu/wireless.html) for your main devices and [here](https://roomgear.psu.edu/guest/roomgear.php?_browser=1) for your dorm-related smart devices. For guests, if you're a university student, [eduroam](https://www.incommon.org/eduroam/) is probably the way to go (it likely works with your own university's login). For visitors, try connecting to the new [psu-guest](https://wireless.psu.edu/visitorwireless_alt.html) network on campus.

&amp;#x200B;

**- What are the job or internship prospects for my major?**

It greatly varies - and it depends on the person. Penn State boasts the largest alumni network in the world, and looking for Penn State alumni at companies you apply for is helpful - especially recruiters. Most departments and colleges maintain some kind of job statistics database and career assistance program, so try looking there for resources like how to write a resume, how to apply for jobs, and etc. I will say the [IST career site](https://ist.psu.edu/current/careers) is the best of them all though. Overall, you determine your own future, and Penn State will only help you with that.

&amp;#x200B;

**- How do I get help with my classes?**

There's a ton of resources on campus to help you out with classes if you're struggling or need help. Professors usually offer TAs, office hours, tutoring, and maybe even a message board to help you succeed in their courses. Past that, [Penn State Tutoring](https://pennstatelearning.psu.edu/), [LionTutors](https://penn.liontutors.com/), and others are great resources. Your tuition is paying for Penn State Tutoring, TAs, and office hours, so make sure to make the most out of those.

&amp;#x200B;

**- What do I do if I'm going to fail a course?**

Easy answer: you should drop or late drop it, if you've already tried your best to improve. Keep in mind there are deadlines for dropping and late dropping (see the [Academic Calendar](http://www.registrar.psu.edu/academic-calendars/) for details) and that LDs appear on your transcript. Employers typically don't mind 1-2 non-major-related late drops, but more than that will probably hurt. Do keep in mind your GPA and your financial aid when looking at dropping a course though - as well as losing full time status below 12 credits. If you can't late drop or drop the course, look at [grade forgiveness](https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/H-2-undergraduate-grade-forgiveness.html) \- a great new policy that only recently came through.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **How do I check my academic requirements?**

A simple Google Search for ""psu academic requirements (major)"" will usually do the trick - each college has lists of ETM and major requirements for each of their majors! To easily check your progress towards the requirements, you can create a What-If Report in LionPATH that will tell you what your progress is :)

&amp;#x200B;

\- **What are the best dorms on campus?**

That's a really subjective question, and everyone has their own opinion on it. While we do plan for a post covering this extensively eventually, here's a quick summary of the pros and cons of each residence area (if you have any suggestions for additions, let us know):

East Halls

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Mostly Renovated|Distant From Most Of Campus|
|Freshman Only|Some Unrenovated Dorms|
|Lots Going On|Oftentimes Noisy|

West Halls

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Close to Engineering/IST/Library/HUB|Far from Beaver Stadium|
|Quiet|Not as much going on|
|Superior cookies and paninis|Relatively Unrenovated|

North Halls

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Quiet AF|Meh Food|
|Close to Business/Arts/etc|Far From Downtown|
|Suite-Style Dorms|Expensive $$$$$$|
|Individual Bathrooms|No ""Freshman Dorms"" Experience|
|Renovated Dorms|Tiny Commons|

South / Pollock Halls (they're like the same area lmao)

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Lots Going On|Pollock is like living in the 1960s. The dorms are that bad.|
|Next to Downtown|South = Honors Dorms (quiet af)|
|Sorority Central ;)|Tall Bois|
|South Renovated = nice|Traditional-Style Dorms|
|Great Food|Tiny Dorms|

&amp;#x200B;

**- I got into \[x\] branch campus and want to go to University Park. Can I transfer?**

Short answer: no, otherwise branch campuses would be a ghost town. You probably won't be able to switch to main campus until junior year (2+2 plan) so make the most out of your two years at your branch. Most branch campuses have their redeeming characteristics - particularly Behrend - and you can live your college life to the fullest at a branch campus just as well. Main campus is no further than three or four hours from any branch, so you can still drive up to main for football, partying, and to get the Penn State experience.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **What are my chances of getting in?**

In terms of University Park, the relative agreement is that you need at least a 1160 SAT, 25 ACT, and 3.0 GPA to get in. Results vary widely, though - [Niche](https://www.niche.com/colleges/penn-state/) has a ton of stats on your relative chances of getting in with your specific SAT, ACT, and GPA. They also like to see a decent mix of extracurriculars to know you're not a boring fuck, but the fact that admissions is rolling and there's no essay makes for a relatively easy application.

In terms of Schreyers, it gets a hella lot more competitive. Expect to need a 3.8 or above GPA, a 1450 or above SAT, 30 or above ACT, and stellar extracurriculars to get into Schreyers. You'll also need to write essays and go through an interview to be considered. The benefits are nice, though - you get cushy dorms, great advisors, the chance to do research and publish a thesis, and tons of scholarship money.

Branch campus requirements vary widely, so again, check Niche for the stats on your branch campus. The common conception is that getting into a branch campus is relatively easy, to the point where some branches are more community colleges than actual branches, so you shouldn't have too much of an issue unless you're doing law or medical school or something.

&amp;#x200B;

**- Best Gen Ed Classes?**

This is a very subjective question and dependent on what you enjoy. I'll add links soon, but some well known ones include ASTRO 7N and EGEE 101. A quick Google search will give you lists upon lists of others, but do be aware that it is very highly dependent on what you enjoy and what you're looking to learn from gen eds.

If so, will tuition rise? Thank you so much for your time, and I appreciate your willingness to help!",1614214278,4,0

Advice: Should I Come Now?,"i know that this may be a dumb question to ask on this subreddit, but i got into Penn State University Park (major in Comp Sci) and i‚Äôm wondering if i should attend now, or go to a community college for two years and transfer in.

basically my options are these

1. Go to community college for two years and transfer and spend my last two years or three (not sure exactly how it would turn out) at university park (hopefully if i get accepted for transfer). if i did this, my family would support me going to grad school and be more willing to support me financially when i get out of college for a while if i needed it.

2. Go to Penn State University Park for 4 years, graduate with bachelors, but my family won‚Äôt pay for any grad school and won‚Äôt really help me financially after college because i spent so much extra money (like triple the price for my first two years)

my family is kinda pushing me towards community college, but i‚Äôm not sure. either way i could have my 4 year degree, it‚Äôs just a difference of how much i have left to use after i get out. any honest advice or information that you think i would find useful would be great! thanks!

"How should I design this rotation mechanism, or alter it, for, my team's ""elevation wheelchair""?","  For any of you engineers out there, student or not, familiar with SolidWorks or CAD in general, do you have any recommendations or any comments on my CAD design of this rotation seat?

For my Engineering Design class (EDSGN 100), me and my team are building an ""elevation wheelchair"", which implies that the seat elevates by specifically 3 feet. I know that might sound challenging, but it's only a project. We already designed an elevation track system for the elevation mechanism, but we also wanted to add a 360 degree rotation mechanism like the one in the picture of my CAD design I added in. Do you think we can rotate the chair 360 degrees, or can we only rotate it, for instance, 180 degrees? Please respond because we're supposed to get asynchronous interview feedback :)

LAing for Yanling Wang,"I'm a rising sophomore majoring in computer science and I'm planning to be a Learning Assistant and/or grader in Fall 2021.

I had wang for 131 so I know I wanna avoid LAing for her at all costs (but I can still grade for 131?)

Before you ask what I‚Äôm passionate about, I haven‚Äôt taken a single stat course in my life, but I was wondering if I should still switch to computational DS.

This is honestly because it‚Äôs much easier form what I‚Äôm gathering. Also the job prospects look better considering I‚Äôm an international student . Data Science is giving me knowledge I can apply right outta college. With CS I‚Äôm getting a theoretical degree with many avenues but no guaranteed path. Like idk how the fuck I‚Äôm gonna apply my CS degree but I can already see applications for DS.

What‚Äôs the right move? What has better job prospects. As far as passion goes. I think I‚Äôll like both the same. However if I start hating CS after 311 or 360 as I‚Äôve come to notice many do, it‚Äôs gonna be HARD to change majors.

Reasons to declare a major,"Hi,
I'm hoping to double major (neither are admin controlled) and at the end of this semester I will have met the requirements for one of those majors but not the other. I'm a freshman currently.

The only thing I've been able to find is locking in requirements in case they change in the future, but I really doubt that would be an issue.

I know the obvious response is to talk to my advisor but: 1. both of my desired majors are in the College of Science and I'm currently in the College of Engineering 2. every time I've asked my advisor about this major they've essentially said ""oh that's cool, I'm sure there's somebody who would know about that"" and nothing else.

"In a difficult financial situation, any suggestions?","I committed to Penn State a few days ago, but I am now realizing this out-of-state tuition isn‚Äôt going to work. It‚Äôs around $50,000, and even with the FAFSA, that knocks it down to about $45k.

Doing some research, I found that I‚Äôd have to pay around $140k in student loan debt after college, and with a degree in aerospace engineering, I‚Äôm going to live very poorly for a few years of my life in order to repay that.

Just wondering what options I have. Already considered moving to Pennsylvania to get in-state tuition, but that‚Äôs not going to work for several reasons. My state doesn‚Äôt offer aerospace engineering at any of its colleges, and this is a field I am SUPER passionate about, so I‚Äôm not willing to change majors (unless absolutely necessary). Penn State doesn‚Äôt have any good scholarships to help pay (at least from the research I did). I already declined the other colleges I got accepted into, as Penn State was my top choice (even so, those colleges were just as expensive).

Right now, I am 100% willing to live poorly for a few years in order to pursue aerospace, but of course that‚Äôs a pretty big thing to say and I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the best idea. I‚Äôm in a huge pickle and I‚Äôm not sure how to get out of it. Any advice or something I might have overlooked in my research is greatly appreciated.

Ramadan Mubarak in advance PennState :),"With finals starting soon I know many of you would be busy to visit Reddit so I thought this would be a good time to send my greetings and spread a bit of positivity.

Ramadan Mubarak. May Allah accept our fasts and prayers during this holy month.

Many people ask what is Ramadan? It is a month where the first words of revelation came to our Prophet (PBUH) during the last 10 nights of the month. This revelation is the Qur'an. It is a month where we do not eat or drink anything from sunrise to sunset. The reason for this fast is to experience God-consciousness and the hardship that the unfortunate face on a daily basis outside the month. This in turn creates gratitude within us by just staring the the bottle of water of plate on the table. Ramadan is also an opportunity to ask God anything we want. It's like a month where we repeat our wish list over and over again. The most important thing on that wish list is to ask for God's mercy, forgiveness, and blessings on us if we may have sinned or wronged people.

It is also a month, where enemies reunite in harmony and forget their past, where families spend good times with each other, and where people compete in charities.

Lastly, it is a month where people become disciplined in their lifestyles and become productive. It is a time where we can truly understand how valuable our bodies are and take care of them both physically and mentally. The fasts are very similar to intermittent fasting which is efficient for weight loss.

To those of you celebrating it, please remember that final exams happen 2-3 times a year but Ramadan happens only once a year. We all do not know if we may experience the next Ramadan, so let us spare some time for it along with of course revising. Here are some things you can do to make the most out of it:

1. Many people want to complete the Qur'an before the month ends. Well try to read at least 3 pages per day during your finals and then you can read more of it later. What matters is that we have to read the meanings and reflect on the verses. It is not the quantity but the quality of our reading that matters.
2. Try to pray the 5 daily prayers if you don't. Remember, we work about 12 hours a day to get something little in terms of income, while Allah is promising a place where you can have whatever you want, outside of our imagination, for eternity, if you only just dedicate 25 minutes per day and in intervals. It's easy. Also, try to make it a habit to get up for Fajr. Take baby steps. Try to become your better self.
3. Try to complete the Taraweeh and make any extra prayers. Remember, the rewards are multiplied.
4. Try to listen to some interesting lectures. Mufti Menk has some really cool and entertaining series every Ramadan.
5. Make dua for everything you want. Do not exit the month without seeking forgiveness.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pxvdav8gk4s61.png?width=1110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f034b6dd750dc9cb03a6d989175e124ce752e3e2

These are steps we all can follow (if we are celebrating). If you have any more suggestions please type in the comments.

I thought this is relevant to PennState content since a majority of students are celebrating the holy month and this is just a little motivation.

Good luck to all PennState students on finals and may Allah bless you and your families and grant us Jannah.",1617964136,1,0

How bad can I make an SRTE before the university contacts me?,"I have a professor I absolutely despise and the class makes it even worse. Basically this Professor's LA does 100% of the canvas work and the professor is putting some stupid acting show on, and is super fake and can't teach. Spends half the class complaining about incompetent co-workers when she's fucking incompetent herself. I'd love to write something like this in the SRTE (below). I will name the LA a different name for privacy sakes:

""This professor is so useless her LA does all the work for her, she's always like 'Oh Samuel can you grade that for me, Oh samuel can you change the due dates, Oh Samuel can you teach the class.' Next thing you know she's going to be saying, 'Oh samuel just have sex with me because my husband's cock sucks.

Transfer eligible?,"Hi,

My sister got into Penn State Erie. She has great stats and interned at NASA. Anyways, she's a Muslim and wears a hijab and has faced racism. Penn State Erie doesn't have a Spiritual Center like University Park does and barley any Muslims, let alone any Muslim women. She's nervous about going to Erie due to the lack of a religious facility and not being able to find a Muslim roommate. Ramadan, where Muslims fast for 30 days, will be during the Spring Semesters at Erie too.  Muslims pray 5 times a day and she needs to pray during school hours so a religious building a big asset. University Park's Pasquerilla Spiritual Center has a praying room for Muslim as well as hosting the Friday prayers (the Muslim church day) The Spiritual Center also celebrates Ramadan and has Muslim events. Penn State Dining Halls serve Halal food which is what Muslims can only eat. All, Penn State University allows my sister to practice her religion but Erie does not. Can she express this to the university and get a transfer?",1617815194,1,0

My ‚ú®critique‚ú® on the overall state of this sub and how it can be improved,"So I‚Äôve been a long time lurker here, say over a year now, and just recently created a Reddit account to post my own questions on this subreddit. And I personally feel like the quality of this sub has gone...down? It feels like the Penn State subreddit is less fun/enjoyable compared to other college/university subs I‚Äôve visited or lurked on. I have some free time on my hands, so I guess here are the biggest complaints I have so far on what the sub could do better:

- *Remove posts that have vague or clickbaity titles*. I‚Äôve seen so many posts recently that are not very helpful at all in being descriptive. It saves people a click when title posts are descriptive and it attracts people who are more knowledgable to provide a direct answer to question that‚Äôs being asked.

- *Remove posts that can be answered in the FAQ (and maybe provide a link to where that question is answered in the FAQ too?).* No shade but there have been multiple posts along the lines of ‚ÄúIs going into lifetime debt for Penn State worth it????‚Äù, ‚ÄúCan I switch my campus?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow is [Non-UP PSU branch campus] for [Some major]?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy should I choose Penn State?‚Äù and some others that straight up belong to r/chanceme. It‚Äôs really annoying to see these posts like these because they have been answered over and over yet they clutter the sub on weekly basis or at least exists a lot more than they should.

- *There are a lot of internationals in this sub that ask questions here* and I think it might be helpful to have maybe make thread for them to reference on admissions, life in State College, or have a general students admitted/accepted thread that I see other subreddits do.

- *And probably the most important point: the memes.* There used be chef‚Äôs kiss worthy memes and shitposts. Now they‚Äôre no more or rare. Bring them back pleeeease :(

So yeah, that‚Äôs it for now. 

I definitely don‚Äôt mean this post as an attack or a out down on the mods since I know they generously donate their own time moderating along with balancing their own academic and social life, but these are my own two cents. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk everyone. I hope maybe this starts a meaningful discussion and feel free to dunk on my opinions that I have as well.",1617758909,1,0

Is this fair/appropriate?,"So I‚Äôm taking a mandatory 400 level class online this semester. The class is taught in person but the professor goes live for those of us who are remote (the sound is awful though). When it comes to exams, the in-person students get to take a multiple choice exam with two or three, short open ended questions. The remote students have to answer two to three long, open ended questions with citations. The questions are extremely vague and the professor told us that they would be more difficult for the remote students. Does this seem fair? The in-person students got their exam results (one we took on Feb 17th) back last week but remote students still haven‚Äôt gotten anything back, and we have another exam next week. I‚Äôve had this professor before, he‚Äôs an awful teacher and the way he grades is so random, his directions are always so vague and when you ask him to specify he just rephrases the question in a way that makes even less sense. I don‚Äôt even want to ask him about this directly because he‚Äôd probably just get mad or take it out on the remote students‚Äô grades, I‚Äôm just very frustrated.",1615679728,1,0

I am an international student, and I would like to be able to apply for STEM OPT extension. I am currently an MIS major and I'm not sure if I should switch to IST. My two questions are:

1- I learned from several posts and Penn State's description of the major that IST prepares well for real-world technology solutions in businesses, emphasizing more the technical side relative to MIS. From MIS requirements, I believe (correct me if I'm wrong) that it will be more about the use of existing technology in business. Which one gives the broadest range of careers? Can an IST major be eligible for the job of an MIS major (say, business intelligence)? Do you recommend getting an MIS degree with a minor in IST or an IST degree with a minor in MIS?

2- Is MIS a STEM-designated degree at Penn State? I will also consider that to make the decision.

BS Computer science transfer credits questions,"Hi I am entering Junior year. I also plan to take a couple of courses in my local community college during summer and have checked the transfer credit tool already to see which courses in that college qualify.  

1. How many total credits do we need for BS Computer science for graduation. I know its more than 120 credits but where is the exact no of credits found. 
2. Also do these 120 above  credits **include ELIGIBLE transfer credits.** For example if 126 credits are required for BS Computer science to graduate how many should be taken at Penn State and how many can be transfers. What are the exact rules? (I do know that there are certain subjects in CS that has to be taken only at Penn state and that is mentioned in the handbook) 

The main answer I need is how many total credits required for BS Computer science and how many have to be at Penn state and how many can be transfer credits and what are exact rules for this.

How to select Honors Housing?,I‚Äôm an incoming freshman at Penn State and Schreyer and was wondering how you select the honors housing option on the eLiving website. Do I just select the Schreyer SLO as my first choice and leave it at that or am I supposed to fill out a separate application? I also selected the South Halls and double traditional rooms as my residence area preferences and selected special living option for preference ranking. Am I good to go to be placed in honors housing?,1620100989,1,0
SLOs,"I'm pretty interested in several SLOs, like Lion Launchpad, Discover and Schreyer honors houses.

Plus, what the percentage to get into those three SLOs, and could anyome share about their own experience.

How to search for apartments not targeted towards students?,"I am in the process of finding an apartment for after I graduate next week. From my experience as a student, many of the advertised apartments in State College are targeted at students.

Where can I search for apartments for the general public, graduates, etc? Much of what I find on apartments.com and Zillow include student housing (e.g., The Heights, Copper Beech, Vairo Village, The Valley, etc.).

Driving through State College, I have found several apartments (e.g., The Willows, Shamrock Apartments, Paramount Circle Apartments) that are not always listed on the usual apartment search websites.

Why does this sub shit on the 2+2 program so much?,"Every day I see posts such as ‚ÄúShould I go to Penn State if I have to go to Berks, Harrisburg, etc. before coming to UP?‚Äù.

From an education standpoint, the smaller campuses are much more friendly for your learning due to the smaller class sizes and the trend that professors tend to be more involved for that reason. 

From a social standpoint, if you can‚Äôt make friends or find a social life at a branch campus, there‚Äôs no way in hell going to UP is going to magically fix your inability to find friends.

From a financial standpoint, you‚Äôre not going to have to dump as much money into your education for an experience that likely will be somewhat on Zoom, if not mostly on Zoom, still due to the ongoing pandemic.

It‚Äôs almost like this sub is condescending towards people who go to branch campuses and shits on what they have to offer.

STEM rigor/taking many STEM classes freshman fall,"I'm  considering coming to Penn State vs Texas A&amp;M in the fall (I got an  extension on the enrollment deposit by a few days), and I had a question  which is important for me in choosing a college.

"Deciding between PSU, Rutgers honors, and Northeastern for a physics major","I‚Äôm very fortunate to have parents that are willing to help me out with my tuition. In fact they have saved 200k for all education. Whatever I don‚Äôt use for undergrad I can use for my masters (or put towards a house). I want to make sure I know what I‚Äôm getting into to justify the price.

Pros to Rutgers
Close to home (50 minutes)
Cheapest (26k a year; 105k total)
Good social scene (I‚Äôm somewhat into going out and partying) 
Both my parents went there
Close to Philly and NYC (for entertainment and for jobs)
Good alumni network

Cons
I didn‚Äôt love the vibe when I went there
Less academically rigorous than the other two
Rutgers NB is spread out over a bunch of campuses
Prestige and co-op program is lower than NEU
Huge classes/ not personal connection with professors


Pros to NEU
Boston is an awesome city with plenty of big tech companies right there
Co op program is great and I‚Äôd love to have some experience under my belt/ build my resume/ have my education built towards work
Enjoyed the campus and energy there. It felt like everyone was working towards something.
I‚Äôve heard 2 co ops would pay ~25k
Job right out of college

Cons
Price is 61k (245k)
Worried that with different co ops and study abroad opportunities it would be more difficult to make friends
Less of a social scene
No money for grad
Quite a hike to get to Boston (5 hours)
Not strong alumni network

Pros to PSU
Academically stronger than Rutgers for Physics
Love the campus and vibe there
I feel excited about the prospect of going there
Awesome social scene
Great alumni network
Could possibly change to instate although I haven‚Äôt looked into that too much 
2 of ny best friends are going

Cons to PSU
47k a year; 190 total
Not in honors for first year but will apply following year (didn‚Äôt apply)
Big classes 
3 hours away

Although my parents keep telling me that I should care less about the price, I can‚Äôt help but wonder is NEU 140k better than Rutgers and 50k better than PSU? The biggest pro to NEU is that I don‚Äôt know what I want to do yet and I feel that would be the best place to really be able to figure that out through co ops.

Are there any students in the College of Engineering and/or pursuing the Engineering Leadership Development minor interested in practicing and improving their leadership skills this semester by joining the Engineering Leadership Society?,"I wanted to let everyone know about the Consultant Competition we will be starting early this Spring semester. This will be an opportunity for you to work on real teams in ACM and DevPSU to practice and improve your Leadership and Project Management skills. These teams will have real clients who are trying to solve problems in their business/organization. You will receive monthly performance reviews based on your own progress reports and reviews by your team members in four categories: 

* Communication 
* Influence 
* Organization 
* ELS Presence 

Points will be tracked by the VP of Consulting and a Lead Consultant throughout the semester. Various winners will be announced in late April and will receive cash prizes! More information will be covered during the **Spring** **Consultant Kickoff** during the **second week of classes** where we will explain the competition at length. 

As mentioned, our primary outreach this semester will involve Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), an organization sponsoring DevPSU Startup where students will develop software solutions for nonprofits. ACM teams need Team Leads to act as project managers for their semester-long competition.

ELS Consultants **do not need background knowledge on software development.** Team Leads will be responsible for creating, delegating, and tracking project team tasks, offering guiding questions for team brainstorming and project progression, providing communication support, and keeping the team on track with project objectives. ELS‚Äôs Lead Consultants and VP of Consulting will be supporting Consultants in this work by providing informational workshops and monthly check-ins.

Sign-ups for a Team Lead position will be available until Wednesday (1/27). This will act as ELS Consulting‚Äôs primary outlet for Spring 2021 and will be the best way to acquire points for end-of-semester rewards!

If anyone is interested in this opportunity, DM me and I will send you the information for the first meeting this Wednesday and can add you to the mailing list.",1611604146,1,0

Is Transfering From a Branch Campus to World Campus Possible/Feasible when I am 1-2 Semesters From Graduation?,"Before I request info from WC and talk to my advisor, I was wondering if anyone here went through a similar situation or can tell me how feasible this plan is.


I originally started in the Nursing program but switched to Psychology (B.S.) in my 5th semester. Over the past couple of semesters not only have I felt a disconnect to ""how things were before,"" but I also got a part-time job in the field I want to go into. 


I am currently at an awkward point with the credits I need to graduate (because of my late major change and not passing a few courses), and ultimately, if I stay at my current campus (Altoona), I will not be able to graduate until this coming Fall Semester.


On top of worrying about paying for another semester (when I initially thought I would graduate this spring or summer), I also am considering getting a full time position at my job. This has also made me realize that the flexibility of World Campus would benefit me more than having to plan my classes around my work schedule. On top of this, I have a lot of downtime at this job and would be able to do pretty much as much coursework as I need during the shifts. This leaves the question.....

Is it too late for someone in my position to finish out my degree on World Campus? I know that you can't generally transfer to certain programs at other universities as a senior, but is this different because it is still in Penn State's ""network.""

Is EGEE 101 really that bad?,"So I struggled really badly this past fall during my first semester. I decided to take EGEE 101 because I heard it was an easy Gen Ed that could boost my GPA, but from looking at the RateMyProfessor reviews it seems like Professor Mathews doesn‚Äôt know how to teach the concepts and that it‚Äôs almost impossible to get higher than a B. 

According to others, his exams are timed so that you don‚Äôt even get a minute for each question, the multiple choice questions have extremely poor wording and are largely focused on small insignificant details, and that the most important part of each exam, the writing portion, is too complex to be answered properly in the time constraints. Despite being allowed to use a cheat sheet, that doesn‚Äôt seem to help one bit no matter how much content you fill it with. 

I‚Äôve heard EGEE 102 is better but I‚Äôve also seen many terrible reviews of the professor and that course apparently involves a lot of math, which is a weak subject for me. 

Is Professor Mathews course given a bad reputation or should I drop it and try to find a better Gen Ed?",1611203853,1,0
Volunteers to lead English as a Second Language Virtual Groups,"Hey everyone, we're trying to bring the International &amp; American Student Alliance (IASA), a student organization at multiple universities across the country, to Penn State and one of its biggest programs is English Clusters. This program provides free, non-credit English as a Second Language (ESL) workshops &amp; conversation hours to international students who want to practice/improve their English skills in a casual environment. These are led by students who are native (or at least near-fluent) English speakers and interested in volunteering to assist international students and/or gaining teaching experience.

Cluster topics can range anywhere from skill-based (i.e. pronunciation) to topic-based (i.e. American movies) to casual conversation-based (i.e. discussion of current events, practicing English by playing games). While the volunteer opportunities in this program are great for those studying to become English/ESL teachers or wanting to teach abroad, we still welcome those who are not. The type of Cluster that you would be able to lead (a more casual conversation hour format vs. one on focused on a specific skill) will depend on your background, knowledge, and experience, but anyone from freshmen to graduate students can participate.

For the Spring, all of these Clusters will be virtual and go from February through April. Clusters meet once a week for an hour and there's a lot of flexibility on the day/time that they can be led. In addition to these Clusters being open to all international students at Penn State, we're combining the English Clusters across all of the universities that our organization is at (i.e. NYU, Binghamton, Drexel, etc.) this Spring since most things are virtual anyway. This means that an international student here can participate in a Cluster led by someone at a different university, and vice-versa.

If leading one of the Clusters for this program sounds like something you might be interested in, visit uiasaa.com/cluster-leaders-info or dm me for more information!",1611199054,1,0

Strategies for Van Hook? (PHYS 251),"Day 2 of classes and this dude already makes me want to drop out of PHYS 251. I watched two lecture videos and done the post-lecture assignments, and have gotten only 75% on both of them, despite taking them both twice and taking notes. Granted, we haven't even had a real class lecture yet, but these post-lecture videos are due before then. I asked Van Hook for moving the post-lecture quizzes to AFTER the synchronous lectures are due, and he said no and it is my responsibility for rewatching the videos until I ""understand the content"".

If I said the same sentence to Van Hook a billion times in a language like Tagalog, this man would never, ever, understand what I was saying. But, by telling me to rewatch videos until I understood the content, he essentially is saying, ""yeah, I explained everything perfectly in those videos, and if you don't understand it, tough shit"". I am in the process of doing the homework on ExpertTA. Not only is it lengthy and tedious, it covers problems I do not know how to do yet, because the videos do a shit job at explaining these types of problems. Also, I already have a lab due Sunday I haven't even started, and I already feel confused and behind on concepts already and there is no support or way to get help because I'm just told to rewatch the videos and Inshallah until I understand.

Can I still cancel housing for this semester?,"Just got an email from a professor a couple hours ago letting us know that we won‚Äôt be returning to in person classes next week and that‚Äôd he‚Äôd revisit the decision in a month. That was my last in-person class, so now I‚Äôm fully online. At least until next month, but even then it‚Äôs a huge toss-up. I‚Äôd rather not pay all this extra money if I can‚Äôt actually go to any classes. 

Is it possible to cancel my hfs for this semester and get a refund? If so, how much for? I‚Äôll go to the housing office in the morning when they reopen, but I wanted to see if anyone here knows anything about my situation. 

Thanks in advance.",1613090794,1,0

Feel free to contact me with Wellness Day concerns,"Hello everyone, 

tl; dr: Send me an email at [StudentLifeChair@psu.edu](mailto:StudentLifeChair@psu.edu) if you have a concern about a potential violation of Wellness Days (e.g., a recorded lecture in lieu of class; required class; extra work). I cannot act on things that I do not know about. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I am posting this personally and not in any official capacity; I am not speaking on behalf of the University (I can't do that anyway) or Faculty Senate (I probably can't do that, either). I am just reaching out because of my relevant role.** 

I have replied to many of you individually, but I would encourage you to contact me at [StudentLifeChair@psu.edu](mailto:StudentLifeChair@psu.edu) (if you want verification about this contact, head to [wellnessdays.psu.edu](https://wellnessdays.psu.edu) and scroll down to ""What if my instructor schedules class, class activities, or a major assignment on a Wellness Day?""

Please let me know if you had a recorded lecture *in lieu of class*. So rather than having a Tuesday lecture as planned, you were told to watch the lecture video on your own time but probably before Thursday. I want to distinguish this from you being in a course that is asynchronous or using flipped classroom where outside lectures are just a normal part of class (essentially outside readings or outside preparation). Asynchronous courses also should observe Wellness Days in some fashion, but that can be done in a variety of ways. 

If you had assignments due on Tuesday, please let me know. You can also let me know if your Tuesday assignments were just pushed to Wednesday. Note that this would only be for a course held on Tuesday, not for a Wednesday course, though you are welcome to contact me about those, as well. 

If you were given **extra work** *because* of the Wellness Day, then please let me know. For example, if you ordinarily would have a short report due on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but you are told to submit two on Thursday, then let me know. This is not necessarily a violation of the policy, but it is helpful to know that is happening. 

Some classes had exemptions, and your instructor should have explained that to you. This would be the case for some lab sections and for courses that have accreditation/certification requirements (e.g., clinicals for nursing; student teaching). We have the list of exemptions. 

If you had something else that you think is a violation of Wellness Days, feel free to let me know. I can answer some questions here, but specific courses should go to the email address above. 

We might forward your email to a unit head or our designated contact for your course/campus location. We will not forward it to the instructor. If you wish for your email to me to remain confidential, just say so. I can copy and paste the content to send to the right people. 

Tell your friends who aren't on Reddit that they can do the same. 

Full disclosure, I did not design the policy and do not enforce it. My job is to put it in the right hands. There is little I can do without receiving emails. I also want you to know that people are listening.  Student groups have expressed concerns. I expressed concerns based on what I have read here, on Twitter, and what my students have told me. (To reiterate: **I am not in administration and cannot speak on behalf of the University or even Faculty Senate**\--I am speaking personally in my role as a Faculty Senator and as the chair of the Committee on Student Life, but I can't magically make all courses serve free coffee and pizza...I am happy to be an advocate, though).
