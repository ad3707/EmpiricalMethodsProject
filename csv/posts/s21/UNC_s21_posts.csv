Housing Priority Academic Class?,"So, evidently, I've been procrastinating on signing up for the housing lottery, and I have a quick question. Housing selection is based on our academic class in the registrar's system, correct? Is there any way to see what that is?

I mostly ask because I've lived on-campus four semesters and have completed 50 hours of credits at UNC at this point; I also have 44 hours of transfer credits. I'm mostly wondering if I'll be evaluated as a rising Junior because of the amount of time I've spent on campus and the credit hours I have actually completed here, or if I'll be seen as a senior since I have 94 credit hours total earned on my transcript.

trying to decide whether to live on or off-campus next year,"i'm a first year and i'm living on campus this semester and i've really been wanting to live off campus buttt im super unsure of what the right decision is. if i live off campus i have found a room in a house for rent that's cheaper than on campus, in a good location, and it's a nice space but i don't know my roommates. i worry i might be kind of isolated. living on campus is more expensive and i'd probably have a roommate. i don't love the idea of having to get a meal plan but it'd be much easier to meet people and have a community around me. i've def struggled this semester meeting people / making friends and i think it's probably because being in the dorms during covid is just hard.  i feel kind of doubtful about how fun the on-campus experience can be just because of how not-fun it is this year. anyways the prioirty housing deadline is so soon and i'm very stressed about making the right decision. plz let me know your thoughts/ experiences living off vs on campus etc etc etc. thanks!",1612454073,6,0

Masks always on?,"Hello everybody. I decided to make the trek to campus today to get some work done so I don't feel so disassociated from school.

I am probably 8ft from the walkway and for the first hour I was sitting there, one person walked by. I saw them approaching from a distance and put my mask back on while they passed, then took it back off. Everything was fine. If they were more covid conscious than I was, I wanted to make them comfortable. Then all of a sudden, my earbuds are in and quietly listing to my lecture when a professionally dressed woman standing on the third floor on the other side of the building can be seen waving her arms around and once I took my earbuds out, I noticed she was essentially yelling across the whole building to get my attention. She very sternly reminds me that I need to have a mask on. I say sorry and put my mask on. Is there really a need for me to wear my mask when there is nobody around me?

Zoom Movies/Shows,"Not sure if this is allowed but if it is I was wondering if anyone would like to watch shows or movies over zoom?

Since being on campus being around others in person has become a daunting task and much harder to socialize than it use to be. 

I was wondering if people would be interested to just talk, study, or watch movies/shows via zoom. It's not the ideal situation and not sure if it helps others but it surely helps me just having another person ""present"" even if there isn't a continous conversation going.

If it's something you're interested in especially to make friends feel free to reach out. As a first year trying to make friends to the best of my ability. 

I also game(xbox) if you'd like to play a game over a movie!

I hope everyone is well during these times❤",1614750981,19,1

I wasn't really able to immerse myself in the college experience. I don’t really have any close friends and the only time I ever left my room was to go to classes. I haven’t attended any games or gone to parties or really anything like that. Finally my treatment is working and I feel like a whole new person, but I feel as if a year and a half was taken away from me because of COVID and almost 3 years were lost because of mental illness. Next year (although it feels like I'm already there) I’m going to be a senior with no friends and basically no college experience. What do ya’ll recommend I do? I just want to make friends and have fun and also take advantage of an amazing school.

Are there any fun summer programs or programs with UNC that are still going on and a lot of fun? Are there any things that are unique to UNC that I have to experience? Alumn, is there anything you regret not doing during your college years? Are there any other upperclassmen or juniors that are also struggling with anything similar? Is it too late to study abroad? I appreciate any advice, seriously. This is just really hard because I look back and don’t even recognize the person I was a month ago. I wish I could go back to first year orientation.

So I need to focus on making this last semester as an underling not blow goats any more than it already is.

I've always given it to you guys pretty straight.  We're a year into, probably, the worst year many of us will have ever faced.  Many of us have lost loved ones to COVID and we've all been affected by staring into ZoomU for hours a day instead of each other's face.  It sucks.  It's not fair.  We didn't sign up for this.  But, alas, it's the cards we've been dealt.  You've all been amazing and inspiring and I've been humbled at your resilience.

Anxiety.,"Hey y’all— this might come off as a little bit rambley and anxious, so forgive the rough language and sentence structure, I just need a fresh set of opinions on this because it’s eating away at me like nothing ever has before. For some context, I’m currently awaiting my regular decision from UNC and it’s the most anxious I’ve ever been in my life. I think it’s a combination of COVID-related stress, personal issues, and lagging academically this year, but waiting for this decision is just killing me. I don’t necessarily know why this is affecting me so much...I mean UNC is my first choice school and I’ve wanted to go there forever, but separate from that, I’ve already been accepted to three schools (NCSU, UNCC, UNCW) so I shouldn’t be this worried...and yet I still am. I think part of it is that I’m still kicking myself for not applying EA or improving my SAT, or doing any number of things that I had planned to do pre-COVID to improve my chances of being accepted. Does anyone have advice from a similarly stressful waiting experience when they applied? I’m trying not to think about it so much in these last few weeks before I get my decision, it’s just really difficult.

Ad/PR and Business Double Major?,"Hello everyone! I am currently a Business Admin major, but I really want to add a second major to maximize my time in college. I've looked at a few options, but so far I'm most drawn to the MEJO Advertising and Public Relations major. I feel like it would complement Business well and make me somewhat ""well-rounded"". I also think receiving degrees from two highly-accredited professional schools (Kenan-Flagler and Hussman) would be a great opportunity academically.

This is a double major and a minor, all in unrelated things AND a decent extracurricular commitment. I will be getting something like 30 hours worth of AP credit, if that makes a difference.

Looking for an internship? a virtual volunteer space? Passionate about making UNC more affordable? Join the NCPIRG's Textbooks and Campus Affordability Campaign!," 

NCPIRG stands for North Carolina Public Interest Research Group. In our Textbooks and Affordability campaign we are looking for individuals who would like to make a difference on campus by making UNC more affordable through advocating for free or low cost materials being used in classes. We are looking for all types of students, whatever strengths you can bring to the campaign we will find a way to put them to good use! All our work this semester is through zoom and the hours are relatively flexible because although we are a national organization, it's ran by students!

We are looking for both interns and volunteers!

We have information sessions on the following dates:

\- Monday 12:15- 12:45

\- Wednesday 12:30- 1:00

\- Thursday 5:00-6:00

DM me and I can send you the zoom link!

Here's some information on why this work is so important!

**According to NCPIRG’s last national survey, it was found that:**

* **63% of students skipped buying or renting a textbook.**
* **17% of students reported skipping purchasing an access code.**
* **90% of students worried that forgoing these course materials would negatively affect their grade.**
* **The cost of course materials has a broad impact on the lives of students.**  

   * **19% choose classes based on their course materials cost.**
   * **25% had to or felt inclined to work extra hours.**
   * **22% prioritized purchasing access codes over other course materials.**
   * **11% skipped meals.**",1615759960,1,0

Are there any mental health support groups at UNC that offer weekly peer support?,"I have been very depressed and I am struggling in all of my classes right now.

There is also a wellness peer support group but they were very picky about what was allowed to be discussed as far as triggering others and not going into detail, which I understand, but I need a group where I can be open with others who are dealing with similar struggles and not hide what I am going through right now.

For anyone who's failed at something and needs some encouragement &lt;3,"I’ve put in a lot of effort so far this semester and have found myself frustrated that it’s not reflected in my gradebook. I don’t know whose fault it is or if it’s anyone’s fault really but the disconnect has led me to question my abilities and self-worth.

So, I took some time to reflect and came to this conclusion: it is ridiculous and unrealistic to expect yourself to be good at everything all the time. Failure is a natural and important part of life.

When we were all babies we had to mess a million times. Babies have to twist and turn for months before they can even turn over. Then they have to wriggle around on the floor like worms until they can crawl. Then they fall and lose their balance over and over before they can walk and even then they still stumble. They babble complete nonsense and say the wrong words so many times before they can find the right ones. They go on to tie their shoes wrong or write the b’s and d’s backwards but they keep trying over and over until they get it right.

No one is mad at a baby because it can’t walk or rollover or talk. Instead, you’re proud to see them trying. You’re not disappointed to watch them fail because you know that it’s all working towards their growth. It’s endearing to watch them try and you understand that this failure is an important part of their growth.

Getting to the point LOL, it would be freaky if babies came out of the womb talking and walking. You expect them to not have mastery of those skills because why would they; they just got started. I know none of us are babies, but similar to babies we’re all embarking on a lot of firsts too. It’s absurd to expect yourself to be good at every class, or test, or project, or subject. You may have some natural talent in areas that might help you like how some babies are better at motor skills or learn to talk really quickly but you can’t do it all.

I’m not sure at what point in our lives failure became a bad thing but it’s not. As long as you’re trying or giving your best effort you’re doing it; you’re growing. That’s something to be proud of, even if this isn’t reflected in a gradebook or resume. You still have worth and value because you’re human and you’re growing and that’s beautiful. 

Even more than that it’s okay to be frustrated or sad. It’s not fun to fail at something. But that’s growth, it’s raw and awkward and sometimes painful. But, as long as you don’t give up you’re still doing it. You’re still growing. That’s a beautiful, wonderful thing that deserves to be celebrated.  

This was way longer and meandering than it was ever meant to be. Hopefully, you guys can glean some encouragement from my ramblings. I’m proud of you, the person reading this, and I’m rooting for you. 

Here’s my favorite video on failure. It’s helped me through a lot of tough times and far more well-put than anything I’ve said hahah: [https://youtu.be/IVCWFbk8S5M](https://youtu.be/IVCWFbk8S5M)",1613760823,1,0

But a cursory glance at my profile that explicitly outlines my interests and life circumstances should make it clear I am not at all a good fit for something like this...

This is about matching prospective candidates with employers that can use their knowledge and skills. Ideally, that match should be apparent if people are actually looking at student profiles when they message you. But they aren't. They're scraping profiles for one or two keywords, however loosely they fit the opportunity, and using that to spam you with messages.

Potential club for grieving children - thoughts?,"Hello everyone! I had an idea for a potential club at UNC and wanted input from other students. 

During high school, I experienced the unexpected death of my mother. Because of this incident, I had the idea of starting a club at UNC to provide grief support for children at Chapel Hill elementary/middle/high schools. I think this would be an incredibly valuable resource, especially during COVID. 

I've had my fair share of grief group experiences, and although they were a *little* helpful, I was never able to properly connect with anyone my age. I think a student-led grief group would be really beneficial to the community.

AHD Resources?," Hello all,

I have recently learned that I have reason to believe I might have ADHD, specifically the inattentive type. I've never been diagnosed before and I'm not sure whether UNC has a way to help out with that. 

Has anyone been through this in college? How do I know whether this is really it and if it's worth it to go through testing? I've really been struggling, especially since last semester. Part of me thinks I might have this and the other part is scared I don't. If anyone has any information that might help, I would really appreciate it.",1613673205,1,0

I’m gonna do better for myself,"I’ve been having a lot of negative thoughts recently about life and work and especially school. And hearing from others that’s definitely not uncommon. I’ve definitely not been at the top of my game. I can’t find the motivation to do my laundry list of homework tasks a lot of days and my performance after the first round of tests wasn’t as great as I’d like it to be.

Despite warnings, I bit off more than I could chew. 11 of my credits this semester are STEM classes and I'm absolutely drowning. I don't have much of a support system aside from my bf. Hell, the only UNC students I've really talked to are on GroupMe. I have never even seen the faces of some of these people.

It's getting really hard to tell myself that all this work is gonna pay off some day. It's hard to get up in the morning and sit down at the computer and do the same thing over and over. It's hard to see that other people just ""get it"" while I'm still stuck on the first question.

But I want to do better for myself. I don't want to dwell on all the bad all the time. I want to find the joy that I felt when I first got an acceptance letter from UNC in the mail. I want to go to bed at a normal-ish time and feel good about the day even if I wasn't at 100%.

So I'm gonna put things into perspective for myself and reflect on the good things that have happened:

* I called CAPS today. This was a pretty big step for me. I've heard some pretty awful stuff about it from reviews and reddit so I was a bit wary going in. Following other's advice, I was honest but definitely careful about my words so that I would actually get to see a therapist and not be stuck in a workshop. Cried a bit during the assessment but got through well enough and I have an actual appointment tomorrow :)
* Test scores for all my classes came out. Yikes. PHYS 115 was really rough but my first test was 20% better than the first test of PHYS 114 and with corrections it could be 30% + better. Putting it in that perspective definitely makes me see that I HAVE improved. Basically the same for the rest of the classes. (*Except you, BIOL 252L. For a 1 credit hour class you sure are a piece of  %&amp;#\*)*
* Random one but something I'm proud of. I started rock climbing. I was an absolute potato last semester. I knew I needed something to do to keep me sane so I joined a rock climbing gym. It has been an absolute BLAST. I feel stronger and more confident and there's always an opportunity to meet someone new. I moved classes around to not conflict with women's climbing night on Tuesdays lmao.

**tl;dr: I'm gonna try to change my perspective. Instead of getting mad at myself for not being as good as I feel like I should be most days, I need to see that the overall trendline of improvement is going up. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.**",1613615071,1,0

Don't you just love it when the class that takes up the most of your energy and time is a gen-ed that isn't even remotely related to your major?,"I'm a Poli Sci student and I get the idea of GenEds. Having classes outside of your target area can help you expand your horizons and potentially look at something involving your major in a different light. Like I took a Cherokee Philosophy class last semester and it's probably good as a Poli Sci student to learn the viewpoints of American Indian tribes (especially one with such a large presence in North Carolina). And although ECON 101 was kind of difficult, I understand why one would need to know basic, rudimentary economics when pursuing a career in politics and government. 

But holy shit I'd rather regrow my wisdom teeth and get them pulled again than do BIO stuff. I hate to sound like a high schooler who doesn't like algebra, but it feels like such a waste of time. I'm devoting an inordinate amount of energy, time, and stress to ""learning"" information that I will jettison as soon as I'm done with the final exam.  

And I'm taking courses -- *interesting* courses that will likely be relevant in my future career -- and they don't even come close to being as much of an time suck as this gen ed. And the real kicker is that a science-centric course I took last semester *doesn't fulfill the UNC science requirement.* 

Maybe I'm a big goober and totally screwed up in terms of what class to take for one of my Gen Eds. But holy shit dude I'm tired of this.",1613597939,1,0

As someone who went into the military for four years out of high school, then got out and worked another two years as a civilian before applying for school, having a high school teacher or counselor that I can't remember the name of be my recommender doesn't make much sense. I called the Veterans Resource Center at the end of 2020 explaining this and asking if it was okay to use my former platoon sergeant or someone from the army instead of someone from high school. They said this would be possible, but now I'm beginning to think there was some kind of miscommunication. My former platoon sergeant called me to say they haven't been able to access the recommender questionnaire because they're forced to choose which academic institution they're associated with in a dropdown menu. Unfortunately the U.S. Army doesn't count.

Is anybody here able to clarify if it's possible to use a prior leader from military service in lieu of a teacher/counselor? Are there any veterans that have had a similar experience? Did you just contact an old teacher or were you able to use someone else?

Advice for swapping out of a lab?,"I am currently enrolled for an on campus lab (MCRO 251) that begins next week on the 23. There is a virtual recitation which counts as lab credit as well, which I am not enrolled in. The only reason I enrolled for the in person lab instead of the recitation is because at the time, nursing school did not say that they would take the recitation to fulfill the MCRO 251 lab prerequisite. They later released an email saying they would accept it but I was already enrolled &amp; the email stated not to drop the lab if you’re already in it so I listened.

Well in light of recent events on campus, I really don’t want to risk being on campus and being in a lab. This is the only class I have on campus so if I could get swapped out of it, it would help lower the risk of COVID since we all stay home to be safe. I live with family who are considered high-risk and am having a lot of anxiety about this. I would die inside if I were to get one of them sick and even more so if I lost one of them due to COVID.

I emailed my professor last Tuesday about this but she has not responded yet. She did send out an announcement regarding lab starting in person. It basically stated that since we have 2 weeks before lab start don’t worry about what happened on Franklin. I understand it’s a difficult situation for everyone and faculty are doing the best they can but I would rather avoid all the trouble for the sake of my own/my family’s health.

Single room Giant Bed,"Hi everyone! So I’ve been assigned a single room for the upcoming semester but it’s a single buyout room which means it will still have both sets of furniture. And since it will have two beds, i was just brainstorming the other day and I thought about putting the two beds together to make one bigger bed. But I’d probably need to turn the mattresses a different way or fill in the hole between them. Does anyone know if this is possible? If they’ve done it? Or if anyone knows if it’d be against the rules and I’d get in trouble for it?

LGBTQ+,"I identify as gay and also asexual. However, Im not sure if it's just me but I really haven't found others who are part of the LGBTQ+ community. In my highscool there really wasn't many people who were out and so most of my friends were girls and it's happening the same in college.

I'm a first year and was wondering if there's any way to reach out or find others in the community without using useless apps that require profiles or whatever. 

I've never really had guy friends and would like to meet others who I can relate to and be able to just hangout with and create friendships with.

Commencement Registration Mishap,"So this is kind of a long story, so please bear with me and I’d love to hear what other people have to say. I believed that I had filled out and submitted the commencement registration form (it was due March 18 originally but then got pushed to March 24, and I also vividly remember logging on to Heel Life and answering the questions on the form), but I’m guessing that my submission did not completely go through, maybe I forgot or it just happened to glitch on my end. But I wasn’t aware of this, until last Thursday when they announced the dates for the commencement ceremonies and I just wanted to make sure of which commencement I would be assigned to, so I went to check my registration form status on Heel Life. It turns out that it did not submit, it said that it was ""In Progress,"" but I made sure to submit it on the spot right then. I also looked through my emails some more and it turns out that all the reminder emails about filling out the commencement registration form went to my “Other” (or also known as spam) inbox, so I never saw them except for maybe the first email that announced to fill out the registration form. Today I called the commencement phone number as well as I emailed them and tried to explain what happened, even the spam emails (which they never addressed), but the most I got from that was just being put on a waitlist, which I doubt I will be able to get in that way. I now realize that I was put at a disadvantage since the reminder emails were not sent to my direct inbox so I was not properly notified. I know that UNC is being super insistent on not allowing any more people to register because it will fill past capacity (I understand, pandemic and all), but I still feel like there could have been more room to fit in extra people, Kenan Stadium is pretty huge, and that UNC does not want to take responsibility for any potential mistakes that happened on their end. I know this was a lot, but I wanted to reach out and see if anyone else had any similar issues/frustrations or advice regarding all of this. Thanks for your help in advance!",1617864155,1,0

"""Fake"" Friends and Connections","I'm just a freshmen and throughout this entire year have been reaching out and trying to get to know people here and there with little to no luck.

I've met so many people who've said they're looking for friends and when I reach out the conversations are always cut short because seems like nobody wants to put in the effort and expects someone to magically just become their friend(s).

Throught this semester or entire year I've met about 1 if not 2 people that still talk every other day on a good week. It's honestly upsetting because at the end of the day people say the same thing over and over again...""You gotta put yourself out there"" it's honestly tiring and depressing because even though you're not being told no or rejected it still feels that way and just makes you wonder if you've done something wrong.

I want to feel empathy for people but some of the excuses just don't make sense. I truly hope my next 3 yrs here are a better experience.

Investment Banking at UNC?,"Hello! I recently got accepted to the UNC Kenan Flagler Business school as an assured admit. I plan on committing soon and will be pursuing investment banking as a career. However, I just had a few questions that I hope some of you can answer.

1. Is there any information on the average number of students Kenan Flagler sends to NYC BB superdays per year seperated by bank?
   1. If not, anecdotally what banks have the best OCR?
2. What finance related clubs/societies that can help me with my career goals should I be aware of?
   1. I know that the admission to certain finance clubs can get quite competetive, how can I best navigate that process and maximize my chances to get in where I want to be?
3. Are there any other Kenan Flagler run programs that I should be looking to try to get into?
4. What (if any) business classes have proven useful for you (not only for interview prep but real and applicable finance knowledge as well)?

I know I may come off like all I care about is banking, but all I'm trying to do is get a handle on how I should focus my efforts at Kenan Flagler so really any other advice for my 4 years at UNC would be really appreciated as well.

Chem 102 Rant,"I feel so lost with chem 102. This has genuinely been the most difficult class I have taken and it's only getting worse as the semester goes on. The worksheets and exams are on content which we haven't even covered in class, in our textbook, or even in youtube videos from people like orgo chem tutor because they ask such specific things about something they mention once in class and don't include in the slides and still refuse to lecture. I asked my brother who goes to an ivy if he could take a look at a question I didn't get to see if he could push me in the right direction and he said that they didn't even mention these topics until their quantitative chem class, let alone gen chem. I think things would be different if we actually had lectures because then we'd know exactly what we need to know, but instead, I'm spending significantly more time on this one class than I probably should be and have somewhat neglected my other classes. I go to review sessions and try to do as much of the work ahead of time, but I don't have the time in my schedule to go to office hours or tutoring. As much as I hate the idea of it, I think I have to pass/fail the class but I know that's going to look bad for grad school. I hope to go into pharm and I'm super passionate about it, but chem 102 has discouraged me so much that I'm not sure that's what I want anymore. I don't know if it's worse to pass/fail or to accept a B- and drag down my GPA. I wanted to retake the class over the summer with a different professor but the waitlist is already full and likely won't reopen. I'm not sure if others feel like this, but I'm just so discouraged and burnt out by the chem department and this is only one year in. It would be different if they responded to our complaints and adjusted when they saw all of us struggling like on the last exam, but it only seems to be getting worse as they're now hiding grade distributions and only giving more work they didn't teach us how to solve.",1617773995,1,0

"Has anybody had any unexplained/""paranormal"" things happen on campus or around CH?","I'm not one to jump to any kind of conclusions about paranormal things, but there is one experience I had that I can't really explain. I was in a class in Bingham hall last spring on the third floor and at one point in the semester the doors would start to unexplainably move or shake nearly every class. It got to the point where it was so distracting that the professor would shut the doors, but even still the doors would shake very loudly. There was no AC in that building aside from the window AC units which weren't running at the time, and nothing was done down the hall to cause the doors to shake. I still have no idea what caused that, but it got me curious if anybody had other stories of unexplained or possibly ""paranormal"" experiences.

Regarding The COMP Cutting,"To the Computer Science Administration / Whoever made the great idea to cut a bunch of current majors potentially :

Honestly, f**k you. For those of you who haven't heard, UNC is restricting access to the classes above COMP 210 for all students until they figure out if they have the space. For all intents and purposes, there is a serious risk this will stop people who are in the major from being able to complete it. This is to make way, by purposely removing people from the majors and minors with this side effect, for a smaller major size. Of course, people not in the major yet, will now have to apply. This is okay, because most of those people are in comp 110, a class relevant and credit bearing for most science majors at UNC. 

Comp 210, on the other hand... is a class requiring Comp 283 or a higher level math as well. Both irrelevant to any other major at the school. Those taking COMP 210 and 283 as corequisites this semester, as is typical custom at UNC, are thus wasting a calculated $2,735.31 instate or $9,605.06 out of state. It's like taking a bio or chem major and telling them they may not be able to be a bio / chem major after taking Organic Chem and its prerequisites. 

This is ridiculous, and also, they don't even have the process planned out for people taking these classes to register for the next ones up. It's even a lottery if so many people in their ""group 1"" exist. Which, btw, is set to be almost everyone. 

So, in short, UNC stole our money potentially and may be basing our futures on if we are a lucky number picked out of a bingo wheel. 

So yeah. I'm planning some harsh words for the town hall... Hope my fellow majors will do the same, regardless of their ""safety"" in this system.

Sincerely, 

A disgruntled UNC-administration-paying individual 

P.S. The professors are absolutely amazing and I love them. None of this is their fault and I hope they don't get any flack for any of this. But some understanding during this stressful period for 110, 210, and 283 would be greatly appreciated.",1617690684,1,0

"UNC to reduce CS major, add admissions process for CS major in 2022"," There are some important changes coming to the undergraduate CS major at UNC. For reasons I’ll explain below, the Computer Science department will be reducing the size of its majors (both BS and BA majors).  To achieve this reduction we will put in place an admissions process for our majors.  We expect this process to start next Fall during the registration period for Spring semester 2022.

This email outlines these changes, including some **important notes in bold**. I encourage you to read this email carefully.  We will update the CS web site as soon as possible with full details.  In the meantime, we will schedule some virtual “town hall” events where we can share more details and answer your questions. The first of these events will be held on Monday, April 12th at 7 PM ([https://unc.zoom.us/j/91046958539](https://unc.zoom.us/j/91046958539)).

\---------

Over the last 15 years, the number of students wanting to major in computer science has steadily grown year after year.  In 2008, we had approximately 140 majors and 29 tenure-track faculty members.  Today we have approximately 1,800 majors and 27 tenure track faculty members. 

A 2018 external review of the Department named the challenge of meeting the demand for our undergraduate courses as the foremost challenge for the Department and recommended that UNC either grow the size of the faculty or the Department limit the number of majors.  While the Department strongly supported growing the Department to meet the demand, this hasn’t happened.  As a result, we’re forced to reduce the size of the major.  As you well know, at present the Department can only offer one section of the majority of our 400 and 500-level courses once a year.  The result is that our classes are very large and yet there are never enough seats in any 400 or 500-level course to meet demand.  Quality of instruction has suffered as courses have become “streamlined” in order to be offered to large numbers of students. 

The simple fact is that the Department has reached the end of its ability to continually scale up our classes.  Without additional faculty, the status quo has become unsustainable.  Worse, because of expected faculty departures, the aforementioned problems with our upper division courses will only get worse.  Thus, immediate action is required.

**Starting this fall (2021), there will be an admissions process to declare a major in Computer Science at UNC**, much like what already exists for the Kenan-Flagler School of Business and the Hussman School of Journalism and Media. Many details of this admissions process are still being determined.

How will this affect current students? **Those students already in or beyond COMP 211 will be unaffected** and are free to continue in the Computer Science major. We will continue to do ""2-before-3 preregistration"" as we did last semester to make registration as fair as possible for all and to reduce load on instructors; stay tuned for details on registering for Fall 21 classes.

**Those students currently in COMP 210** will not be able to directly register themselves for COMP 211 and COMP 301. Instead, because we don't yet have a formal admissions process defined, we need these students to document that they have a viable plan to complete a CS major in their remaining time at Carolina, ideally under the ""2-before-3"" constraint of taking at most 2 COMP courses per semester. The details on this process will be forthcoming shortly. 

With these plans in view, and subject to the current constraint that you must get a C or better in each required course to continue on the major, we will invite students to register for one of the 250 seats in each of COMP 211 and COMP 301 in Fall 2021 according to the following process. First, students who have submitted a plan for completing the major by their eighth semester of study will be divided into 4 groups:

Group 1: Declared majors with 2-before-3 compatible graduation plans

Group 2: Undeclared students with 2-before-3 compatible graduation plans

Group 3: Declared majors without 2-before-3 compatible graduation plans

Group 4: Declared minors

If there's not enough room in COMP 211 and COMP 301 for all of Group 1, a lottery will occur to randomly select as many students from Group 1 as there are seats in these courses. Otherwise, we will invite every student in Group 1 to register for COMP 211 and COMP 301 and move to Group 2 to fill the remaining seats. This process will continue until all seats are filled or we run out of students. The remaining students will be denied a seat in COMP 211 and COMP 301 but are invited to apply to become CS majors next fall, at which point we will have a defined semesterly admissions process. We have asked College advising to stop allowing students to declare the computer science major, to prevent gaming this system.

**Those not yet in COMP 210 but intending to major in computer science** will need to apply to become a major according to the admissions process. A student becomes eligible to apply in the semester that they take COMP 210.

I’m sure you will have many questions about this process.  As mentioned, we will host some virtual Town Hall meetings to explain this process in more detail and to answer your questions.  The first of these Town Hall meetings will be on Monday, April 12th at 7 PM ([https://unc.zoom.us/j/91046958539](https://unc.zoom.us/j/91046958539)).

In closing, the computer science faculty appreciate how unwelcome this news is.  I cannot emphasize strongly enough how painful this reduction plan is for the computer science faculty.  As a Department we believe computer science is an important and incredibly consequential major.  We firmly believe that every Carolina student who wants to major in computer science should be allowed to do so and that the Department should be resourced to make this possible.  We are truly sorry that we have to turn some of you away from majoring in computer science.  Please believe us that we have exhausted all other options and move to this option only as a last resort.

Sincerely,

Kevin Jeffay

Hall Pass completely blowing up on anyone else?,"Went with my daughter to Chapel Hill for a COVID test — she had managed to make an appointment on HallPass just fine — and once she showed up the app completely blew up on her.  So they denied her the test.  At the testing site her birthday showed up as 01/01/1000 or something like that which was an insurmountable problem. 

The interesting thing is that there was no support person that anyone could talk to to try to work anything out.  Not at the site or on the phone.  All they could do was file a written report and turn her away.  

Here’s the thing:  she needs the tests because she has an in-person class and needs to use the student health center on a regular basis, but just showing up to campus over and over in case the app might start working is extremely inconvenient — we live an hour away so every attempt is at least a 3-hour ordeal.

Open Hearts for the Homeless International Leadership Positions for UNC Students!,"Hello! My name is Isabella Castellano and I am a pre-medical Biomedical Sciences major. I am also the Officer of Public Affairs in an international organization, Hearts for the Homeless International. Our mission is to provide free and informative cardiovascular health education events and blood pressure screenings approved by the American Heart Association to the homeless communities around the world. We are currently looking for some talented directors in this area! While UNC Chapel Hill does have a chapter of Hearts for the Homeless that we would love if you were a part of, it is not necessary to be a member in order to apply to these leadership positions. 

Available positions are as follows: the Southeast Expansion Director, the West External Affairs Director, the Assistant Director of Emergency Medicine, the Director of Public Affairs, and the Director of Social Media. These positions are great not only because they are working towards helping underserved communities everywhere, but also because they provide leadership experience in an international organization. Directors will be creating relationships with contacts around the world. Medical and graduate schools look for their potential students to have connections to their regions, and these directorships could provide just that.

If interested, please see this form, which contains all available positions and their thorough descriptions, requirements, and expectations, as well as the application itself: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6bmzhGL8q-yZHpdmzpDY5n484HmNDwNKxM4119npTfDOHeA/viewform?usp=pp\_url](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6bmzhGL8q-yZHpdmzpDY5n484HmNDwNKxM4119npTfDOHeA/viewform?usp=pp_url)

"Are the ""Sophomore Experience"" Dorms Worth It?","Hello everyone! I am a current first-year deciding where to live next year. Since we were basically robbed of the ""freshman experience"", UNC has designated 3 dorms as ""sophomore experience"": Morison, McIver (honors students), and Taylor (Ram's Village Apartments). The only one I'm a little interested in out of these is Morrison. I decided to live on North Campus this year (OCLQ) and I have really enjoyed it so far. I don't mind hall or suite style bathrooms and I think I would be able to meet people in any dorm on campus. But since the only dorm on North/Mid campus designated as just for sophomores next year is McIver, I'm also thinking of choosing a dorm that isn't sophomore-exclusive. I just wanted to ask for any housing suggestions from upperclassmen. Is living in Morrison to meet more people worth it or is any other housing the same experience? Are there any other dorms you would suggest for sophomores? Do a lot of people live in OCUQ or Kenan Community or is it quieter?

The second vaccine is not that bad,"I realized I mentioned in a couple comments here that the second Pfizer vaccine “made me sick,” and that was a poor choice of words. It did not make me sick. It gave me a few mild side effects. It will not make you sick. I just wanted to make clear that I am **not** discouraging anyone who can get the vaccine(s) to get the vaccine(s). Get the vaccine. It was not that bad. My temp never went above 99.4. I felt like I had a cold and slept a long time. And I always react this way to colds - I have a weak immune system. I’ve been in the hospital for mono, lol, so my reaction to the vaccine will most likely not be yours. Also, disclaimer, no one is going force you to get the vaccine. It is not mandatory, so don’t come at me if you don’t want it. Just worried I scared some people who do. It’s like a cold and ibuprofen and tylenol help a lot if you even get side effects. And every second is worth it knowing what the result will be!",1611387645,1,0
Questions for those who went thru the Rad Sci Program and graduated,"Hi Everyone,

I had a question. I got into the Radiologic Tech Science Program  at the BS level (this is my second degree). I have since had to defer to this year.

I have an injury in my right shoulder while working as a CNA and I had to resign and find another job.

My right shoulder is torn up is an understatement. I have good and bad days but I can no longer lift my right arm all the way up. And it is prone to spasms.  If I aggravate it enough I will be unable to do much with my right. . My doctor thinks I need to rethink my career options. And with covid this year and lack of going to physical therapy and my other exercises I have gone a bit backwards in terms of my health. 

UNC was really kind to offer me advice and tell me to defer for a year. They were offering me support thru clinicals at outpatient and advice on maybe staying in mammography modality/maybe MRI

I wanted to know if any students who graduated from the program has felt radiology  has been a bit rough on your body and have you had any issues long term?  Thanks for any advice.",1611382399,1,0

I'm fuming right now, and I'd really appreciate any advice. Our entire class was under the impression that we will be getting an extra point if 80% of the class will submit course evaluations for the course. However, our professor told us today that if 80% don't fill in evaluation forms, the entire class will get 0 for a portion of the participation grade.

This has just got me really worried and stressed out although I do believe I'm in a good position tbf. From what I've seen there will be 150 seats per semester for the required CS 211 class, and at the moment there are 2 courses being offered next semester, which considering it's the 2nd class in the sequence seems like that's way too little.

At the moment, I've been able to transfer my courses and meet these 3 course requirements COMP 110, 210 and Comp 401 which I'm assuming is useless as it's not in the core requirments at least not anymore.

Another concern I have is that, if I were to drop it, as I completed 12 credit hours last semester, I would be below the 24 completed hours needed after 2 semesters.

I am currently planning my schedule for the fall and want to be prepared for the minor. I was thinking there may be new classes from a new subject such as DATA 101 or something like that.

Is there any way I can see it and understand the accusation or do I have to wait for the decision? This process already seems unfair as I have been given the minimum information. I have been reading and everyone is saying that the honor court is unfair and is just full of people with god complexes that want to punish people while not even following the honor code themselves, aka they cheat. I fear this also goes for the SAG. This has been the hardest year of my life and I was finally excited to move on from it only to be brought back with an accusation. Online classes have been impossible, I have learned nothing from them and professors have been rather mean and rude when you have any inconvenience that comes with online classes. Taking exams has been the worst! I live at home with my family and plenty of times they burst in or ask me questions or I have to go to the bathroom and all of those constantly scared me as I feared being accused of honor code violation.

I have made no friends and science classes have ruined my love for science altogether.

I'm not a Spanish minor (just love the language) if that helps with anything!

If I don't go to a Spanish-speaking country, I was also thinking of going to Korea... But I'm scared that I would get judged easily when I'm there because I'm a Korean that can't speak the language well. I'm currently studying Korean to improve, but is anybody here a Korean-American/a child of immigrants that decided to go to Korea/their parent's (or grandparents, etc.) country to ""relearn"" their culture/language? How was it?

(also please don't take this the wrong way, but if you're not Korean and studied abroad in Korea please don't say ""my Korean was bad but everybody was really nice about it!"" It's a completely different experience language-wise for people who look like foreigners/are not Korean since they aren't expected to be fluent automatically)

Tips for using Sakai,"Hello Everyone! I was accepted to a virtual undergraduate fellowship this summer at UNC! I was curious if any of you guys have any tips on using Sakai? My current institution uses Blackboard which I assume is somewhat similar. However, I was wondering if some of you guys as current UNC students could give some tips about features and stuff in Sakai you wished you knew sooner. We will have an overview of Sakai during orientation as well. I know it took me awhile to know some of the features with Blackboard that I wish I would have  known sooner. Also, if any of you guys used Blackboard before could you compare the two and what you think is better/worse with using Sakai?",1621042016,1,0

Will explaining my poor first semester grades in my essay improve my chances for consideration?,I currently entering my sophomore year  attend community college but a few years ago I attended UNCG for a semester after graduating highschool and ended up getting two D's in biology and chemistry because I did not know what I wanted to do and my parents wanted me to major in  biology. Since I started going back to school I've improved my grades and currently have a 3.8 gpa (I maintained a 4.0 for a while but unfortunately recieved a b in a class this semester) . However my grades at UNCG are pulling my cumulative gpa to a 3.2 . I'm wondering if I can compensate for this by explaining about it in my essay.,1621018180,1,0

ATTENTION STEM STUDENTS IN NEED OF CALC BASED PHYSICS 1! IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY!,"Are you in need of calc-based Physics 1 for your stem degree? If so, keep reading. Physics is known for being a notoriously difficult subject, especially at the intro levels. A great way to knock out this credit is to take it during the summer. Catawba Valley Community College is offering PHY-251 which will transfer to most NC based universities as calc-based Physics 1. The problem is that the class needs at least 7 students to run and there is currently only 1. The class costs $380 (before aid) which is MUCH cheaper then taking it at a four year institution. It is also less rigorous due to it being a cc course. On top of that, it is all online due to COVID. Finally, when you transfer it back to your institution it will not affect your GPA- so all you need to get is a C to pass. There are so many reasons to take this class now if you need it and have some spare time this summer, so please consider signing up for this class so it can run! If you sign up, PM me and I will try to update these posts with how many people are signed up. I will be posting this in multiple NC university subreddits to attract as many students as possible. Enrollment caps at around 20. Class dates are 6/1/2021-7/27/2021. Thank you for reading!
