I'm wondering how much effort I will have to put in to secure an A, and whether or not if the class is as tedious as it seems from the syllabus. I'm kind of worried that I might be overwhelmed with 5 classes. Even though I had 18 credits last semester too, it was only with 4 classes and I don't think it it was that challenging.

"[Megathread] Prospective Students, Applications, and Admissions","Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We  don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the  anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's  applications

2. What should I provide to my prof so that he/she will give a strong recommendation letter? I know a CV is necessary but do I need to provide a draft recommendation letter that I wrote for myself so the prof can edit based on that?

NYU MSECE,"Hello everyone,

I am super stoked about recently being admitted into the MSEE, in-person program at NYU. And I just wanted to hear from attending students what they think and how things are going. Times are pretty difficult, and I am not acquainted well with how COVID has factored into the on-campus research and what the plans are for the university in terms of returning back to normal with the issuing of the vaccines. I'm sorry if it seems like a silly thing to ask, but I'd love to hear your perspectives and experiences pertaining to that.

I apologize if this question is another pedestrian one, but can someone also help me understand why US news has two separate rankings for NYU and NYU (Tandon) with two different EE rankings. From what I gather, not many engineering schools have a separate ranking, but perhaps this has to do with the merging about 5 years or so back. Which ranking is the correct one? I'm not really sure. Sorry if that question is dumb, I just got really confused by it, and I am not sure if someone here knows which ranking is correct. But I guess it doesn't matter too much.

I am super happy with the news and I absolutely love NYC. And I appreciate any responses. Thanks once again.",1612406138,2,0

Moses Center Recording/Notetaking Software Problems,"I'm registered with the Moses Center and have the class recording accommodation, and when I first started as a freshman the Moses Center sent me a link to the Glean notetaking software, which they told me was the approved software to use.

It's always been a tiny bit glitchy but generally has worked well for me. I started to have a few problems with it being a little slower and more glitchy last semester but again, still generally worked fine. Now suddenly since classes started this semester it's almost unusable. It keeps stopping my recordings or never actually starting them, it is extremely stubborn about playing things back, and it won't even let me type notes anymore. I am using a pretty new Mac with fully updated software, on the fully updated version of Chrome (which I believe is the only browser it works on?). I also didn't see any correlation between the problems starting and my doing an update of my computer or the browser, it seems to have just started out of nowhere.

To start with, I am still a bit overwhelmed. Frankly, right now, I do not even know if this is the right place to post it.

They kept saying that only one person is allowed, while they were already two of them inside. I wouldn't know if any of them were NYU students. This is the first time something like this happened to me and I am not sure what to do. I only know that I want to lodge a formal complaint. I am not sure if the MHP provides the students with an RA. If anyone knows of any medium I can get through to for this specific incident, please let me know.

There has been a lot of discussion about Fall 2021 being remote or not. Here’s my stance.,"I believe that Fall 2021 will be remote because of the sheer amount of uncertainty going around about the vaccine especially according to the NYU news updates about it. First of all, the fact that they already announced that there will be a virtual commencement this year and Spring 2020 students will have to wait til next year, says a lot. The commencement is not too far from the Fall semester. And according to these updates, there’s a lot of discussion about them being uncertain about how long the immunity will last so masks and **social distancing** must remain intact for awhile. As stated in their email updates:

“It’s important to know that vaccination reduces — but does not eliminate — the likelihood you will become infected following exposure. This means that there is still a small chance that even a vaccinated person could become infected with COVID-19.  It is also unknown how long immunity will last after a person is fully vaccinated.  Additionally, most of the research about the vaccines’ effectiveness has been on preventing symptomatic infection and severe outcomes (hospitalizations, etc.); research has generally not been focused on transmissibility following vaccination, which means it is not yet known to what degree vaccinated individuals may still be able to spread the virus to others.”

There’s just too much uncertainty and question marks for Fall 2021 to not to be remote. The fact that there’s already a shortage and I quote from the email, “And while the COVID-19 vaccines are promising (more on this below), it appears that it will take some time to vaccinate sufficient numbers of people.” Even though progress is being made with almost 7,000 members of the NYU community who got vaccinated according to the email:

“While our aim is to help NYUers get vaccinated, the key problem right now — at NYU and nationally — is the demand for vaccine substantially outweighs availability. I know that many of you are eager to get vaccinated and are frustrated by the wait, the reports of distribution problems, the lack of vaccine availability, and the uncertainty about when your turn may come. I share your sense of urgency and frustration. The New York State and New York City departments of health — not NYU — determine who may be vaccinated and the distribution of vaccine to sites across the State. To date, NYU Washington Square and Brooklyn have not been prioritized to receive stock of vaccine...” 

To the point where NYU Langone will not be able to provide vaccinations to make the process faster, “I should caution that even as this new eligibility group is likely to be significantly larger than prior groups, the availability of vaccine stock appears likely to continue to be limited for the foreseeable future. At this point, it appears that NYU Langone will not be able to provide vaccinations for this new group as it was able to do for prior eligibility categories.”

There’s so much more like COVID-19 variants coming from the UK and Brazil and it might spread here “in the coming months” according to them. It’s just a lot of crap that no college student wants. 

I for one at least hope that Spring 2022 guarantees an in-person return. I graduate that semester. I mean Jesus Christ, my entire junior year was remote. I have not seen my school in full capacity since my first semester of sophomore year. I’m from Tandon, and I barely even explored and/or experienced the campus to the fullest. I don’t even know what the main campus looks like....which is just disgraceful. I was planning to spend most of my time exploring both campuses back when school was in-person but now it seems like that will happen in Spring 2022, my last semester. And that’s IF there’s no issue with the vaccines. 

1. If NYU requires everyone to be vaccinated to enter campuses. 
2. If they still require social distancing. 

Those two things alone will just automatically confirm Fall 2021 to be remote. And to put the shortage on top of that? Jeez. Getting that vaccine almost seems to be the equivalent or even 10x worse than buying a PS5 now with the correct price.",1613675269,1,0

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We  don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the  anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's  applications

I've started the search for an off-campus apartment for Fall 2021 and was hoping to get some advice.

a brief rant about nyu and peoplelink,"i've been erroneously enrolled in the state-required sexual harassment training course (different from the freshman one) even though i'm no longer a student employee.

this problem has happened to me on multiple ocassions even after i stopped working for nyu. and no, taking the course doesn't help, it just reenrolls me. it has taken weeks of back and forth for peoplelink to fix this issue in the past.

this isn't the first gripe i've had. a couple weeks ago, i JUST got paid for time i spent working for nyu wasserman in early september of last year!!! i had to nudge peoplelink and hr for months before they finally looked into it.

Should I Appeal?,"Hey all, 

Before I ask for your judgement, I would like to apologize for making a mistake: I tried to sneak my girlfriend into my dorm through the recycling room of my Residential Hall. It was a very (very) bad decision; my actions not only reek of stupidity but of negligence amidst the current pandemic. She's from a university 30 minutes north that tests their students twice a week, so I didn't believe I was recklessly endangering anyone in the hall by sneaking her in. My roommate was cool with it. When the guard came out and told us to stop, we stopped and she went home. The guard, initially pissed, told me that we all make mistakes and that I should take my slap on the wrist and move on. I found out today that NYU slaps with razor blades: after a month of doing and saying nothing, they suspended me for the rest of the year. If you (the people whose money actually keeps this university running) believe that they made the right decision, I'm not going to appeal it. If you think that my actions did not warrant my sentence, then I'm going to hold them to their own standards and fight it. 

(if you do support my appeal, it would be greatly appreciated if you could leave instances of NYU violating their own policies in the comments) 

If you've read this far, I appreciate you listening to what I have to say.

"[Megathread] Prospective Students, Applications, and Admissions","Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We  don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the  anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's  applications

am i the only one struggling with WTE?,"So I know most people dislike WTE, but I don’t feel like I hear that many people complaining about struggling with it, and I really, really am.

I have class Monday/Wednesday and I truly don’t know how I’m supposed to complete all the homework assigned Monday before Wednesday when I have other homework and a full schedule on Tuesdays. I’m just so overwhelmed. I don’t know how I’m supposed to be doing a full essay draft and reading and film screenings all in one night. 

And on top of that I have a few disabilities and it just really feels like the structure of the class is not made for those needs at all. For one, being forced to write in such a specific way, where we’re writing chunks of our essay in a specific order, just does not work for my brain. I get why they ask us to do it but for me it truly makes the writing process so much harder. I also have attendance accommodations through the Moses center but it’s pretty clear that with the structure of the course those aren’t going to really matter. It so clearly prioritizes attendance and participation over everything else and I’m being made to feel guilty if I miss class even when it’s for a medical reason. I just don’t know how I’m supposed to succeed between the high expectations of the course, my disability needs, other classes, and on top of all that the increasing weight of the pandemic.

NYU Stern vs NYU CS (CAS &amp; Tandon),"Hello everyone! I am applying to college this year and i am an international student. NYU has been on my college list ever since I thought of going to college in the USA and now that I am in that year where i am actually going to apply, I have started researching heavily on NYU.

I want to either major in NYU Stern as a business major or do CS at NYU (either at CAS - Courant or at Tandon). I am competitive for both, CS and business btw. Which one should I apply for? My first choice is obviously getting a STEM degree so that I can get a 24-month OPT extension when I graduate from NYU, but is NYU CS good? Which one is better CAS or Tandon? I have heard CAS is more prestigious than Tandon but you receive a B.A. from CAS so there's that. Anyway, would you recommend a CS degree from NYU at all? Why?

Masters in economics: NYU versus Columbia,"
Hi everyone! I’m a senior in undergrad and have recently been accepted to NYU and Columbia’s masters programs for economics. Everything I find has them ranked somewhat the same and it looks like the coursework is very similar. 
I am drawn to NYU because of the neighborhood but my mom claims this is not a good reason to go there. I just love nyc and know the area pretty well so it draws me in mire than the area of Columbia. I am unsure of what I want to do after getting my degree but am considering staying in academia and maybe pursuing a phd. I’m also really interested in game theory and econometrics specifically. (I am a double major in Econ and math so I’m not opposed to lots of math). 
Additionally, money should not be much of a problem, not that it matters cuz these are both so expensive. 
Does anyone have any experience with one or the other? Are professors at one school more prestigious than the other? I know Columbia has the Ivy name, but how much is this worth/is it worth it? 
Any insight would be greatly appreciated! 
Thanks so much!",1618002233,1,0
NYU Tandon advice,"Thanks in advance for your help!

I got accepted in NYU Tandon for a master in CS. 

I was really enthusiastic since I assumed it to be in the Manhattan campus but then I found out that it is in Brooklyn. The fact that the campus is in Brooklyn is not an issue at all if it wasn't for the reddit reviews about it.  

In short, I read many people complaining about how the social life sucks, how is not that comfortable going to central campus although there's the free shuttle and all the ""gaming culture"" stories. I'm extremely academic focused but I enjoy having an active social life, parties, clubs...

Most of the opinions I read on reddit are a few years old and since Tandon is continuously changing I'd like to have fresh advice. 

How is the nightlife? Social life, parties, clubs. Is it comfortable to go to Washington square? Would I have the constant feeling of missing out something of the New York Experience by being in NYU Tandon? Also, if someone studied MS CS it would be good to hear also about the programme. 

Also is it Tandon better than Courant for someone with industry focus? or is there not much difference. 

I'm sorry if some of the questions are naive but I've never been in the US or NY and this would be a life changing decision.",1617999804,1,0

Should I go to NYU?,"Should I go to NYU?

I got into Stern and I really like NYU. My other college option is Mccombs at UT. If I go to NYU I think I’ll have around 40k of debt, and if I go to Mccombs I’ll have none. 

NYC is my dream city and I really wanna get involved with the music scene there. The problem is: I don’t wanna do IB/consulting, but if I go to Stern I’ll have this 40k to pay off, and I feel like that might force me to. What I really wanna do is work that actually benefits the environment and other people (or music related stuff if I’m successful enough), but whatever I do, I really wanna do it in New York.  

I’m really conflicted because on one hand I can graduate debt free but it won’t be as easy to live/work in NY as it would be from Stern. On the other hand, if I got to Stern, I might be forced to do what I don’t wanna do for the sake of living where I wanna live. 

Do you all have any thoughts? The main thing for me is that debt. I’m not too worried about the “college experience” or anything because I know I’ll have a great time at NYU even tho there’s no enclosed campus or sports or anything.",1617954881,1,0

Looking for Advice: NYU AD vs. UC Berkeley EECS,"Hi, I am struggling to decide between UC Berkeley EECS and NYU Abu Dhabi. I listed some pros and cons of both. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

UC Berkeley EECS vs. NYU Abu Dhabi

UCB

UCB Pros:

One of the top-rated comp sci programs

Have some friends going to Berk

BC Cons:

I enter declared as an EECS major so I have little opportunity to explore other majors before declaring

If I end up not liking CS getting a major change is difficult

Seems to be more restrictive academically (ex. can't explore outside of your major as much)

Large class sizes

NYU AD

NYU AD Pros:

Full scholarship (covers tuition, housing, meals, some flights, etc.); completely free for me to attend

Paid research started freshmen year

Extremely small class sizes (literally 10-20 per class)

Guaranteed study abroad in various countries which seems really fun (majority of cost covered by NYUAD)

Many resources open to the students

Students have large academic freedom; interdisciplinary study opportunities and taking classes outside of your major are encouraged.

Unlike UCB I can explore other disciplines before committing to a major

I like the country and have some family there

Extremely diverse (students from over 100 countries I believe)

NYU AD Cons:

Not as well known worldwide

Not as prestigious or well known as EECS

School still very young (founded around 2010)

I like the atmosphere of NYU AD and the fact that exploring outside of your major is encouraged. There are many academic fields that I would love to get a glimpse into besides just EECS and NYU AD allows for this. However, my biggest concern is that the school is still fairly young and not as well known or praised as UCB EECS. I fear that going here would put me at a disadvantage when it comes to getting jobs or internships. I have friends at UCB EECS/CS who have amazing internships because the program is that well known. I do not know how widespread computer science is in Abu Dhabi or the UAE, but probably not as much as in California.",1617935665,1,0

Columbia vs. NYU,"The title may seem like a WTF question, but hear me out. I am aware that there may be biases, hence why I'm asking this question in both subreddits.

I was admitted to Columbia College (through QuestBridge) and NYU CAS to study (pure) math. I am a commuter which means that my financial aid is pretty much covered for Columbia, with a potential $2k in refund a year. However, NYU would give me about $10-12k in refund a year because I got a big scholarship. Both are refunds not including work-study or loans. Both schools are obviously excellent for math and I don't know which to choose.

The distance to both is quite long. NYU is about an hour and 10-15 minutes away whereas Columbia is an hour and 25-30 minutes away. Yes, I understand this may be impractical but these two schools are pretty much my only options.

I'm into research, but this is undergrad so I'm not sure how significant this would be.

I, first of all, would love to attend and I'm committing to NYUSH but I wanted to know some career related things. I would of course be an International student and I heard you’re not eligible to work with your student visa outside of campus so you can only get jobs within campus? Will that hinder getting any experience for your field and is it that you can only do unpaid internships outside the campus?

And especially, what about after graduation? Will it be difficult to get a job in Shanghai after graduating, which is what I want to do. Will it be difficult to remain there? I live in Abu Dhabi actually, but I would want to remain in Shanghai if I dont go for post-grad elsewhere, will it be hard? Thank you!",1617876793,1,0

NYU Tisch Waitlist Chances?,"
I was waitlisted for Film and Television production at Tisch and from looking at all of my other college offers, I have come to realize NYU is definitely my #1 choice and as close to a dream school as I have a chance to get into. 

With the unpredictable class of 2025 admission cycle, I am really hoping my chances to get off the waitlist are higher this year and that everything will work out. 

From the people here who have had similar experiences or are in Tisch, how many people do you know who are waitlist admits? Have you heard anything about this particular application cycle and historical waitlist chances for NYU? 

I also haven’t sent in the waitlist form because I want to have something strong written down affirming my interest in NYU and am also planning a campus visit. I am also considering opting into consideration for the liberal studies programs or another NYU campus so I can be in the NYU network. 

My future goal is to be a double major in Tisch and to study abroad and get the most out of what NYU has to offer academically and socially.",1617841123,1,0

NYU for premed?,"Hi everyone! I'm a high school senior who got into NYU recently as a Global Public Health major and I had a couple of questions about the NYU premed experience

\-How would you describe the overall premed culture at NYU? It is welcoming and helpful or toxic and cutthroat? 

\-How easy is it to get clinical volunteering/research opportunities at the med school and/or hospitals in the city?

\-Are there any programs that facilitate research on campus?

\-How useful is it to have an affiliated med school? Can I do research under the med school profs? 

\-How hard is the grading at NYU? Some people talk about grade deflation and others talk about grade inflation. Can someone speak to this?

\-What is the quality of professors? Does it fluctuate wildly between classes? Is it consistently not great? consistently good? Any objectively unfair ones?

\-What classes do I need to watch out for or are cutthroat?

\-I've heard the classes at NYU are huge, is that ultimately detrimental? Is it hard to get in touch or meet with professors?

\-How is the quality of the NYU premed advising? Are there any GPA requirements for the NYU Pre-health Committee Letter

\-Would you say the NYU gen ed requirements are a burden to get through?  
\-Are there any premed programs or opportunities that you felt really helped you at NYU?

\-I'm really interested in pursuing the GPH/Bio major, can someone speak about their experience in this major? What is the quality of the professors in the GPH department? Is the workload a lot? Are there any research opportunities in the GPH department?

Advice needed on The Tableau Data Analytics Certificate,"Hi,

I moved to the states back in 2019. In EU, I was working in the iGaming industry as a Fraud Analyst but since I moved here, starting a new life on top of everything going on COVID and all, it's been a struggle to land a job. In the meantime, I recently started learning SQL by myself.

Although I have given some projects with HTML5, CSS3 and C# at collage, haven't used them since 2016, so it's a weakness. Now I am heavily considering to take [this course](https://www.pathstream.com/pages/continuing_nyu_tableau?utm_source=linkedin_pst_ta&amp;utm_campaign=l1004_klik_pst_-_nyu_tableau_wv_tier-2_p_data-management-interests_c-s_-_-_-_no_ta_no_cpc_ty&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=klik_01-06-2021_refresh_learn_le6_nyu-logo&amp;s=nyu&amp;c=tableau&amp;li_fat_id=75ffe19d-421c-466c-a21a-07e4e7816bd5) provided by the collaboration of NYU Tandon School of Engineering, Tableau and Pathstream. 

The context and the structure of the program is appealing to me, and I honestly believe it would give me a good understanding of the full picture of the industry and provide a good start. And I found it affordable and potentially worth for money. 

I wonder if anyone here took this course, because I wasn't able to find any feedbacks online from the people who might have taken this course earlier. It starts on May 11th, hope to get some insight before that date.

I also found SQL's syntax easy to pick up, but to me, the hardest part would be visualizing the data structure you'd like to work on. So if anyone here already active in the field who doesn't mind sharing their thoughts, suggestions on this, please feel free to educate me. I know what I want but I have no idea where to start and where to move on. I am a goal oriented person so I'm just trying to draw a road map to myself then I can clearly see my progress and make sure I am not wasting my time or delaying anything. That's why I am considering investing in [this course](https://www.pathstream.com/pages/continuing_nyu_tableau?utm_source=linkedin_pst_ta&amp;utm_campaign=l1004_klik_pst_-_nyu_tableau_wv_tier-2_p_data-management-interests_c-s_-_-_-_no_ta_no_cpc_ty&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=klik_01-06-2021_refresh_learn_le6_nyu-logo&amp;s=nyu&amp;c=tableau&amp;li_fat_id=75ffe19d-421c-466c-a21a-07e4e7816bd5) at the first place.

Also, would you recommend attending NYU-AD for pre-med in your experience, or would a highly ranked state school (in my home state) like UW-Madison be better?

Tandon accessibility,"Hey guys I hope to get off the NYU waitlist and attend NYU Tandon for Chemical and Bimolecular Engineering as I wish to pursue biomedical engineering in the future.

Is it possible to navigate the campus with a scooter? And also do you guys think they will open lecture halls back up this fall? Lastly, what are the character sizes like for you guys because I would prefer to have smaller classes. Sorry to add on but I would also not prefer lecture halls because they have folding seats and those are hard for me to get in and out of.

NYU Math Placement,"Hello,

I am an incoming freshman at NYU. I was wondering if NYU takes dual enrollment for placement. For instance, I took Calc I and Calc II as a dual enrollment class in high school. The dual enrollment credit was taken from a university. Will I be able to be placed into Calc III? Calc II? Calc I? 

If not, will I be asked to take a placement examination? Do any of you know how the format will work? Will it be a 1 on 1 zoom breakout room or it will just be opened up and I will be asked with completing the exam?

"Real question, I understand that most people here think NYU is guaranteed to have full in-person for the Fall. But I am a little confused as to how some of that is possible when most of my engineering courses have 60 or more students?","I’m from NYU Tandon, and I believe one of the advisors from the Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering department announced that if everything continues to go smoothly with the vaccine, all classes will be in-person only for the Fall. I am just curious as to how they will balance some lab classrooms, lecture halls, exam rooms, with all these students. Is it possibly going to be like before where one group of students come in every other week for a lab? Or maybe not. What about when all the students are gathered in the Pfizer auditorium for a lecture  (or maybe that can’t even happen), and there’s not enough rooms available for people to take examinations during exam hour because classrooms are occupied. I assume that we all can’t be gathered around each other like we used to, so does NYU have enough space to still accumulate small groups of large amounts of students? 

I just don’t want it to be where in the middle of the semester, they tell everyone that we have to switch back to online because all in-person is not working the way they thought. Because from my understanding, even if you get the vaccine, you still have to follow COVID-19 protocols.",1620146706,1,0

Transfer to NYU??,"Hi r/nyu, 

I'm stuck in a sort of particular and strange situation right now, and I'm not entirely sure what to do right now. Any sort of advice, good or bad news would help 100%! :)

So I'm currently in high school with a fair SAT score (1520). I'm finishing my year with a very mediocre total GPA because I aced freshman and junior year, but I had a few mishaps in sophomore year, which messed up my GPA pretty badly when compared to the competition average many people have when applying to NYU. My GPA will most likely end up somewhere at a 3.1-3.4 UW because my high school does not do a weighted GPA at all. I decided to take the CHSPE last year (which is like the GED for minors) and graduate early from high school.

Because finances are also part of the equation when applying to a college, I'm thinking of going to CC first, and then applying to transfer to a ton of colleges in one year, specifically NYU (although it'll be hard).

I took a moderate amount of AP Classes during my sophomore-junior years, here's the list:

AP English Language and Composition = 5

AP European History = 5

AP Statistics = 4

AP United States History = 5

AP Environmental Science = 5

AP Chemistry = 4

I planned to major in Political Science, which unlike Computer Science or any pre-med majors; don't have too many major pre-recs needed. I'm on track to complete 60 credits at CC by the time applications are due (because I'm also applying to some UCs in the fall). This is because I know NYU takes HS stats into consideration, but I was thinking if I could do 60 credits at CC, then my HS stats would matter less and my college work would matter more. 

Sincerely yours and thanks so much for any advice,

Unfortunately, I am having second thoughts about this major because it doesn't seem to give a great foundation in either design or computer science (seems a little too general and not specialized enough for me).

Basically, I was wondering if I could transfer to CAS for CS and do a minor in design. Is there any other faster way to transfer other than starting sophomore year? Like maybe after first semester freshman year? 

Theoretically, let's say I successfully transfer to CAS CS. I would really like the freedom to take more classes in Tisch/Steinhardt for art and design, is there any way to expand the 16 credit limit for taking classes across schools? The design minor is 16 credits and I'd like to take some other classes outside both my minor and CAS.

AND another thing that really bothers me is how Tisch costs $6000 more than the other schools and I know CAS gives out some fat scholarships sometimes, do you think I could be considered for those as a transfer?

Rough calculations regarding the effect of vaccines on reopening in-person classes,"[Source](https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/institutionalResearch/documents/NYU_Common_Data_Set_2020-21.3.22.pdf)

According to Section B subsection 1, 52,775 students were enrolled. This is an upper bound, as not all students are on campus. This also assumes that we don't count the incoming class of 2025, which AFAIK has no regular contact with the campus.

According to Section I subsection 7, there are at least 3349 faculty (with lots of asterisks). That's okay, there is some uncertainty to be expected.

That gives us an estimate of 56124 persons, and we'll just call that an upper bound.

Now, let's apply percentages of the 3 big vaccines specific to New York City.

Here are datasets published by the CDC.

||[Pfizer-BioNTech](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/saz5-9hgg/data)|[Moderna](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/b7pe-5nws/data)|[Janssen (J&amp;J)](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/w9zu-fywh/data) |Cumulative|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|First Dose|128,700|95,200|15,100|239,000|
|Second Dose|128,700 |95,200|N/A|223,900|
|Total|257,400|190,400|15,100|462,900|
|Persons Immunized|128,700|95,200|15,100|239,000|
|% of immunizations|53.84|39.83|6.33|100|

Now, use these as weights of efficacy in the city. We can now estimate the percent of the population that will get COVID, considering everyone is vaccinated (which is a good enough assumption).

100-100\*(0.5384([0.950](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6950e2.htm?s_cid=mm6950e2_w))+0.3983([0.941](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152e1.htm?s_cid=mm695152e1_w))+0.0633(0.663))= 7.17518

7.18%, assuming ALL the students don't follow mask wearing or social distancing, and assuming that you can spread COVID just as easily while immunized as you could without it. And even then, that's an upper bound.

So,  7.17518% \* 56124 = 4024.

4024 infections in the absolute worst case. How low can it be cut down if we all follow precautions?

Unfortunately, that's a little hard to calculate. The following computation is probably wrong scientifically (because current infections affects later infections, because funny exponentials and calculus), but it gives a rough idea of what we're dealing with. The p-values in the cited study have something to be desired, but let's just say that masks cut down your risk by 90%, and masks lower by 65%.

Weighted together: 100(0.1\*0.35)=3.5

That gives us 4024\*3.5%=141 cases. More like a lower bound of an upper bound. If there was data on what % of students were on campus, the total number could be even lower assuming that we follow guidelines.

**Finally, to up things in perspective**: The current % positivity this week was [0.40 %](https://nyc.violettracker.com/nyu-status/#nav). Assuming our calculations, with the virus acting at its worst and us acting at our best, there would be a **37% reduction** in the infection rate.

NYU MS in Real Estate Program.,"Hi Everyone, I’m wondering if there is anyone here who could shed some light on NYU’s MS in RE program since I recently got accepted. I’m graduating this year from my undergraduate school as an Economics major. Since I’m looking to transition into finance/investment based work, I feel as if this degree would be a good thing for me to both learn practical stuff, gain experience, and meet people. Because I do not have prior work experience in real estate finance, I feel as if this would probably be a good move. I don’t  believe in this program guaranteeing me a job but it seems like a good start. 

However, for some reason, I’m sort of doubting whether an MSRE program is worth it or if I should instead try to pursue professional experience and then consider a masters. I’m guessing a bunch of students will already be working full time and doing this degree part-time.

Can't join roommate group,"I'm a rising junior next semester and I want to continue live in dorm because I will graduate one year earlier, therefore there's no need to move into an empty apartment, prepare all the furniture all over again and then sell them at the end of the school year.

Here's the thing, I plan to live with my friend but neither of us can join the roommate group we created. 

We found that we have different priority: I can choose building preference plus room preference while she cannot have room preference.

Does anyone know why this happen? As far as I know we have the same amount of academic credit and that's probably not gonna affect the housing choices...Is there anyone I can email and ask about dorm selection?

I am a graduate student at NYU  for Masters in Financial Engineering. In the summer I will be working as an intern in a hedge fund. I am looking for a private room in a shared apartment or roommates with shared interests. Sharing a space can turn from a sweet to bitter experience,  so the choice of roommates matter to me. I am quite an active individual with an active lifestyle. I am into sports, hiking, travelling and gyming. I am also interested in art, especially renaissance and neoclassical art. I am a non-smoker, non-vegetarian and an occasional drinker (I do have a taste in wine, scotch and beer).  I will not mind your eating, drinking and smoking preferences. It would be better to have someone with shared interests. I am not predisposed towards nationality or food choices. I am LGBTQ and 420 friendly. Though I am not a cleanliness ninja but I would like roommates who appreciate clean shared spaces.
Please reach out to me if you have similar interests.

Improved health care coverage premiums from 90% to 95%.

Parental leave benefits. Established funds too for out of pocket costs.

The whole cops thing was settled with NYU making an acknowledgement I guess that cops can be a health and safety issue. Perhaps that's all they wanted?

Most people won't like this, but I do believe the strike could have been avoided if mediation was agreed too from the beginning. Mediation works. I believe NYU also stated they wouldn't talk about a pay increase unless tuition remission was removed, and that's exactly what happened. I'm glad TAs got a raise, though.",1621046827,1,0

I get it’s grad school. A lot of you might laugh this off and say it’s not important. But, I want the opinion of real NYU students - does this seem like an invalid concern to have? Are there ever moments where you wish you had a large campus that isn’t there? Does it feel isolating? Do the opportunities in the city make up for it, and am I being utterly ridiculous?

Is there better financial aid for nursing students than non-nursing students?,"I’ve read that 88% of Meyers nursing students get financial aid, in comparison to about 51% of NYU students in general. I’ve also read that NYU wants to make Meyers nursing school totally free for 1/3 of undergrad nursing students soon, similar to how they’ve made their Ph.D nursing program totally free and med school totally free. They’ve said it would be much harder to make undergrad nursing school totally free for all students because there are so many more students than in the med school or the Ph.D nursing program. There are also many more scholarships for nursing students.

So yeah, it does seem like the financial aid experience for the nursing students is different than the experience of the average NYU student, so I’m curious as to whether anyone can shine some light on that.

Additionally, NYU nursing grads make the best money of any nursing school’s grads, including Penn. Meyers’s grads also make the best money of any NYU school’s grads. So it’s funny that people talk about how it’s not worth attending NYU if you’re not going to Stern, when Meyers grads make more than Stern grads.",1614725268,1,0

NYUAD or NYUSH in regards to Jobs and Financial Aid?,"Hi! I would like some advice as I’m very conflicted on whether to choose NYUAD or NYUSH as my first choice of Uni, mostly because of job prospects and financial aid. 

My dad makes about $30k per year and I live in Abu Dhabi and I’m applying for Economics or anywhere in Finance. I’ve visited NYUAD but I’ve heard that employers don’t look here much for graduates vs other unis, plus living here, I know employment is kinda unstable. 

I know a primary point will be that if I mind studying in China for NYUSH and I would love to, I just began learning a bit of Mandarin and I like the culture so I would fit well in both NYUAD and NYUSH. 

The problem is, I don’t know whether NYUSH or NYUAD give better financial aid (and I really need high, because, well, salary. My parents can pay about $10k ish per year) and if I do get good financial aid, where can I stay to work?

I think a lot of international students from NYUSH go back to their countries, so will it be easy for me to find work there and stay, or do they favour Chinese students as employees?

Nevertheless with the current pandemic, traveling many hours and the need to do multiple quarantines to end up in a tiny dorm room in the winter cold with almost all my classes online (I would only have one blended which was not even a curriculum requirement) and full of restrictions, I gave up my plan to go to New York. 
Since my decision I’m filled with melancholy and cannot stop to wonder if I’m not missing an opportunity, I even thought about reconsidering and going this weekend but this would be very irresponsible logistically as classes start at the 28 and I need to spend almost one mouth in quarantine. 
Any advices? Should I reconsider? How to stop this spring term blues?",1611256437,1,0
NYU Tandon bridge program experience question,"I recently applied to the bridge program. I got admitted however in the email it says they are unable to guarantee me admission upon completion. 

Should I be discouraged? Not sure what my chances are of getting into masters if the email says that. Don’t want to pay and work really hard if they are not going to consider me for masters. I don’t come from a traditional comp sci background so I wonder if that was the reason of this email.

Also, for anyone who has completed the program. Could you give me any advice as to how your experience was? 

Thank you!",1611254586,1,0

Track Your Homework Using my iOS App," 

Hey there, I am the developer of B4Grad, a mobile app I started developing while I was doing my undergrad.

[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/b4grad-your-student-agenda/id1352751059?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/b4grad-your-student-agenda/id1352751059?mt=8)

B4Grad has since grown and we got a major boost by the pandemic that the world has been facing.

We are looking for students to test the product as we launch several new features this upcoming semester including our note editor. You can send us the feedback via email or write a review on the App Store. That’s it.

And in exchange, we’ll give you the premium version of the app for free. It’s that simple. Just email us on the App Store page or you could message me here on reddit.

So a little more background here- I actually built B4Grad with the intention of making school simple to organize. I always felt like every professor in my program had a different style of doing things, and I thought an agenda wasn’t good enough of a tool.

I hope that B4Grad can serve as a good solution to that problem for some of you. Let me know if it has. 

Thank you 🙏",1611249295,1,0

Does anyone know anything about the MS in Applied Statistics for Social Science Research?,"I am currently very interested in this program but have a few questions.  


Is there any information about the placements for this program? Does it do well with industry too or is it mostly a feeder for the social sciences? How quantitative is this program? Would it be easy for MS Stats students to work on projects with other departments?   


Any other general insights or thoughts on the program from students in the program or alumni would be much appreciated too!",1611209680,1,0

On Campus Jobs search advice,"Hi all. I’m a new spring external transfer student. I’m also an international student. NYU’s tuition is pretty insane. I’ve lost my merit scholarships from my previous institution to transfer to this school too. I’m not qualified for any financial aid obviously. So I really need to look for an on campus job. I have never worked at my previous school before, and would love some detailed input in terms of the process of applying for an on campus job as an international student. What do I need to prepare? Is it more difficult now because of COVID ? Thank you all!",1611189797,1,0
how should I take notes during lecture?,"Hi!

I'm a spring transfer and at my old college I got used to just having the zoom lecture in the background and typing out notes or doing other classwork during the lecture. My first semester here, I'd rather focus more in real-time for each class. How do you guys usually take notes? I could try having  word on one half of the screen and the lecture on the other half. Or I could write on actual paper, but I don't know how fast it might be or if my hands might cramp up. I'm taking a math, science, language, and econ class. Thanks for any advice!!",1611189096,2,0
