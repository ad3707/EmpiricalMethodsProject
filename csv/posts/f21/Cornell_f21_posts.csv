I can hear my suitemate next door with her boyfriend,"I can hear them talking every night between 1-3am. I'm assuming they're just talking at ""normal voice levels,"" but I can hear them because the walls are thin. I'm awake between these hours, but usually in bed and winding down to sleep. It's been bothering me but I don't know if it's enough of an issue that it's ""okay"" to be annoyed by this and ask her and her boyfriend to be quieter. After all, they're in her room...

What do I do? Would anyone else be annoyed by this?",1631513945,1,0

Cornell health rant,"My depression has gotten super bad over the past few months and I finally worked up the courage to get on antidepressants after therapy hasn't been able to completely help. I told the pa at cornell health about my suicidal ideation and depressive thoughts and was hoping to get on antidepressants, but was instead given a weekly vitamin d pill and told to follow up in three months. 

I repeat: I told them about suicidal ideation and depression. They took a blood test and told me it was a slight vitamin d deficiency causing this and that I should follow up in three fucking months. I told them how ridiculous it was, and asked for an earlier appointment but they said she has no other availabilities. I asked to meet with a different doctor and they said I was not allowed to. This just makes me want to die even more lmao",1631509882,1,0

"Almost failed the first homework for CS 4820 (algo), is this a sign to drop?","I'm really struggling right now in algo and I got maybe a 65 on the first homework that I thought I did well on, and the grade distribution graph was skewed left, so it's not like that many people are struggling with me. I'm super weak at writing proofs, and I didn't do too hot in 2800 either. If this trend keeps up, I'll probably end this class with under a C it feels like. I'm not taking any other core CS class this semester. Is this a sign to drop? Or should I take the grade even though it will tank my GPA? I feel like if I drop I won't do much better next semester anyway.

I literally am not smart enough for my STEM classes here,"For my last coding assignment, the prof asked each of us to write the time it took us next to our net id. Turns out the median time was ~4.5 hours. Wanna know how long it took me? 7.5 hours.

Oh, and my classes still didn‚Äôt compile by the due date. And I worked as hard as I could. Hell, I already took a class in this programming language. How am I this much slower than everyone else?

Cornell: The Engulfing Darkness,"Hi, 

I am a sophomore in Fall semester, international student. I live on the last floor of a gothic with no water fountain and no elevators. 

I struggled with depression and anxiety issues throughout freshman year, making me go to the hospital once during each semester. 

Being in this gothic, I feel really isolated and I feel my depression kicking back. 

Being international, I naturally struggle extensively to fit in here and lately, I don't even feel motivated to make friends because everyone is so artificial and not genuine. The friends I had during freshman year have become exceedingly distant and arrogant as they are taking higher level courses than me.

I just declared my major to Physics, after which I feel more hopeless. 

I never had any luck with people ig, let alone girls and this choice of major has just guaranteed intense hardship, Spartanic living conditions and humungous risk of dying alone miserably.

I don't know what I should do. I feel suffocated because nobody relates to me, my parents have given up on me, my friends don't care about my pointless cribbing.

Cornell doesn't want me anymore, it tried to take my scholarship away just before I start sophomore year.

I have considered suicide in the past but I am just too tired to try anything.

I lack any motivation to do anything.

I am not directly asking for your help. I am writing this to get shit off my mind.

But please feel free to respond.

I no longer see the light ahead of the tunnel, I am too far gone and lost in the darkness.",1631502399,1,0

My experience with the many pizzerias of Collegetown,"Okay, so for context, I'm from a tiny town in New England. There's a larger town where the interstate goes through about 20 minutes away (still small by many of your standards), and there are a few pizza places scattered throughout. I've lived my entire life up until coming here this fall in said tiny town, so whenever my family would get pizza, we'd pick it up at the given restaurant, because we were too far away for delivery. A few times on trips where we stayed at a hotel, I had the wonderful experience of pizza delivered to my door, but that's it. I'm a sophomore, so I'm living on West, but I did my first year online, so I haven't lived on campus before. 

So last week, I decided I wanted to order myself a pizza, delivered to my dorm, because I love pizza, and wanted the experience. I found this app called Slice, which showed me local (because I didn't want to get Domino's or Papa John's) pizzerias, and had menus to order through the app. I placed an order with ""Enzo's Pizzeria and Halal Grill"" for a pizza with pepperoni, chicken, green peppers, and jalape√±os, as well as a soda, paid, and sat back to await my food. The driver arrived, and dropped off my food. I had been a bit slow in responding to the text that they had arrived, so they had simply left it outside the dorm, which I understood since it was my fault for not coming right away. However, the soda had not been delivered. I decided it wasn¬¥t worth getting upset about, and wrote it off. When I got back to my room, I opened up the pizza box, only to discover my order had been messed up. The pizza did contain the meats and jalape√±os as requested, but it was missing my green peppers, and Enzo's had added onion, which I definitely did not want, especially because it was ""fucking raw"" (which I despise). I decided to tough it out though, and ate the pizza anyways, some that Sunday night, some the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a week, and it's Sunday again. I'm looking at the menus for the various dining halls on West, deciding where I want to wait in line for 30 minutes for my dinky portion of meat for dinner. However, none of it looks appealing to me, so I decide to order pizza again. Of course, given my experience from last time, I was definitely not going to order from Enzo's again. So I selected a place on the Slice app called ""Casablanca Pizzeria"" which I remembered seeing down in Ithaca when my family dropped me off in August. I place an order for a Meatlover's Pizza and (since they don't have beverages on their online menu) request a soda in the special request box. 15 minutes later, I get an email from Slice saying the cancelled my order because the restaurant did not confirm having received it. As it turns out, they weren't offering delivery. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now its 6:50, and I'm getting hungry, and frankly a bit hangry because I thought my food was on its way that whole time. I get back on Slice, and find another pizzeria: ""Mama Teresa's Pizzeria."" I place the order for a Meatlover's Pizza (which, according the menu, included pepperoni, bacon, and ham) with green bell peppers (to be a little more healthy), and a soda. Unlike Casablanca, they had the sodas directly in the menu, thank god. It's 6:55. According to the app, my pizza should be there, at the latest, by 7:32. 

The time passes quickly, and, assuming my pizza will be there soon, I go stand by the door of my dorm (so that I don't miss the delivery guy for his tip like last week), awaiting the text that he has arrived. 7:32 goes by, still no pizza. Another 5 minutes, and still no pizza. At 7:42, my pizza still hasn't come, so I decide to try and contact Mama Teresa's. I click the ""contact us"" button on the Slice app, and it turns out its to contact Slice support. No matter though, I'll explain the situation to them, and ask to be put in contact with the pizzeria. Just as I tell my support agent Becky about the issue, I get a text! It's my delivery driver, and the pizza is here. I head out and find his car, and he hands me the pizza box. I mention that I ordered a soda, and he says they must not have given it to him, and offers to come back with it. I'm a bit disappointed, but I don't want to be a challenging customer, so I tell him not to worry about it. I get back into my room, and reopen the Slice app to tell Agent Becky I've got the pizza now, which she's happy hear. 

Suddenly, I notice something's off. I ordered from a place called Mama Teresa's, but there's a menu for Enzo's (the place from last week) taped to the box. I open it up, and the pizza has nothing but red and green peppers (no meat). I assume that perhaps these pizzerias use some kind of shared, 3rd party delivery service (which would make sense since the delivery guy's car didn't have any branding on it), and that I have some other customer's order. So I text the delivery guy back telling him I think he gave me the wrong pizza. I don't get a response for several minutes, so I open the Slice app back up. Fearing that Becky may have abandoned me since I said the issue was resolved, I ask if she's still there. Fortunately for me, she quickly responds that yes, she is in fact still there. I explain to her the new situation (with my messed up order and missing soda), and ask for help. After a minute or two without her responding, I ask her to please confirm she has seen my complaint, and then repeat the complaint in more direct language. 30 seconds later, Becky terminates the support session, without any response. 

&amp;#x200B;

[The source of my abandonment issues](https://preview.redd.it/3b9k7ucdd6n71.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43da4e24650d5b70db0dfd47a3e612331d55b35e)

At this point, I'm feeling pretty indignant, and while I'm deciding what to do, I finally get a text back from the delivery driver. He tells me that, in fact, Mama Teresa's and Enzo's (the place I ordered from last week and was specifically trying to avoid because they messed up my order) are THE SAME BUSINESS. He gives me the phone number for the business, and I dial that shit up real quick. The man who picks up has a thick middle eastern accent, so it's a bit tricky for us to understand each other. If it wasn't clear, I'm about to give a summary of the conversation, but in reality, there was much more ""hello, can you hear me?"" and ""what did you say? hello?"" interspersed, on both our parts. I explained what I had ordered (a Meatlover's Pizza with green bell peppers) and what I had received (a pizza with red and green bell peppers), and that my soda was missing. He insisted I had ordered a pizza with bell peppers only, and I reasserted that I had ordered a Meatlover's Pizza, offering to give him the order number. He confirms my name, and goes to double check the order in his system, finding out (much to my surprise) that I am right, and the order was for a Meatlover's Pizza with green peppers, and a soda. His solution is to offer me credit ""for next time!"" I of course, am thinking to myself that there is definitely not gonna be a next time, because I am never going to order pizza from this place again, but I don't want to tell him that so I ask if there are any other options. Again, he says that he can give me credit. I ask outright for a refund, and as it turns out, he's willing to give me $5 back just for the missing meat, and nothing else.",1631498154,1,0

Maskless Monday,"Calling all Cornellians sick and tired of being not sick but still tired!

This Monday, September 13 stop complying with Cornell's indoor mask mandate! We've followed their rules and yet they refuse to treat us like the vaccinated adults the 95% of us are, so lets begin by refusing to follow their rules!

FAQ: 

Will this murder children/ the immunocompromised? 

\- Did you ask this question during any flu season, or in 2009 during the swine flu pandemic when a student [died](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/cornell-undergrad-dies-from-swine-flu/2116193/). You probably didn't but the risk to these groups remains extremely low, per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#SexAndAge) 412 children between the ages of 0-17 have died with COVID-19. If a professor comes forward with proof that their child died as a result of this protest I pledge to drop out of Cornell, because that's how low I think the risk is. 

Why not protest outside or join the Day Hall protests on September 18?

\- This generation is unfortunately way too used to slacktivism, outdoor protests are easily ignored and defeat the purpose of this protest, which is calling for a return to normalcy. The point of protests is to force the issue and get the administration at the very least to be more transparent about the COVID-19 measures they're are instituting, especially when they're not supported by any scientific evidence. 

Will I get in trouble?

\- Potentially! However, like with all protests the more people that participate, the lesser the risk is for individuals, so encourage your friends to go mask-less as well, what are they going to do kick us all out of class? 

I don't like this &gt;:(

\- neat, continue to wear your mask, if you're happy with living like this forever proceed, but the school has yet to say when the masks come off, and based of cancelling OUTDOOR Homecoming events, it'll be never unless we begin to push-back.",1631493796,1,0

Remember who you are mad at,"A lot of y‚Äôall are frustrated, which makes sense and is 100% valid. But a lot of y‚Äôall are  misplacing your anger towards student workers or staff who can‚Äôt really change anything. For example, recently there have been two posts about the dining hall, while frustrations are again valid, they are also extremely short staffed, working to feed thousands of students that the administration obviously wasn‚Äôt ready for. Also etiquette has been declining. As a worker for the service center, I‚Äôve (as well as my coworkers) had a large amount of students come up rudely and start yelling at us. We process as fast as possible. It‚Äôs not the student staff or even the professional staff that Cornell admins decided to increase the north campus population by ~700 without increasing staffing and space for the dining hall and the service center.

Also this could be said about the frustrations for homecoming events being cancelled (mainly the idea of ‚Äúmaskless mondays going around) don‚Äôt put your classmates and professors in an awkward/ potentially dangerous situation because you are upset at the admins. (That being said, protesting is obviously valid, but why ‚Äúprotest‚Äù masks in classrooms when the people who make the changes aren‚Äôt in those classes)

Anyway this is a long rant saying be nice to the people who are helping you, we are frustrated too (and we are students too  l: )and it is frustrating to hear people complain about how you are doing your job when you are doing as best as possible and often higher things are out of our hands",1631463286,1,0

Choirs or Singing Groups,"So, I've been trying to join a choir or an a capella group since I transferred in this semester. I've been singing my entire life in various a capella groups, gospel choirs and show choirs, and would just love to get into it again after being out of the game for 5 years. I've gotten callbacks to every group I auditioned for, but I never end up being accepted because I get incredibly nervous doing solos. I'm not a highly confident person, but I know I can sing and that I did pretty damn good during auditions, so it's slightly disheartening. Do all the groups wish to remain a relatively small size? Did they not accept me because I get crazy nervous singing a solo in front of 15 people I don't know? Is there a reason they're so selective? Are there choirs/groups I can join that won't be so selective based on how nervous I am or that don't do auditions period? I'm a junior, and would like to join a choir as soon as possible because I don't have much time left at Cornell like most people auditioning around me.",1631445609,1,0

About a week later, I got an accidental glimpse at the Window again. And what do I know‚Äî next to the barren coffee table stood a cone. A singular traffic cone, by its signature orange shine. He is moderately sized and in good shape. I thought it weird but I paid it no mind. 

From that point on, whenever I go close the blinds, I can see through the Window its orange little head poking out from behind the table. It is weirdly comforting. That is, until I just looked out my window yesterday and holy shit.

This is my weakest semester and idk I just feel bad :(,"This semester has been pretty bad mentally and I have been trying to reach out and get help, but response times have been terrible and so far two local places only have appointments until December and the rest are far from Ithaca. And also, I'm driving myself crazy by doubting whether there's actually something wrong with me or if I'm fooling myself. I'm waiting to get a diagnosis on something that I feel like will really explain my behavior to me, but now I'm paranoid and I can't tell if I'm just making excuses or if I actually need help. I think I do, but there's days where I just feel like maybe there isn't and I'm just sucky. 

I usually have it together, but things have been getting worse (for years) and I'm slowly breaking down and giving up. I'm about to drop another class because of it, putting me at 13 credits (with 3 being research and 1 being a pass fail class, basically putting me at 9 actual class credits).

I've never done that before and I feel so guilty or disappointed in myself. I'm hoping I can get my issues solved by next semester so that I can come back with a bang. I'm just trying really hard not to see myself as a failure, especially since everyone around me seems to be grinding and taking so many credits/classes.

Shoutout to my ‚ÄúLeadership‚Äù professor for inspiring me to never speak up,"So context. I‚Äôm in a class with a visiting prof and after the drop deadline for 7 week courses ended his personality completely morphed. He went from kind and compassionate to a horrendous human. And he has spent a long time constantly targeting me in these implicit ways by either pretending I don‚Äôt contribute, quickly moving on without an acknowledgement, or emphasizing how I should have followed the point of his fave. 

I thought I was the only one noticing this until I worked with my group and yeah, we noticed his targeting of some folks. Today though he crossed a line. We were having a discussion and so I was sharing a strategy that was inspired by my own experience. People had questions for me so I just answered as it was a discussion but the professor goes in and says how I am boring, I‚Äôm boring everyone, my point is pointless, and I‚Äôm talking too much. What the fuck‚Ä¶ 

In reflections for this prof I‚Äôve already mentioned my severe anxiety and my insane lack of confidence. And he justified it saying he was playing into gender roles and I just made myself a target. He actually polled the class and asked how many people were bored with what I was saying. Not one person raised their hand. They were all completely shocked. No one talked after that. How could you? You just watched a professor tear a student down completely to bits. I had my camera off (thank god) and proceeded to cry in peace. He sent me some private chat and I didn‚Äôt bother reading it. 

What‚Äôs upsetting is nothing will happen to him. He‚Äôs a visiting prof, the class is extremely small, and no one probably is going to care. But the trauma will stick with me. I‚Äôm not okay. I‚Äôm not. I feel so broken by this whole experience. He justified abuse by making the victim feel like the offender. He just taught us how to abuse and bully people and make it okay. Previously he has said we don‚Äôt need to take people‚Äôs emotions into account as leaders among other such horrible statements. But I just needed to share something here because I don‚Äôt want to break my veil of anonymity and say these words out loud. 

I don‚Äôt want to talk anymore. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to.",1633527229,80,1

CS @ Cornell is too easy,"This is not a shitpost. Cornell CS needs a weed-out class. I have done nothing but slack off in 3110 and I‚Äôm guaranteed an A- (provided that I submit A4 on time). That shouldn‚Äôt be allowed. All of the assignments are very hand-holdy, students aren‚Äôt challenged to think critically about anything, no matter how much Clarkson says we shouldn‚Äôt memorize material, the class is very much memorization focused. 

There needs to be harder mandatory classes to graduate as a CS major. Yes, 4120 is a hard class, but it is in no way required. 3110/3410 should be hard classes. They should challenge students to question whether or not they want to be CS majors. 

I feel like: if I were to poll the top 50 students in 3110, and ask them a CS question that is adjacent to the material covered in lecture, 45 of them would get it wrong. How can these be the next generation of software developers? I wouldn‚Äôt trust half of the CS majors to maintain a single file, much less an entire code base.",1638833487,1,0
[QUESTION] Would Cornell students use an app that lets you study together with other students via silent video calls?,"I‚Äôm a London-based Master‚Äôs student who currently finds it difficult concentrating for longer periods of time and finding daily motivation. I‚Äôm normally very organised, have the will to learn and the desire to achieve good grades (scored a 1st/5.0 GPA in my BSc). But the remote-learning environment due to COVID-19 decreases my accountability, productivity and makes me feel socially isolated.

The idea would be to:

1. Match verified students (i.e. you sign up with your university e-mail) on a video call
2. Study silently side-by-side (on mute) by leaving video running in the background 
3. Finish the study session

I submitted the initial request on sept 16th and got approved by the instructor &amp; department, but was rejected by the graduate school due to passing the deadline. However the result was never communicated with me via email.

cornell for sale,"I have decided to put the university up for sale. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to purchase a property with great historical value. There are multiple incredible buildings across the campus. On North Campus you can find the amazing Balch Hall which houses some exotic pets including bats and beetles. The Arts Quad hosts the colossal Goldwin Smith Hall which is filled with fake statues straight from ancient Greece. On the street behind this hall you can find PSB, the coldest building on the entire planet (world record). Central Campus has the clocktower which plays loud, incessant music on some bells (?) even when you are trying to study. Inside the building with the clocktower is the Cocktail Lounge which does not serve cocktails and is not in fact a lounge. There is also of course the Engineering Quad with some great spots like Duffield Hall which always has something going on (need I say more?). Heading left from there you can find the Statler Hotel, ex-home of some of Cornell's first ever COVID patients! Now down the MOUNTAIN (wrongfully titled Libe SLOPE despite the slope literally being infinity) from Central Campus is West Campus where the architects of Cornell decided to put almost every single dining hall (which are rarely open at convenient times, but that's because Cornell is ensuring we all stay skinny). East from Central Campus you can find one of the best places on the property, the Dairy Bar, which serves ice cream sourced straight from the genius cows kept in the Big Red Barn. On the way back from this building you can stop by the Ag Quad which has the best library on campus, Mann, where even the mice of Cornell want to live. There are a few other delicious leftovers on campus including Gates Hall, sponsored by Bill himself, and Schoelfubrefobgdsfdff Field where you can burn yourself on the metal benches on a hot day (good for your skin). Finally if you head down south from Central Campus you reach, of course, South Campus where you can find the spacious and modern Cascadilla Hall (also for sale). This dorm keeps you fit by making sure that the elevators never arrive when you click the button so you have to take the stairs. Also on South Campus is Sheldon Court above Collegetown Bagels (easy access to food and excellent for stalking people from the window) and a few other dorms scattered about. As for nature, North Campus has Beebe Lake where you can go kayaking (right over the waterfall) and South Campus has Cascadilla Gorge which is sure to someday cause Cascadilla Hall to collapse in a sinkhole.

[POLL] Would you use a rideshare aggregator provided by r/Cornell for traveling to/from campus on breaks?,"Hi, everyone. We're (the mod team) thinking about creating something that will allow those searching for rides on this subreddit to find drivers, and people with transportation who don't mind bringing a fellow student along with them to earn a bit of gas money. This could be a spreadsheet, a megathread, or something else--we're not quite sure yet. Completely free, of course, and we'd prioritize anonymity as much as possible by restricting things to people with Cornell NetIDs. But we wanted poll you all, the members of this subreddit, to see if there was any interest in the program.

Please vote on what best represents your interests, even if you have secure transportation that will take you through your time at Cornell. If you could ever picture yourself using a mod-created aggregator to find a ride home/back to school, choose the option that speaks to you. If not, still do the same.

Can I borrow someone's graduation gown?,"Hello, I am graduating in December (the 18th) and I don't really feel like buying or keeping a gown. Does anyone in the Ithaca area still have their cap and gown and would be willing to let me use it for graduation? I can return it, or take it off your hands if you also dont want to have to keep it forever. I am Envi Eng in CALS so either tassel color would be fine, but also I don't really care if it's the completely wrong one either. They're not gonna not let me walk because of it.

Odd Event in Olin Library,"So I was in Olin studying today. There was a guy a few desks away from me who was pretty absorbed in his textbook. He was also wearing headphones so he was essentially completely oblivious to his surroundings. Completely normal, right? You're supposed to be hyper-focused while studying after all.

Well, what made this weird is that there was another guy across the library. He had an Electrical Engineering magazine open but was holding it upside down. He wasn't reading the damn thing at all, he was staring DIRECTLY at the first guy. I swear this dude didn't even BLINK. He was laser focused looking at the headphone dude.

It went on like this for like 20 minutes. I kept periodically looking up from my work to see if EE dude was still staring and sure enough, he was. I don't even know if he was *moving*. I honestly worried if he was having some kind of panic attack or something.

Then all of a sudden, EE dude puts down the magazine. He shook his head vigorously like he was a cartoon character who just ate a spoonful of hot sauce. He dropped his jaw to the floor, raised his eyebrows as far as he could, and then shouted ""AWOOGA!""

Headphone dude didn't notice b/c of his headphones but me and at least a dozen people looked up and stared at the EE dude. He looked around somewhat confused, then cleared his throat loudly, violently shook his head again, and repeated ""AWOOOOOOOOGA! AWOOGA AWOOGA! What a HOTTIE!"" He held up two paper hearts to his eyeballs and shook them back and forth like they were supposed to be hearts on springs popping out of his eyeballs. Headphone dude still didn't notice, but now about half of the library was staring at this guy. 

EE dude then starts digging into his backpack. It took like two minutes to find the object of his search because he didn't take his eyes off of headphones guy, but he pulled out a small musical triangle and the stick you play it with, and he just started smacking that thing around like a fucking madman. DINGALINGALINGALING -- AWOOOOOGA! Hottie alert! Hottie alert! --- DINGALINGALINGALING! Then this motherfucker pulls out an honest to god ACCORDION and starts playing it with one hand while smacking the triangle with another. 

This lasted for like 30 minutes. Then Awooga dude suddenly got super quiet. He put down his horn and triangle, reached into his backpack, and pulled out a boombox. He stood up on the disk and pressed play on the boombox. The boombox blasted out [Awooga Awooga!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) at max volume. 

Then I looked out the window. What did I see? Twenty psych majors with cameras and notepads. This whole thing was a fucking social experiment. 

And that, my dear reader, that was the moment when I realized. We were all so focused on awooga dude and headphone dude that we completely missed that Mario Judah was breakdancing in a Touchdown Bear costume on top of the stacks for the past hour. The moral of this story is that it's fucking stupid that Olin closes early on Friday.",1638743920,1,0

Prioritize getting work done M-F. If you have to do some work over the weekend then so be it, but carve out some time for hobbies and exercise. 

It was hard to go from being the top of my class in high school and undergrad to middle of the pack in grad school. I learned to accept this and to be confident in my abilities. My mental health was more important than dwelling on getting the highest marks. 

Get outside during the day. Dress warm and go for a walk. We need sunlight during the shorter winter days.

Try to reduce intake of news and current events. The world is fucked up.

Free Sublet! Just take care of my pets

Hi! Just reposting this again to see if anyone is interested!

Hi!

Making this under an alt account as to not have too much personal info on my main. I would like to go home for the winter break and have an apartment at auden ithaca. I am willing to let someone stay and sublet my apartment for FREE given the catch that they take care of my pets for me. I have one dog, one cat, and another small animal whose care is all pretty easy (the dog is the most high maintenance but even then they are p easy to be cared for). I dont want to come off as suspicious so if you are interested comment here and I'll DM you, and to make you feel even better I can meet with you IRL and even have you meet the animals. There will be instructions and obviously enough stuff provided for the break. I think this will be pretty beneficially for both parties so instead of dropping 400-800$ to stay this winter you could get this opportunity for free. I'd prefer a girl to live at this spot, but anyone can dm me and I'll def keep you in consideration depending on how much traction this post gets. Thanks!

TL;DR Free apartment for the winter as long as you take care of my pets

edit: I shouldve added a bit about myself, I'm a cornell sophmore! ofc ill add more if we dm etc

My mental health has declined since I‚Äôve been here but it‚Äôs been the worst it‚Äôs ever been this semester. I just haven‚Äôt been at my best here and I don‚Äôt see it getting any better if I stay. 

My main problem right now is that I might need to withdraw from a course because I can‚Äôt risk falling under a 2.0 gpa in order to transfer. The school I wanna transfer to does consider transfers even if the gpa is under 2.0 and based on my high school grades and rank as well as my SAT score I‚Äôm hopeful I could transfer but obviously it would help for my gpa to be over the threshold rather than under. I‚Äôve had to withdraw from a class my first semester and ended up with less than 12 credits. If I withdrew now, I would also fall under 12 credits. 

I have a meeting with an advisor soon and I‚Äôm wondering if they would grant the withdrawal if I mention Why I need it or if I should just mention my mental health. Would I also have to pay money back for this semester if I fall under the 12 credits? Also if anyone has any stories of people they know transferring to a different (and obviously less prestigious) school please share them. This is an extremely difficult decision to make as Cornell was my dream school and I had high hopes that have very rapidly come crashing down.",1637686796,1,0

I feel so defeated,"I am taking cs 2800 and cs 3110 right now. 

I wake up 15 minutes ago and see exam 3 has been released. I studied hard for this one. This is the most prepared that I've ever been out of all 3. I rush out of bed to check my score, expecting at least a high C or low B. I get a low D. Maybe it hasn't been curved yet. It has been. The mean is a whopping 78, median 80.

I did every single exercise, looked at past prelims, and yet.

The same thing happened with CS 2800. I don't know what is wrong with me. It's almost like the more I'm prepared the worse I do.

At this point, I am just so emotionally drained; I put so much in to do so poorly. I have never experienced this before. I always thought that I could do well if I just put the work in.

Martha Pollack‚Äôs Surprising Silence,"
For a university president who is quick on her feet to send an email to all of the students whenever there was something going on across the United States, she sure is quiet about the Rittenhouse trial. Why is that? Is it simply because he was found innocent on all charges? Maybe it‚Äôs because it doesn‚Äôt meet her agenda and decided to stay quiet? Speaking of being quiet, maybe it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs dealing with the backlash from students because she didn‚Äôt do anything that was useful while the active gunman was freely running around campus and the Cornell police were receiving fake bomb threats. She‚Äôs fast to come to the defense of a man who had multiple robbery charges and points a gun at a pregnant woman at point blank, but not to a man who was defending himself from a convicted pedophile felon who was about to shoot him instead.

A positive message to all potential Cornell Students and Applicants (why Cornell is an awesome school),"If you‚Äôre looking at Reddit as a glimpse into different colleges and their cultures (horrible idea btw), you may have looked at Cornell and thought oh no way I‚Äôm not applying there, this place is very depressing.

Let me start my argument by stating Cornell Reddit is not in any way representative of the student body here (nothing wrong with y‚Äôall just not an accurate representation). Most students here are generally happy. I was very scared coming in from a public high school in a small town with friends who either went to local colleges or none at all. But in my time here I‚Äôve gotten involved in things and met people I never would have thought possible. 

From joining a social Greek life org (something I wouldn‚Äôt have done at basically any other college but Cornell Greek life really does have a house for everyone) to getting involved in random clubs that have nothing to do with careers (as well as a bunch of finance clubs), to meeting lifelong friends, to taking classes that have broadened horizons (and dropped my GPA but who cares), Cornell really has been an amazing experience.

Here are some things to love about Cornell:

1. Diversity in majors and in turn personalities and people (so many unique here compared to other places)
2. Incredible food
3. The hybrid vibe of Ithaca with a small town that has a ton of nature but also a city feel in the commons and collegetown
4. Campus architecture that is an awesome mix of old gothic and new modern structures
5. The larger size is both good and bad but is really good in the sense of never running out of people to meet and things to explore

I am definitely forgetting a lot and I‚Äôm sure others can add a lot more.

Now this is not meant to disparage those having a hard time. And Cornell has its fair share of problems that can‚Äôt be denied but that is like any other college.  

But to anyone (especially class of 2026) who is reading this and scared of coming or applying to cornell, seriously don‚Äôt be. Come check it out, it‚Äôs not that bad of a place. And if you have any questions definitely dm me.",1639873807,1,0

Is this a good idea?",1630917045,1,0
"CS Masters in Engineering, is it worth the price tag?","Hey everyone, I am a potential master's student applying for the M.Eng in CS for Spring/Fall 2022.

I'm a non-traditional student in the sense that I'm applying with an undergrad in biology but with extensive CS coursework (discrete, OOP, DS&amp;A). I have no professional or internship experience in tech so I mainly want to use this master's as a springboard to break into the industry.

Compared to online master's programs like r/OMSCS that costs only 8k, Cornell's on-campus program costs around 80-90k (including room and board). I'm not so sure if that price tag is worth it in my situation but also considering Cornell is pretty prestigious, I feel like it would help me get to land a great job after I graduate.

Would it be more beneficial for me to attend the on-campus program, despite the increased cost, or would it not make much of a difference in terms of networking, job/internship opportunities, and interacting with faculty/classmates?  Would love to hear from people who are actually in the program or tried applying.",1630913800,1,0

"Have symptoms, when do results come back?","I got test at Willard Straight Hall around 1245 pm, felt a little tired but attributed it to lack of sleep.

Then just went about my day. At about 9 pm, I began to feel unusually tired, some slight muscle aches and a chill. Now I have a slight fever and a cough. I live alone in a studio off campus. I honestly don't know where I could have got the virus (if I do test positive) because I'm a last semester senior and all I do is go to classes, meet my gf (who tested negative yesterday) and come straight back to my home.

I don't party and the only time I'm ever with a large group of people is during lecture. I had visibly sick students in both of my classes so that's a warning sign, but I sat far away from them and there was some air ventilation. I wear a N95 mask inside and outside as I'm only partly vaccinated with Moderna.  (I'm an international student) Normally, I wouldn't have given a shit about these symptoms and slept it out, but the seemingly rapid progression is kind of alarming me. I really was feeling just fine a few moments ago. Now I've put myself in self-quarantine and I sorta feel scared.

Does anyone know when I get the test results back on mycayugahealth? They haven't updated my status yet. Also, if I do test positive as an off-campus student, what procedures are going to follow? Will I be visited by someone?",1630898895,1,0

A place for spaced repetition in your quest for a 4.0,"I'm sure you have all heard of spaced repetition, the idea that you remember things better if you study them regularly rather than cram just before a prelim or final.  Most of you will have heard of or used software like Anki that has you make flashcard of things you want to learn and then tests you on them at the appropriate intervals.  But have you ever tried to implement spaced repetition here at Cornell?

What methods have you tried?  What excuses have you given to avoid or quit spaced repetition?

A couple of semesters I started out trying to Anki my way to a 4.0.  I still have the decks I created that led to high grades on a couple of first prelims that devastated many others.  However, despite my success early in semesters, I have never been able to keep up the process for more than a month or so.  Then it seems like I have to chose between giving my all to new work or keeping up with review.

This semester I intend to try something different.  There are roughly 100 days between now and finals.  I have two classes that rely on problems sets and tests for their grades.  My plan is that about 90 minutes before I go to bed to test myself on a hard problem or two that I have done in a problem set for one of those classes, every day.  This misses some of the ideal part of timing in spaced repetition but one the other hand I don't have to make flash cards.

I won't spend 90 minutes on this type of spaced repetition, more like 30.  Then that will lead to abut 60 minutes of winding down time.  OK, sometimes the best way I wind down is lying in bed snoring but it works in the end.

So far I don't have enough problems finished to make the problems I chose for repetition much of a surprise.  My solution to that is to add reworking problems from lecture to the pile.  So far I have been able to have a pretty good balance and work on problems that I have a clue about but don't really know the answer.  I think that is ideal.  The point of the process is NOT to learn extra material OR to use this as a mini session to start a new problem set.  The goal is to reinforce things that if I look at them I think I know them but it turns out that on the final, I really don't.  Hopefully, it will also help will the speed I need on finals as well.

Good luck",1630854415,1,0

Trying to understand the buses that drive through Cornell,"Today I was in the bus stop in front of Cornell Law School to catch the 30 back downtown. This is, by the way, the last stop before the Bus 30 crosses the bridge into C'Town. When the bus came, it was too full and we weren't allowed in. 

Then I checked Google Maps and was informed another bus 30 was coming. Well, another bus 30 did came in the time Google Maps predicted, but it came from C'Town into Cornell. I assumed that bus wasn't going downtown, but after the bus stopped in front-ish of Hollister Hall (across from the Law School), it took a left and went down the hill. 

I take that bus every day up the hill and after stopping at Hollister Hall, it takes a right and it goes all the way to the mall. 

Does anyone know why that bus took that turn to downtown? In the end,  Google Maps prediction was right but  it didn't occur to me that I would have to cross the street. It didn't make any sense to me, but maybe I'm missing something.

Idea,"Currently, we are creating more problems for ourselves by following this minimal testing protocol. Many other schools are functioning much better due to their complete LACK of testing. For example, my friends at Wake Forest or USC among many others are able to go to football games and treat life far more normally than we are without consequence. As Dr. Pollack stated in her email, EVERY case on campus has been asymptomatic or mild, and there should be ""no in-classroom transmission,"" so those who are at higher risk should have nothing to worry about. Additionally, our testing frequency is too low to actually stop spread before it occurs. People can get tested on a Sunday, COVID incubates and they start spreading on Monday, and then they walk around like normal for 6 days before realizing they may have had COVID the whole time the next Sunday. This is a terrible excuse for protecting the immunocompromised and it's shameful that the administration is pretending that they're doing their best - people don't even get quarantined after a contact trace anymore, ESPECIALLY not on Cornell's dime (at least in my experience - I had a friend who tested positive who I had seen extensively and I couldn't get Cornell Health to quarantine me).

PHYS 1112 CASE difficulty,"Hello, I am Affectionate Pie. I would like to inquire the Cornell community about the difficulty of the physics CASE examination, especially compared to the past prelims or the course. Also, are there any prelims or course material that are available to use for studying?

Homecoming breakdown,"I feel like people are missing the point of the Homecoming changes, which is important if you want to change the administration's perspective.  Homecoming is an alumni event that includes undergrads, not an undergrad event that includes alumni -- i.e., it's about ""coming home"" to your alma mater.  The administration uses Homecoming to maintain strong connections with alumni in between their reunion years (especially the older alums with -- just gonna say it -- higher earnings).

Coming off of a week with 300 COVID cases, I don't think they wanted a ton of people coming in from all over, entering the bubble on campus.  So, they decided to eliminate some of the more novel, exciting components that might draw people from far away, but kept core things like the football game -- probably expecting that fewer people would come just for the game.  In their minds, I don't think it's about whether to have gatherings of people, it's about whether to have gatherings *that include large numbers of people from outside the campus bubble*.  From that perspective, there is no inconsistency in canceling the fireworks/laser show while keeping the football game.

If you want to argue with them, you need to know where they're coming from.",1631323808,1,0

Oh Corn Hell...what shall we do with your dumbass logic,"* Literally have freshman crammed into eateries with little to no air ventilation. Their mouths are all open (obviously) as they eat and talk. Aerosols flying everywhere

* Even despite the dreadful indoor situations (proven numerous times to be where the vast majority of covid spread occurs), even despite the constant fearmongering doomsayers spreading the worst case scenario, the fact of the matter is, **Cornell is sitting at a VERY COMFORTABLE 95 percent vaccination rate + 0.57 weekly positivity rate + NO STUDENT HOSPITALIZATIONS + sufficient quarantine capacity.** Even with the dumbass decision to not conduct arrival tests AND subpar contact tracing, numbers are still very low. If anything, this is a clear indicator that the vaccine is clearly VERY GOOD at what it does. 
* Yet when it comes to outdoor activities, Cornell can't allow homecoming events? WTF? You allow overpacked eateries, you allow poorly ventilated jam-packed lecture halls, you allow confirmed positives to roam around campus free willynilly - yet you can't allow outdoor homecoming events?

any history+gov double majors? anyone familiar with study abroad programs?,"hi! im applying for the college of arts and sciences this upcoming cycle and was wondering what the experience of double-majoring is like at Cornell, specifically with history and government, and some clarification for a study abroad program I find super interesting.

questions for cornellians in general:

* how difficult is it to double major? if the majors are similar, could the same individual course count towards both majors? 
* i read that apparently 2/3 of the courses taken at Cornell are outside of your major -- is that accurate? Could I take courses wildly different from my major, purely because I think they're interesting?
* can I study multiple languages? specifically thinking about Spanish and Bangla, but also possible Portuguese and Arabic as well. if so, is there any detriment in doing so compared to sticking with just one language?
* **what are some classes** ***everyone*** **should take? like the absolute most interesting and enjoyable class you've ever taken.**
* what classes should I avoid like the plague?

the question I have about study abroad:

there's this program on the directory called [SIT/IHP: Cities in the 21st Century: People, Planning, and Politics](https://experience.cornell.edu/opportunities/sitihp-cities-21st-century-people-planning-and-politics).

"Cornell Once, Never Again","I love to learn. I love the coursework and academic rigor present at Cornell. I love the campus and admire professors‚Äô dedication to teaching. I thought these factors would be strong enough to persuade me to remain at Cornell for a graduate study. **This is no longer the case.**

I am deeply frustrated and angry with the administrative aspect of Cornell. Of course, for a great university to truly be a great university, the growth of a student body and academic potential must be accompanied by a growth in the university‚Äôs ability to manage and administrate. I find that this is not the case at Cornell. For an institution that prides itself on ‚Äúany person, any study,‚Äù Cornell lacks the administrative capabilities to efficiently handle many needs of the student body that fall outside of the classroom.

Whether the administrative function be dining or financial aid, Cornell is incapable of managing the masses. As a student, I expected more from this institution. In fact, we are *entitled* to improvements in the administrative functions. I once thought Cornell prioritized the mental and physical well-being of all students to make sure we are maximizing our time here. Take a look at the dining halls bursting at the seams with students or the stress inflicted upon those still waiting to hear from financial aid 48 hours before deadlines approach and you will understand that administrative improvement is not a priority at Cornell.

I demand that decision makers and management at Cornell understand that the day-to-day functioning of a university greatly impacts the well-being of students. Though I find joy in what I am learning and the people I interact with on this campus, the literal functioning of Cornell is too burdensome and outweighs the benefits.

I deserve better. All students deserve better.",1631293709,1,0

I knew if I came back, as soon as we got past the deadline of September 1st (where you cannot withdraw with a full tuition refund), they would threaten online school. Sure enough that is exactly what happened. This administration is cowardly and irrational. We as students should not continue to be pushed around while they continue to raise tuition costs and provide us a terrible college experience. There needs to be a protest.

*What is Wushu?*

Wushu is a contemporary Chinese martial art. During regular semesters, our club performs at many cultural events on campus and even competes at collegiate level competitions. Wushu is performance-oriented rather than combat-oriented, so while you may be able to beat people up with Wushu, the focus is mainly on aesthetic and exercise. Also, unlike other martial arts at Cornell, we can teach you how to wield weapons, including staff, spear, broad sword, and straight sword.

*Practices*

Our practices will take place every Monday, Friday, and Saturday, starting next week (9/13) and are open to all! You don‚Äôt need to come to every practice, or to the first practice; show up when you want to!

BIOG 1440 or BIOG 1445,I have seen so much polarizing information on BIOG 1440 vs 1445. I just want to make a decision on whether I should stick with 1440 or take 1445. I think as a student 1445 would be better since I'm bad at prelims and in 1445 the exams are all oral which I would be better at. The problem is I'd be at 18 credits with 2 other very difficult classes. Also for context I took AP Bio 2 years ago but still have a lot of the information retained. I'm just wondering which class is more worth it.,1631221172,2,0
