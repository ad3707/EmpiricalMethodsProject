How's the visiting student program?,"I'm a sophomore at another university, and I'm strongly considering applying for the visiting student program at Columbia ([see](https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/apply/visiting-students/)). It was my dream to study there, however due to some life events I had absolutely 0 chance of admission out of high school and I didn't even bother applying. I had the opportunity to (somewhat) visit campus this past summer, and I loved it. My major is great but tiny at my school, and I have comparatively limited opportunities, so it would be amazing to have the opportunity to study away at Columbia.

Unfortunately, I can't seem to find any information on the Visiting Student program outside of what's listed on the website. How is it? How competitive are admissions? What's life like as a visiting student?

How possible is it for someone to shift from career in HCI to Private Equity?,"Professionals in Human Computer Interaction help in creating websites and apps for tech companies, SaaS cos, FMCG companies, etc; which is using the ideas of 'mass psychology' for commerce. 

Using the skills accrued while working in HCI, MBA should help get the aptitude to slide into Private Equity; as managing / flipping a business is largely about knowing market consumption i.e. what market wants and cash flows   
(not entirely though, talent management and etc too are required);   
Hence, an HCI degree will have transferrable skills of how consumption works and then an Ivy League MBA will help get foot in the door for buy side finance. 

I have a degree in finance from a regular college in Mumbai with a 3.0 GPA.  Worked in State Street Bank for a year and then slid into advertising during the pandemic. Private Equity takes the elite of the elite of B School recruits and the aim is to sharpen your profile as one, hence I chose HCI as it is a easy transition for me as I am already doing the same work in advertising.  The intent is to have a great profile and preferentially work in Management Consulting (as Accenture and BCG too have Ux roles) to sharpen up my profile and  skills in making products for mass consumption and then get my MBA to transition in Private  Equity  


My questions

1. How possible is it?
2. What do I have to be prequalified with before applying for an MBA? Would CFA work? (large part of that is corporate finance)...Would courses from Wall Street Oasis, Peak Frameworks, Corporate Finance Institute work?
3. Do they need pre MBA industry experience or will it be the same ritual ie working in M&amp;A for an investment bank first after MBA and then get in PE after some experience?

Additional Core Classes as a SEAS Student,"Hi! I'm a prospective student who applied to SEAS during the Early Decisions cycle.

Virtually all my high school friends are in relationships and I‚Äôm obviously nowhere near getting a partner. My daily routine consists of going to class, going back home and studying, and working out. I‚Äôve not eaten a meal with anyone else during my entire time at this school. There are more days than not when I don‚Äôt talk to anyone. I tried therapy for a year but it didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm a bit scared that if I failed to make any friends in a setting where the primary objective is (arguably) to develop a new circle, my post-grad social life that involves a job (if I even get one-that‚Äôs for another day) could be absolutely miserable. As you can tell I‚Äôm pretty lonely as is.

Idk guys. This is partly a rant but I‚Äôm also wondering if there are any alums or seniors who made very few connections during their time here. Maybe your situation isn‚Äôt as extreme as mine, but even if it isn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd like to hear if/how you made it to the other side.",1636371233,1,0

Chasing a Dream Job,"So, my dream is to get into Jane Street. And that's putting it lightly. I have nothing else going for me, I pretty much need it. But, I can't, because I'm not USAMO/MOP/IMO level. I am not against grinding and ditching time with friends (though I don't have a choice on that last part haha... sigh). 

Anyway, no matter how much effort I put in I doubt I can compete. I don't think I'm smart enough. I'll probably get the interview with Columbia's stamp, but that interview will be the most stressful moment of my life. No fuck ups allowed or its all over, no chance of recovery. Now, there are other firms, I guess. None as prestigious as Jane Street or have the (relatively) good work life. But maybe HRT or Citadel wouldn't be too bad, though they are almost if not just as hard as Jane Street.

If anyone got into one of these firms (or other quant firms), please advise on what to do. Tips on how to prepare, whether I even have a shot, etc. would be helpful. I am looking for trading roles, and am class of 2024.

If I don't get it, I don't know how I'll be able to live with myself. If I do get it, I will still probably be miserable, but hopefully I'll be able to live with myself.",1636339119,1,0

Bomb Threat Deemed Not Credible By NYPD,"To the Columbia Community:

On Sunday, November 7, at approximately 2:30 p.m., Columbia University Public Safety issued a campus-wide emergency alert after receiving bomb threats involving several University buildings, similar to threats that have been made at other colleges around the country in recent days. The University proceeded with an immediate evacuation of the buildings identified in the threat. Following an investigation, the threats were deemed not credible by the NYPD and the campus buildings have been cleared for occupancy. We thank those individuals affected for their patience and cooperation in evacuating.

All the best,

Is Columbia GS worth the money for computer science?,"It seems Columbia GS's tuition will cost around $65,000 per year and combined with other costs like rents, the cost of attendance will be around $90,000 a year. I won't apply for financial aid since Columbia is need-aware for international students. My parents can pay the tuition without loans. But I am curious whether the opportunities Columbia GS will offer is worth almost $100,000 a year. 

1) I want to pursue PhD in ML and getting the research opportunity in ML as an undergrad is crucial. I know Columbia is famous for humanities, finance, and medicine but I am not sure if Columbia is well-regarded in computer science, too, especially in Machine Learning. Also, I want to know if Columbia offers machine learning research opportunities to undergrad international students. I've heard in other schools, there are labs that do not accept undergrad students.

2) In addition to research opportunities, what worries me is that there seem to be some people who look down on GS students. Like in this post, [https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/pu5tdl/opening\_the\_universitywide\_suggestion\_box\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/pu5tdl/opening_the_universitywide_suggestion_box_for/) if you scroll down there are some pretty negative comments toward GS.

Some comments are pretty nasty and I am not sure if they are Columbia students but still it seems there are some people who looks down on GS. These kinds of comments make me wonder if I should just spend one more year at my current community college and apply to UCs instead of going to Columbia GS. I've heard that the true gems of the ivy education (compared to public schools) are networking and small class sizes but I am not sure how I will network with those who look down on me.

I wanna share with you another Columbia related project that is unlike Culpa.

The purpose is to aggregate all *publicly* available data in one place and allow searching it.

&amp;#x200B;

[peqod.com](http://peqod.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Key features**:

* Useful info about Profs ‚Äì Wikipedia links, Google Scholar, h-index, etc ‚Äì in one place
* Database of the schedule for the last 5 years
* Tracking daily updates to the catalog ‚Äì useful for watching new classes
* Historical data for enrollment ‚Äì watch how many people drop the class ([screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/m8hnYK0))
* Yet another CULPA mirror. The purpose is not to be yet another platform for reviews, but to provide an easy search across all available review websites (including Reddit in the future). So we won't be handling new reviews, but we will search and link them from other websites.
* Open source. Including data.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coming up**:

* Links to Reddit reviews
* Links to syllabus when it's publicly available
* Lists of books that is not broken like on Vergil (identified from syllabus, when available)
* Super-duper intelligent recommendations that read your mind and recommend you classes based on the reviews, historic enrollment, archived info, etc (that will take a while to finish)",1637511972,1,0

COLLEGE ALGEBRA-ANLYTC GE (MATH 1003) Worth it for someone like me?,"Hi there!

Despite my disability, I still strongly want to understand mathematics.

Where to Complain Anonymously About an Awful TA?,"Hi,

So I'm taking a certain class this semester and it is the first time here at Columbia I've felt like the grading and overall handling of the class by the TAs, specifically the head TA, is awful, unjust, and incompetent. Let's say the head TAs name is ""Dexter""

During my time at Columbia, virtually every class I'm in has had AMAZING TAs. But not this time. I've spoken to a few of my friends who have TA'd and they told me the experience in the class was against most standard practices they have seen. This was how Dexter ran the grading of the Midterm:

&amp;#x200B;

* Dexter graded 2/3's of ALL problems on the midterms for ALL 114 students in the class 
* The average for the problems Dexter graded was 40%, the median was 30%, and the standard deviation was 35% (!!!!!!!), meaning a significant portion of students received lower than 20%.
* Dexter told us if a student didn't do well on the first few problems on the midterm, he wouldn't spend much time grading a student's later problems.
* Dexter emphasized his midterm grading strategy was to grade as fast as possible 
* If you received a 0 on a problem, Dexter left no comments on what you did wrong. To clarify this, Dexter sent us all an email saying if you got a 0 on a problem you should ""study the solutions"".
* When you received partial credit on a problem the comments Dexter left were either a single word like ""wrong"" or a single ""X"" over a part of our solutions.
* If you had a correct solution that was different than what the professor's solutions manual had, you either received minimal partial credit, or Dexter gave a 0.
* Midterms were NOT graded anonymously 
* Dexter conducts his office hours on Zoom with his camera off
* Dexter's advice when a student in office hours asked what they could do to do better was ""put in the work, this is a hard class. Some students did well on the Midterm."" This is in fact, an introductory course required for many majors.
* When students asked how a low Midterm score would affect their grade, Dexter told us ""I don't know, it will be curved."" When asked how the curve would work he said ""I don't know.""
* The midterm is 35% of our overall grade.

I could keep going because there are some other major problems with how Dexter is running the class, but that should give you an idea. What are our options? He's such a bad TA he almost feels like a parody of bad TAs.",1637288534,2,0

Solution to Meningitis Medical Hold (and the snarkiest email ever),"So I emailed the head of the portal with my concerns, and he sent me the solution in literally the snarkiest fucking way possible. I was so surprised that an old man would be this fucking condescending over a problem that like half of the people I've talked to are running into. This is what he said:

""First, we are well aware of the different vaccines and how they may display on records.  Be assured that is not a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

As you know, all students had to update their meningitis decision form this year, and we appreciate you completed yours in a timely manner.  However, when you completed the form it clearly stated if you selected the option reflecting having been vaccinated in the past 10 years you must also upload a document. As you did not upload a document there was nothing for our team to review associated with your form submission.  I suspect you assumed past uploads might suffice, but it is the upload following the form completion that will place your record in queue for review.  Had you completed that required step after submitting the form our team would have processed your record.

&amp;#x200B;

I will ask the team to review past uploads to determine if there is sufficient information to verify the vaccine.  Assuming so, your hold should be released overnight after the record is verified.

&amp;#x200B;

If other students, like you, only did part of the process please ask them to complete the process so that the team can review and verify.""

&amp;#x200B;

Like it's obviously not clearly stated if half of the people I've talked to are running into the same issue. I'm sure some of us can read. And no, it's not really intuitive that we need to resubmit the same documentation if we've already given it to you (I also feel like you should be able to look at the records you already have in order to see that we've gotten it, like we already had to give you all of our immunizations, why bother asking for that if you just need us to keep resubmitting it).",1638806316,1,0

TA is harsh with grading and shows little to no mercy. The first hw I didn't even get a 50% on it since the TA is has a ""it's right, or it's wrong"" kinda grading style. Barely any partial credit for the effort.

I can't really say where I stand since we only got 2 hw assignments, but the homeworks are HORRIFICLY difficult. Even with office hours, the TA is not helpful at all and just gives super general unspecific guidance.. I swear, I put in so much time studying and trying my best, but the HWS are just SO HARD..

This class is only graded on hw, midterm and a final. After just this one hw, I am scared that I might fail a core class. Someone from SEAS please tell me, can students actually fail and must retake core courses, or for the most part do students pass as long as everyone else is kinda performing just as bad?

"A warning to Columbia University students about freshman Rory Wilson, heir to Christ Church cult featured in Vice News.","Before you hear what I have to say, I'd like you to read this article:  
[https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezwx/inside-the-church-that-preaches-wives-need-to-be-led-with-a-firm-hand](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezwx/inside-the-church-that-preaches-wives-need-to-be-led-with-a-firm-hand)

Now that you have read it. Rory Wilson is Doug Wilson's grandson. Rory is actively involved in his family's  cult. In many ways he is more like his grandfather than his father. Around Moscow Idaho he's know as one of ""The cult bros."" The cult bros are the 3rd generation of prominent families and elders Of Christ Church cult. Rory and the cult bros have gone around harassing and filming victims and victim advocates of his family's cult. Recently he and his father, children's author ND (Nate) Wilson [went around and tagged our town with Soviet Moscow stickers](https://lcvalley.dailyfly.com/Home/ArtMID/1352/ArticleID/58296/Local-Author-Sons-Charged-with-Thirteen-Misdemeanors-over-Stickergate) because his family had staged a fake outrage anti-mask protest. The whole stunt was a setup to encourage donations. They had RED cameras rolling when the police arrested them for having a concealed carry and not showing ID. His family and the cult staged the whole event. This stunt sent waves of violent far right militia members into our city. [One of them beat one of our citizen's face in](https://www.khq.com/news/brawl-breaks-out-at-anti-mask-protest-in-moscow-on-saturday/article_4b9b9a46-01db-11eb-9277-3bc8dca0e823.html). The stunt [sent waves of death threats](https://dnews.com/local/lessons-learned-in-a-tough-year/article_19486b13-aeee-5a10-8981-76fe48951f0d.html) to our local police officers and their families, all because they were trying to keep the rest of us safe.  


Also last year [they sent a flash mob to Tri-state Outfitters full of anti-mask protestors](https://dnews.com/coronavirus/moscow-police-investigating-maskless-incident-at-tri-state-outfitters/article_5ea91bf3-6656-50c1-aa80-3166b37dfdff.html). Some of whom had just tested positive for Covid. The store had to shut down for a week to decontaminate. It should be noted that our small hospital is overflowing at maximum capacity. Pullman regional, across the Washington state border is also at max capacity from our counties carelessness.  


Rory's and his family have over 30 years of hatred. Rory's grandfather the leader of the cult has said this about slavery. It's no wonder his family and the cult celebrate Robert E. Lee day.  
 

https://preview.redd.it/11xfxsteovq71.jpg?width=1042&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85d4a9d27ccc3d6d5e7d45ec23eaa4e951cf1aff

His family has said this about the LGBTQ community. [https://dougwilsonbelieves.com/docs-category/lgbtq-issues/](https://dougwilsonbelieves.com/docs-category/lgbtq-issues/)  It should be noted that Rory's family had a gay neighbor by the name of Wil Hendrick that went missing. His jawbone and skull were found years later dumped in a hunting area. The case is still open with the FBI.  


At one point his family broke into the University of Idaho's president's office and stole letterhead to forge documents.   


I encourage all students reading this to contact Columbia Administration and warn them about Rory Wilson. Columbia students are called to higher standards than a history of hatred and harassment.

Building Social Media App @ Mental Health Space: Request for Customer Discovery Interview,"  

Hey Folks,

We're a team working on building a social media app in the mental health space, as a part of one of the entrepreneurship classes at Columbia. For that, we are seeking to conduct Customer Discovery surveys and talk to people generally about the mental health problems they face, what kind of solution they would want to have, what about social media that helps, and so on(or maybe social media makes you feel even worse). When we say mental health, it doesn't necessarily need to be depression or anxiety, it could be your job search struggle, or loneliness issues coming back to campus after being virtual for a long time.

If anyone would like to help us, what we'll need from you is a short meeting to conduct a quick survey and ask some questions.

If someone's willing to share a part of their valuable time for this, please let us know, we would be happy to have you and would extremely appreciate that. We don't expect that you've dealt with any such issue in the past. If you've some thoughts on social media, some thoughts on mental health, or anything in general, your answers would be helpful.

We respect individual space, and this survey is not meant to be surveying your mental health experiences or such and is generally meant to be exploratory. Still, if you would like to not discuss a question, more than happy and willing to accommodate &amp; adapt to your requirements.

Thanks!!

We look forward to helping people out and increasing their happy times!",1632958908,1,0

Early Application yet never been to New York,"Hello everyone,

I am Danish, yet I've lived in London almost my entire life. I think it would be great to study in New York. The only problem is I've never actually visited New York. We were meant to in 2020, but we all know what happened. 

So now, early application is coming up, it increases your chances to get accepted from 5% to 19%, however you are legally obligated to go to Columbia if you get accepted. 

On one hand, It is my dream to go and study in New York, but on the other hand it feels a bit crazy to 100% commit to a city and university which you have never even visited. I love cities, and I've heard that if you like London and don't think London is too busy, then you'll be fine in New York. It just seems very daunting.

So my first questions are How is Columbia? How is the Core Curriculum?

My second question is Should I apply early or does it not make too much of a difference? What are your guys' input on my situation?

First Year Going Through it Tbh.,"Hi everyone! I'm a cc first year and this is kind of a long and disjointed rant ab my experience, but if anyone has advice or experiences to share, I would really appreciate it. I just feel so weird going to Columbia. Like nothing is objectively horribly wrong and I haven't hated Columbia, but I really just did not love my experience this semester either. Socially, I have a few friends, but I don't necessarily feel like any of them are bound to be lasting connections and I often feel like I'm looked down upon or irrelevant, particularly because I'm kind of introverted. I feel like this is also bc in my experience,  a lot of CU is kind of snobbish either in an intellectual way, acting like your interests are not niche and interesting enough, or financially bc they attended elite private schools and know exactly how to navigate CU. After NSOP, it also just felt like everyone established immovable friend groups, and I still want to meet and get to know people, but everyone seems super closed off. Also the seeming absence of parties on campus makes it feel impossible to meet people that way, and overall just like a traditional college experience is impossible at CU. I also still have no clue what to major in, and it is nearly impossible to get any useful insight from my advisor or to meet upperclassmen who came in undecided and figured out what they were doing. Idk I guess I really just want to know if it gets better or how people who have been in similar situations at Columbia dealt with it? How have people met their friends post-NSOP, esp. as introverts? Like I really just feel kind of directionless and super overwhelmed. In essence, I just feel like everyone else has tons of friends or loves it at CU, and I am kind of yearning for a community or group of friends that I really feel like I am a part of where it doesn't feel like I am being judged 24/7. Also like internships and research kind of terrify me and I feel like I am totally out of my depths in that regard. I apologize if this sounds whiney or anything, but I genuinely just don't feel comfortable at Columbia and really want to ""find my people"" and figure out what I'm doing with my life. I don't think that any of my issues are bad enough to transfer, but if anyone has felt this way and ended up transferring, I would also love to hear about your experience. Anyways, thank you so much and I apologize for how annoying this probably is, but I would really really appreciate any and all advice or insight.",1640921299,1,0

(CS/Stat Double Major) vs. (CS Major + Stat Concentration) vs. (Data Science Major),"I'm currently a freshman in CC, and I'm having a little difficulty deciding whether I should do a CS/Stat double major, a CS major with a Stat Concentration, a Data Science Major, or even just a CS major by itself. From what I've seen on the bulletin, the CS and Statistics majors have some overlap (the calc sequence, linear algebra, and the CS prerequisite). 

However, I'm a little hesitant about going for the Data Science major since it seems to be missing some of the CS core (like Advanced Programming), and ""data science"" itself feels too like too much of a buzz word right now. For the CS major, I'm thinking of doing the Intelligent Systems track, but I am having trouble choosing whether to just do the CS major by itself, or to double major with Stat or add a Stat concentration.

Career wise, I would like to do something along the lines of data science, machine learning, and/or software engineering. If anyone has any insight about the CS or Stat majors and/or the Data Science major, I would appreciate any advice. Thank you!",1634606654,1,0

Warning to Students - Deregistered from ALL Fall 2021 Classes on Wed if you Don't Complete Meningitis Form,"Ok so I just got this email from CU Health stating:

""As an individual registered for the Fall 2021¬†term¬†we see that¬†you¬†are past due¬†to¬†complete the required¬†Meningitis Decision Form.¬†¬†This is a requirement based on New York State law and University policy.¬†¬†Failure to complete this¬†informed decision¬†form by 5pm New York time on Wednesday, October 20 will result in your de-registration from all¬†fall 2021¬†classes.¬†""

I am completely pro-vaccine and have received every one available to me throughout my life. However, the communication around this requirement and the consequences are absurd. 

1. The only other massage I've ever received even mentioning the Meningitis form (buried in info about updated COVID policies) was back in May 2021.
2. Does CU Health know how insanely catastrophic de-registration from all classes could be for a student?

The worst part is that I AM compliant with the meningitis vaccine and I uploaded proof months ago. It is a mistake on their end that they did not process it. But by simply not completing the form I could be de-registered from all my classes. I'm CS and every class I'm in is beyond capacity and I fought hard to get off these waitlists. De-registration would be an absolute nightmare.

In addition, the meningitis vaccine (unlike the COVID vaccine) is optional. So if you choose not to get it, by simply forgetting to click a box CU Health told us about once and only again two days before the deadline, you could be de-registered from all your classes.

Make sure you do the form everyone. Stay vaccinated and stay safe.",1634586667,1,0
CS@CU Bridge program as international student?,"Hello; I've been looking anywhere and couldn't find concrete information on this, so I'm hoping someone here would be able to advise.

I'm an international student interested in applying to the CS@CU Bridge program. I am not in the USA and do not have a USA visa yet. It seems that parts of this program are part-time, and a part-time program would not qualify for student visa? 

So as an international student who would need to get accepted into a fulltime program to obtain a student visa, would this program not be open to me?

Apply to physics or astronomy PhD?,"Hi all, I'm a rising fourth-year undergraduate physics major from a large public research university (very strong in physics).  I'm interested in researching theoretical/computational astrophysics. Since both programs have faculty doing research in my area of interest, I'm debating between applying to the physics or astronomy phd programs (as I can only apply to one).

This post is mostly directed to any students in the physics and astronomy departments at Columbia, but general advice on grad student life from other grad students is welcome as well!

I know in most schools there is a significant exchange of student between the physics and astronomy programs (i.e students in physics dept. do research with faculty in astro dept.) so I was wondering if this is the same for Columbia physics and astro as well.

As far as admissions go, I was wondering if anyone had any further insights or statistics on acceptance rates of either program, number of students accepted in each cycle, etc..., or just any general advice on whether I should apply to the physics or astronomy PhD programs. I have a solid foundation in regular physics (Advanced mechanics, EM, QM, nuclear, particle etc...) and some experience in astro (cosmology, stellar astro, cosmochemsitry) so I believe I can be a competitive candidate for either program and my interests would be well suited to either program. But is one program more difficult to get into than the other? I know at most schools, physics programs tend to take more students per year than astro programs.

 Furthermore, how is the culture in either department?  How is student life? Any insight is appreciated! Thanks in advance.",1634427645,1,0

How is Mowsh Bio graded?,"Just got the score for Exam 1 and got obliterated. Quite disappointed with myself. 

I know we can drop one midterm and I'm confused as to how the grading / combining of points works. 

The syllabus states the following: 

&gt;There will be three non-cumulative midterms and a final. One midterm will be dropped (or if your final is your lowest score 50% of your final and 50% of your lowest midterm will be dropped instead). 

https://preview.redd.it/o7ej0fltdgt71.png?width=358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5b5cef954c1a701a87edc9ae60a061012f63fd8

I know the midterms are 100 points each, so thats 3x100 = 300, additionally we have the 60 points from recitation = 360 total. **How much is the final worth?** Assuming the final is worth 100 as well, that's 460 total points. 

**My question is:** since we drop our lowest score midterm, are the total points out of 460-100=360? Does that mean I need a 336/360 (93%) for a guaranteed A? 

Also, what does **guaranteed** mean? Is there a curve that changes every year depending on class averages?

9/23/21 - Email Announcement from President Bollinger,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

I'm writing to share that Jim Valentini, after leading Columbia College so ably and with such distinction for a decade, will step down as Dean in June of 2022. We are delighted that Dean Valentini will continue to teach and conduct research as Professor of Chemistry when his responsibilities as Dean and Vice President of Undergraduate Education conclude at the end of this academic year.

Reflecting on the long tenure of a successful and beloved institutional leader is always a bittersweet affair, and that is especially the case here. Jim is a scientist who leads Columbia College with his heart as well as his intellect. Anyone who has worked with Jim for even a short time feels his devotion to the College and his abiding appreciation for its unique and proud history. His public addresses sparkled with familiar phrases and ideas: Columbia College is ‚Äúthe greatest college in the greatest university in the greatest city in the world;‚Äù his embrace of the Zen Buddhist state of ‚Äúbeginner‚Äôs mind;‚Äù and, of course, the delight he has taken in enlightening us all about Columbia Blue. Always, Jim‚Äôs stewardship of the College has focused on raising up the students, their families, faculty, alumni, and staff‚Äîa community he sees as being in his charge. This sense of responsibility for the wellbeing and future aspirations of thousands of people is something he has embraced and shouldered admirably. When Jim departs as Dean he will be missed as much for the spirit he has brought to the College as for any particular accomplishment, as many and as significant as they are.

The long-term, strategic plan for the College, developed under Jim‚Äôs guidance, provides an invaluable template for the future, created with input from faculty, students, staff, and the College‚Äôs alumni advisors. The plan focuses on innovative curricular offerings, expanded access through robust financial aid, and celebrating the Core Curriculum, as well as ways to support our world-class faculty. Paired with the strategic plan is the Core to Commencement Campaign, which Jim launched in 2015 to secure the resources needed to fulfill these goals. To date, the campaign has raised nearly $670 million of its $750 million goal. Those funds have endowed 25 professorships and 104 scholarships, made possible rich summer experiences for undergraduates, supported mentoring for faculty, and expanded resources devoted to student wellbeing.

Jim has made a priority of new initiatives designed to enrich the experience of Columbia College students and faculty. My Columbia College Journey is a project encouraging students to interrogate and share their experiences in service of skill-building and personal growth. The Eric H. Holder Initiative for Civil and Political Rights links themes explored in Columbia‚Äôs Core Curriculum to contemporary issues concerning civil and political rights. Jim also has been responsible for a vast expansion of student resources beyond the classroom, from global engagement and career development, to his role in leading the JED Foundation task force on student wellness and mental health. The work of the task force resulted, in part, in the creation of Live Well | Learn Well, a project coordinating Columbia‚Äôs wealth of supportive resources to enhance the wellness of every Columbia student.

Jim arrived at Columbia more than thirty years ago and was quickly recognized for his thoughtfulness and engaged teaching. He was Chair of the Department of Chemistry from 2005 to 2008, and for three years he was director of the Department‚Äôs undergraduate studies program. He has been an active member of the University Senate, contributed significantly to the Presidential Advisory Committee on Diversity Initiatives, and has been Chair of the College Committee on Science Instruction, Chair of the Arts and Sciences Academic Review Committee, a member of the Committee on the Core and the College Committee on Instruction, and faculty representative to the Alumni Association Board. In 2009, Jim was named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is also a Fellow of the American Physical Society.

A signature of Jim‚Äôs time as Dean has been his approachability and his consistent availability to students and colleagues. He has always understood that the people of Columbia College, the students, faculty, staff, and alumni, are responsible for creating the distinctive experience of a Columbia College education. With this insight guiding him, Jim has for ten years been a fundamentally inclusive and wise steward of Columbia‚Äôs oldest school.

I am deeply grateful for Jim‚Äôs service to this University and we all look forward to celebrating him in the months ahead.

Sincerely,

Lee C. Bollinger",1632413527,1,0

"Feeling a little overwhelmed by clubs, etc","Junior here, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed going to clubs and extracurriculars.

And then I was doing homework and totally missed my other club meeting.

When it comes to doing anything really productive outside of school, it just feels kinda pointless and I'm already just so exhausted. I'd rather watch my show in my room than force myself through an awkward conversation or a stilted meeting. I haven't really been meeting up with friends although I've tried some.

Essentially, the only entity benefiting from the benefit isn‚Äôt the owner of the benefit, but Columbia. Excuse me, but how???? This sure sounds like Columbia defrauding the VA.....

Does Anyone Else Feel Lonely?,"I'm a transfer student in CC and the past three weeks have really got me thinking if I should've come to Columbia. I live in a really anti-social dorm with no other transfers, so no one is really eager to talk to me or hang out with me. Most of the other people here seem to have already established friend groups (even if they were at home for all of last year ???), so few people are receptive when I try to reach out to them. I've applied/auditioned/tried out for nearly two dozen clubs, but I've gotten rejected from almost every single one of them (and the ones that have decisions TBA all seem really selective). I got rejected from a few clubs that really meant a lot to me and that I really wanted to join, and I was super hurt when I didn't get in. I'm sad I won't have a group of people to share my interests with anymore at this school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I'm the problem or not, but this school doesn't seem very social. Whenever I approach someone after class and get their number, they always ghost me, leave me on read, or give some other sort of sign that they don't want to interact with me (i.e. quickly walking away after class, ignoring me, etc.). It seems like people here don't like talking after class to people unless they already happened to know them. It's also not like I'm really shy and don't try to make an effort to get to know people (I'm pretty extroverted and outgoing). No one takes up my offer to go downtown on the weekends -- is there something undesirable about me? Do I give off desperate transfer vibes? Probably lol. I've recently starting wondering if I'd be better off at my state school -- no one really gives a shit where you went for undergrad anyways, and most state school kids aren't as cliquey or reserved as the people here. I think I might even be better off GPA-wise at a state school (but maybe not professionally). 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. The past few weeks with club rejections (and social rejection from people in my classes and my dorm) have just been really tough on me as an extrovert. I'm wondering if it'll ever get better soon, but it seems like so much of the things I already want (meeting other transfers, socializing in my dorm, joining clubs) are closed off to me.",1632256143,1,0

I feel so lost with data and papers! I'm not sure whether I should just contact my departmental advisor and tell him that this is turning to be a malignant and stressful experience! Or, should I just keep my mouth shut? Any advice?

New MSCS and CVN Admit - Looking for advice on both,"Hi all,

I just got admitted to the MS in Computer Science program via the Columbia Video Network, and I am planning to begin classes this spring. I am currently planning on pursuing the Machine Learning track, with some interest in the NLP classes, and living in the NYC area.

I want to know what really helps and what I should take advantage of as part of this program and Columbia in general as I plan to visit campus sometimes.

Any advice or tips from current/previous MSCS and CVN students on classes, class rigor, social life, etc would be greatly appreciated. 

Also any advice on how to balance a full-time job, part-time student work, and life would also be helpful, as that is my current plan (i.e. how should i balance my course schedule with this, general advice from anyone who has done this, etc etc).

Thanks in advance!",1632238996,1,0

Insights / Questions for current Columbia CVN students,"**Problem:**

I‚Äôm sort of stuck between committing between Columbia and other universities and wanted some insight from current / former students.

**Background:**

I got into *Columbia‚Äôs CVN Industrial engineering* program as a non-matriculated student, meaning I would have to complete 2 specified courses with a B+ and then reapply.

**Questions:**

1. What is the general difficulty of courses at each university? How are the teachers?
2. Are the courses usually self-paced?
3. Is the reapplication process for Columbia stringent or is it more of a rubber stamp since you‚Äôve already been accepted once? It seems a hassle to reapply vs other colleges automatically accepting me once I‚Äôm done their prerequisites.
4. What are the networking opportunities like being a fully online student? A big part of Columbia is the network and I‚Äôm worried about not being able to put it to use. 
5. What access to resources / campus life do you have (ex. Clubs, incubators, etc..). Does me not being close to campus hurt me?
6. Do you think the college name opened up opportunities that would not have happened if you had gone to a less prestigious one? Aka does having an Ivy league on your resume provide any significant advantage?
7. Anything else you wish you knew before committing?",1632192602,1,0

I'm a junior and I can't seem to land any summer internships and it's causing a lot of anxiety. Any advice?,"I've been searching and applying to multiple internships high and low and I can't seem to land any internships, let alone any interviews.

For context, I'm a Psychology major trying to apply to consulting positions but I've also been applying to other internships that are relevant to my major and everything that is remotely of interest to me. I have some real work experience as well. I took a gap year last year and worked (and still work) as a corporate HR associate at one of the biggest tech companies. I've been to numerous CCE appointments, had my resume reviewed numerous times, tailor my resumes and cover letters, I believe I'm very personable with other things outside of work/school in my life, a part of numerous pre-professional/social clubs, and good with interviews if I'm afforded the opportunity (or at least I'd like to think so), but for the life of me I can't seem to land anything whatsoever. I know that intern hiring season is about to end if it hasn't already and it's causing me mass anxiety.

I'm a GS student utilizing the GI Bill so I do not have any income during the vacations so working/interning is paramount or else I'll find myself financially insecure. I don't have the option to just sit around at my parents' house during the summer nor can I just take any unpaid internship position unless it's a position that I'm VERY interested to the point where I'd take out loans for it.

I think my GPA is holding me back massively (3.0) since I got a C in a class during my first semester due to things going on in my personal life. Then COVID hit and the second semester my grades did not count towards my GPA at all when I did EXTREMELY well. So I effectively have a shitty GPA from a single semester. I am more than confident that I can do extremely well in the coming semesters but it seems like it's too little too late, especially since I'm technically on my third year. I couldn't even attend the virtual career fair this year either since I had to go to a mandatory programming seminar that day for a research course.

I feel helpless and clueless and feel as if I'm trying everything. Does anyone have any advice? And if anyone's wiling to meet up, coffee/tea/beer/your drink of choice is on me.",1632148381,1,0

Advice for a Class of 2026,"Hey y'all 

I visited Columbia in August and it literally was amazing. I walked onto campus and started hysterically crying in front of Alma- the moment was so surreal. I visited the 7 other Ivies, and didn't really experience this same thing so it just made me feel better about signing my life away with an ED Application to Columbia. I'm planning on applying as a Sustainable Development major and listing Environmental Science as my second option. I'm feeling really overwhelmed with this whole process and I guess I just need some advice. As you can probably tell, Columbia is my dream school and I want to do everything I possibly can to get in. Here's some more info about me... 

\- I go to a public school in LA with a graduating class of about 450 students 

\- I have a 3.97 unweighted GPA and a 4.5 weighted GPA 

\- I'll have completed 10 AP classes by the time I graduate

\- I got a 32 on the July ACT (35 english, 26 math, 35 reading, 31 science) but I took it again in September and am waiting for my score still  

\- I took two academic immersion courses with Columbia 

\- I'm the vice president of a club, the fundraising manager of another club, and a part of NHS/NEHS

\- I'm politically active in my community- I'm a part of the mayor's council, on a city commission, and volunteered extensively during the 2020 general election (I'll be starting again with the midterms soon) 

\- I am a farm-hand for a local family-owned farm where I'm able to conduct research regarding sustainability and apply regenerative farming methods 

I'm almost done with my main common app essay (I responded to prompt 3 and tried to make it somewhat funny...I would love to get feedback on it) and I'm still working on the Columbia supplements. They're stressing me out because the prompts are so simple that it seems like someone is trying to trick me. 

Also, nobody at my school has gotten into Columbia since 2011 so that's great. My fear is that the admissions officer will just read the name of my school and throw the whole application out. 

 Anyways, if you guys have any general advice or Columbia-specific advice, I would really appreciate it!",1632088494,1,0
Covid Anxiety,"Hi everyone,

I've been dealing with some bouts of Covd anxiety since returning back to campus. Seems like everyone is being contact traced nowadays, and I keep hearing people cough in my lecture halls (sick coughs, not like ""I have something in my throat"" coughs). According to surveillance testing, I shouldn't be too worried since last week there were only 23 positive cases on campus, but I find myself worrying incessantly about attending giant lectures of 100+ people. It's tough to even feel safe in my own dorm room, which is part of a six person suite. I don't even want to study in the libraries anymore for fear that someone sick had sat there before me. Does anyone know if there are any resources to deal with this on campus? Or perhaps some people that feel similarly?

Commuting to Columbia / Online Classes?,"Hey yall,

I just got admitted to Columbia for the Spring Semester 2022 as a transfer. I was wondering if any of y'all commute from out of Manhattan to Columbia.

Also, I heard from a friend attending the school that the school is going online for the spring semester. Can anyone verify this?",1639750431,1,0

"Booster Dose MANDATE by January 31, 2022","‚Äú
‚Ä¶ Our current vaccination mandate will be expanded to require booster doses for all faculty, staff and students who meet the criteria for eligibility. In general, you are eligible for a booster six months after the last dose of your initial Pfizer or Moderna series (or WHO-authorized vaccine) or two months after the initial J &amp; J vaccination.¬† We expect to make a formal announcement in the next few days but are providing this advance word so that you have as much notice as possible to seek a booster dose.¬† For some of you, the easiest option for obtaining a booster dose may be in the area where you are spending the winter break.¬† We anticipate that compliance with the booster mandate will be necessary by January 31, 2022.¬† Information for faculty and staff on how and when to upload your information will be provided in early January, and students can upload through their student health portal.¬† Booster doses are available at many pharmacies and other locations in the metropolitan area or wherever you may be traveling to over the winter break.¬† Columbia will continue offering booster doses for Morningside students at Lerner Hall and for faculty, staff, and CUIMC students at various ColumbiaDoctors locations, as noted https://covid19.columbia.edu/news/covid-19-booster-shots As always, we recommend that you take advantage of the first opportunity available to you, even if it is a non-Columbia location.¬† All locations provide documentation of all vaccinations, which will be accepted to fulfill the booster mandate‚Ä¶‚Äù

Can someone explain the relationship between Teachers College and Columbia?,"Saw a post about Barnard and I have similar questions about Teachers College.

We also loose out on a lot of benefits CU has - like there is no union for student workers, and our wages haven‚Äôt been raised in 5+ years (they are absolute shit btw). Also, although TC has a good reputation, I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs admissions standards are absolute shit.

I feel like it‚Äôs so hard to find people who will open up about what they‚Äôre going through. I know other people aren‚Äôt having a good semester but I feel like I never hear anyone talk about what they‚Äôre dealing with, or even have anyone to reach out to or ask to talk about life.

I am not low-income to the point where I qualify for automatic fee waivers, but I am not in the financial situation where I can throw away like 85$ (Columbia application fee) for no reason.

I know Columbia has the Ivy League cachet and is ranked higher than Stanford, in addition to Columbia being in the finance capital of the world. I was wondering if it would be a no-brainer for me to go to Columbia if I am able to get accepted. What would most people do, given the same decision? If I probably won't go even if I am accepted, it would be great for me to just not apply and save 85$. Was hoping to hear from you all what you think.",1639625625,1,0
