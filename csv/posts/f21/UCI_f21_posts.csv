Electric Scooter Questions,"I bought an electric scooter before the pandemic. I’m finally about to use it, but I have a few questions. 

1. Are we still technically not allowed to ride them on outer ring road? I see people do this all the time now without getting ticketed.

2. Do they need to be foldable to carry into classrooms, or does it not matter? Mine doesn’t fold, but it’s very light.

3. Do we need a permit or some sort of license to ride them? Getting mixed answers the internet — I want to make sure I’m not breaking any laws.

Thank you so much! I’m aware a few of these were answered before, but I’m just wondering if the policies have changed and what your experience riding an escooter is like on the campus.",1633602493,1,0

Wear a helmet!,"I’ve been seeing a lot of bikes on campus, probably due to the inadequacy of the Anteater Express (UCI’s fault though, not the drivers at all). This is my first year on campus, so I’m not sure how many bikes there were before, but I really want to emphasize the importance of helmets that I’m not seeing!  
  
As an avid cyclist for almost two years in hilly SF, I’ve had my fair share of crashes where a helmet saved by head from being cracked right open. Even though UCI’s elevation changes aren’t as drastic, you don’t need to be going fast to potentially injure yourself. No bike crash is ever fun. One of my scariest crashes involved me going at only ~10 mph on a flat road, and I grabbed my front brake too hard trying to dodge a car at a T-intersection, sending me over my bike and splitting my helmet.  
  
Traffic in Irvine is fast and there are a lot of students that you need to dodge; no doubt many of you cyclists will need to emergency brake at some point, which is dangerous especially if your bike is on the cheaper end (no insult to buying a bike for cheap, it’s just often components can be incorrectly installed or poorly maintained) or if you’re just new to cycling.  
  
Cycling is really fun and convenient, and while I know helmets are an extra cost to the already pricey introduction to cycling and they probably don’t look too great, head injuries are no joke. Be safe out there and where a helmet!",1633582062,1,0
Potential Scammers targetting ACC communities,"So today I got approached by two teens asking if I wanted to make a one-time donation of $20 to sponsor their education for UCSC. The whole thing seemed strange as they were asking for credit card info, and I noticed they had a stack of papers with them of other people who had filled in their information. So once I got back into my apartment I looked further into the program they were advertising, since I noticed that the ""sponsorship program"" they were a part of was associated with the Los Angeles Times. Come to find out it is a scam, and what you sign up for is a subscription-type program where you're told you will pay $20 but in weekly increments that go up each week so you end up paying way more than advertised. I'll link the Reddit post related to the situation. Just letting everyone know because I saw that many people at VDCN specifically filled out that form. If you were one of these people I highly recommend you go freeze your card and get a replacement because the whole situation is very strange, to say the least.

Anteater Express drivers should consider a strike at this point,"I’ve been following news about both the current situation at UCI with the Anteater Express and the situation happening in LA with IATSE, and it’s got me thinking about how unfairly UCI is treating the drivers they rely on to provide transportation for students:

• All buses are full or near capacity due to a lack of staff. While some lines (one or two?) have been added in recent weeks, staffing remains critically low. 

• As of a few weeks ago, only 30 out of the 90 drivers required for full service capacity have been hired. 

• Drivers have been expected to take on the work of three people (which is not possible due to space limitations in each bus), and as a result, have been the subjects of passengers’ anger and frustration when buses are too full to operate normally and service all riders. 

• Drivers are only being paid $18 - $22 an hour. Some might say this is a lot compared to the minimum wage of $14, but in my opinion, BOTH are far too low for the cost of living in Irvine. Especially for bus drivers, who are expected to be drug tested, have a pristine driving record, and a Class B or C license to boot. The job seems, to me, harder and more stressful than working in retail or fast food—especially given the current circumstances… and at least in fast food jobs, you’re given tips and free food in many cases. Imagine driving a bus full of 40-50 people knowing that not many of them are pleased about being squeezed into a bus like sardines, and being expected to handle all sorts of complaints and abuse from students who are angry they can’t leverage a campus service they pay for via fees. 

• On that last point — whatever happened to COVID-19 guidelines? Aren’t we all supposed to be masking indoors (even when it doesn’t make sense, such as when students are doing close-combat sports such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu)? Why is it OK for 40+ students to be packing onto a single bus, with hardly enough room to breathe, when UCI pretends to be super strict on COVID in other instances? To me, the buses act as the veins of the UCI campus, bringing students from far and wide to their classes. If someone with COVID steps on the Anteater Express, they’re exposing the virus to far more students than necessary due to overcrowding. Then, those students depart the bus and potentially expose more students in their classes. Rinse and repeat with every single bus that passes through campus. Why let such a critical point falter with regards to COVID safety? 

• Finally, UCI doesn’t have any issues opening its pursestrings for executive staff. While it might be argued that the best of the best deserve to be paid in accordance with their skills, Gillman is pulling in $562,256 a year in base salary—not to mention all of the benefits, including free housing, he gets as a senior member of the executive staff. For comparison, someone working part time (20hrs/week) at the “competitive” wages offered by the Anteater Express would make $18,720 annually… just enough to cover rent on a tiny studio, if you got lucky enough to find one for $1500/mo. 

So, what’s my point here? In a word, I think now is a great time for the 30 student drivers of the Anteater Express to band together and strike. 

It doesn’t have to be forever, or even for more than a week; even a few days of completely halted services would be enough to spook UCI. It’s been too long since this university (which, to me, resembles a corporation more than anything) was reminded that its workers are living, breathing people who aren’t happy letting themselves be pushed around for scarce above minimum wage driving in unsafe, overcrowded buses during a pandemic. 

What I would demand, at the very least, if I were a worker on the Anteater Express today:

1. Minimum wage of $25 an hour for student drivers to account for the skill the job requires, as well as the stress it entails;

2. Expanded hiring efforts at *whatever price point is necessary* to recruit drivers who already have their Class C licenses. This will ease up the shortage of buses for the time being until more student drivers can be trained and onboarded at more enticing wages;

3. Stricter guidelines on what a “full bus” means during a pandemic—hint for UCI: the answer is not “as many people as can physically fit inside”;

4. Additional benefits to attract talent, including potential housing stipends/reductions, free meals at university dining halls, etc. 

I understand that it’s very unlikely for a strike to actually go through, and that if it did, many students would become even angrier at drivers for “ruining students’ ability to get to class”. 

But I ask you: Is it better to put up with the conditions you’re seeing today—overcrowded buses, long wait times, bus drivers who are stressed out, not as happy as they could be, and trying their best not to burn out given the demands currently being placed on their shoulders—for who knows how long, or is it better to go without public transportation for a few days to allow the people who keep the Anteater Express running to express their discontent with the way UCI is treating them?

I can’t make the decision for anyone here, but I urge you to consider the points I’ve laid out in this post, especially if you are a driver for the Anteater Express. It is deeply upsetting to me that UCI is taking such extreme advantage of students who are just trying to get by and help students who aren’t able to secure housing within walking distance of UCI, and it worries me that a lack of consequences (ie, a strike) will inform UCI’s hiring decisions going forward. 

If nobody makes serious, lasting damage to their bottom line (making money at any cost to students), nothing will change.

Thank you for reading. I welcome feedback and comments from the community and from drivers themselves.

Will changing state driver's license mid year cause me to lose in-state tuition?,"I'm a California native and long term resident. I was awarded in-state tuition for what will be my final year at UCI. However, after a trip home back east things kicked up with the Delta Variant I decided to apply for an in-person exception for Fall quarter.  


Certain things in the state I'm currently in require a local ID/Driver's License. Would changing my driver's license change my in-state status? Do I *have* to report this? FAFSA already classified me for the year, so I'm not sure if financial aid does some kind of residency check beyond the one they did to award aid this quarter.",1631510376,1,0

"Photo ID, On Campus Job, Parking Q's!","1. Hey everyone, may sound a lil noobish of me, but I'm an incoming freshman and I am a bit unsure on how to to pickup my physical student ID exactly. I was sent an email awhile back and my photo was approved but does anyone know how I can actually pickup my physical id? 

2. I'm also looking to find a job on campus that way I can avoid as much back and forth trips because after all, I am a commuting student. Should I wait for classes to start and look for hiring positions in person? Is it usually difficult to find a job on campus? Or will I be guaranteed one essentially if I look? Also, what is the pay typically? My current job is $17/hr and I am debating whether to put my two weeks in or not.

1. If I got this meal plan would I be able to swipe guests in, for example, if I swiped a friend in could I use one of my 85 meals as part of swiping them in meaning that if we ate together and I swiped myself in I would go down to 83 meals?

transfer looking for friends//ACC,"Hey guys. I'm a junior transfer(19F) and live in vdcn. I'm a bit shy and my housemates are busy doing their own things so I literally don't know anyone. These past few days, I have been staying in my room the whole day/night and only go to campus and come straight back after class is done. 
Even though I'm shy, I always ended up making friends but this time, I feel so left out because I see everyone already in friend groups. It kinda feels like cc all over again--going to class alone, walking around campus alone.
I like going to cafes and hanging out to do whatever/go wherever, so if anyone is interested, pls hmu.

Stolen Bike and PSA,"Hello fellow anteaters, I am making this post because this weekend my bike was stolen and I also wanted to offer some advice so that the same thing doesn't happen to you. First though, I have included a picture of my bike so if you happen to see it online, or on/near campus please contact me or contact the proper authorities so that I can hopefully recover my bike. The bike was last seen at Puerta Del Sol at the base of the elevator, securely attached to the bike rack, so beware if you live in that area especially. I relied on this bike every day just as I am sure many of you rely on your bikes so I was quite devastated to see that someone had taken a grinder to my U-Lock and my bike was missing this morning. Again, if you have any information that can help me locate my bike, please PM me.

So here is my advice to you. 

1. If you don't have a U-Lock, go get one. It is the most effective way to secure your bike. The police officer I spoke to today said only 1/50-100 bikes reported stolen have the U-lock cut/sawed, a cheap cable makes you much more susceptible.
2. When you secure your bike to a rack, be sure to place the U-Lock through the frame of the bike rather than just a front or rear tire. Many bikes have tires that are easily detachable, or I have seen many bikes on campus that can easily be taken because they are not properly secured. 
3. VERY IMPORTANT! Be sure to register your bike with UCI so that if your bike is stolen, they can record the serial number and are more likely to be able to get your bike to you if it is found and can more easily identify the bike.

"i have no friends, i'm sad, what do i do","i'm a first year bio sci student who is from out of state, and i just don't know how to approach making friends. it doesn't help that i'm the most socially awkward, introverted person ever, and that i don't have a roommate since i got assigned a single dorm (don't get me wrong i love it, but sometimes i wonder if i would've had friends since a roommate is kind of like a ""forced friend."") it feels like i'm the only person suffering even though i know i cannot be the only one given the amount of people here but seeing the amount of people having lunch with other people, going to classes with other people, etc, it makes me feel like i'm the only person with this issue. i know it's only been like a month and that the classes are big so it's hard blah blah blah, but still. each day goes by and i always wonder if it's me, my expectations being too high, my social awkwardness, etc which makes me feel (if i'm going to be honest) like i don't belong here and sad. does anyone have any advice on how to approach making friends as an introvert or at least what i could do to make myself feel less lonely?",1634622590,1,0
Is there really no party life unless you’re in a frat?,"I’m a second year and this is my first year on campus (I live at vdc). I’ve heard that uci can be a “boring” school and at first I didn’t really believe it. But after living here for about a month it honestly does feel a little dead. I did rush a few frats, but I just don’t think I’d want to be in a frat as I’m not the biggest party guy but I definitely wouldn’t mind going to some on weekends. So it just leaves me feeling like I’d have to force myself to join a frat to have fun because it seems like everyone already has their friend groups. I really don’t know what to do since it feels like I only have acquaintances but no friends who would hit me up to go get food or something like that. Does anyone else feel like Greek isn’t for them but they do want some to at least party a little? Guys who didn’t join frats, what do you recommend to do to find some sort of parties or kickbacks because I know I’d probably never get into a frat party unless I’m in one. I’d appreciate any suggestions!",1634621969,1,0

Is CS really right for me?,"I took 31 back in freshman year and I really liked it. I've never coded before but learning the basics really gave me enjoyment and I went on to take 32 and further.

But then Zoom Fatigue started hitting me so bad that I could not stare at the monitor for longer than 30 mins -- I lost my motivation and failed 32 and 2B. It was miserable but I still went on and retook 32 in the summer, and raised a D+ to A+. Things started clicking and I loved coding even more.

Fast foward, I'm now retaking 2B along with 6D and 33 -- but the midterm grades came out and I failed 6D. 33 and 2B are okay (though I still struggle in 2B), but I have no chance of doing well in 6D. This in-person quarter in general has been so overwhelming to the point that I don't think I ever took a real rest. 

I probably have to re-take it, but at this point I really question whether I should still switch into CS when I am about to fail 3 classes before even switching into CS. Academic counselors have been recommending me to look for Informatics or other majors, and I myself question whether I should really pursue tech field too.

Should I still apply for CS after failing 3 classes? I love CS, I still love coding classes I take, but time management and my capacity (or discipline) don't seem to tell me that I suit for CS. Informatics and SE are options, but if these classes are already giving me a hard time then I don't know whether I should even have a step in this field.",1636742696,1,0

2nd Year Transfer - A Rant ?,"Hello!!! I hope everyone is doing well. I have been on this reddit for awhile, but never got around to making a dedicated UCI account, hence the newness of my account. I am a 2nd year transfer (4th year), although this feels like my first year at UCI!! In fact, for those who are lucky enough to be here since your freshman year, know that I envy you LMAO. This is my first time at ""real college"" since imo community college was the worst experience thus far. I like being anon because I can finally shout to a void that I saved money but hated every minute of CC, and would only recommend it if it's your only option. Anyways, it's simple to say that my journey through college has been less than ideal. But I couldn't be more happy to finally be here! 

Besides my happiness, and being proud but also feeling lost because I often wonder how I even got into UCI in the first place, I feel so alone. Like the pandemic alone was isolating, but walking on campus completely alone and unattached is a whole new feeling of emptiness.

I am involved on quite a few endeavors on campus, but I don't really know everyone well or have friends. I have no deep connections with anyone, and it hurts. I don't know, it's like those friends I do have are the ones from classes etc, but I don't necessarily feel like they are people I could tell my problems to (hence why I am here ahah), or casually ask to hangout. I am a commuter, so on top of not living near campus, I often am worried about the drive home etc, rather than staying longer to study and stuff. 

I really am not sure what else to say. I've intended on posting here for awhile ironically, though I'm not even sure if this will reach people. I really enjoy campus, and stuff but god **I literally don't think I've ever felt so alone** LMAOO. If I am being totally honest, I feel like my only friends on campus are those little robots idek what they're called because I've never ordered from one. But when I see them like backing up or stuck I just think to myself, me too little buddy. (Also quite possibly the stupidest question, but how do those work? Is someone controlling it or is it literally a robot?) 

I really would love to spend more time on campus. Find more secret study spaces for when I am there, go through the student center (i've only ever been to the Zot &amp; Go for some snacks lol), go to the pub, go to a basketball game, go to the arc (although I've never been to a gym and am quite shy haha), you know just all the fun things that typical UCI students do. Although, being shy I am super scared to try these things alone, as I just know I would feel so awk, like I would love to go to a basketball game, but alone ?? LMAO, I feel like I can see the ""step out of your comfort zone"" comments coming already, but please know I am like a senior with the mindset and experience of a freshman here (that's what 2 years at a CC and first year online will do) so please be kind &gt;.&gt;

Also not to grasp at sticks here, but the dating scene? I've never really dated in my life but was planning too when I got to UCI. But now LMAO, it's like I go to UCI for a few hours for classes/clubs etc and I'm like how does everyone do it? (sorry dating novice lmaoo)

Also, is everyone sick? Is everyone okay? I hear that something is going around, and it's been knocking people out of my classes. Please make sure you all take care of yourselves, and I hope you feel better soon!!

Also shoutout to all the homies on this reddit page, because I learn so much from all of you!!! Literally, I learned how to register, classes, parking, professors, research - you name it! So thank you for helping people out like me!!!

Anyways, sorry for the rant, but thank you for taking the time to read it as I super appreciate it. If you have any advice or anything on how to feel like a true anteater please let me know. I hope everyone has a great week 7 :)",1636611746,1,0

Failed a class,A professor failed me in a class because I forgot to cite 2 sentences after chatting with a TA on discord. It was high level discussion and it was a homework during week 2 of the quarter but I was only notified about it last week during winter break. I tried to reason with the professor but he decided to fail me anyway. Many of classmates are telling me I can fight this and speak with the dean and such but honestly I'm very depressed and I'm tired of dealing with UCI. The F in the class is causing my graduation to be delayed by another year and I'm feeling very depressed. I have had anything to eat in the past 48 hours and been crying. I don't mind retaking the class if I can just avoid the heartache. The professor is also planning to report me somewhere.,1639853539,1,0

Lowkey having an identity crisis as a 3rd year,"Y'all, I've been at UCI for 3 years now working towards a humanities degree because I want to be a teacher, but now I'm thinking that this route probably isn't for me. 

However I can't really do anything about it. It's my 3rd year and it's kind of too late to switch to any other major and finish before UCI decides to kick me out. I'm not even really qualified in anything else so I wouldn't be able to switch schools even if I wanted to. The only thing I can really switch to is education, but if that was a viable option then I wouldn't be having this identity crisis. My current degree is pretty much useless if I don't become an educator D: 

Anyhow, not sure what I'm going to do. Maybe I'll change my mind down the road. I'm sure I'm not alone in this, how do you guys handle having identity crises with your major or future? Any tips on how to navigate the next few years in college without feeling too miserable?",1639818637,1,0

But knowing how much UC loves fucking college kids they're just gonna shut down and not deal with it. Like they cant charge us all this money and not even try to deal with the situation. we need to hold them accountable if they shut down because this isn't the beginning of the pandemic anymore we cant just retreat every time there's a new variant because retreating and shutting down has proven not to work.

Incorrect writing score for act on student access,"I’m a senior who just graduated this fall quarter, and maybe I’m over thinking things a WHOLE lot by posting this, but I need some help.

Everything else looked okay (English math reading scores etc) it wasn’t like I submitted the wrong ACT, but for writing it said I got a 0 when I got an 11. Normally I could care less since I remember very clearly as a freshman submitting my scores accurately and never being contacted about a mistake on their part, but now I’m worried it will affect my degree getting conferred properly now that I graduated.

to get an A in the class you needed 4/4 passes on the in-lab assignments and 2 high passing and 2 low passing lab reports. as well as 3/3 passing on the final. 

i met all of those requirements except one lab report i got ONE rubric point taken off for a dumb reason so i got a fail. and so now im getting a B in the class despite meeting ALL of the other requirements for an A. 

in other words, I could've essentially not done an entire project (not shown up to lab for the last 3 weeks) and still have gotten the same grade im getting now...

I know college isn't all about partying, but it would feel so nice to let loose and have a break from all the studying and stress. That’s why I was looking forward to this weekend. I think a part of my frustration is that I bought a whole ass costume and I there isn’t even a party to wear it to. I talked to some friends who went to other non-party UCs, asking them how they found out about parties, and they said, “idk we just heard about it.” HOW? I’ve been asking everyone I know if they know about any house parties and everyone seems to be in the same boat as me. I saw a comment about frat parties on Reddit but they never dropped any details.

2. if i do take writing 39b, do the professors usually teach the same theme every quarter? i can't find the theme list for this upcoming quarter and i really don't want to take some previous themes that were offered. also what professors are good because writing isn't really my favorite thing.

Does anyone want to be friends?,"I apologize if this is another post talking about how isolated it feels going to school here at UCI but it’s also been sort of comforting to see that it isn’t just me who feels this way. I’m a commuter and I’m driving from Los Angeles to Irvine 5 days a week and I’m essentially here 12+ hours each day which can be exhausting but it also gets lonely and makes succeeding in class difficult as well just in terms of feeling comfortable and happy on campus. Back at my CC I didn’t have trouble making friends or keeping connections and even now the friends I do have don’t go to UCI or are so far away there’s no way we could hang out. I’ve been trying to make new friends here at UCI specifically by exchanging contact info with people in my classes or discord channels for my courses but everyone either already has their group that they mesh with or just plain ignores me. I’m definitely a talker but I can take a hint. It’s gotten to the point where I feel like I must be coming off awkward or something, which is possible because 2 years of Covid college will do that to you but it’s still hard to deal with because prior to this I’ve always been very extroverted/friendly/chill and making friends has never been an obstacle I’ve faced. 

All this to say, if you’re on campus most of the week and you’d like to study together/hang out/ or grab food let me know! I’d love to make friends here at UCI. If it matters I’m an environmental engineer major, I originally applied as a chem major and before that I was a bio major. So I do love stem but I’ve found myself to be out of my element in engineering.",1635492852,1,0

# We've got......dumptrucks that won't even fit through your door 😈😈😈 that'll leave dents in your sofas, that'll take up the space of a whole other person but at least they're dumptrucks 🍑💦💦

It might take a minute for us to squeeze through your doorway, but it's worth the wait :)

# Don't pass on that ass

For the nerds out there, we have questions: 

1. So like, can we just walk into a frat party or do we...like..maybe need an invite? (again we ain't no sweaty CS boys, we're hot **ass fuck**)
2. How wide are your doorways?

UCI Halloween Party - open invitation,"When: Halloween, 8-pm whenever.

Where: My home near campus. 

Hey guys. I’m a final year Engineering major, at UCI so I figured I’d go all out and have the best Halloween party I can host at my place. I have parties all the time, but I got a few people messaging me about it, so I figured there was a demand. This will be my last party, so I’ll try to go all out. 

I own my own home near campus and I’m 22. I’m extending the invitation to my fellow Anteaters who that would like to go to a costume party on halloween. Everyone is welcome. Details: 

You must wear a costume. Doesn’t have to be crazy. Just something. I’ll have plenty of liquor, beer, seltzers, normal drinks, snacks, I have food to grill so yes real food, weed is allowed in the backyard. I have outdoor games and party video games set up, I clear out space for a small dance floor, a backyard, and an audio system. If you want to bring something, maybe sweets or liquor you like. 


There is usually a medium amount of people, but I hope this time there is more. I will try to get some extra fun stuff to make it special. If you attend UCI, you and any of your friends are welcome. 

I try my best to make it as comfortable, safe and fun as I can. Please don’t feel any pressure to drink or smoke, I’m grilling some food (no vegan options sorry), but just know usually 99% of people drink. If you do drink, my place is open to anyone who needs to stay over if you aren’t okay to drive. I have plenty of spare blankets and pillows, but bedrooms/couches are first come first serve. You are more than welcome to use my appliances if you need. I have separate bathrooms and rooms. Don’t expect Project X, but we are college students so come on, it’s gonna be a lil’ crazy. 

The rules are: no vomiting inside, no smoking inside, please stay out of my room, don’t let my cat out, don’t abuse my dog, don’t trash my place, don’t disrespect my place (you know what I mean) don’t steal anything, don’t be a douche, those who I don’t know are required to have a shot with me, and have fun! 

Girls++ the more girls we have the better. DM me so I can have a headcount. Yes bring your group. 
Guys, HMU kings if you are interested, I just want to make sure we have a healthy split of people but I want as many people to come. 95% of the people there will be from UCI, but any of your friends that don’t go are fine. Just make sure they’re cool. 

I hope to see you guys there, I want my last party to be a blast!",1635474441,1,0

Is it difficult requesting to go over the unit maximum?,"I tried requesting from my counselor my first quarter here through, and they declined because it wasn’t allowed for students of their first quarter to go over 20 units (I wasn’t aware this was a rule). I just got accepted as a double major and I am really looking forward to taking more classes but this would also mean going over the unit maximum. 

After the first time I was declined, I’m truthfully a little nervous to request from that counselor again because I don’t want to be turned down a second time. I wanted to ask UCI students that have gone over the unit maximum: was it something that just took an email and you were confirmed,,, or did it have to take some more back-and-forth convincing before your counselors allowed you to go over?

For context, I am in the school of Humanities",1638821575,1,0

Returning to school puts us in a very awkward situation where we are forced to plan around our jobs. Not only that, but it makes it easier and cheaper for students who commute or dorm. The key word is options. We should be able to decide how and when we want to continue our education.

"Now I might just be a confrontational moron, but this is an example of a perfectly legal solution to a problem that is far too common. I have heard many stories from my friends about when they were being attacked, chased by unmarked vans, cornered in, and hurt by men on college campuses.","[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/10/18/back-to-the-eighties-crime-yucky-subways-and-the-guardian-angels](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/10/18/back-to-the-eighties-crime-yucky-subways-and-the-guardian-angels)

The guardian angels were able to prevent crime with active LEGAL patrols organized by community members. Now this is not the 80's but there is nothing wrong with having an active community of College Students who are willing to make a few rounds without engaging in and stooping down to the same level of violence that the campus scuzzbaggs choose inflict on students at our school. This is all within the bounds of the law.

I think I will be sure to contact the founding member Curtis Silwa or other Guardian Angel representatives and see what it takes to have a chapter established on this side of the country.

The Guardian Angels were first and foremost the people that were wiling to practice restraint and good judgement when entering dangerous situations and they were able to contact the police or appropriate authorities when using verbal intervention was not enough.

I totally want to respect the autonomy and wishes of those that have been harmed or have been robbed or victimized in any fashion.

Can't make friends:,"Hello UCI. Now before you regale me with how many posts this subject has gotten, let me explain the steps I have taken to solve this problem myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Joining Clubs 

Yes, I have joined clubs in an attempt to socialize. I won't name the clubs in particular, but I've mainly joined clubs that pertain to my interests (mostly video games, writing, etc). I have found that within these clubs, no matter how hard I attempt to put myself out there, I'm always brushed off or ignored.  For example, in this one club, I asked how I could write more often, and in response, I got brushed off by some other person ""hijacking"" my question and turning it into their own question without any regard for the original question. Other clubs that involve sports and on-campus activities have devolved into becoming cliques because I am fundamentally an outsider. No matter my attempts to introduce myself to new people, I am excluded because I hold differing views and different ways of approaching ideas.

* Making Friends in Classes:

This one stung the most. I am very quiet within my classes and I decided to test my luck by joining a study group to study for a midterm. Needless to say, after communicating to no avail (i.e. asking when we are studying, where where are studying, etc), I got told in the group chat that we ""oh lol, we already did our study session"". Much like my high school years, this one stung hard for me. I do not know what I did wrong. 

* Talking with professors: 

I think this one might be a problem with me internalizing my insecurities. I think that whenever I want to have a conversation with my professors, they are turned off by the incessant questions I have to further a discussion. It's not so that I don't understand the material, but I simply wish to approach new angles of thinking.

* Getting a job: 

This is one that my parent has told me to do. I would get a job, but I'm an introvert that only has basic social skills to function in society without appearing disabled. Stuff like the food and retail sectors abhors me because I cannot tolerate incessant amounts of people. At most, I can only tolerate around two to three people at a time which is why I tried conversing with my professors one-on-one. Jobs such as the eSports arena and the Library have rejected my applications somehow (I did not disclose I was an introvert nor that I could not handle big groups of people).  

To be blunt, I do not know what I am doing wrong. While I am trying to ""lower"" my standards by mingling with people who do not share common interests with me, it is incredibly hard for me to attempt to socialize with people with who I do not enjoy socializing because I cannot find anything we share in common and instead are forced to devolve into small talk about ""oh, yeah, school is tough LOL!"" I've tried going to counselors on campus and for somewhat reason, the counselor did not even show up to my appointment. I only have a school life and an online life where the only things I do are study, write, and play video games. 

I have tried adjusting my perspective, such as trying to find intrinsic value in people with who I do not share anything in common besides the fact we identify ourselves as a human, but I simply cannot develop any meaningful relationships with people. If you wish to hate and flame on me for asking genuine questions, that's okay. I'm used to people roasting me.",1640906353,1,0

Those who were admitted / rejected …,"Please be kind. 
I am anxiously waiting on an admission decision and trying not to make up anything in my brain.  

First can you comment if you were someone who was accepted/ waitlisted/ rejected (if you don’t mind).

Secondly, did you receive an email about a month after the confirmation of application receipt email that said, “Let’s stay in touch *name*!”

I am going to fail a class that is required for my current major,"Tl;Dr reread the title.

I am currently doing ok grades-wise in a class I am taking for my major that is a prerequisite for a series that I should take next year. However, I am only doing ok because I'm getting hard carried by the friends I've made in this class. There's only homework, an oral presentation, and a final that is graded in this class and I know for a fact that without the help of my friends who actually know what they're doing, I am not passing the final (professor already explained that there will be no curve so I don't have that to fall back on). Anyway, I do plan on switching majors regardless of how I do in this class. I don't know how this is going to affect my career going forward, however. If anyone has had a similar experience, please share below if you're comfortable!!

Verano Place $10 million for WiFi in units without AC but already wired for 1 gbps internet.,"We live in graduate housing and my fiancé got an email saying they are spending $10 million for wireless internet in Verano Place. This would be great except the internet in these units is already super fast and what we really need is air conditioning. 

Last year it was 97 degrees in October while Silverado burned. Couldn’t open the windows because the air was poison and couldn’t go anywhere on campus because coronavirus (or anywhere else really for that matter). In September before that it was over 100 -110degrees for a weekend. 

You cannot install window air conditioning units here per the lease. You can try the almost useless portable ac units but they don’t do much. The money should be spent to retrofit the Verano Place and any other campus housing units that don’t have ac with ac.

But this is my first time not being able to get ANY of my top priority classes or my backups. I don’t have anything in my study list at the moment because every other class I try to look up is also full (spent my 16 unit cap on waitlisted classes).

I've noticed every single lounge/study area (even the ones where without quiet rules) are absolutely silent and nobody really talks. 

I've tried the non-quiet floors at Langson, Science Library, Gateway, Courtyard Study Lounge, and even the food court, but nowhere is loud enough for me.",1637706574,1,0

waitlisting a discussion when i’m already registered to another one.,"i had my course registration today and i signed up for a class which had a required discussion. when i saw my possible options for the discussion slot, i had one that ended an hour before the lecture and one that ended right before, but this one was waitlisted. i don’t really want to have to wait an hour in between, so i registered for the one i could so that i could be registered for the lecture and i placed myself on the waitlist for the preferred one. i’m just wondering if this would actually work. i’m first on the waitlist but it says temporarily waitlisted and i don’t want to accidentally mess up the lecture.",1637684137,1,0
