Dreading Orientation,"I made a throw-away account for this because I'm probably going to get flamed. Regardless. Confession: I am dreading orientation with every fiber of my being. I haven't had any real social contact for over a year due to quarantine (and it was absolutely wonderful).  Obviously I understand the importance of making connections and networking yada yada yada. I fully intend to forge meaningful connections with my peers ... but at my pace.

However. The thought of being thrown into the deep end, surrounded by people, overloaded with activities from 8 am to 9 pm makes me want to die. I feel terrible for complaining and I feel like a spoiled brat, but I honestly don't know how I will manage. I have a terrible social battery. I am on the spectrum as some of you might have guessed, but I don't intend to disclose and no one can tell just by looking at me because I am an \*excellent\* yet exhausted actress.

Election Week Info for Yolo County (ELECTION DAY: TUESDAY SEPT 14),"**TL;DR if you haven't registered yet you still can conditionally register and vote in Yolo County at a few locations in Davis including the MU. If you haven't turned in a ballot yet, you would need to mail it or drop it off at a vote center or ballot box, including at the MU, by or on Tuesday.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Voting in the Gubernatorial recall election will culminate this Tuesday, the 14th! I've compiled some information on Yolo County-specific voting; much of this info concerning mailing ballots especially will hold true for other counties, but you will need to verify with your own local elections office.

&amp;#x200B;

**Per the CA Secretary of State Website, here is what is on the ballot:**

&gt; The recall ballot will ask two questions: 1) do you want to recall Governor Newsom? and 2) If the governor is recalled, who do you want to  replace him? 	   
&gt;  
&gt;If 50% or more vote NO, the governor would remain in office.  
&gt;  
&gt;If more than 50% vote YES, the governor would be removed from office and the person with the most votes would replace him.

&amp;#x200B;

**If you have not registered yet, you can still vote** through the conditional voter registration process up through Election Day. The Yolo Elections Office has prepared this website to explain the process. (You must go to their office or a Voter Assistance Center to fill out the form):

[https://www.yoloelections.org/voter-registration/conditional-voter-registration](https://www.yoloelections.org/voter-registration/conditional-voter-registration)

***Voter Assistance Centers in Davis (from Yolo website)***

*  **UC Davis Memorial Union- Garrison Room 212**   225 E. Quad, Davis 
*  **Veterans Memorial Center- Multipurpose Rm.**   203 E. 14th¬†Street, Davis 
*  **Montgomery Elementary School- Multipurpose Rm.**    1441 Danbury Street, Davis 
*  **Emerson Junior High School- Indoor Commons Rm. 1**    2121 Calaveras Avenue, Davis 

Early voting is happening at these centers from **10 AM - 6PM Sunday and Monday**, and they will be open **7 AM - 8 PM on Tuesday**. The county has a map with wait times: [https://www.livevoterturnout.com/YoloCA\_SEP2021/Vote%20Center%20Wait%20Times.html](https://www.livevoterturnout.com/YoloCA_SEP2021/Vote%20Center%20Wait%20Times.html)

&amp;#x200B;

**If you have already registered and filled out a ballot, it must be postmarked or returned on or before the 14th.** If mailed, the county office needs to receive it by the 21st, and if in-person it needs to be returned to the elections office, a voting location, or ballot drop box by 8 PM on election day.

***Ballot Drop Boxes in Davis (from Yolo website)***

* **City Hall (Exterior ‚Äì 24/7)**  23 Russell Boulevard, Davis

GAME THREAD: #127 UC Davis @ #232 University of San Dego (1:00PM; WCC Network),"The Aggies are coming off a stunning road win at higher-division Tulsa and are now looking to continue their unbeaten record at the University of San Diego (private school; not to be confused with UCSD or SDSU).

San Diego plays the Aggies a lot and we've generally had their number in recent years, but they did come within about a foot of beating Davis in 2019 when they mounted a comeback against a heavy-favorite Aggie squad. Look to see the team push to have four consistent quarters against San Diego so the Toreros can't get back in the game. San Diego probably can't muster the size and pressure on defense that Tulsa did, so expect a somewhat stronger ground game from the Ags without resorting to the air or settling for field goals as much as was required in Week 1.

When tf do classes start??,I looked at the ucd academic calendar and it states that September 20th fall quarter begins but instruction doesnt commence until the 22nd of September.

"New Provost Email: ""...if it at any time it becomes necessary for us to pivot to remote instruction to keep our community healthy, that is exactly what we will do.""","You should all be receiving the email, but here are key topics: 

* Vaccines are available and effective. 

* Predictive modeling regarding potential classroom transmission

* Still, if it at any time it becomes necessary for us to pivot to remote instruction to keep our community healthy, that is exactly what we will do. Should we need to make that decision, we will do so based on our case positivity rate, our number of students in isolation, and by working closely with Yolo County and Sacramento County public health officials in conjunction with the University of California Office of the President. For now, though, the data indicate that returning to in-person instruction and learning is appropriate and feasible.

* Working with our partners in the Academic Senate, instructors of record and TAs now have added flexibility in how they can deliver the curriculum

* If students do not comply with our vaccine mandate policy, they will first face a registration hold and then, prior to the beginning of undergraduate instruction, be disenrolled.

* The campus has evaluated HVAC systems serving all classrooms and is modifying these systems to supply 100% outside air and upgrade to MERV 13 filtration wherever possible.

* We are very happy to report that our campus community has crossed the 90% threshold for vaccination rates.",1631311857,1,0

Need help this weekend (or next week) to re-adjust my bike wheel because the bike pedals won't turn. I Will buy a coffee for whoever manages to fix this problem :),"Unfortunately, I had a flat bike tire recently. I remember biking back from my first lecture and I noticed that my wheel was flat to the bottom. I tried pumping it back up two times, then replaced the rubber tube for my back wheel. I took the wheel off, pumped it, and then put it back on. I don't have a flat tire now, but the problem is that my bike pedals could not be pressed down. Like I can not sit on the seat and pedal, the bike pedal will not go down. I checked it out after dinner and I noticed that the new wheel was very loose, and it seems to jam against the side when I pedal. I am no bike expert and I do not want to risk creating more problems by attempting to fix them myself. The bike barn isn't open until Monday, but I would like to have this problem fixed as soon as possible. So if there‚Äôs anyone here who can devote the time to helping me fix this problem, please let me know. All I need is someone to take the tire off and readjust it so that the bike pedals can go forward. The person who manages to fix it will have my thanks and a cup of coffee:)",1632553992,1,0

Thought it was weird at the time but it kinda just hit me that he probably just stole it, right in front of me and like 10 other bystanders, in broad daylight. Dude just hopped on and rode it away.

I Feel Like the Densest Person Today because I Forgot How to Socialize.,"Today I was waiting in the line for the Mongolian wok with my AirPods in listening to some music. Most of the time I can't help but vibe to the music but it usually consists of tapping my feet and moving my shoulders. Today in line I was full-on grooving, eyes closed, noise-cancelling on, etc. When I opened my eyes the girl next to me was jiving also and said something. I took out an airpod and she said with a smile something along the lines of ""Am I invited to the party?"" Me, being the stupid person that I am, said ""Yeah, it's a one-man party."" She said something else I didn't hear and looked somewhat disappointed. It only hit me that she was trying to make small talk immediately after the conversation ended.  I feel terrible because she was being pretty kind and I just shut her down unintentionally. Writing this so that hopefully you don't forget to socialize properly.

Is sex worth having?,"I just made a tinder account. I uploaded a few old photos because I haven't taken any recent ones. Within 10 minutes, I ended up with 9 likes. I waited for an additional hour and I had 6 likes. Three of the accounts that liked me must have gotten deleted. 

Personally, I never had a lot of success with tinder. I went on a date here and there. The furthest experience I got was consensually feeling a woman's unclothed breasts during a ""netflix and chill"" session. 

Using tinder always made me feel like I was inadequate of something. It made me feel like I was a child living amongst adults, that there was something there that I did not ""get."" Whenever I told someone that I was using tinder, I felt guilt. I felt lesser. I felt like other people were able to enter relationships seamlessly, that I was an anomaly because I had to use tinder.

Tinder makes me feel desperate. It makes me feel like a starving child in a third world country that would do anything for a parcel of food. It crushes my self esteem to know that I am going on a date with a woman because no other women would date me. I feel like, when you are desperate to achieve a goal, you lower the standards needed to meet the goal and crush your own self-esteem in the process. Was it really worth achieving the goal?

One could go to the bar and get drunk and then let nature take its course, but, we still face the same problem. We are getting drunk in order to have sex with women because we know that, otherwise, no women would have sex with us.

This is the catch-22 that we run into. You can avoid desperate attempts to have sex and thus avoid crushing your self-esteem. But, if you were to use this method, you would still not have sex. You would still crush your self-esteem.",1632521427,1,0

Welcome Back Parking Info - Day 3,"Good morning all. We're going to be giving parking capacity updates in this thread. Here's what we learned from the last two days of *Carmageddon* @ UC Davis:

* Quad Structure: Full by 9:00am
* Lot 1: Full by 9:45am
* Lot 5: Full by 8:50am
* Lot 22: Full by 9:00am
* Lot 25: Full by 9:00am
* Lot 47: Full by 10:00am
* Lot 48: Full by 8:30am

Pavilion Parking Structure never filled up. The top floor was empty both days.  

The Gateway Parking Structure did not fill either/

**Pro-Tip**: If you want to ""Just park and get on with your day"", park in Lot 2 or the Gateway Parking Structure. Those, by far, are the easiest to reach non-filling areas. 

* Parking Lot 2: https://goo.gl/maps/LEysnWvJsSicqLVY8
* Gateway Parking Structure: https://goo.gl/maps/KJeeN7abkeLjhCzN6

Lot 30 is also good, but you'll want to approach it from La Rue, *not Hutchison*, or else you'll need to do a U-turn to get in there. (https://goo.gl/maps/D3BcqgGNktSHLXJW9)

**Traffic Congestion**: Due to the construction on the Hutchison/113 interchange, it's slower than ever getting from 113 to Pavilion Structure. The quickest parking from the freeways is to take I-80 to Old Davis Road (NB) and then park at Gateway Structure, Lot 1, Lot 2, or (if you get here early enough) Lot 5/5A.

Linear Algebra Exam Preparation Lecture Notes and Playlist,"Dear Friends,

I would like to share with you those lecture notes on Linear Algebra that meet the high standard of rigor and difficulty that is demanded from UC Davis students, that are available to download for free here:

It is a summary of only the difficult parts of a standard undergraduate-level course, and it is absolutely the best way to prepare for an exam.

In it, you will also find a link to a YouTube lecture that follows those notes.

Chem undergrads looking for research?,"Hi everyone!
I'm a student researcher graduating next quarter, and I currently work as a chemist in a mechanical and Aerospace Engineering lab in Bainer hall. We're looking to hire one or two more undergrad chemistry students that we can start training to help take over my duties as I start training for the position I'll have after graduation. 
I personally am an environmental chemist, and I found this job incredibly enjoyable, though it can be a lot to take on during an academic year or with summer classes. However, to help compensate for that, the position is paid ($14.75/hour)!
You likely won't see much engineering work in this position, but if you're an applied chemist and enjoy working in the lab, or want to experience a lab environment while an undergrad, this may be a great opportunity for you!
To apply, you have to do it through Handshake, so if you don't have an account set up already you will have to make one. Laboratory experience is not required, though basic lab skills and safety are preferred. Unfortunately, we are not looking to hire seniors, but 1st, 2nd, and 3rd years are encouraged to apply (including 3rd year transfers!).
If you have any questions or problems accessing the application on handshake, feel free to reach out to me!  The application is due by November 5th at 5 PM.
And please feel free to share this link or post in discords or to other students who may be interested! 
Best of luck on your midterms :)

Should I drop my Math 21A class?,"I posted once before on here that Calculus 21A has been terrible for me. It's easily the most difficult course I've taken in college thus far. I leave class not understanding how to do the assignments at all which has led me to perform very poorly, especially on one of the more important ones. I've calculated my grade on canvas and it's a 48% due to me being so confused that I could hardly do any of the problems at all. The last day to drop is today. It's definitely possible I could turn it around but would it be worth the risk of tanking my gpa? The class isn't even for my major, it's for a minor. Dropping the class would mean I'd be part-time but that's something I'd be willing to deal with at this point.

Pop Quizzes,"Are obscenely stupid. Let's think critically for like 2 seconds. What possible real world scenario could they be preparing me for? What job will I ever have where I'm not expressly given deadlines, not explicitly told what the expectations for my performance are? 

College is a lot of work. I personally stay up until at least 1am most nights doing homework. And I have the privilege of not needing to work during the school year, a privilege many students don't have. Knowing when you're going to be tested increases the efficiency with which you can study.

Thinking of changing majors,"So, I am majoring in Animal Biology but for several reasons I am thinking of going a different path‚Ä¶ but I am unsure of what I want to do. I was thinking something more towards either/ or a mix of philosophy and psychology but first, I wanted to try a course or two relating to those, this next quarter. Should I talk to my major advisor about changing to undeclared or something? 

I am so lost and overwhelmed, feels I have too much on my plate I can‚Äôt even focus on one task at a time haha. Making me wonder why we put ourselves through this x.x 

You can stop reading here if you‚Äôd like; as I am only going on about why I‚Äôd like to change my major to something like this. 

I‚Äôve struggled with mental health and understanding it, for myself and others for a while. My family has a history of different mental battles including extreme depression and schizophrenia. Another personal thing I struggle with is communicating my thoughts. It frustrates me to no end. I‚Äôve spent a good amount of time learning on my own with YouTube videos and readings and I have improved, sure‚Ä¶ but YouTube videos can only do so much right? I‚Äôd love to use this opportunity to learn about something that motivates me more than it could stress me out. 

I won‚Äôt drag this on anymore now, but thank you for reading. I apologize if some of what I‚Äôve said does not make sense, I will blame it on me being stressed to make me feel better (: not that it isn‚Äôt true haha",1634602267,1,0

ESA Cat - Advice,"So I have several documented conditions that are exacerbated with time alone, so my doctors were happy to sign the forms endorsing ESAs as potentially helpful to me. I've filled out the form and sent it out. (Applied on October 11th). 

It's complicated, but basically my previous doctor was crappy and didn't really put stuff in my charts and did some other...... lovely........ things that were really unprofessional, so I wasn't really sure whether or not I could qualify for an ESA. I had two cats at home that had been encouraged by my therapist, and they were wonderful to have and a huge help and literal life-savers at times. I didn't want to split them up since they're a bonded pair, and Davis only allows one per apartment, which is reasonable for student housing. I wasn't ready to formally consider adoption of another animal until I was settled and had started with the new doctors.

Long story short, here we are now.

I found a cat I want to adopt. They met with me and are fully aware of the ESA needing approval and kind of being in limbo/waiting. They still pulled him off all the websites he was listed on because they're happy with my application and experience with cats.

The SPCA and I are waiting on the student disability center, which has to get back to me by the 6th at most I believe? (20 business days). I also sent them my dr's letter on the same day. 

Is there anything I can do to expedite the process? Someone in my apartment said to contact someone named Samira, but I'm not sure who they are or how to go about that. 

Any advice is appreciated (Picture if of the cat at his foster mom's house)",1634601270,1,0

[mild rant] welp in love with my best (only??) friend oops hehe,"before I came to college I met this dude online forgot how but we became pretty good friends. we talked quite often and then I met him for the first time during orientation week. he wasn‚Äôt my type as in he wasn‚Äôt like guys I had liked previously but he was cute and nice and we started vibing. we‚Äôre both huge introverts who have no friends and so we started hanging out like a lot and became super close overnight. wed text several times a day and always eat together. We do have other friends haha but we never see them much. Our roommates are also all extroverts and it‚Äôs very draining sometimes and they also have other friend groups. He and I always end up finishing each other‚Äôs sentences and having basically the same thought processes. We‚Äôve also told each other some very personal things. Unfortunately I also realized I caught feelings the first or second week of school but I didn‚Äôt want to rush anything and ruin our friendship. A week or so ago he told me he likes some girl and yeah that kinda stung especially since I know I‚Äôm not his type (he likes soft girls and I‚Äôm definitely not one). He barely knows her but it bugs me how jealous I can get üíÄ. Hes the type who would definitely notice small details or changes in my behavior so I‚Äôm really trying to hide my crush and play it off. We do talk abt relationships sometimes but we agreed we‚Äôre not ready for one anytime soon. I‚Äôm pretty certain he‚Äôs oblivious bc he thinks of me as only a friend and my type doesn‚Äôt  really include him. He hasn‚Äôt even considered the possibility of dating me. I‚Äôd like to tell him at some point, maybe in a year from now. I just don‚Äôt want anything to change. I am trying to make an effort to meet more people rn but I just keep getting disappointed with guys haha.

Students here seem to go beyond what is necessary or reasonable with masking. Why is this the case?,"One thing I have noticed here is that most students here go well above the basic requirements of wearing masks indoors and in crowded outdoor spaces such as stadiums. Most students here wear their masks outdoors, and many even wear them while riding their bikes. It isn‚Äôt just students from East Asian cultural backgrounds: rather, it‚Äôs the student body as a whole. I don‚Äôt understand why they do that. I don‚Äôt know of any science to support that level of caution, and honestly this all seems a little ridiculous. I feel like I‚Äôm one of the few students who takes their mask off when I go outside, so I wonder why more people don‚Äôt do the same thing. I even get the feeling that students are more religious about masking than professors. Does anyone know why all of this is the case?

(vent) Senior year scheduling is totally fucked,"Idk about y'all, but I have NOT been able to find any classes that work together for the winter. I have two required lab classes and some restricted electives to take, but all my fucking classes overlap and I won't be able to register for jack shit. That, or the classes I was planning on taking (so I took pre-reqs) aren't being offered in their traditional quarters or at all. I waited four years to take a class, but it switched quarters that it is usually taught and I can no longer take it. Waited for another class, and then it was completely removed from the entire year. Signed up for a class in junior year, was asked to drop to make room for seniors, found out that other juniors didn't drop, and the lab hasn't fit in my schedule since then.

The only classes offered as RE's are things that I didn't fill pre-reqs for, or their Pass 1 is restricted to a major. Like, holy shit? I can only register for 6 units in pass 1, because all the restricted electives left are /restricted/ to other majors, need pre-reqs, or overlap with this 6-unit lab. My major advisor hasn't gotten back to me, winter professors haven't gotten back to me, and it totally fucking sucks. I'm trying to be understanding and patient with their situations (teaching/advising/can't reply quickly) but holy shit, CalGrant runs out after four years and I just wish I could register for ANYTHING that will get me to graduate on-time.

The target sample is undergraduate students in the US over the age of 18. Those who complete the survey will have the chance to enter a raffle for 1 of 2 $25 online Amazon gift cards.

Getting started running,"I've been meaning to start running because my mental health is poor but I have difficulty forcing myself to run. I do see here and there people running, usually middle-aged males. I see them running alongside bikes (even when there is a lot of bike traffic). I have admiration for these people because doing this must take a lot of bravery. You have to have a lot of confidence to do this.

In my case, I have been seeking to increase my confidence and to get outside my comfort zone gradually. These have been my long-term goals (which get harder as you go along):

* Go for a run.
* Go for a run when there is heavy bike/pedestrian traffic.
* Go for a run at midnight.
* Go for a run while listening to music out loud.
* Go for a run while listening to embarrassing music out loud (think ""High High Hopes for a living"").
* Go for a run while shirtless (I'm not good looking).
* Go for a run while chanting Christian music.
* Combination of the above at once, especially when it's raining

I have been thinking of easing myself into it slowly, but, not too slowly. Remember, they say, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I want to become stronger. I want stand right next to adversity, staring into its eyes. I want to face my greatest fears. I want to fail and to resurge.

I don't think that it will be easy. I get anxiety when people make eye contact with me. I am deathly anxious, but, I want to get over my fear of other people (social anxiety) and I want to do it like a baller.

Anyways, what times is it socially acceptable (or common) for an individual to go running? Where do people usually run? I'm gonna start the socially conventional method and then go more and more courage-building mode.",1635500805,1,0

Confession: I overhead some students being racist on campus today‚Ä¶,"Just as the title implies, I overhead some students saying some racist stuff. It wasn‚Äôt in some corner of the room either, but in broad daylight around a lot of people.
It happened in the Quad where all of the clubs were set up. I was near a table set up for the Chicanx and Latinx club. The table had a few people asking questions. A few feet from the table were three male students. I heard their conversation go something like this;
‚ÄúWhat kinda table is this for?‚Äù
‚ÄúBeaners.‚Äù
‚ÄúBeaners?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, for the beaners.‚Äù
The three students laughed amongst themselves. I don‚Äôt think anyone else heard them since there were hundreds of people talking on the Quad.
It was pretty shocking considering; 1. UCD is a pretty diverse and liberal campus 2. The three males were Asian, a demographic that have unfortunately been increasingly the targets of racial discrimination since this past year. 
It‚Äôs pretty disheartening to hear that kind of talk coming from fellow students. I don‚Äôt know what might have happened to prompt such a response from these individuals, but being divided by race is something that helps no one and fuels very hurtful emotions.
Please don‚Äôt say these types of things, even if its to be ‚Äòedgy‚Äô and make your friends laugh.",1633559899,9,0

"This may sound random, but please avoid taking love advice from the movies...","You know how in the movies there is a good guy but the girl he likes either doesn‚Äôt see him or is with someone else? But he still pursues her and some magical bullshit later and he ends up with her? It never works like that in real life. 

There was this girl I liked and for 2 months I kept thinking I‚Äôm going to one day win her over. I always said hi and tried to start a conversation. But the truth is she doesn‚Äôt want me. She most likely got over me a month ago and I‚Äôm still here trying to ‚Äòsalvage‚Äô things. She moved on...

Rom Com movies led me to believe that I can win her over but the truth is she‚Äôd be with me if she wanted me. The sad part is that I had 2 girls who were interested in me and I avoided them because I wanted my ‚Äúdream girl.‚Äù I avoided talking to a lot of women that I met at parties and such because I had her on a pedestal in my mind. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still think this woman is amazing... but she‚Äôs probably with someone else. She isn‚Äôt as invested in me as I was in her. Or I‚Äôm not her type... regardless, she got over me. 

Last thing:

- If you pursue someone and they reject you, avoid being bitter. Some people I talk to about this call her derogatory names but the truth is we never officially dated. Just wish them good wishes and move on and actually mean it. No point in being sour...

- If you know someone likes you and you like someone else, please avoid being friendly with them. I wish this girl wasn‚Äôt so nice to me... she thought that she was just being friendly, but when you have a crush on someone, especially a big one, friendliness seems like signs of interest. It‚Äôs honestly best to just be a mean girl... 

Tldr; I wish I had this moment of clarity earlier. There are so many women here and I‚Äôm sure one of them would love me and they are probably all great in their own way. She‚Äôs most likely already moved on... 

The funny thing is my freshman year there was a girl who pursued me relentlessly for like a year and I recall it being a bad experience. I‚Äôm just happy I had this realization after 1 month because I‚Äôd hate for her to go through what I went through for a year...",1633558628,0,0

Taking next quarter off,"Hey. I‚Äôm a first year and I‚Äôve personally been struggling to adjust completely here. I‚Äôve joined clubs and attempted to make friends. My only problem here is the schoolwork. I have Depression and it makes it really hard for me to do assignments. I went through some pretty traumatic stuff earlier this year that I don‚Äôt often think about, but I still feel like I haven‚Äôt completely healed or gotten over it mentally. Its one of the things that triggered my Depression. Anyways, I knew going into college that I would have to pick my work ethic, hygiene, etc. But it‚Äôs still really damn hard. 

I‚Äôm thinking of using PELP and taking the next quarter off so I can come back in with a better mindset. My only problem with that is that I don‚Äôt want leave. With the friends I‚Äôve made from clubs and orientation along with the activities that come with, I‚Äôve become attached. I realized recently I am really happy when I‚Äôm at club meeting with friends or just hanging out with people sometimes. I‚Äôm afraid of missing out on opportunities when I‚Äôm gone. It‚Äôs a true escape. I don‚Äôt want to let that go because I‚Äôll feel a sense of loss and hurt. It sounds crazy but atp, I‚Äôm only here for the community. 

I‚Äôm trying to give myself grace before shitting on my mindset right now but it‚Äôs really hard. My parents are paying for me to be here. I got in because of my essays and my desire to pursue my current major. But for the nearly two months of being here, I‚Äôve done little to no assignments. I haven‚Äôt even attended many lectures. So that‚Äôs why I feel I need a quarter off to go back with the mindset that I‚Äôm here for school and to get a degree. 

And I‚Äôve tried to get in contact with the SDC but there accommodations aint shit to be honest. At least compared to the ones in high school. Idk, with my priorities not being straight to pretty much having zeros in all my classes, just leaving seems like the most appropriate choice. 

I want to stay and SOMEHOW get my grades up but believe me when I say I‚Äôve tried to do assignments. I always end up on my phone or asleep. 

There‚Äôs also a possibility of if I do take a break and come back that I‚Äôll be the exact same.

I asked about the tallest building a few days ago.,"I posted on this sub a few days ago asking about the tallest building on campus.

I was not trying to stargaze, throw parties, nor anything fun.

Yes, I tried to jump off a building and end my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of you might have seen my personal story from my previous post (it has been deleted so I would appreciate if you do not share any personal details about me). I have been extremely struggling from academic, personal, family, financial struggles and may more without any access to a proper care. Out of years of depression, multiple suicide attempts, and desperation, I had no other choice as my life has been stuck on the very bottom of the ferris wheel ever since I was born or I can remember. It seemed like the world has turned their back on me.

I packed all my belongings so it would be easier for others to clean up my room once I'm gone. I wanted to write letters before the end, but I did not have anyone to write to nor anyone who could write one for me. So that's when I wanted to share my story as a stranger to other strangers, hoping one of them might recognize my presence and the struggles that I had to endure. I just wanted something of mine to be left when I am gone. And I was ready finally. When I posted a question, I was not trying to gather attention. All I planned out was once I see the very first comment with the building name, I was planning on heading there, and the rest was very clear.

But people reached out to me. Some people who identified themselves as a fellow student, faculty, staff, and even a complete non-UCD affiliated stranger reached out to me. They offered me resources and heartwarming words. I was hesitant. But after reading all those messages and comments, I gave myself another chance that one day, my life will be better, and some day, I might reach the top of the ferris wheel looking down all my accomplishments after years of struggles.

Although I am not fully recovered yet, I feel better for now. As the crisis counselor I met said, it is going to be a long journey, but what really matters is taking one step at a time: Give yourself a chance one day at a time and give others‚Äîcounselors, classmates, other people who are here to help‚Äîa chance. So I did, and hopefully I will keep doing so.

I just wanted to share this for those who were concerned or curious about my whereabouts, and I wanted to thank every one of you who reached out to me. Even though it is going to be a difficult and long journey, I will give myself a try.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart everyone for saving someone's life. Thank you.",1636674347,1,0

ASUCD Campaign," Hey everyone. I know this is kind of strange, but I also think it's kind  of very fitting for me to reach out to you all here on reddit. My name is Adrian, and I'm a first year student here at Davis. Coming to Davis, I  was stoked to be by the capital and a part of a massive student body.  When I think of a lot of people, I think of a lot of possibilities for  activism, organization, and positive change. Especially being in a  community of young people. That's definitely what I expected to see coming to Davis, but that's not what I found here. Davis has shown to be a school with so many resources and so many great people, but the student body here is divided and unempowered in their voices, in their power as individuals, and in their power as a community at large. I'm running for ASUCD because I really see so much potential for this university community. And, at the end of the day, I want students to feel safe, valid, and empowered in their voices and in their ability to determine what  their experience can be like here at Davis. This really is the reason I'm running for ASUCD. I'm trying to make UC Davis a more democratic, empowered community through systematic and cultural change. And then, hopefully, we can get to making UC Davis a more just, progressive, and representative community for all of us. If you're interested in  supporting me, ASUCD voting ends tomorrow, 11/11, at midnight. I'd really appreciate your vote. I'm committed to listening to you and representing your voice to the best of my ability. [This is my instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/rozoucd/) If I'm elected, please reach out to me there with any concerns, criticism, or ideas; anytime. 

My name is Adrian Rozo.

The website for voting is [elections.ucdavis.edu](http://elections.ucdavis.edu/).  

There are some questions about amendments before the Senate vote, and I encourage you to just abstain from these if you feel they're a barrier for you to participate in the election. Thanks much.",1636609912,1,0

Warning to Those Seeking Therapy Through LiveHealth Online,"Two days ago I scheduled an appointment through the school‚Äôs online appointment system to see a male therapist. Immediately after the appointment started, this therapist let me know that he was not interested in validating my emotions because ‚Äúwomen tend to be too emotional rather than focusing on the facts.‚Äù Then he proceeded to ask me if I am learning about white privilege in college which turned into an entire rant about how he hates the idea of white privilege and how successful people don‚Äôt believe in that kind of stuff. Then he gave me examples about how hard his life is and began discussing his experiences with other clients while barely listening to anything I had to say. When I tried to redirect the appointment, he continued ranting without listening. 

Please be careful when speaking to anyone through this system and be aware of red flags in a therapist. Someone who claims to want to help you should be able to listen without ranting about their personal beliefs. For victims of racial trauma, please be aware that some therapists, like the one I spoke to, do not consider this experience to be a serious issue. When seeking help, do not be afraid to immediately end an uncomfortable encounter like I was.",1636592753,1,0

No curves until the end of the year and I've been getting about 50% on the midterms. Every other assignment I've done is 100% though, which doesn't make a difference since the midterms and final make up the grade. Chances of me getting a B or even a C is slim to none. I spoke with my professor and he told me my best option was to just give up in the nicest way possible. He told me my best option was to get a D, and retake the course to replace the grade another quarter with an A. This is to make sure I don't drag down my other classes by focusing on a final that might not even let me pass the class. I'm thinking he's right. I can make up for financial aid by taking other units while I retake it. I just suck at math. Every other class I'm taking is fine.

Also, I want to go to grad school for some form of health profession. It feels like an unobtainable dream however if I'm failing my first entry level math course. I don't know what to do and my advisor can only meet me after the final. Should I just sign up for MAT17A again for Winter Quarter to prepare for a likely failure? Should I do a last ditch effort and pour every hour of my next two weeks and try to get the highest score possible, or is that detrimental for my other finals, which I really want to get an A in?

He's a nice guy; his teaching style isn't my favorite but it's not like I had a choice in which professors were available. His tests were mostly fair, just difficult and expected a lot of practice and quick thinking. It's my fault. I wasn't accustomed to the pace and my high school never really went over the concepts very well, and I should've done more practice exams/questions. Won't make the same mistake if I have to retake it.",1637641610,1,0

What are my chances of transfer admission for Computer Science and Engineering from a CCC if I'm missing Differential Equations (MATH-022B)?,"CCC student hoping to transfer into CS&amp;E this fall. I have Modern Physics (PHYSICS-009D) planned for this summer because my community college only offers it in summer. My TAG got rejected because my major-relevant GPA was too low (a B in intro physics, a C in MATH-021C, and As in every other STEM course) and I was missing Modern Physics and Differential Equations.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm doing well in my current courses (five, all STEM). I'm already taking two physics courses to complete the basic physics series, Linear Algebra (MATH-067), and Data Structures (ENG CS-036C) next semester.

Winter break bike theft is a thing. See our Dos/Don‚Äôts before you split.,"**If you have a bike,** **we urge you to do what you can to ensure it‚Äôs not stolen while you‚Äôre away.** Peak at our *dos* and *don‚Äôts* for bike storage tips, so you can help make sure your bike sees you on the other side of the holiday break.  

**DO:** 

* **Do take your bike inside (into your home, residence, or garage).** Park it in the hall, in your room, or in your kitchen. Got roommates? Tight on space? Store your bike on top of your bed. (Heck, tuck it in if you like.) Keeping your bike inside and out of public parking areas for extended periods of time, dramatically reduces (if not eliminates) the possibility of it being stolen. 
* **Do keep your bike clean.** If you have taken and used your bike outside, chances are it's got some dirt on it. When bringing your bike inside, be sure to wipe the tires off or carry the bike and avoid getting dirt/grease on your walls and floor. 

**DON‚ÄôT:** 

* **Don't leave your bicycle locked up outside (for the extended break).** You may think it's okay, business-as-usual, to just lock your bike up outside while you travel. Nah. It‚Äôs prime season for thieves to target campus and quiet bike racks--especially where there's a high density of student residents. Most everywhere our guard is down and anyone looking to snatch a bike (or wheels, etc.) knows their chances of getting away with a crime are much higher during the holiday break. Also, your bike is only going to wear in the winter elements. 
* **Don't block walkways, stairwells, or any passages.** This tip is mostly for those living with roommates or in multi-unit family dwellings. If bringing inside, don't let your bike be in the way of others. 
* **Don't lay your bike down on its driveside.** If you lay the bike down on its side, make certain the chain and gears are up so as to not get damaged by the bike‚Äôs own weight. This also keeps the chain from staining your rug or bedspread (anything under the bike).",1638833698,1,0

On the Subject of Friends,"Before someone goes out to complain; this isn't really a ""looking for friends"" type post. More on the contrary, I've noticed that I have become strangely accustomed to not having any friends. I drifted apart from my last friends about 4 years ago in high-school, and in hindsight I realized I never really learned (or retained knowledge of) how to format friendships. The initial friends I did use to have came to me from a set of circumstances of which I have a very faint recollection and little control over. As such I never came to make any new friends. The first couple years put me in something of a depressive mood, but I've noticed I just seemed to stabilize over the years. I have something of a theoretical interest in friendships but it isn't much distinct from a yearning one might have in riding a Rollercoaster (maybe not directly comparable in magnitude but you get the point). Additionally, I've noticed my depressive symptoms changed such that they don't seem to pose any immediate obvious threat. I no longer have much stress about academics ( I can intellectually acknowledge how a lower grade may impact grad school or employment, but I have very little emotional reaction). Similar self-worth issues just don't quite seem to compute anymore as in I have no tangible notion of my personal value as I might once have had. I just move through the motions of life, pursuing what seems most interesting in the moment, and I feel very indifferent. I have a hard time pinpointing any objective issue as I don't have any particularly negative emotions. Conversely, I've also manifested a similar disposition towards life in general; while I'm not and have never been seriously suicidal, I can't say I continue to possess a strong affinity towards life. There are certainly things that interest me which lead me to get up everyday, but I can honestly say I wouldn't make much of an effort towards self-preservation. Realistically, this doesn't seem to be an issue that would manifest in any likely setting but I'm just wondering if this is a stable state to remain in.

For the People That Want to Make New Friends...I Understand the Struggle,"For those of you that are struggling to make new friends, trust me, I've been there. I know that for a lot of you, meeting many acquaintances hasn't been the most difficult part. The main issue is continually trying to make time for each other, losing contact after the rhythm of the conversation, or just not clicking...I admit that this is the part that has probably been difficult for most people. I met a lot of people this quarter, but the people that I'd actually call a true friend to me is definitely a fewer amount compared to that. Whether you have been ghosted by a person you thought was a friend, you're going through too many struggles that you don't know if you want to open up to them about, you feel like your friendship bond isn't that great anymore, or you don't feel like you match up to that person, I think that you shouldn't give up at all. There may be some negative people out there that make you feel discouraged, but think about the people in your lives that make you truly happy. Think about the people that want you to succeed. Think quality over quantity. For anyone that wants to reach out and be friends, feel free to message me. If you feel like you are also mentally struggling, talk to me. One of my possible goals out of getting my degree in college is to go into something like therapy or counseling. I've met some great people on this Reddit as well after reaching out, so I think you shouldn't give up. Don't think that you're not good enough because personally, I have both failed and succeeded during this quarter, depending on my condition. It's all about the willpower. Go Aggies!",1638583404,1,0

More info on the Schedule Builder update,"We are still seeing questions/ comments/ concerns regarding the update we made to Schedule Builder recently.  

Firstly, we have the following fixes that will be rolled out shortly:

* Searching for courses using subject code and course number (i.e. PSC1/PSC 1 instead of PSC 001)
* Courses displaying 0/0 for available seats and waitlisted, when they really shouldn't
* Mobile display wasn't as good as it could have been.  We made it a little cleaner.

Secondly, the inline search field now allows you to search using CRN, subject code, instructor last name, or keyword (i.e. course title, or part of a course title).  We also removed the limit of results that would show, which was a hard 999.  It will now show you everything that matches, the most we were able to show is around 1500 using ""logy"".  Let us know if you can make more show and what keyword you used. 

Finally, the biggest aggie in the room, the chrome add-on.  Unfortunately, it is broken due to the updates.  As of right now, it still works within the advance search section of Schedule Builder, but this will be updated in the future as well.

If you find any issues or bugs please direct them to  [Message Center](https://my.ucdavis.edu/ask_us/index.cfm) using the myucdavis Tech Support option.  This has more eyes on, and a bug posted using Message Center is more likely to be addressed than a bug posted here.

So what do you do if you get covid?,"I almost certainly have covid (I can't know for sure as I don't currently have access to a test, but someone in my household tested positive and I have had very mild symptoms since Sunday night). Fortunately, I can just remain off campus until I'm no longer infectious, but I'm totally clueless about the procedure, if any, that I have to do. Can I just go back after the necessary quarantine period + a negative test or is there anything else needed (like uploading a form/test result or contacting someone)?",1640773928,1,0

Is it too late to switch majors?,"I know I should talk to my advisor about this and will do as soon as I can schedule a meeting with them. But I would like to ask you guys first:

Some Background: I'm currently a third-year Mechanical Engineering major with 51 units left to take. I've also been taking CS classes as I planned to make it my minor.  If I decided to major in CS, I will need to do 66 units.

Reason: I've always wanted to do engineering since I was young. I built many mini-projects here and there. Messing around with toys and lego, building RC vehicles, and fixing up old tech ( always failed but it was fun). I took some CS classes in High School and didn't like it. It's not because I'm not interested but because the teachers are atrociously bad. That left a bad impression on me so I didn't factor it in when applying for college. 

I applied and got in as a Mechanical Engineering student and I liked it. I have always liked math so I breeze it through with ease. I've learned how to use interesting programs and grow to like them even more. However, that was short-lived as I began to do more researches during my second year. I've learned that the transition between ME student to ME employee isn't what I've expected. I went in thinking that I will design interesting parts and be a part of something bigger. I was wrong. If I graduate with an ME degree, I will not able to find a job in the area where I've lived (my hometown is in Silicon Valley where ME is not popular as a career, and I am not planning to move any time soon due to family reasons). Also, I will most likely work in front of the computer, designing parts that I am not interested in, and writing boring technical reports that I hate. I find all of that uninteresting and not what I imagined myself doing for the rest of my life. 

I looking for an alternative and decided to take CS classes to see if it fits me. I was amazed at what I can do. The possibility is endless. Since I have access to more resources and am more determined compared to my high school self, I find myself enjoying CS more than ME. Moreover, as I grow older, my goal shifted and I want to be independent in the future, which I can do if I have a CS degree. Living in Silicon Valley is also a plus because of the number of opportunities I'll have. Overall, CS is more in line with what I'm trying to do with my life. 

I have 3 choices and I am struggling to decide what to follow. 

1) I can continue with ME major + CS minor, but CS minor will be worthless in the future due to how unrelated these fields are. The plan is 4 stem classes every quarter until graduations (take roughly 5 ish year, so 2024). 

2) I can double major in ME + CS and decide what to do after. This choice will mentally break me as I've to do 7 years of school with 4 stem classes every quarter just to pick one as a career once graduating ( totally not worth it). 

3) Postpone ME for a while (2 quarters) and fully commit to CS. If everything occurs according to plan, I will graduate with a CS major within 5 years (2024) with 3 stem classes every quarter (the workload is much smaller which allows me to do other things). If after 2 quarters and I changed my mind, I still have ME as a backup. 

Regardless of the choices, my goal is to graduate within 5 years and move on with life. 

Sorry for such a long post. I am currently stressed out and don't know what to do. I hope some of you can help and give me some advice on what to do next. Thank you for your time.",1640766655,1,0
