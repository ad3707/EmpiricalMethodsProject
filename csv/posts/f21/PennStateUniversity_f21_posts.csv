Are you looking to try out tabletop roleplaying games? I'm looking for 2-3 players for a weekly in-person campaign of Monster of the Week - all skill levels welcome!,"I'm a seasoned TTRPG facilitator in State College looking for a few more players for an in-person Monster of the Week campaign.  
MOTW is a pen, paper, and dice system based on the serialized format of shows like the X-Files, Buffy, etc. where the players hunt monsters and investigate mysteries. It's a simple game compared to something like D&amp;D or Pathfinder - just a handful of stats and moves to remember - so it's great for beginners and people who want to do a lot of open-ended roleplaying.  
The campaign is set in Bemidji, MN, 1987, and has a tone comparable to the movie *Fargo*: creepy, absurd, and mysterious.  
If you're interested, vaccinated, and available for 3-5 hours on Wednesday or Saturday evenings, DM me or comment below 🎲",1634596822,1,0

Advice about living off campus next year,"I’m currently a freshman and I’d like to live off campus next year. I’m only really interested in living downtown or pretty close to it. I feel like if I live super far off campus, I’ll be much more disconnected from campus and clubs and such.

Everyone’s saying you pretty much need to start looking now to have a chance at getting an apartment downtown, which I would be fine with, but I don’t know who I want to room with yet. I have some friends here, but I’ve only really known them for 6 weeks and don’t want to really commit to rooming with them. I’d much rather have more time to make some closer friends and maybe room with them, but it doesn’t seem like I can do that and still get one of the apartments I like.

I’ve heard people talking about how you can basically get a random roommate, which is what I did for my dorm this year and everything is going fine, but I’d really love to room with a great friend or two.

Anyone have any advice for what I should do?",1634586957,1,0

Questions regarding creating an organization,"So I'm in the process of creating an organization for the Spring semester but I have a few questions that I'm having trouble finding answers for. I would appreciate if anyone with experience in creating a club / or just knows the answers chime in.  


1. Is there a procedure or special kind of process needed for a for-profit org? Is it even allowed / sanctioned? If its not could I still proceed just do it off the books?
2. What if the club has nothing to do with my major? I'm in stem and the club would be in finance / economy so in terms of getting an advisor approval can I just ask any business major and be okay? Or is there some more structured process? Could I just straight up email any given business professor and ask for their approval and sign off? Does it even need to be a business major or can it be anyone who is a staff at Penn State?
3. How can I advertise the club so I can reach enough people to fill all the director positions? Do I need to be registered first or not to do so? 
4. If I wanted to do an interview process is there something special I need to include within the constitution? Are there things I need to include / exclude? In general am I / the board allowed to dictate who gets approve and who doesn't, or do we need a legitimate reason(s) to deny someone?
5. Are there any suggestions or docs available to help me write the constitution? The vocabulary and diction many other orgs / clubs makes it very difficult to replicate into my own words / use. Basically are there any resources that help me write more fluently or just practice? 

Thanks to anyone who is able to provide their input as I really appreciate any and all help.

My question, or statement really, is that I am super overwhelmed/confused with my career (planning). In all honesty, I have no clue what to do.

Background: I am a sophomore with the intended major of Finance. I am in DUS since I transferred from Comp Sci and my GPA is currently a 3.7 (this excludes the FA2021 semester, which will go up as I've gotten back all my grades except 1). 

What I know so far: Career-wise this is what I know so far. I do not want to do IB because I value at least a little work/life balance. The career that I have been researching is Consulting. I know that Consulting work/life balance isn't that great, but from my understanding, it is better than IB.  While this is what I am interested in at the moment, I still want to learn about different career paths in Finance to see which suits me the best. I also know that it is tough to crack into. I know that Finance isn't really the ideal work/life balance career path, but I would like to know if there are some jobs/career paths that aren't as bad as IB and even Consulting.

What I would like to know: I understand that Penn State Career Services offers Career counseling. Does this help? I will be making an appointment with a rep. but I would like to know beforehand, if possible. I also do not have any internships and I feel like I am behind/not on track. What resources at Penn State, or in general, help with internships? I am not too sure where to look. I do look at Nittany Lion Careers. Basically, I am confused about which career path I want to take and the steps to take to increase my chances. I know the layout, grades/internships/networking/etc, but I don't know the how. Are there any Finance clubs you recommend joining? What does Penn State offer that can help me with my career planning, aside from what I mentioned before? I will be trying to get into the NLF next semester (SP22), but I don't really have my hopes up for that. What would give me a boost, specifically clubs or organizations?

It would be greatly appreciated if you could tell me:

What your career path is:

What steps you took:

Any advice you have:

Thank you in advance and Happy Holidays!

Do I switch my major?,"I’m currently a comsci major and I took the cmpsc 131 class this semester. Although I was doing okay in the beginning I was completely lost after the halfway point.

I’m taking 132 next semester to see if anything changes cause maybe it was the 131 professor that was just ass at teaching. But I’m also taking Accounting 211 so I can have a route into business if Computer Science isn’t the move.

University Park is overrated,"I personally believe people don't give the PSU commonwealth/branch campuses any attention and just look at university park. There are multiple reasons why I think the common wealth campuses are better. I'd say the only benefit of going to University Park is  it has more opportunities and if the degree you want is only offered there but I think that cant outweigh what the other commonwealth campuses offer.

1. They are Cheaper
2. Not a nightmare to find your classes
3. You can double major if the departments of that commonwealth campus will allow you to. I know this because I am double majoring in Business and Information Technology. Main campus doesn't allow you at all.
4. It's a whole lot easier and less stressful
5. You get a better interaction with your professors about  your classes.
6. They are less competitive 
7. Most degrees are offered at commonwealth campuses
8. Might be closer to where you live

How much damage do late drops do to your chances at employment/grad school?,"I'm a freshman under the College of IST, who initially planned on going for Cybersecurity.

Throughout this semester, I quickly realized that Cybersecurity just wasn't for me (through both the course and a Kali Linux book I checked out from the library), and I'm now thinking of switching over to either ETI or Data Science. I'm gonna do some exploring over break (should've done this with Cyber over summer of 2021) to see which one I like better.

I struggled a lot with Cyber 100S, and I ended up having to late drop the course in order to save my GPA. In addition, while struggling with Cyber, I fell behind on English 15 to the point of no return, so I ended up having to late drop that class too. I plan on taking English 15 next semester, but I'm not gonna take Cyber again.

In hindsight, I should've utilized the IST tutoring services earlier while there was still time to get up, but at least now I know.

I plan on taking two summer classes for summer of 2022 in order to make up for missed credits.

On my transcript, it is now going to show LD for both English 15 and Cyber.

Out of curiosity, how much damage is this going to do for my employment chances/chances of getting into grad school? 

I'm not sure whether I wanna go to grad school after college or go straight into getting a job. However, I heard that most jobs only care about your GPA, not your transcript. I'm assuming that grad schools would care about your transcript, since they are schools.

What happens if you drop below 12 credits?,"So, I graduated a few years ago as a psychology major and had great professors and an ok advisor.

(I would have gone to grad school, but with my resume and math skills, it's probably not gonna happen now anyway) 

Well now, I'm in the college of arts and architecture.  I see what all my friends were complaining about. My original advisor seemed to be unavailable,  and was changed without me being notified. Most of my professors are fine, but they aren't like the psychology professors.  I ended up in a web class where I actually kinda have to look up my own tutorials (as in she didn't link the tutorials, we have to copy and paste the lesson she wants us to learn, but the tutorials are outdated and don't match what's listed in canvas).  I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing, and things are due during the week, which is awful for me. I'm having a temporary mobility issue where I can only do maybe one activity a day. Plus the projects seem to involve lots of introspection,  which is a HORRIBLE idea for me. The last place I need to be is in my own head. Additionally,  my desktop cannot run the programs at the specs she wants without crashing.  

Tl;Dr
I have a web class that the professor doesn't seem to be teaching.  The content is bad for my mental health,  I can't find the time to do it. I physically can't do multiple projects in a day as I should. I've also not had a good time getting advice from my advisor.  Plus, my computer can't reliably run the program.  I already have a degree, so my goal is purely to make myself more marketable in a different field. I am willing to take the class again later, even if the only thing that changes is that I can physically put more time in it. There is no reason for me to be full time other than for financial aid.

How do I tell my roommate to politely STFU while he's playing League of Legends?,"Honestly, he's a very nice and super reserved dude. I try to adjust and be friendly with all my roommates. I never had a problem until now. I know what you might be thinking, why not just confront him, or why not just leave and go to the library/computer lab? I don't want any bad relations, considering I'm only a month in with him, and I don't want it be awkward for another couple months. I'm also forced to be in my room to finish work for my major, as some courses require my beefy setup and dual monitor. The computers in the labs just don't have enough memory to finish my dat sci projects quickly. Whenever he plays League, he does a 180 with his personality and turns from the quietest dude into the loudest, most expressive dude. It doesn't help that his constant clicking from The game is probably the loudest mouse ever made. I swear I feel like I'm gonna snap one day and yell at him.

Is anyone else struggling with in person school?,I’m a junior and only experienced my first semester freshman year in person. During that semester I didn’t do very well but attributed it to the transition to college. I forgot how much time in person school takes up little things like walking from class to class and waiting for food take up way more time. Online I could hop on a zoom call one minute before and be fine and I could other things in the background of meetings. Since everything was online I also feel I didn’t get a good grasp of certain subjects and having open note tests has wiped out all my study skills. I took the intro class for my major online and choose it thinking it would be a good choice but now that we are in person I’ve realized it’s entirely different in person and I hate it. My major Accounting has 7 Week semesters and class everyday and I am struggling so much with the workload. Our accounting professor expects 30 hours a week just on his class. I don’t enjoy a single class this semester and my favorite class is my gen Ed English class. My one professor is also just really mean to me. I’m so lost as to whether to switch majors to something I actually enjoy but as a junior switching seems harder than just toughing it out even though I hate my major and I’m struggling. I also have adhd and sometimes my brain doesn’t feel like it works well with such a detail oriented subject I have zero interest in. I’ve been involved in a lot of different clubs but had a though time making friends my freshman year and being online made it so difficult to make new friends. Staying here longer than I have to sounds like my worst nightmare. Everyone else seems so sure and I hate that as a junior I still don’t know what to do with my life.,1633564255,2,0

Engineering Second Year Advice,"I’m considering transferring out of the college of engineering. I haven’t talked to my advisor yet but maybe wanted advice from a students perspective.

I know engineering is an amazing major (not to mentions pays well) and it’s truly the one thing I have passion for but when it comes down between the course load and mental health I’m not sure if continuing is worth it. I didn’t do well last year with online learning and ended up having to retake Physics 211 and seek alternative grading for majority of my classes. This semester I had to drop EMCH 210 because of the course load and not wanting my GPA to drop even lower. I have the option to retake EMCH over the summer but I feel as if I’m now really behind because of these two courses. I’m biomedical engineering and considering changing to biotechnology because of its similarity but want I want to do is truly centered more around engineering. 

My biggest concern is that I’m not gonna meet the ETM requirement of a 3.0 by next fall and still won’t be able to declare. I’m in between a tough decision tbh",1633479491,9,0

I hate the apartment store.,"So I pay 1275 dollars a month. I just got a reminder to renew my lease, and they said If I renewed my lease anytime after 10/15, they'll raise my rent to 1360 dollars. And If I do renew before that, they'll still raise my rent to 1300. Keep in mind that heating and electricity is NOT included, which sometimes can go up to a 100$ a month during the harsh winter.

I know this isn't illegal, but it's so stupid considering that I don't even live right in downtown but a block or two from it, and there are apartments in downtown right in the center that rent for around the same price and include ALL utilities, plus actually have services in their buildings like parcel stations and fitness centers. 

The only thing that got me Into the apartment store was that one particular property (which is where I live as of right now) seemed to be in a quiet area and still a walking distance from campus (15-20 mins, mostly.) but looks like I'm gonna have to sacrifice peace and quiet for better deals.

This is not where my interests lie.My problem with the CS program is that it is too theoretical and too many people have a CS degree. Due to this I’m debating switching to Computational Data Science in the college of engineering. It’s a lot of the same classes as CS but they actually cover AI and ML which is what I’m interested in.

So based on job prospects, and considering I’m an INTERNATIONAL student, is this a good move? It’s a passion over practicality problem for me cause CS is hot and I LOVE coding but not the PSU curriculum.

Late switch to CS? Is it worth it/even possible?,"Let me preface this question with some context. I’m a junior who finally made it up to State College after a year at another university, and then another year after transferring into Penn State at Altoona. I have been a Biology major since the beginning of my freshman year, but now that I’m a month into my third year, I have come to the realization that this is not what I see myself doing for the rest of my life. What has pulled my interest is Computer Science. 

With all that being said, I have no idea what the program requirements mean in terms of my own situation. Is it even possible to change into that major as a junior? I don’t mind extending my college career by a year or even two if needed. Also, is CS here even worth that big of change?

Your grandfather, also standing in line, said, ""I'll pay (the $85 fee) for you on my card if you Zelle me"".

I'm not looking to participate in any super serious ensambles or anything, so most serious school or club groups are kinda out of the questions.

Is online still an option?,"To preface: I am an industrial engineering major &amp; an operations and supply chain minor going in to my 5th year. It’s been a rough year for me academically, largely due to the learning atmosphere during the pandemic. I was on track to graduate by spring 2021, but after going online spring 2020 it was downhill for me. In the fall 2020 I failed 90% of my classes and I took 1 class in the spring and had to withdraw. I decided it was best for me to take some indefinite time off to recover mentally from the frustrations failures of the past year. 

My question: I think I’ve decided to officially go back this spring 2022 just to take a few classes and ease back into the normal flow of school. I live about 2 hours from the campus I attended and would realllllly prefer to not have to find a place to live, pay rent, pay other expenses, ect. for just 2 classes. Would there be any chance I could take the classes through zoom still or be able to work something out with my professors so I don’t have to move back to campus ? I’m not sure if I should contact my advisor about this or just directly contact the professors to ask. I just don’t think I would mentally be ok if I had to live alone at school for a semester especially because all of my friends graduated so I would be alone and go crazy. I also have a job and want to still be able to work while taking classes but the job is not able to be done remotely so I would prefer to stay.",1636726667,1,0

Should I study at Penn State?,"Hey! I’m a prospective undergrad that’s  considering studying at Pennsylvania State University and I’m interested in 3 majors:
- Biomedical engineering
- Biochemistry 
- Biological sciences
I need your help to decide if I should choose this uni for my higher studies.
 
Now a little about me for context. I’m studying at an IB high school in Ecuador getting certificates in biology, global politics, English and CAS. I have a pretty good GPA at roughly 9.25/10, but I stand out for my ability to learn and actively engage with the knowledge I perceive, not just in academic contexts. I also think I have good extracurriculars; I was president of the student council, participated in UN models, was a scout for several years, and participated in a CISV international camp abroad. 

I’m very interested in topics like physiology, immunology, zoology, genetics, neurology and pharmacology. However, this is not really the case with engineering or chemistry but it seems like the best way to get into careers that focus con research science but can also get me an outstanding salary, plus I believe I can make it thought them. 

I’d like to perform jobs like developing new drugs and vaccines, curing genetic disorders, developing new therapies or studying and protecting animal life and biodiversity. I’m even considering going to med school.

Based on this, do you think the programs I listed are the right ones for me at this Uni? Does Penn State stand out in any of these programs? How’s the campus life?

Sorry if this is too much but I really want to be sure I make the right choice. I’m looking for any feedback I can get and I think hearing from the students themselves is the best source of information. Also if you know anything about scholarships I would be so grateful.

Thanks in advance Nittany Lions!!",1636609135,1,0

The other course, I would have to wait until a week before the next semester starts. I know I will most likely will not be able to enroll in those courses since these are small-size classes; resulting in me being a year behind.

 The reason I can't enroll right away is because I am not a part of the college. I know a DUS student who is currently taking a entrance course this semester. So this doesn't really make sense to me.

The university can't stop Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking. Here's what you CAN do if the whole situation makes you angry.,"Before I write this wall of text, a little background on me. I hate Milo Yiannopoulos and everything he stands for. He's a professional edgy kid- all of his income comes from making people upset and generating outrage. Imagine your entire livelihood being dedicated to making people angry, creating controversy, and spreading bigotry. It takes a serious sack of shit to be doing something like that every day. I don't personally attend Penn State myself, but I stand with the LGBTQ+ community at Penn State and I have quite a few friends who attend Penn State, so I wanted to give my opinions and background knowledge to share my thoughts on what you guys can do.  


First, I've seen a petition floating around for the university to prevent Milo from speaking. That's unfortunately not possible. For more background information, I would recommend that you read [the university's official statement](https://news.psu.edu/story/673978/2021/10/25/administration/university-leaders-denounce-yiannopoulos-comments-and-tour) on the situation and [the ACLU's page on free speech for public college campuses.](https://www.aclu.org/other/speech-campus) If you don't feel like reading, I'll give a TL;DR : An official student organization called Uncensored America invited Milo to speak. If the university didn't allow him to speak, they would get sued, lose a shit ton of money, and line the pockets of Milo Yiannopoulos and potentially the club's acting president. The definition of hate speech is incredibly strict. There are very few exceptions to the first amendment. You can actually say a TON of hateful and bigoted stuff while still being well within your first amendment rights to do so. Milo's speech will almost certainly break no laws, so the university's hands are tied.  


So, basically, Milo is coming to Penn State. No getting around it. Now, let me spit out some theories on how students at Penn State can stop Ann Coulter or the Kent State gun girl or some shit from coming in the future. They involve the club behind it all: Uncensored America.  


Because Uncensored America is an official Penn State club, it has to follow certain rules. These rules can be used in the favor of students that are against bigotry. According to [Penn State's student org hub](https://orgcentral.psu.edu/organization/uncensoredamerica), Lucas Miraldi is the primary contact of the club. Here's his [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-miraldi-675170221?trk=public_profile_browsemap). If you see him (or any other members of the club) on campus, make sure to exercise your first amendment right to tell him what an absolute wad he is. 

One way to prevent this from happening in the future is to organize a large group of tolerant students to join the club. The leaders of the club can’t bar anyone from becoming a member. I would highly recommend looking at the constitution and bylaws of the club [here]( https://orgcentral.psu.edu/organization/uncensoredamerica) to figure out a way to join the club and replace the current president with a new, gayer, more tolerant person. That would prevent this type of event in the future.


Additionally, it might be possible to get back at the organization another way. Here’s the purpose of Uncensored America as listed in their constitution:


&gt; Uncensored America is non-partisan organization dedicated to protecting, promoting, and educating college students on their First Amendment right to freedom of speech.  

That “non-partisan” is quite interesting. After all, [in his own article written for campus reform]( https://www.campusreform.org/article?id=17880), Lucas lists the organization as a conservative one. I know that ideology != party, so maybe I’m grasping at straws here, but I believe Lucas’ own admission means that the club may not be fulfilling its purpose as stated in its constitution. Either way, it’s worth checking out the [student affairs policies and rules]( https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/involvement-student-life/student-organizations/student-organization-policies-procedures/policies) to make sure that Uncensored America isn’t violating any rules. 

Anyways, those two suggestions are just that—suggestions. It’s possible that the group is completely legit rule-wise, and they will make it exceedingly difficult for a progressive group of students to change the leadership. If that’s the case, the best (and only) thing to do is to ignore their antics. The more attention these people get, the better. I know this post is antithetical to that goal, but I wanted to let you guys know that you do potentially have options to stop this in the future. Thanks!",1635294355,1,0

Schreyer Application,"Hi, so, I’m kind of confused about the honors college application. I can’t actually see the application until I apply to Penn State, so…what exactly will I be submitting? I have a lot of questions (sorry lol)

Is there a specific extracurriculars section, like on the common app? There’s a short answer question about significant ECs—do I need to include all my important ECs there for admissions to know they exist? 

Do Schreyer’s admissions also get my common app essay, or can I reuse it if it fits one of the prompts? 

There’s a short answer about college credits not on your high school record, so I just leave it blank if I don’t have any or say “I have no college credits?” 

The website doesn’t specify how many words the short answers are, but based on past years, I assume they’re 400?

Also, my awards are really bland. I don’t really know how to write the meaningful award essay.

And could any current scholars share how much they filled the word count? I’m at 500-600/800 and I’m happy with my essays. I don’t really have anything else to add, but I’m worried they’re too short.

I wasn't able to get tickets this year even though I got on around an hour earlier, cause I was like 2000 in the queue and they sold out. I want to ask this question before I forget so that I at least get them for my last year.

What determines your place in the queue?

Do you reload when your in the waiting room and the clock hits 7 AM to be put in queue faster? Or do you just stay in the waiting room and don't reload and wait to be put in the queue.

Does anyone have any tips to make sure that I get them for next year?",1631304729,1,0

Long story short, they never got back to me to confirm the change.

on-campus vs off-campus as a sophomore,"I'm a freshman really struggling to decide whether to live on-campus or off-campus next year.

I'd personally much rather live off-campus for a variety of reasons, but my best friend wants to live on-campus. I already have other people I could room with, but I'm not great friends with either of them and don't really enjoy spending time with them. My main concerns about living on-campus are the lack of space that I would have off-campus and the social situation as a sophomore on-campus. Obviously there isn't really anything I can do about the lack of personal space on-campus, but what is it like living on-campus as a sophomore?

I've heard people say that sophomores that live on-campus are losers. I doubt that's true, but if I'm a person who likes to go out, would I not fit in too well among the other sophomores? I hate to be rude, but are most of the sophomores on-campus ""nerds"" as in they are introverted and don't enjoy drinking/going out?

I haven't made any amazing friends that I really get along with so far, but I feel like I would be able to make great friends living on-campus. I find it really hard to just hang out and talk with a few guys when the only place you can really do that is in the dorm lobby where everyone can hear you. I feel like I'd be able to make so many more friends having kids over and hanging out in our apartment's living room or something.

I guess I'm mostly wondering if it's a lot easier to make friends and go out living off-campus than on-campus and if it is, it that’s worth sacrificing to live in a dorm with a friend. I'd really appreciate any advice or hearing any of your experiences.",1640564354,1,0
Dear Penn State,"Hello Reddit,

I have tried emailing many different places to send a letter about schools next semester, but unfortunately, all their offices and emails are closed until January 3rd. I don't know how else to get this message across, so I'm hoping that posting this here might possibly catch the attention of someone important.

If I am not allowed to post something like this here, I apologize in advance, and please kindly delete this post.

Dear Penn State,

My cousin once said that college is one of the most significant turning points of a young adult’s life. I hope this can be true for every student in America, regardless of who they are or what school they go to.

One of the most significant experiences I have put on all my college applications was my Tourette Syndrome disorder. I really put it there because it was probably the biggest struggle of my life, and it still is. Friends and mentors have given me the typical identity crap, which I’ll be honest with myself and others struggling with this disorder: I’m not normal, and I won’t ever be normal. Faces turn to me everywhere I go when I make vocal noises, but I still accept it. Once people get to know me, every single one of these people did not say they know who I am because of my Tourette’s, and I strongly believe that. But the fact is, the other 99.9% of the other students walking to classes won’t ever get to know me, but that’s okay. I still have that 0.01% that still recognizes me for who I really am, and I really appreciate that.

Penn State is really a phenomenal school. I’ve been there for less than 4 months and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed every bit of those months. At times, I experienced happiness, sadness, and sometimes both emotions, but one thing I will never deny is that all those experiences built me to try to become a better person in some way. I’ve built probably the most amount of friendships during this past semester compared to the rest of my entire life, which definitely means something to me. I originally chose Penn State because of this exact reason, to build friendships, connections, and to just have a good time. I came here for the transition into adult life that every college graduate has experienced, and I really hope I can do the same.

I’m currently in my sophomore year; my freshman year has been fully online and hearing that the next semester might also be online truly breaks me down. I’ve missed my entire second half of senior year in high school; I’ve missed my entire first year of dorming in East halls, meeting new friends, and being careless for our first year. And, I’m sure everyone else in this graduating class is suffering as well. I came from a very academically-rigorous high school back in Maryland, and I chose this school to experience something different, different from all my other 11 years of rigorous and tedious academic education. 

To be clear, I don’t involve myself with any of the political issues going on, nor do I involve myself with debates about masking or vaccinations – those simply cause more turmoil and us to hate each other more. I’m simply asking for Penn State to stay open during next semester. Penn State has already done a lot – from just the openness of basically any student walking to class to the numerous activities and student life they provide. 

I know I can’t be a normal person. I make noise wherever I go, regardless of what others think. I’ve developed chronic drug-induced lupus from taking medicine for my Tourette’s symptoms for a decade.  I can’t be normal, and I’ve chosen to accept this a long time ago. I do still hope that I am able to at least live and experience a somewhat normal transition to adulthood in college, and I’m sure that many students at Penn State want to as well.

Although I’m just one voice, and this single message probably won’t make much notice, I hope that whoever sees this will really consider that students like me, that even though we all know life is not normal and won’t be until this pandemic is over, that I and other students can at least be able to physically attend.

In the middle of the exam I get a random discord notification from a random server that has nothing to do with physics and I completely forgot discord doesn't close when you close it and you need to force close it. I completely forgot about this since I was so focused on the exam. When the notification popped up, I just continued the exam and did not click on any type of pop ups or notification. Will I get an academic integrity case or will I be considered of cheating even though I never cheated on this exam. This has been in my mind non-stop and I'm continuously worried that something will happen. It was a complete accident and it wasn't my fault that discord doesn't close when I close it and I need to force close it for some reason. Can someone please help? Thank you.",1633102284,1,0

Less than stellar experiences with clubs/organizations?,"Has anyone else in here have bad experiences with clubs or organizations offered to students? I just want to know I'm not alone (Don't namedrop though)

One common and pretty valid advice to people who are lonely here is to join clubs and organizations around campus. However, a few of the orgs I tried to join I ended up not fitting in or finding it pretty boring

A prime example of me not fitting in was when I attempted to apply for a role in this one org. Back then (pre-COVID), I was a naive underclassman desperate to bolster myself, and this role seemed like it could really help me. So, I got an interview, but I absolutely bombed it because I had weak interview skills (it was my first ever interview in my whole life). I didn't get accepted, which would be understandable due to my social skills, however, some weird stuff happened during the time of the interview: 

1) I thought the interview would be one-on-one. The person who scheduled this meeting never specified there would be a second person and acted like it would be a personal conversation, so I got intimidated once I realized I had to deal with two people
2) The second person smirked at me the whole time... I know I was shit at conversing, but it doesn't help at all

I was still in the club, just not accepted for the specific role I applied for. Once I attended the meeting that was meant to welcome in new members, I was pretty much ignored by the long term members, even those I tried to talk to. The interviewers, who had big positions, also never followed up with me regarding the interview and pretty much ghosted me

I wish I could go into more detail, but I must keep everything vague. What happened to me with the above club sucked, and it made me cautious about future clubs. I really believed joining a club would help me improve myself and sociability, but I guess I'll have to look into alternatives that are more welcoming",1633017181,1,0

should i report my prof that forced me to get a covid test and share the results with her?,"so today while i was in lab, i coughed a few times (like 3-4 times maybe it wasn’t like i was constantly hacking) as i have one of the psu plagues going around. my professor confronts me in the middle of lab for anyone to hear and asks me the last time i got a covid test (which was exactly a week ago). she told me that i was being irresponsible for coming to class after being told not to if we were sick. i knew i was sick, but it wasn’t serious (just some sniffles and cough from the runoff) and i knew that i didn’t have covid so i decided to go to lab anyway because it is the biggest headache to try to make up lab classes. she told me that i HAD to get a covid test and send her the results because she was seeing her elderly mother this weekend. i know that i probably shouldn’t have shown up to lab since i was sick but i was scarred from being forced to drop a class last semester due to getting covid and missing so much class that i couldn’t make it up. i am NOT going to let that happen this semester because i am graduating in may and this is a fall only class. i know that it’s not allowed for her to ask me to get tested or about my results but should i report her to admin or leave it alone? i ended up getting the test and begrudgingly sending her the results but it just feels wrong to force me to do this. what do you guys think?",1632982141,1,0

Cover a mouth when you cough,"It’s really stupid that I have to say this. I was in line at pollock for dinner and the girl behind me was wearing her mask on her chin.

We’re still in a pandemic. I understand that it’s mostly not Covid, but regardless, if you’re sick or not, cover your mouth when you cough. And it was multiple times. I politely asked her to put her mask on and to cover when she coughed, which she rolled her eyes and removed it when I turned away, again coughing until the air. You’re not making a point besides you’re a selfish jerk. COVID or not, have some respect for your peers and keep others safe. My roommate just had a seizure from what the doctors said was the flu.

Information Science Technology and Cybersecurity Analysis Operations major at Abington and world campus,"Hello,

I am thinking about a second degree in IST or CAO.

Now would I have same recourses at world campus compared to Abington. I know UP is considered to be the best of all, but I cannot go there because I don't want to live in dorm. At same time traveling to Abington is not difficult, but because of COVID. I might prefer online classes for now.  


Suppose I graduate/attend world campus would that have same value as any other penn graduate? I did a crappy online college before and it did not do me much good. I did got a few job offers here and there, but I am no longer interested in accounting field as much. I want to purse IST or CAO.  


Initially, I wanted to get a compsci or engineering degree, but it is too difficult and would be hard over online learning for now.   


Am I making same mistake if I go to world campus for IST/CAO?  
If I take CAO then I will have to finish it at world campus anyway.

RealCryptoEstate Keys are NFT collectibles, but also a social experiment in these early days to see how well glued the NFT community is.

Enter: mintable --&gt; realcryptoestate

Currently, people may be buying and selling their homes by accepting Bitcoins/crypto. Other aspects of the real estate transaction such as hiring a real estate lawyer for documentation (title/deed), would still require Fiat. 

How RealCryptoEstate Keys work:

\-The first buyer of the NFT holds the key and also kickstarts the journey

\-They may choose to sell to another community member on campus for ETH or Fiat, which would be used to fund their property purchase

\-This could then be used: a rental deposit, a first home, an investment property near a college campus etc. The seller of the NFT can always use to convert their realized gains to Fiat and purchase

\-The original key holder effectively unlocks a property with the NFT and that key starts taking a course that would be fascinating to follow.

\-The second holder of the key can sell the NFT to another community member and the process repeats

\-The NFT key can also be traded directly for a property to a seller willing to accept the NFT/ETH (other local real estate transactions processes and registration would still use Fiat).

Each key takes on a life of its own and the course it takes can be followed. This will require NFT holders to note where they are from and the kind of the property they acquired with as much or little detail as they would like. At the very least, the Country or City the key lands in would be interesting to follow.

Tracking can happen on Reddit (realcryptoestatekeys), or Twitter realcryptoestate

Imagine the NFT key jumping Towns, Counties, Borders, Countries and Continents. The data provided will have zero malcontent, but simply show how well adopted NFTs are and how well connected we all are. 

The price of 1-2 ETH accounts for the higher amount that real estate transactions typically requires. 

The first few phases could see the key unlocking a modest first home, mobile home, or a campus investment property . Eventually, the key could take on a path towards unlocking a home on the Bird Streets (LA), a Hamptons Estate (NY), Rosedale (TOR), Winecountry Estate (FR), Castle (UK), Danang Beach property (VN).

OK! So lets go unlock the World!

CHEM 110 (WC) grading questions,"I am an international student thinking to do CHEM 110 next semester (Spring 2022) in World Campus (so not in US).  (I would be majoring in Software Engineering)  However I have been out of HS for over 10 years.  I am worried about how I can excel in the grading.

According to the syllabus ([https://sites.psu.edu/chem110wc/brief-syllabus/](https://sites.psu.edu/chem110wc/brief-syllabus/)), there is a 3% grade on  Skills Check (review prerequisite content).  Can I know what it means?  Like, we would be graded based on what we already know from HS chem?  But...I have forgotten all of that lol.  If so, how can I catch up right out of the gate?  Since it is a prerequisite knowledge check kinda thing, wouldn't it be held in the beginning of semester so would there still be time to salvage this?  Would studying the assigned books help?

Also, there will be a 6% on weekly recitation.  How does that work?  If you participate but fail in giving correct answers to question, does that punish your grade?  Or does participation only count?

Quality of the ice cream in the creamery in decline.,"This is my 5th year on UP campus. I would call myself an ice cream lover. I have had countless ice cream from the creamery. My favorite flavor is the PB swirl, I buy them on a regular basis. One thing I noticed recently is, the flavor and the texture of the ice cream is so much worse than what it was. I won't even talk about the price.

Now I am done venting, here is my personal list (I don't like it moderately sweet, a little salty) of available ice creams that are superior than the creamery ice cream, feel free to add your own:

1. Fat Boy. It tastes better regardless of the price. And you can get a 18 count box for 10 bucks in Sam's. 
2. Tillamook ice cream. Pretty much any flavor I had is at least decent. You can find it in Giants.
3. The ""frozen yogurt"" of Sam's. It's not really frozen nor yogurt. But tastes great.
4. Milkshake in Meyer's.

My go to is fat boy, I will buy tillamook if I want something other than Vanilla.

PS. I crashed my first car when I left the cold stone for the fisrt time, and haven't been back since. So, I can't comment on their ice cream.",1637177932,1,0
