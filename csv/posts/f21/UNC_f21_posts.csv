Professor Conway's ECON 560 - Advanced International Economics (Questions on Class and Professor),"Hi Everyone!

I am registered for Professor Patrick Conway's ECON 560 class for the Spring 2022 semester, and was wondering how the class is, and how the professor is like. I really enjoyed ECON 460, taught by Professor Vaidyanathan, along with ECON 410, taught by Professor MSA. As background, I took ECON 460 in Fall 2021 (this semester) and ECON 410 in Spring 2021. 

I looked over the course syllabus and looks like there are some interesting cases to study (e.g., debt crisis and Grexit, monetary policy) and is research oriented, with some group work in this smaller 30 student class. I also heard he teaches ECON 111 as well, besides 560, and most of his RMP ratings is for that class. I know that for this coming semester, I will try not to ""forget"" my ECON 460 concepts as I will be a ULA for that Professor V's ECON 460. 

Any help is appreciated! Have a great winter break!",1639681806,1,0

I'm probably going to double-major in something that, if I took a few other classes that I would almost definitely have time for, could graduate with 3 bachelor's degrees. I know UNC only allows for 3 areas of study, but does anyone know if they make exceptions for this? And if so, who could I contact to get more info on it?",1636665326,1,0

No one will give me a chance,"This will probably get deleted but I'm going to try and post anyway because I have no friends and need support right now from other students who get it. I am struggling to find a part-time job right now and no one will hire me. 

I have almost 2 years experience working full-time in tech support and applied for an on-campus job which gave me an interview and then never got back to me. The interview did not go well and I have always been bad at interviews, but I knew I had the experience and skills relevant to the job so I thought I still had a fair chance given that it is not a position that requires face to face social interaction. I asked them what they were looking for in the position and they listed nearly everything I have experience in, yet then they asked me questions on technology I have never worked with that was not relevant to the job or the skills they claimed they were looking for in a person. I sent a thank you email with no response almost a week later. I've applied for at least 100 different tech support positions in the last week and no one will hire me despite my experience working full-time in the field which is rare in college students

I've applied for at least 200+ internships and no one will hire me for an internship either due to a lack of experience. I'm a CS major with 90+ credits and so far have only been able to take COMP 110 due to issues getting in CS classes. I've been trying to teach myself as much as possible off of youtube but that doesn't get me very far for obvious reasons. They look at my resume and see no CS coursework other than 110, no decent projects, no experience, and I'm out of their consideration. I feel completely defeated and worthless right now because I am trying to teach myself this material and just now getting into 1 intro CS class in the spring. 

I really need a job right now and no one will give me a chance. After losing my job in tech support in 2020 I came back to school because after nearly a year of looking for work no one would hire me. Now almost 2 years later and still no one will hire me. I'm not sure where these people think I am going to get more experience if they aren't willing to give me a chance, considering most successful people wouldn't be where they are now if it wasn't for someone willing to give them a shot when they were starting out. But no one wants to do that anymore and it is literally killing me. 

Making friends at UNC seems to be just the same, give that the people I try to connect with decide I'm not good enough for whatever reason and disappear into thin air, politely indicate they want nothing to do with me, or just outright ghost me. Then people get mad at me for coming on here and needing to talk to other people my age who are actual students when this is the only way I am able to connect with anyone at this school. I just want someone to give me a chance, take the time to get to know me, and treat me like I'm worth something. 

Being shut out of every job I've applied for, every internship, every social interaction, I'm just about ready to completely lose it. I feel isolated, unwanted, and rejected by the world and by everyone at this school. My favorite professor here told me to drop out and that she would give me a reference to get my old job back because apparently I just suck at everything that much. No one in my entire life has ever believed in me, except for my sister who is dead. 

I need someone to give me a chance and no one wants to be that person. What job am I supposed to go into when no one will hire me? What am I supposed to study when I can't take the classes I need and no one will hire me because I can't learn anything off youtube about CS? I am trying to be proactive and get a job, make friends, have a life, etc, but no one will give me the chance to do that and the world doesn't seem to want me in it. I am facing rejection everywhere I turn with everyone I meet at this school and it never ends. 

My own dad and brother tried to beat me to death a month ago and it wasn't the first time. I seem to have something that makes people want rid of me for good and I am trying to fix it but no one will give me the chance to do that. I've been in therapy for over a year but it was not helpful, and most of the time therapists would always tell me to try talking about things with friends or other people, which other people don't care about or want to hear. I kept getting therapy shoved down my throat because people didn't want to hear me talk about my problems, but as someone who has been in therapy for an extended period of time and seen several therapists they don't care either and usually suggest talking about issues with friends, family, or other people for support. I haven't talked openly to anyone about anything in a long time now because I realized that no one listens or cares and I just kept getting tossed around from person to person and therapist to therapist because no of them wanted to listen and kept suggesting to go to friends about it who I ended up losing because of that.

I'm not blaming other people, I'm trying to seek out people and opportunities so that I can be more self-reliant, yet no one wants to hire me and no one wants to give me a chance and get to know me or treat me like a person that is worth anything of anything. I'm not sure what to make of things anymore because it doesn't seem like I'm ever going to get a job no matter how much I try to force myself to think positively about it. I worry that I will graduate knowing barely anything about CS due to the spacing out of the classes and difficulty getting into them, and that I will struggle to get a job even after graduating. I also worry that I will never make a friend here which seems to be the most realistic outcome given being shunned by people and professors I looked up to here that ended up trying to get rid of me.

If anyone knows of places in the area or on campus that are hiring please let me know. Suggestions for clubs to join to make friends would also be appreciated. I'm in a few clubs right now but have not had any luck with making friends in clubs, despite people suggesting that as a way to meet people. Not trying to kill anyone's vibe with my ""negativity"" just trying to find a way to turn things around before I starve of both basic human interaction and basic needs from being unable to find a job and people to socialize with.",1636661603,1,0

Employment Opportunities for Students,"Hello Everyone!

I know that a lot of students have been struggling with finding internships/jobs during the pandemic, so I wanted to share a free resource that will match you with opportunities you won’t get ghosted on!

It's this resource called RippleMatch, completely different from job boards like WayUp and Handshake. On RippleMatch, you have a feed of opportunities curated just for you, kind of like TikTok. You don’t have to scroll through thousands of opportunities like you do with job boards; instead, you can generate your own matches that the AI finds for you. I love it because it takes under five minutes to apply to each company and get your profile in front of a recruiter—and you’ll actually hear back rather than getting ghosted by job boards. You’ll also have a 50% chance of getting an interview when you apply through RippleMatch (compared to 2% on job boards)! 

If you're interested, you can sign-up [here](https://ripplematch.com/index?r=mVGZc5).

It’s a quick sign up process and if you receive a match upon signing up, it’s best to apply right away because you have a higher chance of landing an interview!",1632517317,1,0

Carmichael 4th floor issue,"Disclaimer: on mobile 

Does anyone know have any information about what’s going on with 4th floor Carmichael? There’s been a “wet floor” sign up in the hall for over a week over a weird spot on the floor and a terrible smell that’s gotten worse and worse. It’s so bad now that the entire hallway and most of the room halls smell like death even with two masks on. A lot of people think it’s mold. The RA’s told us to wait for more info but I’m seriously allergic to mold and have had worse and worse reactions such that I’ve moved some of my stuff out and staying with a friend. Many people on the floor have sent in fix my room requests and I know some have called housing. 

Anyone have any more information? Any ideas on how to push this?

I am about to flunk out of my 1st semester here,"Half-vent but also half ""what should I do now to improve.""

&amp;#x200B;

I came from an NC community college with straight As, thinking I was hot shit. Now I'm getting my ass kicked here.

Part of it was bad luck. I couldn't take 2 mid terms; 1 had no make-up accommodation, despite campus health telling me to stay home. Also missed a lab due to a health emergency which is no bueno; miss more than 2 (excused or unexcused) and you fail the class automatically. I fell behind on that work since it was hard to keep up when you should be resting/putting your health first.

Part of it was also my fault. I couldn't handle the rigor/keep up with the readings for my sociology class, so I dropped that too.  I am now only taking SPAN 203 and STOR 155 since I dropped the others. I just bombed my STOR exam despite studying \*a ton\* and also going to the learning center. Literally all I do is do menial tasks (laundry, dining hall, etc), \*study\*, and occasionally take breaks to talk to family or friends. I feel like I'm doing what an ideal student should be doing, yet it yields poor results.

BIOL101 Exam w/ Garland,"I want to know how to best study. PM and SI meetings (that don't happen during my classes, which is usually one a week or less) that I've attended have been complete garbage, and I'm spending multiple hours studying, getting the GRQ/Mastering done, going over old problems, using the dynamic module thing on MyLab... I feel like I'm putting in a shitload of effort for barely anything in return.

 I'm very afraid that I won't pass the class with a C. My current test scores are a 72, 63, and 77, and I'm hoping to replace the 63 with something. Anything above a 75. I just want to pass the class so I don't have to retake it. It doesn't help that my 77 came with 4 questions full credit for everyone, a +3 point curve, and +1 point for attending an SI meeting (which was unhelpful with how vague our SI was and how quickly she went through all the slides).

What can I do for the final? It feels like the more I study and the more time I put into trying to learn, the worse my grades get. Is the final difficult? What should I focus on studying? Are there any study tools that would best prepare me?

About Course Evaluations (From an Instructor)," &lt; I was obnoxious (sorry) and posted this as a comment to an other thread asking for wrong answers about course evals, but do think it's worth sharing this info as its own post. &gt;

I'm a graduate student instructor at UNC and make a point of telling students about course evals because so many students don't know what they're used for, who sees them, etc. What's more, students are often unaware of how tremendously harmful evaluations can be for instructors who are BIPOC, LGBTQ, not cis-male, etc. Some info for anyone who would like to know:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Who makes them?:** These course evals are designed and mandated by the corresponding University College (i.e., the ones for an English course are from the College of Arts &amp; Sciences).
* **Who sees them?:** Course evals are visible to the instructor and supervisors, departmental admin, university officials.
* **What are they used for?:** Course evals are used to ensure instructors are meeting required expectations by their departments and the university more generally. They are also used in decisions about hiring/firing, promotion, etc. I also use them to identify areas in which I can develop my skills as a teacher, but it comes with the added pressure that my supervisors can see them too (and very real anxiety of what sorts of bias will inevitably appear in the comments). I usually have my own course reflections for students to complete that are more meaningful to my specific courses and are for my use only.
* **Isn't that sort of oversite a good thing?** In some situations, maybe. But even that is arguable. For decades now, course evals have been criticized for their disproportionately negative impact on instructors from any marginalized communities. Instructors who are BIPOC, LGBTQ, female, young, old, disabled, etc. are most at risk from the impact of student bias (unintentional or otherwise) in these evaluations. I carry all sorts of priviledges that my peers do not, but I have still received comments in evals that are very gendered (focus on my clothes or appearance, age, relationship status, etc), carry ableist or homophobic undertones, or are downright abusive. Graduate student workers like myself, who often make below living wage and receive poor benefits and little to no job security, are also disproportionately at risk of experiencing bias in course evaluations and of seeing course evals negatively affect our career paths.
* **So I guess I should only say nice things in evals?** No! I'm by no means suggesting you shouldn't be honest about your experiences with an instructor, but ask that students consider their intentions with their responses--and how their biases might be influencing their comments.
* **Then it's better to just ignore them, right**? As ineffective and often harmful as they are, the unfortunate truth is that the instructors most at risk of encountering bias in course evals are also those under the most pressure to get responses. Respond and be honest about your experiences with that instructor, but please consider what sort of feedback will be helpful/productive and how your responses could unintentionally perpetuate the marginalization of vulnerable individuals.

should i move out?,"hi guys! sorry this post might be a bit long, but i kind of need to vent about my roommate situation at the moment. so i'm currently living in a dorm with my roommate, and we haven't gotten along well since the beginning of this semester. our first arguments started with when i talk on the phone with my parents or friends in our dorm, and she would clear her throat loudly or keep looking at me until i got off. i barely communicate on my phone now because of that to be honest. according to her, i wasn't being respectful of her time in the room while she was studying and i was making too much noise. maybe i do talk a bit loudly when i'm happy about something but i told her i could be a bit quieter if she wanted. she said that she didn't like any type of noise in the room while she was working and that i could take my calls outside. i got a bit frustrated but i thought, ""okay, that's fine. this isn't my room alone anyways and i understand she needs her time too"". so sometimes i left the room, sometimes i didn't, but even if i didn't talk much in a discord call with my friend to be honest, she would still get frustrated. i don't have a set time for when my parents call me or when i want to join my friends online or something, but it was usually around nighttime, and she would sleep around 10 or something. i tried going to the lounge (super noisy), or outside most times, but i didn't want to keep leaving the room and just eventually stopped trying to communicate with my friends especially.

we ended up on a few other issues, like how she didn't like the lights behind my bed (fairy lights) because they were too distracting to her when she slept. i got stubborn and said she would have to deal with it, but i kept them as dim as i could. later on, she had sent a message to our RA without me knowing and i was asked to go to a meeting so we could start sending boundaries. we did make official agreements, but i just feel unhappy and feel that they were mostly tailored to what she wanted. she currently spends most of her time out of the room, which makes ME feel guilty because i feel like i'm taking away her personal space. she barely talks to me at this point too, like when i say 'hello' when she enters the room she doesn't usually reply back.

i felt like my experience in the dorm this semester made me feel really awful and definitely contributed to me not feeling like i did my best this semester in terms of grades and socializing. i am already dealing with some mental health issues that especially flared up when i moved to college this year. i probably am complaining a bit too much but i'm not sure at this point, i just don't feel happy living here, been feeling too timid and keep expecting her to complain about something else to me. i've heard of reassignments, but i'm just not sure i want to risk an experience something like this one next semester, and i'm not sure how even the costs work. is it worth it to move out, even for one semester until the new housing changes? or should i just tough it out? again, sorry for the long rant, i think i just needed to let someone else read this.",1638680840,1,0

Did I deserve it?," Hi everyone,

**TLDR**: I'm an NCSU student who posted a source of contestable (meaning anti vaccine) information to the college subreddit, and was banned for it. I think this was wrong, but what do you think?

Let me just start off by saying that I am not here to get people mad or to cause a fuss. I know that in some ways UNC and NCSU are kind of like enemies, but I don't like involving myself in those feuds, even though I guess technically that this post may count as doing so. I do not know how well you guys are going to take this; I am already preparing my overly-sensitive self for a bunch of mean comments, but if you feel the need to be mean / harshly-criticizing then so be it, I know everyone has their own opinions and I won't try to silence yours. However, I do humbly ask that you try to respond kindly, as I am trying to be kind to you.

Anyways, I posted a source of information related to covid so that I could see what my peers thought of it. Yes, the source is anti vaccine, but whether or not it is true is up for debate, and I never claimed it to be true. To me, the source was interesting, and I thought maybe it would interest others, as information like this tends to not be as widespread. Despite me just posting a source of information for others to review - not claiming it to be true - I was met with comments that honestly hurt me and made me feel terrible. Call me what you will, a pussy, snowflake, etc., I know that I am overly sensitive. The comments aren't why I am here though, they were well within their right to reply as they did. I am here because I was banned, first temporarily, and then permanently when I brought up the mod's intolerance.

The source I posted deals with the research of one Dr. Pablo Campra, who found that there was graphene hydroxide in the covid vaccine (although, there is the benefit of a doubt, since the vaccine sample was not from a well-accredited source). Dr. Andreas Noack, a leading expert in activated carbon compounds, is discussing this graphene substance and the implications it has inside the human body - acting as nano razor blades. That's pretty much it, that's the source. I will link the whole thing at the bottom of this post. Also, it's interesting that soon after Dr. Noack did his video on this, he was arrested and since the last time I checked, is reported to be dead.

So, here I am with my question: did I deserve to be banned? My only guess as to why is because either the community was intolerant, and/or the information I shared was so dangerous that it deserved to be silenced. Mods, if you also think so, please at least let this post sit for a while so that I can see how others respond. If there is an overwhelming majority that are offended, I apologize in advance, and I will delete this post myself.

If you want to express your displeasure with the source I posted, below are some of the responses I received that might help you to formulate yours. I only ask that if you reply, that you either watch the whole video or read through the whole transcript.

""Lol, absolutely fucking not.""

""you still have time to delete this post... this is sad. this information does not deserve to be shared, because it's incredibly stupid.""

""This is the dumbest shit I have ever read. You should be ashamed for posting it.""

Here is the dreaded source. You can also find this video on a few other sites as well.

Last chance! Register and vote today (by 3 pm) in Chapel Hill/Carrboro.,"People don't typically pay attention to local elections, but town governments make a lot of decisions that matter to everyone who lives here, including students. Bus service, police budgets, the availability of housing, and many other issues are determined in part or whole by local government.

Despite an engaged citizenry, turnout in local elections in Chapel Hill is abysmally low. In 2019, only 18 percent of registered voters cast a ballot in the local races, while 75 percent or more voted in 2020. For this reason, your vote is likely to make a bigger difference in local elections than it will in state or federal contests. 

Through this afternoon at 3 pm, you can vote early at Chapel of the Cross (near the planetarium), Carrboro Town Hall (108 Bim Street, just behind the town hall itself),  or the Seymour Center on Homestead Road. If you're not registered to vote, you can register and vote early, but not on election day, which is  Tuesday.  More information [here](https://www.orangecountync.gov/1116/Early-Voting).

If you have any questions about the candidates or what's at stake in this campaign, please ask. Alternatively, you can use this [guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qUrBCcIvhCnRcMMqCQG0dSFxCYnWIFz8cITKrAU4qZs/edit?usp=sharing) to endorsements, which includes links to candidate surveys and other information. ",1635602219,1,0

I know it’s generally advised against taking 2 labs in one semester, but most of my remaining credits (I came in with an associates degree) have labs with them, so I don’t think it’s avoidable.

PROTEST TOMORROW (OCT 29 FRIDAY) FOR UNC MENTAL HEALTH,"Hi everyone! 

For those of you who have been interested in this protest, thanks for sticking with us!

For those who don't know, tomorrow there will be a protest in front of Wilson Library for the prioritization of student mental health. This will be between 1:30 PM to 5:00 PM- RAIN OR SHINE (bring an umbrella)!!

# We are making three important demands:

1) Hire more counselors for UNC CAPS. Currently, only 5% of the student body can be seen in a single week! 

2) Have staff go through training for mental health and be more accommodating for extensions and deadlines. UNC is very demanding with the workload they give us, and it has become a bit too much for those of us that struggle with our mental health.

3) We also want to demand that we are given a mental health day each month so we can take out time to care for ourselves and focus on our own needs. The one mental health day we were given recently was great and gave everyone time to enjoy themselves and take care of their own needs, but this needs to be a normal thing for everyone. 

Please come out tomorrow to support us! We will be handing out pamphlets, playing music, and spreading so much love and positivity. There will be opportunities to speak on your own experiences with mental health at UNC, so do not be afraid to take the mic! We need to make clear that our mental health as students is a major priority that cannot continue to be swept under the rug. These alterations are long overdue, and need to happen now. 

I hope to see you there!",1635462907,1,0

New Course about Psychology in Movies/TV," 

Hi,

If you're looking for a fun 1 credit, P/F, once/week class, consider SPCL 400.308!!

In Spring 2022, I will be teaching a 1 credit, P/F course titled ""Psychology in Television and Films"". It takes place on Mondays at 3 - 5pm. The course will be about analyzing how Movies and TV portray mental illness/therapy and discussing how it affects stigma. Homework will consist of watching movies and light reading and grades will be primarily based on discussion, activities, and participation (no exams). If you're a fan of learning about mental health and watching movies, this class will be a treat for you!

Class: SPCL 400.308

Code: 2782

Time: Mondays 3pm - 5pm

Location: TBD

&amp;#x200B;

Full Course Description:

 For many of those unaccustomed to mental illness or psychology, their perceptions of these topics are influenced by the tropes they see on TV or movies. The depiction of mental illness across these media is often sacrificed authenticity for the sake of entertainment. Even the depictions that attempt their best to maintain accuracy still don’t present the full experience of individuals suffering from mental illnesses. The inaccuracies in these depictions contribute to the stigma surrounding mental illness. This course will attempt to de-stigmatize mental illness through analysis of mental health depictions in media. Throughout the course, we will take examples of characters in TV shows and movies who exhibit traits of or are directly diagnosed with mental illnesses and compare these depictions with the reality behind the mental illness.",1635440572,1,0

"You can, in fact, be an alcoholic in college","Hi all, just wanted to make a quick PSA I wish I had heard two years ago. Fuck that adage that “you can’t be an alcoholic when youre in college”. You can be an alcoholic at any point in your life. I turned 21 a few months ago and I have no problem admitting that I am an alcoholic. 

Alcoholism is an illness that develops from and encourages unhealthy use of alcohol. Regardless of how much you drink, I would implore you to answer these questions for yourself to reflect on your relationship with alcohol and whether or not it is healthy. 

-	When was the last time you had only one or two drinks?
-	Do you drive after drinking? If so, do you have a limit of how many drinks you can have before driving?
-	How frequently do you drink?
-	When you drink, do you have a strong urge to have another?
-	Have you blacked out? If so, how many times/how frequently?
-	Have you experienced strange problems, pains, or sensations from drinking, including intense hangovers, but continued anyways?
-	Have you tried to stop or cut down on drinking? If so, how did that go? If not, why?
-	Do you drink in order to have more fun doing certain things? Would those things be fun without alcohol? If not, are they worth doing?
-	Do you do things drunk that you wouldn’t do sober?
-	Have your relationships with others suffered from your drinking, directly or indirectly?
-	Do you find yourself trying to keep up with someone else’s drinking?

If through reflection, you decide that your drinking is unhealthy, you may want to consider talking to someone else about it. Remember that alcoholism is also a progressive disease; it can be obvious to the point where you black out every day and drink in the morning, but it can be far less significant than that, where you might not even crave a drink when youre not drinking but as soon as you have one you crave more. And like cancer, it is better to catch early rather than wait for it to start killing you. If you need someone anonymous and confidential my PMs are open.

I just wanted to let y'all know that while I didn't take this class, I did take MATH 381 with a fairly difficult instructor  (and uses the same textbook)  + upper division math classes like 521---and I'm 100% willing to help out/tutor, send my old works for you to practice, whatever you need. No charge, especially if you have covid or just covid-related concerns. I want y'all to know I sympathize as this isn't an easy class and intimidating instructors and I don't want any of my peers at this school to feel like they're drowning for something out of their control/just in general. Also there are always people willing to help you, and I'm willing to talk if anyone needs to vent/needs emotional support as I understand these are scary times and it can feel really bad when someone's dismissive---but you are all doing great and I believe with some support everyone can make it. :)

Do current UNC students get scholarships to fund their education?,"I'm a freshman at UNC burdened with student loan debt.

I received $4k in outside scholarships for this year, but obviously that's a paltry amount in the face of $20k.  Not to mention needing to pay for future years.

Have any students gotten scholarships while in school to pay for it?  Where do you source scholarships from once you're admitted?  And how do you otherwise save money on living expenses (food and rent)?",1631164849,1,0
UNC blows too much money on needless luxuries in the face of exorbitant tuition costs. It's maddening.,"UNC just opened the gaming arena in Craige. Why, exactly? Why should an institution of higher learning have a fucking arcade?  Shouldn't students be learning and playing video games on their own dime, if at all?

Same with the dining halls. Do we really need all these fancy expensive add-ons, like a nacho bar or a fancy salad bar, when decent food could be made for much cheaper, saving students money?

Why is my tuition (which is paid for ENTIRELY by loans by the way) going to fund these frivolities? And why am I funding this nonsense for kids who, unlike me, actually received aid from UNC?  Why is the taxpayer paying for this instead of directing the money towards driving down the cost of attendance?  Why are they doing this on my dime when my family and I are drowning in debt?  

Why isn't UNC focused on providing a quality education to its students at a good price instead of making us take out loans to have fun at an expensive daycare?

I just don't want to be in debt anymore.  College administrations are greedy and corrupt.  This is more of an issue than COVID mishandling.",1631164340,1,0

LPT: Treat HeelMail like a work email,"A lot of folks graduate and then panic because they use their UNC email addresses like a personal account and have to worry about forwarding important emails and losing the ability to access accounts (eg.

It also helps separate your professional life from your personal life. Any email you send on HeelMail runs the risk of [being released into public records](https://its.unc.edu/2015/10/21/five-limits-to-the-privacy-of-your-unc-edu-email/), so it is important to maintain professionalism in your messages and know that there is no guarantee of privacy (also, in general you should just assume that any email you write might be forwarded to someone you wouldn't want to see it).

Come to your own conclusions, but I heard something from Bob Blouin that just sounded *wrong* (turns out it is) and wanted to make sure we know the actual facts around Covid-19 vs. seasonal flu. I don't want to go online either. I also am upset by our co-chancellor giving misinformation.

Bob Blouin stated in the Zoom meeting at this link that, ""flu kills millions of people every year,"" I assume with intention of downplaying the deaths potentially caused by Covid-19, which could increase significantly if we return to in-person learning. I don't want to go online either, but we are a leading university in public health and I find a grossly false statement, arguably a flat-out lie, unacceptable. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, **estimated deaths from the Flu were 20,000 for the 2019-2020 season**. Not millions. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html). Also per the CDC, ""deaths with confirmed or presumed Covid-19"" for the year 2020 are **816,823**; ""deaths involving Influenza \[including\] deaths with pneumonia or or Covid-19 also listed as cause of death"" for the year 2020 are **8,785**.

Transfer Student Questions,"Hey! I'm a potential transfer student to the University from an out of state school with equal academic standing to UNC.

I currently have a 3.7 GPA, obviously a lot of CC applications come with a higher GPA as well as those from schools such as App State, UNCA, UNCG, etc. Will my standing at a ""more rigorous"" school play into affect here or should I have reason to be concerned?

Additionally just a few questions that come to mind regarding housing:

1. Should I be concerned with being able to find a place to live as a transfer student? I assume apartments are cheaper than the dorms, and by late March/early April will I still be able to find something? I'm find with living in a studio apartment as long as it's reasonably priced and not super far from campus, my school is in the Midwest so I don't mind walking far even if it's cold, I'm used to it at this point.

2. Would you recommend the dorms for a transfer student? I am an NC resident and have friends at the university. Obviously I don't want to rely on them for everything, and would love to meet new people, but does the price of dorms cancel out the benefit of meeting new people in your opinions? For people who lived in apartments as transfers, did you find it difficult to find new people?

I dropped 210 last spring mid-semester so if I take it again this spring it would technically be my 3rd time taking it, so I wanted to see if taking the placement test over the summer instead to get credit for it was an option before I end up retaking it.

Do you think that professors should be allowed to provide support to students,"I had a professor this past semester that I really hit it off with that was easy to talk to, understanding, and seemed to get me. The professor was very supportive but after opening up to them I got referred to DOS, told that they were not supposed to act as a support system for students and that DOS would be able to refer me to resources. A constant issue I've experienced is coming across compassionate, kind, understanding professors who seem to genuinely care but are limited in their role to support students due to an obligation to refer students to DOS as policy. 

On one hand, they may not be ""trained"" to have a conversation about these topics, but access to trained professionals costs money and is not always helpful or accessible to every student. I have spoken with a lot of students on this sub who like myself just needed someone to talk to at this school who understood and was willing to listen, regardless of their credentials. 

DOS seems very short-term and does not provide long-term support that some students desperately need. Many students including myself can not afford a therapist and CAPS just gives referrals and turns you away if you need ongoing support. I will never understand why professors are told that they have to do this, because DOS is short-term support that refers you out again, then CAPS refers you out again, and if you are a broke college student you are back where you started only with no one to talk to. Most professors I have talked to have given me better advice than any of the therapists I have seen and seem to care, but they are discouraged from doing so and apparently told they have to refer students to DOS. 

On the DOS website it appears that once professors refer you to DOS they are told very limited information on how you are doing if they try to get updates or check on students. They seem to act as a barrier between professors and students experiencing life challenges or mental health issues, which leaves students who are broke with no one to turn to for ongoing support after being referred to more ""resources"". Is this to remove liability concerns for the school in the event that something happens to a student? 

It just seems like one of the main problems is no one is able to support their students to the point they get referred around over and over like a hot potato that no one knows what to do with. I think that professors and students should be allowed to have these types of conversations without the student being referred out to DOS or CAPS if there are boundaries set between the student and professor that are mutually respected. 

I know that it is never the obligation of a professor to provide emotional support to students or part of their job, but if they offer to do so and genuinely care about a students then I think that should be allowed without all of this tape and bureaucracy, especially if the student has no one else and limited or in some cases no access to other means of support. Resources should be offered as a supplement to that, but in many cases are inaccessible, leaving low-income students with a genuine need for ongoing support isolated and disposed of for the sake of avoiding liability while also increasing the risks they attempt to avoid in doing so.",1640627332,1,0

Fall Exchange Clarification,"Hi everyone,

Hope everyone's Christmas break is going well. I am an exchange student from Asia hoping to come to UNC for the Fall 2022 semester and was hoping to get some help for the mod mapping.

If all goes well, I should be heading to Kenan Flagler as that is our partner university. So as a finance major hoping to clear 5 mods across these requirement areas as it relates to my graduation requirements:

1. Cultures of the modern world
2. Finance Elective 1
3. Finance Elective 2
4. Sustainability Elective 1 (ie. Sustainable Cities/Energy)
5. Business Management theory (ie. Negotiation)

Based on my understanding from the Kenan Flager website, I believe the courses will be pre-assigned for international students based on our stated preferences with the majority being business mods and allowance for 1 mod outside of that.

However it does not elaborate much beyond that. So if you have any suggestions related to courses to take, materials I can refer to, clarifications or just things to take note off. It will be much appreciated.

Otherwise thank you all for the help and hope y'all have a great Christmas!

•don't let anyone tell you that you have to go to a ""prestigious"" school. Even if you've been a gifted kid, a high achiever, a straight A student, it might not be the best for you. Consider staying closer to home, going to a smaller school, going to community college, or taking a gap year.

•if you want to drop out or transfer, do it. Trust your gut.

•the best thing I ever did for my mental health was taking time off from school and getting a full time job. If you're struggling, consider getting some real world experience to help you figure out what actually makes you happy

And finally, it's okay to make mistakes. It's okay if you failed a class. It's okay if you wish you never came to college. You're still young. You have the whole world in front of you. Just because you weren't happy in college doesn't mean you won't be happy ever: look at me. I didn't think I'd make it out of college alive, but next week, I'm starting a job doing something I love (and making a living wage!) I'm moving in with my partner back in my hometown. I'm okay. I made it.

Please feel free to pm me, even if you just want to talk. I hope that my college struggles can help someone else avoid some pain.

Best wishes to all of you! Thanks for always answering my questions on here :)",1639320081,1,0
Test optional or not?,"I’m a senior applying to chapel hill. As of now, it is my number one. I had 1 B freshman year English, and a B+ in Algebra 2 accelerated.

But with COVID, I was online for the entirety of sophomore year while about half of my friends were in-person.

Now, my friend groups aren’t really groups anymore as everyone has sort of split off and met new people/groups. I’m still friends with a bunch of people but they’re more of 1:1 relationships now rather than having a group of people to hangout with.

Going into next semester, I want to make a lot of new friends and hopefully find more of a community of people whether it’s a friend group or social organization. I’m not sure if rushing now is worth it since I have 3 semesters left but I’m open to it. I’d love to hear any advice, organizations, etc.",1639062097,1,0
Transferring to UNC from App State?,"i’ve been having a difficult time at app being so far away from home and UNC being my dream school.

I highly regret not joining the waitlist but I’ve learned a lot at app. I have more friends at UNC, it’s closer to home, and I was interested in their nursing program. I was wondering if it would be worth transferring as a sophomore because of my stats and the workload at UNC.

HS GPA: 4.5 UW, 3.9 W
Dual Enrolled GPA at local CC: 4.0
HS EC’s: Varsity cheer 4 years (captain one year), student government officer, national honors society, a local tutoring club twice a week.
Volunteering: 150+ hours from some club opportunities and volunteering at my nearby hospital.
I also have 41 transferable hours that i took while in highschool from my community college.

Now this is where it gets rocky

College GPA first semester: i think it will be a 3.56 for 16 credit hours….for reference i got all A+’s and a C- in Microeconomics (very difficult course that I am retaking next semester for grade forgiveness).
College EC: Joined one club for a major that I changed, which means I will most likely join more nursing clubs next semester. I also have a part time job.

Pissed about math curves,"Got the curve back for my math class and it effectively penalized people for doing well in the class. Apparently, too many people did well, so they had to change the grade ranges to:

A: 91-100

B: 85-90

C:77-84

D: 66-76

F: 65 and below.

I get that it's standard for classes beyond calculus to be curved but I think it's absolute bullshit that they're choosing to fail students and tank GPAs simply because too many people got B's. I think it's bullshit that they are penalizing students and dropping their grades because *too many of them understood the material and did well.* What the fuck is the point of that?

And what makes me even madder is the entire spiel on mental health we've been given, how we're told about resources and shit and then the university pulls shit like this. Like yeah, grades don't define me, but I worked my ass off and let out a sigh of relief because I knew an 84 would be enough to not tank my GPA, but then the bullshit curve does it anyway. What the fuck is the point?

I love math and I was really looking forward to doing a major but I don't know if I wanna keep doing it when the department won't take our concerns about this kind of shit seriously and if it seems like I'm gonna be penalized for actually trying to learn. I'm just stressed and pissed and tired of all this shit.

ETA:  They didn't specify a grading scale on the syllabus, but we would be told that grade boundaries would be determined after finals. That being said, when we took midterms, we'd be given rough estimates of what we should consider an A, B, C, etc. but these never really seemed to negatively affect grades, and to me, it didn't seem as though they were officially implemented. They also were pretty close to the 10 point scale, if I remember correctly.

The syllabus says ""This section will be graded in a manner that is consistent with how other recent sections of Math 381 have been graded, and with the way that upper-level UNC math courses are typically graded"", so there were no clear curve or grade boundaries defined, but through the year they stayed relatively consistent w the 10 point scale.

I have a couple of questions that I would really appreciate if yall could answer-Prospective Student,"UNC-CH had been one of my dream schools for some time now but recent events alongside the experiences of people who I know(my dad actually went to the school for a year before transferring and has really strong opinion of not wanting me to go there and a former upperclassman of my high school is not having the greatest time in physics even though I could've sworn he was a pretty good student/studier), I would like to ask a couple of questions and hear the experiences of yall

* Are science courses fair in a way that you are not fighting an uphill battle for your grade? (material clearly stated, assessments accurately paralleling content discussed, academic support availability, professors offering sufficient support for students)
* Do you feel like the work you put in for a  course accurately represents the grade you received, especially regarding science courses? 
* Are there any benefits of going to UNC for premed in comparison to other in-state institutions, such as NC State
* What would you consider the campus culture to be like(competitive, easy-going, etc)
* How much do the professors/school overall care for their students academically or mentally? 
* What are some of the issues that you would consider to be the most significant at UNC-CH?",1634602881,1,0
[TW suicidal ideation] Anxiety over returning to campus. Is it worth it to finish my degree?,"**TW FOR SUICIDAL IDEATION** 

I hope this is okay to post. I read through the subreddit rules and didn't see anything prohibiting posts like this, but please take it down if it's not allowed. Also, throwaway account because I'm too ashamed to post this otherwise.

I’m sorry, this will not be very eloquent or optimistic. I just needed somewhere to vent about this and maybe see if anyone had any advice on how to move forward.

I should note that I am seeing a therapist to work through this right now, but in-between sessions, the anxiety feels constantly overwhelming.

My first semester at UNC was Fall 2019. I have been studying remotely since the first time campus closed during the Spring 2020 semester. During my freshman semester on campus, I really just hated being there. I have a very difficult time with change, living with others, and am burnt out very easily by social interactions. As one might imagine, this can (and did, for me) easily make for a grueling university experience.

Today, an email was sent out explaining that the Carolina Away program, which I am currently enrolled in, will be terminated upon the completion of this semester. I am an American Studies major, and none of the few online courses being offered in the spring make sense for my graduation track.

Essentially, I could either move back onto campus or take a gap semester. Due to ongoing physical and mental health issues and the financial burdens that come with addressing them, I will be taking a gap semester to work.

The problem is this: I never, ever want to move back to Carolina. Every night, I either take forever to fall asleep because of or am woken up by anxiety over potentially having to move back to finish my degree. Every day, I play out different scenarios of going back to in-person, and **\[TW\]** every single one ends in me killing myself.

A huge part of this has to do with my cat. I know this may sound trivial, but thinking about leaving my cat in the care of my mother and sister when I move back often sends me into full-blown panic mode. When we we first sent home and my health began deteriorating, he was really the only thing that got me out of bed in the morning.

He’s a stray I started feeding at the start of the pandemic after moving home, and he stays outside (we live in a rural area, he sticks around the house, he won’t come inside, and we already have 2 pets in the house. please do not lecture about the dangers of leaving a cat outside; I can assure you that I fret over that, too). I can’t move him onto campus with me because I genuinely believe he would suffer in a 14’x12’ room––even if I managed it, I would have to put him back outside when I moved home, which is cruel.

Again, I know that may feel stupid to many, but all I can picture is him dying while I'm away. People/human relationships are confusing and exhausting for me to navigate, so my best friends have always been my pets. In addition, I function better with remote learning/being able to come home to some familiarity.

I’ve thought about transferring to a different, more local university, but none near me have an American Studies program and I truly adore the department’s faculty at UNC. I already have an associate’s degree (arts).

It might be worth mentioning that I have absolutely no plan after college. I don’t know if I want to go to grad school (to be honest, probably not, as it would only be to fill more time while I figure out my life), and there’s not much to do with an American Studies degree without pursuing graduate or doctoral studies.

It truly feels as though I’m just waiting for the day it all becomes too much, and then I’ll remove myself from the equation entirely. There’s a Jean Cocteau quote I’ve been thinking about quite a lot recently: “Since the day of my birth, my death began its walk. It is walking toward me, without hurrying.”

It feels as though my death *is* hurrying––pretty much barreling––toward me. And every day, it gains more ground.

I don't feel as though I want to die so much as I just want everything to stop. I just want to rest in a liminal space between living and dying until I figure shit out.

I apologize for how long this turned out to be, I’m just exhausted and feeling hopeless.

Is it even worth it to try to finish my degree?",1634601818,1,0

stem will be the death of me,"im writing this because i’m at the end of my rope and about to absolutely lose it. 

im a transfer student at this school (from one four year to here after my freshman year). i thought i was hot shit leaving the other university with a 3.9 gpa (worked my ass off for that) and thought that i was gonna be fine here. 

WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME THAT THE STEM DEPARTMENT HATES EVERY LIVING BEING??

granted, chemistry is generally unkind and i am well aware of the required work that goes into being successful in higher level science classes. with that being said, this school has been nothing but unkind and almost spiteful in a way when i say that this is absolutely ridiculous. the other 4 year school i attended was private and had its prestige in the sciences as well but at least they wanted their students to have some degree of success for their future. it feels like you have to be an absolute genius to be successful here and given the circumstances i SIMPLY AM NOT. i work ridiculously hard to get the mediocre grades i do, and yet i still feel completely looked over by every single professor on this campus. 

tonight i wish i hadn’t left the other school. i left because the social sphere there was awful and i thought perhaps a bigger school would be better. in that respect it has been, but my interest in the sciences has been nothing but thrown into the bin because the stem department seems to make it their dying wish to have students work ridiculously hard for so very little in return. i miss my old professors that actually cared about us. i miss the academic advisors who told me actually helpful information when i came in upset about a bad grade. i miss everything about it right now solely because i have lost all of my passion for chemistry which has undoubtedly been one of my favorite things to learn about since high school.

i just want to feel cared about for more than the money that i owe this institution very semester.

Giving the University Administration Feedback,"\*warning: mentions of suicide and death

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all, 

I’ve seen a lot of discussion on here surrounding the recent loss of UNC students to suicide: how the university has addressed it and where they’ve been lacking. 

I sent an email last night regarding how the suicides have been addressed – or how they haven’t – to the following people:

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs (Amy Johnson),

Executive Director for Campus Health (Kenneth Pittman), 

Dean of Students (Desirée Rieckenberg), 

Director for Counseling and Psychological Services (Allen O’Barr),

Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz. 

I expressed that I thought the university hasn’t directly addressed the suicides. They were mentioned in passing in the email about World Mental Health Day on October 10. If you didn’t read carefully, you could’ve missed it. It’s troubling that we get information through Reddit and crime logs because the university doesn’t provide it. These tragedies were publicized and widely reported in the media. There has been no effort from the university to make a memorial or organize any event to acknowledge and honor the lives we lost, so students have stepped in. (On a positive note, that has been amazing and heartwarming to see.) It seems that there was a quick pivot by the university to giving resources and emphasizing mental health without ever mentioning what actually happened to make those resources so critical at this time: the loss that the community suffered and the grief and trauma that people are experiencing.

Today, finally, in the Chancellor’s email, the deaths and suicides are acknowledged. In the future, as in the past, I am advocating for less “spin” and more direct communication, fewer euphemisms and more forthrightness.

I was pleased (and surprised) to receive a quick response from the office of the Executive Director for Campus Health, Kenneth Pittman. I know from talking to many around me that others have similar feelings to mine and may feel comforted to send an email, too. In a situation where we feel we can do so little, we will have done something by communicating to the university leadership what we are feeling, how the tragedy affected us and what our expectations are. We can only hope from there that the university hears us and responds more quickly and honestly to any such situation in the future.",1634341553,1,0

Study abroad or be on campus last semester of senior year?,Hey everyone just looking to get some input on studying abroad my final semester of my senior year. I was a transfer student and then COVID happened so I haven’t actually got to be on campus yet and I feel like I’ve missed out on the “college experience”. Spring semester would be my last chance to finally be on campus and see what UNC is like but I also want to study abroad before I graduate and I feel like it is the last chance I’ll ever get to go abroad and live in another country for a few months. Is being on campus a must have experience or is it not really that great? I feel like this upcoming semester would be my last chance to finally make some new friends and even to network and make connections which seems important before graduating but I’ve always wanted to study abroad and I’m not sure if I’ll have another opportunity to do so. Just looking for some input on whether being on campus is worth missing out on the chance to go abroad? Thanks everyone!,1634272337,1,0

The Catch-22 of wanting to make new friends,"This is my first on-campus semester as a transfer student, and as an awkward, introverted, self-described “weird girl” I’ve (unsurprisingly) made a grand total of zero friends so far this semester. Sometimes I see groups of people walking together on campus or sitting in the dining hall and wish that I had a group of friends. But on the other hand, being a non-traditional student who’s probably 10+ years older than most of the people in my classes, I can’t help but feel like I shouldn’t even be trying to make friends in the first place, like it’s not appropriate. I keep going back and forth in my head between telling myself that it’s fine and I don’t need friends, but then also feeling increasingly alienated from campus and from people in general. I always assume that most people wouldn’t like me (and/or would have nothing in common with me) even if we did start talking, so what’s the point of trying to reach out to people (even if I weren’t actively terrified of talking to new people)? I’ve almost posted these same thoughts here on Reddit a handful of times in the last few weeks, but honestly I don’t even feel like it’s my place to be trying to join into discussions here, either. It just feels like I desperately do not belong here (“here” being UNC in general), and I’m less and less sure how to deal with that.",1634269190,1,0
