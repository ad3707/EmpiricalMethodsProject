Can we put an end to the hostility over Gabbi Sharp?,"I don't get why this has been overblown for many days or why people keep posting screenshots of what her supporters are saying over Twitter. Why does it matter? Why is it necessary to stoop to their level and be bullies? I would honestly like to recall Gabbi from office and move on from this.

**Gabbi made prejudiced tweets and should be removed from office as she does not properly represent the interests of the student body. However, making hateful comments about her in retaliation is not okay. Both statements can be true at the same time.** As stated in /u/Royal_Estimate_4871's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pu9rov/maintaining_civility_respect_during_the_recall/
) yesterday, the objective is simply to remove her from office.

There have been posts on this subreddit accusing Gabbi of being a segregationist, making fun of her appearance in racist ways, and using racially charged language towards her. Her supporters are being immature on Twitter, but IMO /r/berkeley is far from innocent.

Clubs that dont have applications,"Seeing a lot of (totally justified) annoyance and malaise about club rejections and thought it might be nice to compile a thread of cool clubs that aren't exclusionary and don't require an app. Bonus points if the club's leadership structure is democratic.

Two that I know well (and that im lowkey plugging ;)) are CHAOS (Cal Hiking and Outdoors Society) and PsySci (Psychedelic Science at Berkeley). CHAOS has strong claims to being both the oldest and largest club and meet weekly at La Val's (Weds@19.30, chaosberkeley.org). PsySci is a pretty new club and meets weekly at the Brugmanisa bench (Tues@7, psychedelicscience.org). Both are completely democratic (all students can become members who can vote for officers in annual elections)

URAP and Clubs as a Freshman?,"Hey everyone!

I recently was accepted to a URAP project.¬† For context, I am a freshman, which is why I wanted to ask this sub your thoughts on whether I should sign the learning contract or not.

If you could answer any or all of the questions I had below, I would really appreciate it!

1. I am not yet sure what field/major I want to pursue, and I was planning to use my initial semesters at Berkeley to make the decision.¬† As a result, it is possible that this project may not relate to the major I eventually choose.  Even though this may be the case, do you think it would be a good experience for me to get involved with the project just to learn how research works and how to conduct it (as my responsibilities would heavily comprise of surveys, networking, and data collection)?

2. Do you think the project will help build my job and/or grad school resume?¬† As I said, the project may not pertain to the major I eventually choose, so I am wondering if getting some research experience early on, even if it is not major-specific, will be beneficial.

3. All URAP participants are obligated to work on the project for the semester they sign on for - but many stay on for much longer.¬† As my goals may change drastically after first semester, do you think dropping the project at the end of the semester, if I want to at that time, is advisable or acceptable, or could it cause any issues?

4. The weekly time commitment is 3-5 hours.¬† Do you think adding this on to a 15-unit schedule is fine for a first-semester student, or should I wait until next semester or beyond?

5. I am trying out for a club (the tryouts process began before I found out about the research position).¬† The club meets weekly and requires a weekly time commitment of a few hours.¬† Should I do both if I am accepted or not?

6. If I drop the club after I am accepted, would that blacklist me from trying out in the future, or do clubs generally not care if you turn down a spot?

Thank you so much!",1631484369,1,0

For anyone feeling down about getting rejected from clubs,"I saw a post earlier about people feeling down about club rejections and kind of wanted to give some advice. First it's important to acknowledge that it's ok to feel disheartened after getting rejected and here's why. 

It hurts because they're rejecting you based on who you are, which hurts more than other sorts of application where you're either rejected because of lack of accomplishments or requirements. 

Now with that said, fuck the clubs here. I think it's absolutely stupid how serious a lot them take themselves. And you shouldn't take to heart what a couple young 20 year olds think about you, there's millions of other people who will take the time to know and appreciate who you are. All these ""exclusive"" clubs do is make judgemental assumptions of who they think you are based on only spending a short time period with you, and trust me, you don't wanna be friends with those type of people anyways.

I know what you're thinking, what does this guy know? I'm a little older than most Cal students and have been to a lot of uni's. Every club I've joined at other universities have welcomed me with open arms and have taken the time to know me, and a lot of those people are still some of my best friends. Take the time to find those communities here at Cal and tell yourself that these ""clubs"" can go right on and fuck off with their pretentiousness. :)

I am tired of exhausting myself to achieve what my peers achieve with minimal effort.,"Before I say anything, here‚Äôs an obligatory ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anyone‚Äôs story and they could be struggling behind the scenes‚Äù. Okay.

I am pre-med juggling a difficult course-load and I‚Äôm afraid to talk about my disability and associated struggles. Medicine is a very ‚Äúsurvival of the fittest‚Äù career track; I don‚Äôt want anyone doubting my capability to be a doctor. Even though I know my firsthand experience as a patient is invaluable to my career, it‚Äôs hard to see it that way when all my pre-med peers tend to infantilize the disabled.

But the truth is that I am chronically ill and I am exhausted. I have chronic fatigue because my body has to overwork itself to compensate for its own dysfunction. I constantly have to ration energy just to perform basic tasks. My housemates make fun of me for being lazy or sleeping often, and I go along with this joke to avoid the embarrassment of admitting ‚ÄúI have to do that because I‚Äôm disabled‚Äù. Because when it comes down to it, I‚Äôm a very driven student and I don‚Äôt want my peers to think less of me because I got dealt a shitty hand of genetics.

On top of physical disabilities, I also have raging ADHD that makes it difficult to stay on task, so assignments take longer for me than my classmates‚Äîgreat for the imposter syndrome. I‚Äôm registered with DSP, I go to study groups, I go to office hours, I do all of the right things.

So I‚Äôm planning on taking NUSCTX 11 and UGBA 135 for Spring 2022 semester. I have two questions:

2.	I‚Äôm honestly curious to learn more about personal finance and as such, plan on taking UGBA 135. Any tips for proceeding? I would say that I have a pretty solid  - albeit basic - understanding of financial concepts/terminology.

Harsh Realities of Being a Transfer Student?,"Hello everyone, 

I‚Äôm set to transfer out of my community college by the end of the regular school year in May and as a result I‚Äôve been shooting out applications to schools who are willing to accept my credits (mainly 4-year state schools in CA since i‚Äôm from the state). And in an effort to make sure i‚Äôm a good fit to said schools I reached out to numerous alumni from multiple campuses mainly Berkeley asking for a cold truth, nothing held back anecdotes/advice before making any big decisions. 

One conversation of note was my old high school physics teacher, who mentored me through my Junior and Senior years of HS in addition to coaching my team in a STEM competition. He gave me a (what I think at least) pretty honest rundown that went around the lines of ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big school, teachers are pretty ruthless and cutthroat because of it, city is pretty boring and depressing especially as you go deeper into the winter months, and since you‚Äôre gonna come in late any hopes in joining one of the labs such as BAIR are very grim.‚Äù And sorta went on and on about the negatives of attending Cal. I don‚Äôt know if he was being extra hard on me since we‚Äôve grown our relationship over the years and knows I can both appreciate and accept a tough reality in addition to wanting to complete the same major as he did (Mechanical Engineering) but that‚Äôs just how he put it. And before I get any comments about how ‚Äúhe just had a bad experience‚Äù I should mention that he personally loved attending Cal and even got an autograph from Jared Goff and gave tours. However he sidebars it by prefacing that ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt for everyone, it‚Äôs not like Stanford or Harvard where you can really get to know the professors in a tight net community with your peers, it‚Äôs faceless and doesn‚Äôt have a lot of sympathy for those who fall behind.‚Äù 

Anyways that‚Äôs really the gist of it. As mentioned above I‚Äôd appreciate a no bullshit approach to my intentions of joining all of you on campus someday, but in order to do that I‚Äôll need an informed opinion on what exactly i‚Äôm sticking my feet into‚Ä¶

How does EE126 + EE127 + EE120 + CS170 sound ._.,"I know it is an unreasonable workload. I'm thinking about which one I'm letting go to learn the rest better. For my case, I'm a transfer on my 2nd junior semester so I don't have much time left. Should I move some of these classes into my final year?

Discussing challenges with a course with professors.,"I'm a student at Cal with bipolar disorder, and this semester I've been dealing with a severe depression. The result has been that in one of my classes I've missed four homework assignments, and much of our assigned (but ungraded) readings. Only two of the four homework assignments will be graded, since we get two drops. And, I've been communicating with my professor so far, so they are aware of my DSP status, my academic accommodations (including extended deadlines for homework). 

I've been getting better, thanks to medication changes and a lot of additional therapy, but it's been a slow process, and I might still be impacted by the episode for a few more weeks. 

When I'm not in an episode, I'm able to work just fine: I like the content of the course I'm taking, and have the requisite study skills to keep up in the course. I also believe that, if I get better within the next few weeks, I will be able to catch back up in the content I've missed so far. 

So, I'd like to schedule a meeting with my professor to talk a little bit more in depth about these issues, but I'm not sure exactly what to do / say. 

For one, I don't want to sound like I'm making excuses: I take full responsibility for my illness and don't want any handouts‚Äîwhen I'm feeling better I'm willing to do all the work necessary to catch up. 

Also, I don't want to go too much into depth into the specific nature of what I've been dealing with because (a) there is a potential for stigma, and (b) there are restrictions on what a professor is able to ask students about related to disability, and disclosing disabilities to professors can sometimes put them in uncomfortable situations they don't want to be in.

**If you've found yourself in a similar situation, would you mind sharing what you did, what your experiences where, and what you might do differently in the future?** 

What did you say to your professor? What type of class was it for? How did they react? Have you every tried to request an alternate grading format, such as a project to make up for missed assignments?

This class is a math class, if that matters.",1634580379,1,0

I played clarinet in high school, and I'm getting back into it. I was wondering how competitive it was to get into these two groups. I would expect the orchestra to be extremely difficult to get into because of the number of seats available as a clarinetist in an orchestra.

I was wondering if the majority of people in these music ensembles are music majors practicing their instrument professionally or are they also students like me just interested in playing in an ensemble again. I'd be awesome if I could ask some questions from someone in one of these ensembles right now too!",1633492118,3,0

Typical INFJ social problem,"We all have social issues. As a typical INFJ, I am always obssessed with searching for my soul mates, those who I can personally and emotionally connect and establish a deep, meaningful relationship with. I won't easily allow people to come inside my boundary.

Applying as a Transfer with a GED,"Hello everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

In an effort to keep this brief I was a screw-up in high school and subsequently dropped out. I later got my GED and finally enrolled in a California community college. I'm doing pretty well for myself (3.9 GPA plus some decent extracurriculars) but now it's application time and since I've always dreamed of becoming an engineer I've made an active effort to become a Golden Bear majoring in MechE. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, I've always caught flack for my GED for things like jobs, and now that I'm applying to 4-years it's come out in full force from people like my guidance councilors. So here I am asking if anyone is going to actually ask, the transfer page only says that they look at work from the previous two years, but in the event I do indeed have to talk about it do I just have to swallow my pride and talk about how much of a fucking dufus I was back then or what? The person in high school and the person applying now are two different people now and I can clearly and concisely explain that to them but if it all is in vain I don't know if I should bother to put in all the effort, especially with my major of choice.

My car got towed on a game day and I got double my money back,"If your car got towed on a game day, you might be able to get double your $220 tow fee back like I did.

I was stupid to park on a game day tow zone a couple weeks ago. In my defense, I had parked 150 feet from the sign. I'm appealing the ticket from the city for that reason. My car got towed by this company called Avenue-Berkeley tow, and I picked it up from a UC Berkeley lot on Bancroft but was required to pay a tow company $220 to release my car.

The tow company actually so sloppily filled out my itemized receipt that they didn't put down my address, location of the tow, and vehicle identification, or anything besides my name, DL number, or me paying the $220. Something wasn't right, they didn't even have business cards when I asked for one.

I looked up the California Vehicle code, and  California Vehicle Code Section¬†22651.07(g) states that,  


&gt;(g)‚ÄÇ‚ÄúItemized invoice,‚Äù as used in this section, means a written document that contains the following information. ‚ÄÇAny document that substantially complies with this subdivision shall be deemed an ‚Äúitemized invoice‚Äù for purposes of this section:  
&gt;  
&gt;(1)‚ÄÇThe name, address, telephone number, and carrier identification number as required by subdivision (a) of Section 34507.5 of the person that is charging for towing and storage.  
(2)‚ÄÇIf ascertainable, the registered owner or operator's name, address, and telephone number.  
(3)‚ÄÇThe date service was initiated.  
(4)‚ÄÇThe location of the vehicle at the time service was initiated, including either the address or nearest intersecting roadways.  
(5)‚ÄÇA vehicle description that includes, if ascertainable, the vehicle year, make, model, odometer reading, license plate number, or if a license plate number is unavailable, the vehicle identification number (VIN).  
(6)‚ÄÇThe service dispatch time, the service arrival time of the tow truck, and the service completion time.  
(7)‚ÄÇA clear, itemized, and detailed explanation of any additional services that caused the total towing-related service time to exceed one hour between service dispatch time and service completion time.  
(8)‚ÄÇThe hourly rate or per item rate used to calculate the total towing and recovery-related fees. ‚ÄÇThese fees shall be listed as separate line items.  
(9)‚ÄÇIf subject to storage fees, the daily storage rate and the total number of days stored. ‚ÄÇThe storage fees shall be listed as a separate line item. ‚ÄÇStorage rates shall comply with the requirements of subdivision (c) of Section 22524.5 ([https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/vehicle-code/veh-sect-22651-07.html](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/vehicle-code/veh-sect-22651-07.html))

 

California Vehicle Code ¬ß 22651.07(k) states: ""A person \[business entity under¬† who violates this section is civilly liable to a registered or legal owner of the vehicle, or a registered owner's insurer, for up to two times the amount charged. ‚ÄÇLiability in any action brought under this section shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500) per vehicle.""¬†[https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/vehicle-code/veh-sect-22651-07.html](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/vehicle-code/veh-sect-22651-07.html)

I emailed the tow company and requested double the amount back, cited these laws, and promised to take them to small claims court if they didn't comply. They will be sending me back a check for $440.

Traveling queer couple looking for temp place to crash and fun host in Bay Area for trip,"Hello there, lovely creatures and fellow cosmic monsters of the bay. I hope everyone is having a wonderful day. I'll be traveling to the Bay area and staying there with my wife for a bit. Last year I made a similar post on here, and thanks to said post AND the kindness of a few strangers (we, unfortunately, lost touch with), had one of the loveliest times out in the bay. I am 23 years young, as is my wife.

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Shane (trans ftm) and my fiance (girl) and I are traveling to SF around the end of January for my 24th birthday. We'll probably be landing in Oakland or SF around February or the end of January. We are also looking for a fun place to crash for very cheap, in exchange for us to cook, in exchange for art, share stories, music, or whatever you'd like. We're both flying from Miami and would prefer someone who is LGBT friendly, open to Polyamory, etc. We're both very young artists and hope to meet many like-minded individuals. Housing doesn't have to be for all the days we're here. What we can offer: Our friendship, a wondrous time, some money, the ability to cook some amazing meals and clean, 4/20, cultural exchange, knowledge of Santeria, design your logo, I can teach you how to play guitar, we can do chores, play you music, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

We'd also absolutely love to have someone show us around, preferably someone who is a lot of fun, queer, and also 4/20 friendly. We want to really explore around this time around since everything is a lot more open than it was during our last trip to California. We really want to get down and get to know San Francisco for it's local glory and culture. Maybe explore some of the local venues, queer scene, spiritual scene, local punk and overall local music scene. We also really would love to meet someone kind, and fun that we actually get along with (we had the fortune of doing so last year with a few souls and the experience was beautiful).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A little insight: We are both polyamorous, I'm trans (FTM), she's genderqueer but identifies mostly as a cis female. I'm a musician, she works for a movie prop and film company (works on preparing props, helping film music videos, helping film commercials, etc). We are both notorious art pigeons LOL I'm a writer, creator, and we both love anything nature, we're both spiritual (I'm a witch, born into Santeria), we love going to shows, camping, exploring, activism, we're both very adventurous, fun, etc. We also ove to explore. Email us if you'd like to meet while we are down there or get to know us!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A little more about us: My name is Shane, I'm 23, Cuban, a musician, a writer, excellent cook, trans (FTM), androgynous, going to local music showsshows, pansexual, love philosophy, food, skating, sightseeing, plants, spirituality, traveling, love music, doodling, playing guitar, reading, couchsurfing, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Diana is my wife who is also 23, Ecuadorian but born in the US, Pansexual, works for the theater (collaborating sets and whatnot), loves painting with watercolors, planting, Silent Hill, designing, drawing, cheesy horror films, sightseeing, writing, and just having a grand time. This would be her second time in San Francisco.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S WE BOTH SPEAK SPANISH AND ENGLISH

"Respectfully, fuck EECS 16B","As if people didn't have enough reasons to shit on Sahai's version of the class...

Now we have a 12 page, 15 hour homework assignment due in the middle of dead week.

Hey dipshit, if 90% of the student body is out here doing the minimum 30% on homework assignments and relying on resubmissions, maybe you're not teaching adequately or assigning unreasonably burdensome amounts of boring ass homework. If you have to set up a ""discipline bonus"" for kids to show up and get through all your course materials and most kids STILL can't keep up and give up on the bonus... maybe you're trying to force too much useless content down our throats.

I can assure you most students have more productive things to do with their time dead week than do this fucking homework. Like study for the final. Or study for other finals. Or even just take a moment to breathe, because this school is suffocating and I can't wait to be an alumnus so Berkeley doesn't see a CENT of donations while I'm thriving in my career.

We only have one life,"I‚Äôm typing this after watching a video of someone who dropped out of college because he knew he wasn‚Äôt doing what he wanted to do in life.

I feel like the only way I can be respected and not feel left behind is by getting a summer internship but being trapped in a 9-5 during a college summer when you have the rest of your life to work feels idiotic. 
I honestly just want to cook for the rest of my life, it‚Äôs what I love doing but it sucks because I feel like I can‚Äôt do it when I have a million dollar opportunity right in front of me (getting a cs degree at Berkeley).

you‚Äôre doing great :),"hi all, recent alum here. tis final season of course and i‚Äôm seeing a lot (understandably!) stress-induced posts here. i just wanted to be a positive force for you all to tell you, you are doing great. 

berkeley is an incredibly tough, rigorous environment. it personally brought myself and many of my close friends to their breaking point (a whole other topic). however, i can promise you, berkeley is not a reflection of your work ethic or your self, it is a reflection of how well you can do under extreme pressure, which for many people is not so great. 

for the people that are questioning whether a grade for a final or declaring a major will make or break your career, i really promise it won‚Äôt. as someone who failed/retook a class while an undergrad and had a generally not-super-great gpa and now is currently extremely happy with their post-grad job and lifestyle, i promise that life will proceed after graduation. college is not the end-all-be-all. life continues to grow and change with experience overtime and is hardly set in stone with your college major. 

just, try to be kind to yourself, the same kindness you would give to a friend or another loved one.  i wish i had been more kind to myself while i was and undergrad, it would have made life so much easier. sending you all as many good vibes and love as possible, please have a lovely and restful winter break &lt;3",1639812856,1,0

Proud of You All,"Happy winter break everyone! Nice job finishing out your first semester back in Berkeley. I know it was tough for many of us, so that‚Äôs all the more reason to be proud. Now it‚Äôs time to catch up on sleep, if you can. 

The end of finals week often brings with it a mix of euphoria and dread, so I just wanted to wish you all the best of luck on getting whatever grades you are aiming for. That being said, do me a favor and take a deep breath right now. Your side of the equation is finished and you‚Äôve done all you can do. Now we play the waiting game ‚Äì a dreadful game for many, I know ‚Äì of getting our grades back. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs easy, but please try to remember that your grade is ultimately out of your hands now and that you should try not to stress too much about it. I promise you‚Äôll suffer more in anticipation than you will from the actual result. 

And when it comes time and you do get the result, know that it doesn‚Äôt define you. (That‚Äôs true if you get an A, an F, or anything in between). You are much more than a little letter or number could possibly sum up, be it good or bad. And despite our best efforts, the world will keep spinning. We can‚Äôt go back and change what has happened, but we can do our best to try something different in the future. Sure, it might not succeed there either, but nobody can knock you for trying. All we can ever do is try ‚Äì at some point the rest is out of our hands.

Congratulations to those of you who are graduating! Enjoy the, um, festivities of life in 2021. You have a lot to look forward to. I mean that only half sarcastically. Try to keep your head up and do what you can to keep yourself happy. We‚Äôre in for one hell of a future so you might as well do your best to enjoy it. Similar to the message above, though, remember that we are seldom defined by this period of your life. You will likely have plenty of time in the future to make ‚Äúthe big decisions‚Äù, so don‚Äôt stress too much about them now. Take your problems day by day and try to grab onto small things to keep you happy. Also, importantly, keep close to the friends you‚Äôve made here (or reach out to acquaintances now while it‚Äôs still less awkward). It‚Äôs extremely difficult to make friends in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù right now, and those connections will help tons. Try to figure out people you can meet up with wherever you wind up in the world. And if it‚Äôs your speed, set up a discord channel so you can hang out and watch movies, play games, or just generally keep in touch.

I know that for many, this break might bring with it a bit of pain. It can be a difficult time of year in the best of times, and this is not the best of times. If you‚Äôre ever feeling down at all over this break, please reach out to a friend. Or make a post here; there are many more friendly faces than it might first seem. You could also look at u/bewallcal ‚Äòs post history (or the official UHS website) to see what resources the school is offering. Some resources will not be available at points during the break, so it‚Äôs good to plan ahead if you think you‚Äôll need something.

Again, I am extremely proud of anyone that is reading this. We‚Äôve made it through a tough two years, and while we may not be out of the tunnel by any means, it‚Äôs still important to take a breather and realize what we‚Äôve accomplished. So please enjoy this break to the best of your abilities, and I‚Äôll see you all in January. 

Wishing you all the best,",1639807329,1,0

I love my major and I'm passionate about it, but it's off-putting when I look at my grades at the end of the day and they're consistently below Bs. It doesn't bother me to the point where I would change my major, but it does make me feel like maybe I'm too stupid for the academic rigor at Berkeley. I know it's supposed to be tough here, but it seems like everyone around me is so smart and capable.

Yes, I'm aware that in 10 years, college GPA will be irrelevant, and yes, I'm aware that it would be wrong to abandon my passion solely because I'm not a good test taker, but it really do be demoralizing out here.

Very specific citation question for essay - not sure where else to ask,"I'm an English major with an essay due today. It's done, ofc, but I am running into a wall with a citation problem. I've been to office hours, I've asked around, and I'm still stuck.

I have a quote as a hook at the very beginning of my essay:

Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, ""fiction reveals truth that reality obscures"".

It hung in my high school on posters in my English classrooms, it's been in books of famous quotes, and I've found countless results for it on Google listing Emerson as the originator. But nobody seems to be able to tell me where it actually came from. A speech? A book? An essay? Something he shouted to a friend in passing on a random Sunday afternoon? 

The last thing in the world I want to do is accidentally plagiarize, and it's in there that EMERSON, not I, said those words. I just have no idea how to add a citation or footnote with the original source if I cannot find the original source. Do I even need to add anything more? Am I totally overthinking this?

Any fellow English majors (or really, anyone in the Humanities who's dealt with something like this) know what to do here? The whole essay strongly connects to that quote, so I don't want to scrap it, but how the heck do I cite it?",1637782713,1,0

Hello from NZ! A Research Query - On Privacy,"Hello everyone.

I'm an undergraduate University student based in Auckland, New Zealand. I'm currently undertaking research in the intersecting areas of Law, Software, Information Security, Privacy, Data, and Digitial Identity management - to discover problems linked to exposure of personal information and personal privacy.

In particular, I'm keen to hear your experiences around controlling your privacy online, as well as the management and protection of your personal information, data, and identities/accounts. I'm eager to look at these problems through a behavioural lens and dive into how we can mitigate privacy exposure via changes in human behaviour (rather than merely tweaking settings across services you use or switching to alternative software platforms).

Ultimately, this may eventuate to the creation of a platform that helps you learn about privacy and security best practices and create a tailored, fine-tuned privacy behaviour framework to meet your privacy goals (i.e. to create privacy-centric habits that endure). However, the format and content of the platform are TBD as this research exercise will quantify the areas of development/curriculum we should prioritise. As a part of this research, I'm keen to hear the perspectives on the following questions from US-based students:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is your personal privacy (in online and offline life) something you regularly think about ? If so, why?
2. Have you considered the potential risks associated with apathy towards the management of your privacy?
3. What is the biggest problem you've experienced while managing your privacy?
4. Why/why would you not consider yourself a privacy-conscious individual?
5. How do you currently manage your personal privacy risk? (or why aren't you?)
6. Do you regularly check in on the exposure of your personal information online? (or why you don't)
7. Are you aware of the extent of the exposure of your personal information online?
8. What are the highest friction (most difficult) steps you've taken towards the management of your privacy? And, what are the highest friction steps you want to take in the future?
9. What actions do you plan to do in the future to mitigate exposure of your personal information online?
10. Do you feel personally confident to assess and mitigate exposure of your personal information online? Or, would you prefer to be assisted in the assessment and mitigation process?

&amp;#x200B;

If you're keen to chat about this, feel free to connect to tell your experiences. Please reach out via PM, and we can talk; or, feel free to comment on your experiences below. Also, let me know if you know anyone else who may be keen to answer these research questions or help out with the platform's development.

Thank you so much!

Should I apply for EECS or L&amp;S as a transfer?,"I'm apply for a Computer Science transfer this week from a California community college.

So now I'm planning to apply for EECS. I noticed that EECS doesn't accept IGETC whereas L&amp;S requires and accepts IGETC. So, would all the GE's I've taken still transfer over, or would all those credits go to waste?

An open letter to a professor who was deeply hurtful,"This incident happened 2 months ago but I'm still angry.  There's a lot of things I wish I could say out loud but I can't. I obviously can't be specific about the incident or person. I just need a place to vent.  

To a professor:

I don't know why you decided to be so hurtful.

I'm now about to graduate but I met you during your office hours the first week of my freshman year 3 years ago. You are one of the biggest names in your field (STEM, can't say anymore)- it was unbelievable that I had the opportunity to ask you questions, that you knew my name. You told me I was a great student, that you were really impressed with my academic curiosity- it meant something to hear one of the biggest names in my field say that to me, a first-generation undergrad from a tiny rural town. I was honored. Over the years, I took other classes with you. You were one of the few professors I stayed in touch with. I asked you for advice. You were a fantastic mentor. 

And then suddenly in just one week this semester, it changed- the situation that came up is too specific for me to reveal but it started with a simple question. Maybe your ego was offended-I had treated you like any other faculty member/professor in asking that question? But beyond that, I don't know what made you so mad. I've asked people to absolutely confirm I did nothing wrong- there's just nothing I could have done to justify this. 

You started to gaslight me. You tried to make me doubt myself again and again- you tried to convince me that I was almost troubled? Like I would have some kind of nervous, stressed overwhelmed breakdown. It didn't work- it might have in normal situations but you tried to get me to doubt the one thing in the world I have more pride in than anything. No one could have gotten me to doubt myself on that. I stood my ground. And when that didn't work, you pulled the rug from underneath- and took two of the most important things I have at Cal from me. And you did so in the most hurtful way possible- did you have to kick me while I was already down?

I feel like a fool and so manipulated. You analyzed my words to a ridiculous level and constructed the narrative you wanted from them. 

The worst part is you guaranteed I feel all alone in this. You were careful. Without context, it just looks like you are a faculty member concerned for a troubled student. except I'm not troubled and you are certainly not concerned. With context, your behavior was appalling. Without context, the thing you took seems really small- but it has particular meaning to me. I have absolutely zero evidence you did anything wrong. And you didn't break any university rules. You were just hurtful and petty. 

You constructed the perfect image. All your students love you. You recently won a teaching award- I nominated you for it before all this, though I certainly wasn't the only one. And while you are celebrated by the university, your school, and your students for the rest of your career, I have to wonder why you chose to take out your sheep's clothing just for me. And for what? I said nothing, did nothing to you. 

I doubt even Reddit would believe me if I told them who you are. 

I wish I could just tell you how hurtful you were - maybe I could get you to recognize that your words and actions matter. And it matters even more when you are in a position of power, a position of influence. But I'm scared of you. You used my words as a weapon in your arsenal, and tossed them out when they couldn't fit your gaslighting.  So I don't want to give you more of my words to use. And you are one of the most powerful people on campus- I don't think you care enough to take the time for retribution, but of course- I don't know you. 

You aren't worth my tears, my energy. I know it's not a big deal. You are just some professor, , this will make no impact on my life. At first, you shook my belief in others and myself. But when I confided in others the kindness, and compassion I believe have only given me more belief in kindness. I'm even less of a cynic now :) .

And I'm never going to be scared of those in positions of power after this- if I can take this crap from you, I can handle anyone. 

Sincerely,

A student, a human being with emotions. Maybe during the pandemic, you forgot that zoom boxes and email addresses actually have a person with feelings with them. 

A reminder to all of you here: you learn from the top researchers/professors in the country. But nothing matters more than how a faculty member treats those with less power than him/her, when no one will hold him/her accountable. Their stature doesn't matter, their research doesn't matter, their ""legend"" status doesn't matter, their awards don't 'matter. Respect is earned only, only through your moral code and how you treat individuals around you. Don't hold a lower bar for integrity for the accomplished or famous.",1637726402,1,0

Deciding between CS 61C and Math 110 for next semester,"I'll be taking ECON 1, a foreign lang. class, and possibly 16B next semester - in addition to an english class at community college to finish my R1B requirement. 

I was thinking of adding either 61C or Math 110 to my schedule next semester. As someone who wants to primarily go into Data Science but would also like to keep SWE as an option, which class would benefit me the most taken at this time? 

I want to double in ORMS so Math 110 is a requirement for it, and also linear algebra is super important for DS. I also wanna take one of Data 102/EECS 127/CS 182/189 in Fa22. However, I am thinking that taking 61C + one of the above would be pretty rough. I also don't wanna delay 61C too long (esp if I'm not able to declare CS since there are reserved seats for undeclared ppl but not non-CS majors), and I wanna be able to take classes like CS 186/162/161 without having to take 61C concurrently and/or studying that over summer/winter break. 

If I'm not able to crack CS 70, I won't be taking 16B next semester. In that case, would ECON 1 + 61C + Math 110 + foreign-lang + english-at-cc be realistically doable (while being able to do extracurriculars / recruit effectively)?",1637698968,1,0

"[2 year update] Didn't declare CS, really fucking scared about my future","original post: https://redd.it/edk6vu  

Almost 2 years ago, I made a post on here panicking that my dreams of being a software engineer were shattered because I failed to declare the CS major at berkeley. I was extremely depressed and even borderline suicidal during this time in my life; it was truly rock bottom for months and I was the lowest I had ever been in my life. 

Im happy to report that since then, I was able to land 2 software engineering internships at a decently large company, and have just now signed a new grad SWE offer at a very large tech company (many would categorize it as FAANG/Big-N).  

I honestly don't believe that being a DS major has had any significant or noticeable handicap on my ability to recruit for SWE roles, and I experienced pretty decent response/OA rates, especially after my first internship and once I became a junior.   

I'm not writing this to brag or flex or look for any sort of validation.   

I'm writing this for the many students who are probably going through the same thing that sophomore year me went through: a long stretch of stressful, uncertain, depressing, and agonizing thoughts of self-perceived failure as they become traumatized by the idea that they won't be able to declare the CS major.  

There absolutely still is a future for you in SWE and in the tech industry in general; 3 classes do not determine your ability to shine as a productive and valued software engineer. 

As long as you follow the traditional advice that's been regurgitated a million times all over the place (grind leetcode, do projects, get internships, etc.), you will be absolutely fine as a DS major. 

If I can ease the anxiety, fear, and depression of even one Berkeley student reading this post, then I will consider it a success.",1637639669,1,0

"Course review: Physics 7B, CS 61B, EECS 16A","Overall, the semester went alright for me, but it certainly helped me realize that I don't like the EE part of EECS. The workload was quite small for all these classes, but if I were to do it again, I would seriously study for the classes I disliked by not procrastinating. Hindsight is a bitch, huh? Anyway, on with the reviews:

**Physics 7B with Lanzara**: 3/10

Even beyond the shit show with final exams and grades, this class was disappointing. Lectures were prerecorded and quite boring. Highly recommend reading the textbook instead. Labs were definitely the best part‚Äîmake sure you go to them! They're actually enjoyable. My GSI was solid, and I think that's generally the case for this class. Content-wise, they stress a lot of math stuff upfront related to multivariable calculus, but it's never tested on the exams, weirdly enough. Exams were straightforward if you were familiar with the material. But they're basically 100% derivation/calculation based, which was kind of shitty. Do past exams to gain familiarity with the format. Mastering physics is a joke in comparison. 

Conclusions/advice: fuck physics, I hate this shit. I don't really have advice other than to actually do practice problems.

**CS 61B with Hilfinger:** 9/10

Probably one of the most enjoyable classes I've taken here (so far). Hilfinger is a true character, but I wouldn't be worried about the class just because of his notoriety. His lectures honestly went over my head half the time, but if you're really on top of the material in advance, you can gain a lot from his perspective. The dude has been here since dinosaurs walked the hills of Berkeley.

But the real place where you learn is assignments. There's an emphasis on making you an independent programmer, which is good, but can be daunting coming from 61A. Labs/homework could take a lot longer than you might expect. **Start early** (although, I suppose this goes for any class)! If you take this opportunity to dive deep into how data structures work, you'll gain a lot. Projects were the best part of this class. Gitlet was definitely worth it for me. But again, **start early!** TA's can only help so many people at a time, so if you want help, you gotta go get it ASAP. Lastly, exams are pretty low stakes in terms of your grade, which is nice. Get all the points on assignments, and you won't have to worry too much about them. 

Conclusions/advice: **start early!** That's literally the key to this class. It's not like 61A where you have to see the matrix during exams to do well. 

**EECS 16A with Ana and Miki: 6/10**

Everyone hates the 16 series, and now I kinda see why. The content skips around, which is confusing, and I'm not really satisfied with how they taught circuits. Lectures are pretty interesting, especially when they talk about their research. Be sure to read the notes and maybe consult proper textbooks for circuits. Labs were very fun in this class, at least for me. It was a cool introduction to EE, but tbh, the class helped me understand I'm not all that into it (and I'm incompetent as hell). I guess this is will be like a drop of heaven compared to 16B, so I can't complain all that much. Exams were very poorly administered though. It was done through Bcourses, and all the questions had no partial credit‚Äîthey were MC and fill-in-the-blank, so the idea was that you could guess and get free points. It was a pretty strange idea to not consider correct reasoning/work towards a solution instead. Bcourses also had the lovely side effect of not loading the exam images properly, so it was an all round bad exam experience. 

Conclusions/advice: the class is what you make of it. Try to enjoy the actual labs though. Building circuits and seeing them work is a good driving force to help you learn how to design/analyze them.

I would go into detail on how she behaves but that‚Äôs another layer to the onion. All this to say, Berkeley is my safe haven. I can be myself, be free, think, be happy, develop positive habits etc. I cannot imagine living with my mother longer than 3 weeks anymore. This feels like the most depressing, brain damaging hell  hole of a winter ‚Äúbreak‚Äù. I know I need to stay in Berkeley or at an internship for the summer . I know I need to get a job after college because I cannot move back home. I miss you Berkeley, thank you for showing me how amazing people, and the world can be.

Seems crazy, right? Why would I pass up the opportunity to get the best CS degree in the world?

**For context, I am an international student from a tiny country.** Statistically speaking, your EECSperience is likely to be way different to mine.

The two classes that sealed the deal for me were, not coincidentally at all, the only two classes with a bona fide curve: 70 and 170. No matter what I did, I just felt that my position on the curve was never going to be a function of my effort because I would always be outshone by the people that know this stuff better.

In fact, the way both those classes are designed with the rounding up of HW score means that if you know your stuff you're basically guaranteed full marks on every HW. And if you don't know your stuff your only option is to leech off of others in OH and/or find a study group of people that do know their stuff. For 70, this feeling was very pronounced because it was all online and I barely knew anyone at Cal. I felt truly alone, and after two weeks I caved and switched to the no-HW option. And despite still attempting some of the questions every week, participating actively in every discussion section, religiously reading notes in advance of lecture, and asking (and answering) questions on Piazza, I would still get outclassed on what mattered most - the exams. 

Everyone just seemed to have something I didn't. Could it be... this so-called ""mathematical maturity""???? Of course it was! The phrase may be a meme but it feels real to me, mainly because of how evidently I lack it. This kind of stuff seems to take years to perfect, and we don't have years when taking these classes. Every time a 70 question would pull a random math trick out of nowhere (like wtf is a triangle inequality?) I would sit there really confused on how they got it. But in truth everyone knew how to do it because it was a question on the 20xx \[insert math olympiad name here\].

My experience in 170 was arguably worse. It was in-person so I could go to OH and I ultimately did find a study group, but I'm not sure any of that helped my alleged impostor syndrome. OH was just a breeding ground for anxiety, not least when many people there weren't even speaking English to each other. As for my study group, I was always the one getting carried and I never felt like I was learning anything. There were to be no points for how many in-person lectures I went to and how many pages of notes I took. In what mattered most - the graded assignments - I had naught. Since everyone was getting full marks on the HW, if I couldn't work it out I would fall massively behind curve-wise. If I did well on an exam, it was likely because it was easy and everyone else did well. And if it was a hard exam, well........ yeah no I had a bad mental breakdown mid-final and got an embarrassingly low score.  I'm glad the class's policy on failing is so generous because in another class I probably would've failed.

I hear you cry: *This is college. Toughen up. You're not going to be the A student you may have been in high school.* True, but there's something about the utter cesspool that Berkeley CS can sometimes be which frightens me. This culture of being the ""best"" or ""only"" major and the constant craving for the outrageously high salaries that SWEs make is getting annoying. And it seems like everyone I know is focused on that track. I have to say I admire people that can truly grind like that, but the gap between myself and everyone else is so wide. The place I grew up in just didn't have enough competitive programming and math opportunities to build up my skills to the level that the average CS student I meet here has. But I suppose this is what you get when you go to the number one university in the world.

Do I feel like I learned something in 70 and 170? Yes, of course. They were good classes that just didn't happen to work out for me. Prof. Nelson is easily the best lecturer I've ever had here. And I don't want to sound like these issues are exclusive to international students and common with all of them. I'm sure I speak for plenty of other underserved minorities in the CS space that may have faced the same barriers to entry that I did. This is a real issue that needs to be tackled, and I'm all for more diversity. 

My schedule for the spring is very varied and unusual, but it's full of things I genuinely like. I really hope I find my place here soon, but what I can confidently say as of now is that it's not in CS.",1640823026,1,0

IND ENG 172 or Stat 134 sufficient for MLDM courses?,I haven't seen much info about this. I can't take Stat 140 since its full so I am currently considering these two classes. I am leaning towards IND ENG 172 as it seems to be a better fit for me and I've heard that Stat 134 is disorganized (not sure if this part is true). Is there a difference in how well 172 vs 134 would prepare one for MLDM courses like Data C102 or IND ENG 142? (those are my two only options). Would taking either of them be fine for these MLDM courses since they accept either 172 or 134?,1640815898,1,0
