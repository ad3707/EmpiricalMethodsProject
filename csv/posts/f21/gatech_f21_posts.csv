congrats - you got out! now find your financial footing...,"Congrats to those who walked this weekend.  The hard part is over (for the most part :)

You're a GT grad, and with that, hopefully comes the financial payday in the form of a rock-solid job offer with great pay and great benefits. For those who didn't learn the basics growing up, just a few pointers to get you started the right way...

In no particular order...

* Emergency fund.  Once you have a groove going and know what your typical monthly expenses are, build an emergency fund that will cover between 3-6 months of those expenses.  This should be in a safe savings vehicle (NOT the stock market) that you build then forget about.  Ok to do it gradually, over 12-24 months, but having an emergency fund is non-negotiable.
* Check your credit report ([annualcreditreport.com](https://annualcreditreport.com) is the government site), get your scores, and take care to never miss a payment on any loan you take out.  Your goal is to get to a FICO score of 720 or higher.
* As soon as you can, get enrolled in your company's 401k (or 403b) plan.  Be sure to contribute enough to get all the company matching dollars - never leave free money on the table.  
* Between your 401k plan and/or an IRA, aim to save at least 15% of your gross salary (not take-home pay) each year by the time you reach your mid- to late- 20s.  If you can't do 15% immediately, gradually work up to it by increasing your savings by 1-2% each year.  \[Won't get into the specifics of pre-tax or after-tax (Roth), but the latter allows you to set aside money after taxes are paid, which means your money grows tax-free, so when you take it out at retirement, no taxes due.\]

Finally, enjoy yourself too!  No need to sacrifice everything for a future that is never promised.  But these early years of saving a little bit of your hard-earned money will benefit you nicely in 40 years when you're looking to retire, not to mention minimizing money stressors over the coming few decades.

My Last Reddit Post 🎓 (at least for now),"Hey folks,

Just dropping a note here to let y'all know that I'll soon be stepping down from my position with SGA...because I'm graduating later today 🥳

Thank you all for working with me over the past seven months to identify things that are broken and finding solutions to a variety of interesting challenges, from microwaves in the Exhibition Hall to on-campus parking regulations. I very much enjoy being a problem-solver, so I've enjoyed every second of this role (even the frustrating parts). You've also helped me demonstrate to other student organizations and departments that concerns and questions can be useful catalysts for change.

When I first started at Tech back in the fall of 2017, it was common practice (at least from my experience working in prior roles) to write off complaints and ideas posted from students on Reddit. While one social media platform isn't really representative of the entire student body, you've all helped me prove to Tech (and SGA) that you can engage directly with students, hear their concerns/questions, and use that feedback to make more responsible decisions. I've always been a big believer that student leaders should go to where students are, and it's my hope that my fellow and future student leaders continue to engage with students more directly, whether on Reddit or through another means.

It's important to me to continue that advocacy work that we've started here, so I'll be working over the next few weeks to transition away from my role and ensure that my successor is set up for even more progress. I'll still be responding to posts, comments, and DMs through next Monday, December 20th at 2pm (and I know I've got some DMs and final advocacy projects to catch up on before then!). If I've been working with you on an idea or advocacy project, I'll connect you with another SGA individual to make sure you can continue to work to improve our community.

Thank you all once again for your continued feedback. Campus Services isn't a perfect department yet, but I can feel quite confident saying that your feedback helped make Tech's services better for all. While this is definitely a bittersweet moment for me, I'm ready for some time away to rest up. I don't know what's next for me just yet (other than lots of sleep), but I've got a feeling this isn't goodbye forever.

I feel like it's impossible to take the time to digest the material with how our courses are structured. Since I'm trying to meet deadlines for assignments nonstop, I end up just getting a shallow understanding of the subject and can't go beneath the surface.

I will graduate in spring 2022.

My boss from company A just told me that he doesn’t know yet whether he will have the budget to hire me full-time in May. On the other hand, I have found company B which wants to hire me part-time for the spring.

Company B is way better than company A, and there is no doubt that they have the budget to convert me to full time. I see myself working long-term for company B but not for company A.

Should I renege on my spring internship? I don’t care about getting banned from careerbuzz/career fairs but I care if GaTech does not validate my CPT with company B.

You do not owe your energy to anyone.,"I was approached in Tech Square by a dude recruiting for that black hammer cult thingy. He said, ""Hi"" and I simply said, ""Excuse me"" and walked off quickly. 

My interaction strategy is classically thought of rude, but I don't think it is, really. You do not owe random people your energy. It is valuable, especially during finals week. Spend your energy on what is important to you. Maybe that's friends, or studying, or projects or some combination thereof. 

I'll watch the Black Hammer cult drama mini-series when it comes out on netflix after the whole thing implodes in conspiracy. That'll satisfy any curiosity I have for them. 

Maybe this perspective comes from the fact that I've got less than a week before I graduate (hopefully). Time feels different now, like I can't waste _any_ time on things that don't help me study or recharge. My last final is probably the hardest I've ever had at this school and I can't help but be angry at random people who accost me and try and waste my time for trivial BS. Why they decided to recruit during finals week, when students are tired, angry, and irritable, I will never know. Anyway, I should probably stop procrastinating and end this post.

Here is some more info from AID Atlanta: ""All volunteers must dress in all black (black jeans are fine). We will have some tables setup in the back for volunteers to check-in &amp; get refreshments.

We Need To Talk About Parking...,"Hi all,

Following the APS graduation parking ticketing fiasco back in May 2021, my team and I conducted a full review of all PTS rules and regulations over the summer semester (or at least the ones that we're written). The more time we spent looking at the rules and regulations, the more questions we had. **The more questions we asked, the more we uncovered about how poorly the current parking rules and regulations help students understand how to park on-campus.**

So, over the past few months, we continued investigating this and ended up with enough material to write a full report on our primary concerns as well as several recommendations we've made directly to PTS. Today, we're ready to release the report in all of it's PDF glory, and you can check it out via the link below:

https://preview.redd.it/lhc6nzzy55381.png?width=1545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dc189ed2217e3e34abb8e4dacd4fe07174e9be8

**Read the Report:** [**SGA's We Need To Talk About Parking Advocacy Report**](https://www.sga.gatech.edu/sensible-parking/)

I know it's a long report, but I promise we tossed some humor in there to keep it easy to read and included many a pretty graph for all of my fellow visual learners out there. We write these reports to explain confusing parts about campus, keep folks in the loop on what SGA is working on, and catalyze our efforts by putting public pressure on departments to prioritize fixing things that are especially broken.

We welcome any and all feedback (positive, negative, and in-between) either here or directly to us (feel free to email me at [emmett@gatech.edu](mailto:emmett@gatech.edu)). We've heard your concerns about parking and the burden of citations. Keep us accountable to actually making some progress on this. We're here to advocate for you.

Appreciation post for the profs,"This was my first semester as a grad student at Tech, and boy was I blown away by the kindnesses of some of the profs I encountered. An exceptional example would be Mostafa Ammar - anyone who's been in his classes knows what I'm talking about. Just wanted to share some of the ways he showed kindness in his class.

1. On the first day of class, he showed the covid graph of GT and distilled it down to the probability of having a covid-positive classmate: a hard-hitting way of making a point without anyone feeling upset about wearing masks.
2. He offered the class in 4 ways: attend lectures in person, or livestream them, or watch the recordings, or even watch previous sem's recordings (should we want to get ahead at our pace). 
3. There were no ""silly questions"" in class. He genuinely appreciated and answered every question asked in class. He'd often appreciate the nuances in the questions themselves and patiently answer them. If the same question was asked multiple times, he would go deeper into the topic and ground it with examples. This extended to his Piazza posts where he would encourage questions and post lengthy answers to clarify doubts.
4. The lectures were often arranged in a \`problem -&gt; solution -&gt; new problem -&gt; new solution\` manner. Not only was this deeply engaging but it also made you appreciate the ""how"" and the ""why"" along with the ""what"". 
5. The class policies were always guided by fairness. While his pre-quiz briefings and doubt-clearing sessions were recorded and shared, the more sensitive one-on-ones were not. Marking on tests were liberal and detailed solutions were shared.

Always a brilliant class when you have the prof ernestly rooting for your success.",1640908214,1,0

Attendance should not be mandatory this semester,"People should be able to make their own choices with their health and vote with their feet. Professors should not make lecture attendance mandatory this semester while posting recordings of lectures (very low effort). This is especially good with the large classes here at Tech where actual interactions with instructors are extremely limited and remote lectures are similar to in person.

Non mandatory attendance also benefits students who choose to go to lectures by offering better faculty to students ratio.

I had several 250 people classes enforce attendance and there was honestly 0 questions asked during lecture and 0 interaction.

I don’t mind in person exams though, Math 1554 for example did an excellent job last semester with COVID offering in person (non mandatory) labs and properly social distanced exams.

COVID itself might not be so scary but long COVID certainly is. Until they find a solution (and apparently they are close), I don’t want to take the risk. Other people might feel differently which is totally fine.",1640796334,1,0

You are not necessarily being altruistic by asking for an online semester,"Health is more than just getting sick. I have had Covid. And while Covid did suck, I can say for certain that staying in my dorm my entire freshman year had a far more adverse effect on my health than getting covid did both in the short and long term. Staying inside all caused me to gain weight increasing my proclivity to actually get severe illness with covid, isolation led me to go through thousands of dollars worth of therapy. I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder caused by this time, and through many conversations this semester, I know I am not alone.  I actually understand and supported the measures taken last year considering we didn't have a vaccine. However, with Omicron being the dominant strain, where it affects your upper respiratory tract instead of the lower, the chance of severe side effects is significantly limited especially if you are vaxxed and even more so if you are boosted. I am not saying that there aren't measures that we can take to limit exposure, but shutting down isn't a solution without consequences as many are framing. I was in favor of lockdowns for a long time, but at some point we have to allow people to make their own decisions about their health, otherwise, I think we are going to have some very negative long term effects for our generation.",1640737949,1,0
Regular Transfer for Junior and Senior Year. Late?,"I’m currently in another good aerospace engineering program: 4.00 GPA, second year, letters of recommendation, propulsion lab experience, internship, recent 1520 SAT - the lot. I feel that the load I get rn isn’t the load I can handle, and I definitely can handle the GIT (that’s what they all say, I know). Putting the jokes aside, I’m definitely interested in Georgia Tech’s aerospace program, however, I’ll only be able to transfer in for my third and forth years. Should I do it? Will it be late? Will I be able to land at a good company with such timing? Or get some lab experience? (I’m at Purdue AAE rn; international student) Any additional questions are welcomed.",1640736134,1,0

AMA: GT Dropout moved to SF and started a venture-backed startup - 1 year in,"I took my last GT final exam just over a year ago now, and a lot has changed since I took the leap of faith to drop out and move to Silicon Valley to build technology. I did CREATE-X for my capstone last fall, and after seeing how Silicon Valley operates, GT's startup initiatives are **severely lacking**. We have an enormous economic opportunity to make Atlanta a regional or global tech hub, but GT is more focused on donations from Coca-Cola and Home Depot than helping prepare their students for risk-taking, innovation, and wealth-creation. As a result, the biggest startups in Atlanta are Kabbage and Calendly, whereas here, they're Apple, Google, Tesla, etc.

We have almost everything we need to be a burgeoning tech hub – bootcamps, accelerators, tech square, a history of finance, investors, talent. But the big breakdown is there **aren't enough people starting startups in Atlanta.** I wouldn't start one in Atlanta either, seeing as how most of the resources are in California. And so, the flywheel continues.

So, I wanted to come back home to GT subreddit and see what's changed. Hopefully, there are a few of you who are thinking about doing the same (Hybrid Zoom university isn't what we paid for, etc.) so AMA about the tech industry and startups and to reassure you to take the leap of faith.",1640717320,1,0

"What to do about an unfixed grading error dropping me a letter grade, grade now in OSCAR?","I emailed the professor about the grading error when it was in canvas multiple times and was assured it was indeed a grading error and would be fixed, and the correct score (98 versus 0) showed for a few hours after that first email before reverting back to a 0. That assignment had a comment on it by the professor saying ""Great work."" There were actually two incorrect scores, but I never saw the correct score for the second assignment which always showed as a 0 (it was to answer a number of questions, and I'm sure that not every answer was wrong). On our second correspondence, the professor said she was having technical difficulties that was making grades show as a 0 in canvas, and said it would be fixed for final grades.

The grade only showed in OSCAR just now, being NR for the longest time because she apparently had difficulty uploading them there too, but now it shows as the letter grade as if those assignments were still 0. There are no curves, exams, or assignments not yet graded, grading is very straightforwards with labs 60% and Perusall 40% using total point system for both. The only possibility for it to drop as far as the lower letter grade is if BOTH assignments were still incorrectly a score of 0, even though her first correspondance confirmed that at least the first one was not a 0.

I can't help but feel both mad and screwed over by this, should I just accept a lower grade because of a grading mistake even though I did the work and legitimately scored the higher grade? If I want to fight this, who do I even contact now that it's already in OSCAR? It's Christmas Eve, is anyone even responding, and is after Christmas too late for changes?",1640367337,1,0

Missed BS/MS Deadline for Computer Science,"Hello,

I was planning to graduate in Spring 2022 and apply for the BS/MS computer science program that same semester because I thought that the deadline to apply is Spring 2022 if I want to start the BS/MS in Fall 2022. But turns out I need time left in my BSCS program in order to apply to BS/MS, meaning that if I graduate in the spring, then I needed to have applied by this fall's deadline, which is already passed. So I missed the deadline...

I was wondering if anybody went through the same thing and could share what they did? Or what my options are from here on out? I still want to apply to BS/MS, so if I apply in Spring 2022 but graduate in Summer 2022, will I be allowed to start my MS in Fall 2022? Or will I need to delay my graduation to Fall 2022? I contacted the BS/MS advisors and am waiting on their response, but I thought I'd also reach out here and see if anyone else has any insight. I prefer not to apply to MS regularly because then I will have to take the GRE and I'm a bad test taker...

How many credit hours are you taking/planning on taking? How do you maintain your work/school/life balance?,"Was just curious how many credit hours other students are taking, what their experience was taking too many, etc. And if you are somehow taking 13+ credit hours and working full-time: HOW?

Would love to create a little bit of discussion around this especially since I assume many other first-years are wondering the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where I am at:

Spring 2022 is going to be my second semester at Tech. This semester I started out with *only* 13 credit hours. I  had to drop a class (and go down to 9 credit hours) due to tons of financial aid issues as well as I could not keep up while working 40-50 hours a week and quite frankly I did not even have the slightest clue what was going on in that class.

&amp;#x200B;

For Spring 2022, I have decided to cut my hours all the way down to 8-16 hours/week as I will be playing ""catch up"" due to the dropped class.

I am planning on taking:

MATH 4107 Abstract Algebra

MATH 4317 Analysis I

CS 1331 Object-Oriented Programming

CS 2316 Data Input/Manipulation

APPH 1050 (if I can get in by my time ticket) and/or/maybe MATH 3012 Applied Combinatorics

For a total of 14-17 credit hours depending on the and/or/maybe on MATH 3012.

&amp;#x200B;

I am hesitant to take MATH 3012 since I've heard many horror stories and compared to the other higher-level Math classes it doesn't seem to be up my alley anyway so I want to hold off on it until I become stronger Mathematically-wise.",1636577597,1,0

And CS 3651 wasn't even up until today- did college of computing or whoever runs the registration system tell anyone? NO OF COURSE NOT- they silently take it down and silently put it up

For a school with such a highly ranked CS degree why is our registration system so shit and inefficient????? Also it's beyond me why I would need to apply for a permit for classes I'm *required* to take??
Idk I have lots of anger and frustration towards registration
And yes I'm aware classes usually get sorted out during phase 2 but I'm still annoyed it can't just be over with the first time

Where does Coursicle get it's class seats data from?,"I have just spent the entire night trying to analyze the routes on different gatech websites (such as oscar and lite) in order to avoid having to scrape them with multiple requests (and instead, just sending one request and getting all the data I need in that request). While I was able to make some headway on how lite works, and combine that with the fact that this data is on a semester-wise basis and wont change every day, I could not find any way of getting data from oscar in such a manner. I even resorted to using Google's indexing to see if any public oscar pages were out there that could help me.

Don't get me wrong, oscar does have a very extensive public api, the thing is they hide the class seats from any endpoints that give bulk information. The only way to get seats information this without logging in is to use the ""display detailed schedule"" endpoint on their restful api, but that only gives the seats for a particular class and section at a time. I know that if you are able to log in with a selenium script, you can potentially just view the registration page and get the seating details of all sections in a particular class in one request, but it makes me wonder:

HOW DOES COURSICLE GIVE YOU LIVE UPDATES ON CLASS SEAT DETAILS?

Does it continously ping oscar? If so isnt that really bad for performance/ won't it be rate limited?  
I have a feeling that maybe OIT has included some public endpoints and have made them hard to find., so wanted to know if anyone had any experience with this.",1637674283,1,0

GAMEDAY!!!!!!!!!! (WEEK 9 vs. Virginia Tech),"# IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTT'SSSSSSSS
# GAMEDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
""Thus, despite the showing the last few weeks, I will never give up.  I can't give up, especially after all my experiences as a Georgia Tech fan.  Weirder things have happened, and nothing can convince me to throw in the towel.""

Okay so that's a bit gratuitous of me quoting myself in one of these but it's still quite apropos.  Last week was a barn-burner in Scott Stadium.  Both offenses came out to play.  Unfortunately the Virginia defense was slightly better while Georgia Tech's defensive performance resulted in some...*ahem*...frustration.  But the offense never gave up.  They had some dry spells but they kept attacking.  They- kept fighting and almost tied the game up on the last play!  And the fact that, down  48-27 with 3:50 left in the game, we brought it to one score with 8 seconds left and 31 yards from the end zone speaks to that never-say-die spirit.  It's gonna need to carry over to today.  And this week's opponent is against Virginia Te.....I MEAN Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

Remember when we got shut out?

This year we're in better position not to.  The offense is good.  And the Hokies are coming in kinda vulnerable.  They beat UNC to start the year but since then they've stumbled.  Like us, they sit at 3-4 overall coming off a close loss.  However, unlike us, they're in the midst of a losing streak, something we've somehow managed to avoid this year.

Unfortunately we still haven't been able to put together a winning streak this year.  But a streak's gotta start somewhere.  AND we're celebrating the 1990 National Championship team this Homecoming!  If there was a time to take care of business, it's this one.  

It's time to lock and load.  Let's get back to work!

NEED ADVICE. Sexual misconduct case against me from another student in my cohort and don't know what to do...,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. This is a hell of a long story so I'll try to keep it as short as possible, but I am in a shitty situation and feel like my life is about to fall apart...  I'm a part time graduate student who recently finished undergrad here and I learned this week that the college is pursuing a sexual misconduct investigation against me. I am expected to attend a Hearing Panel under Title IX at an unnamed date. 

All of this I learned this week like a slap in the face and have no idea where to begin. All I know is that this is a huge misunderstanding and that the person in question is falsely lying about everything. I won't provide any details at all but me and another student went on a completely normal date after a small party just exploring the campus, after which they spent the night at my midtown apartment. The allegations came out of no where and I am worried at this point that I could be put on academic probation or expelled for something completely out of my control and fake.

I also work a near full time job which I'm worried this could affect if word gets out... I spoke to my family about this and they believe I should look into getting an attorney if I'm given that right at an academic hearing. I did some reading on this online and if this turns into a criminal investigation my life is over. My family will striaght up disown me and my employment will likely terminate me..... I'm on edge right now and venting and I'm sorry but this is unreal... if anyone has been in this situation please provide details and outcomes of an investigation like this and what I should expect at the hearing",1635552855,1,0

Improving institutional decision-making: guest lecture by Chris Walton,"In 2003, the United States chose to invade Iraq. Most now agree this decision was deeply flawed, costing trillions of dollars and thousands of lives. Exactly what went wrong here is a contested and controversial issue. At best, the decision-making process severely lacked rigor, and at worst, it was heavily biased. The call to invade hinged on the subjective impressions of a few key people – subjective impressions that later turned out to be wrong, made by people with complex motivations.”

Is there a way we can prevent similar mistakes from happening in the future? Join us for an introduction to decision sciences and different approaches to improving decision making in various domains. In this workshop, we cover key heuristics and cognitive biases that can interfere with rational decision making and some techniques for improving decision making.

This will be presented by Chris Walton, who received a master's in psychology from McGill and University College London and wrote his theses on bias, judgment, and decision-making.

Time: Friday, October 29, 6:30 PM to 7:30 PM Eastern

Any experience with placing out of multiple math courses via Advanced Standing Exams?,"I am a hoping to do a CS/Math double major. I did competition math and programming in HS and with that background I was able to place out of CS 1331 and Linear Algebra by taking the Advanced Standing Exams for those. There is at least one other required Math class (although from looking at online syllabi perhaps a few more) I think that I can place out of but it would put me beyond the 9 hour credit limit that GT has for placing out of courses since I have placed out of 7 already. 

I spoke to my counselor and wrote the Math dept asking to take the Advanced Standing Exam for Multivariable MATH 2551 and if successful then I requested to not necessarily get the hours (although that would be awesome), but instead just allow me to replace it with a higher level Math course. Has anyone had any success in getting this done? I know there are plenty of others at GT that are further along than me so did you just repeat the class? Seems to be a waste of time if I already know the material...

I get it if I do not do well enough on the ASE but I do not see why they would want me to repeat it if I do well, just let me take another course instead.",1635514706,1,0

Need help with 3D printing at Tech,"Hello, I tried 3D printing something at the Hive for the first time on Tuesday and totally fucked up the sizing of my project.

Self-Studying for MATH 1554 Advanced Standing Exam,"Hi,

I'm a first year out of state CS major who took a relatively easy course load - CS 1331, ENGL 1101, PSYC 1101, and MUSI 2010 for humanities credit. On top of that I've got CS 1100 and I'm in an ensemble as well (which is 1 credit).

After about 3 weeks of class, I regretted not taking MATH 1554 this semester which a lot of the CS majors around me did. I had the idea of self-studying all of the material and taking the advanced standing exam. If i could just land a 70, I thought, I would be out of this hard-ass class.

In high school, I self-studied Calc BC and got a 5, so I really thought I could pull this off. Now here I am, struggling with week 2 material while everybody is on week 7.

I've found the online Mayer videos and studio worksheets and textbook, but self-studying this class is so difficult for me because this stuff is really conceptual and I don't have a community with which to study since everybody is so ahead of me. Sometimes my friends are gracious enough to explain a concept to me, but obviously I can't study with them since they're just ahead of me. I'm going to try the outdoor Math tutoring but I don't know if they can help me learn an entire course.

I wanted to see if anybody has any experience or suggestions with this process. Being able to test out of linear this semester is a big goal, honestly for me to push myself and build confidence.

thanks for your input",1633574565,1,0

Who is Monitoring Dining Hygiene?,"Does Georgia Tech have the equivalent of a ""Food Safety"" Office?

I have been to the coffee shop in CULC twice (left the line yday) and I have to wonder who is setting standards. Cashiers regularly put fingers in the cups. Yesterday, one was scratching her head and her arm and there is no handwashing happening after these events. 

The lady distributing food was repeatedly shouting for orders from people who were getting food or baked goods (over the open space for baked goods). She was not wearing a mask, which would be gross just for the spit, even if there were no COVID to think about.

I realize there is a staff shortage and appreciate all of these workers. It's a small but essential step to follow food safety guidelines and I wonder who is monitoring this.",1633537798,11,0

"overwhelmed with guilt, any advice?","hi I can't believe I'm posting this bt I really need some feedback about a situation I'm in.

so I've been having trouble keeping up with one of my classes (a coding class), and I had a big hw assignment due recently. After giving myself only a few days to complete the hw (which was a mistake in itself), I knew I had to finish it  very fast, but whenever I tried to start I honestly had no idea how to begin. I became very stressed about it, not really sure why I couldn't do it. In retrospect, I think I had a panic attack about it.

so finally the due date came and I still had a lot of the most difficult parts left to complete. I'm ashamed to say this, but I ended up submitting something that was *heavily* influenced by a github repo. I have no excuses for what I did and believe me, that I regret that I felt the need to do it. Over the past few days, I've been overwhelmed with guilt feeling like I will be punished (even though I'm already being punished in a sense) and I am not sure what to do. I have already been thinking about talking to the professor and telling her that I've been struggling but I'm debating whether to mention my hw??

GAMEDAY!!!!!!!!!! (WEEK 5 vs. Pittsburgh),"# IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTT'SSSSSSSS
# GAMEDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

""It's not about the money.......it's about sending a message.  Everything burns!""

The ACC is burning.  And we're not the only log on that fire.

Let's review:
1. Week 1: Virginia Tech beat UNC in their opener.
1. Week 3: myamee got their asses kicked by Michigan State
1. Also Week 3: Georgia Tech takes Clemson to the brink and comes one play away from overtime
1. Week 4: NC State finishes the job against Clemson
1. Also Week 4: Georgia Tech beats the shit outta UNC.
It wasn't just Mayhem at Mercedes this past week.  It was Mayhem throughout the entire ACC!!  Now there's legitimate chaos in both divisions and, dare I say it, a shot for Georgia Tech to win the Coastal!  And the next step on that journey takes us back to Bobby Dodd at 12pm vs. Pittsburgh.

The last time these two teams met, they left on not so amicable terms.  It was an ugly game that we unfortunately lost to end the season culminating in Geoff Collins yanking his hand forcefully from Pat Narduzzi after a handshake.  The time before that, a late goal-line fumble did us in and we couldn't bring it home after that.  And the time before that was another ugly affair in Paul Johnson's last year at Georgia Tech and the last year that Narduzzi would complain about cut blocking.  There's some, uh, bad blood between these two programs.  Not as bad as our vendetta with u[sic]ga or my vendetta against myamee but still.....

The fortunate thing is we're riding a nice wave of momentum.  Two weeks ago our defense threw everything and the kitchen sink at Clemson and held them to well below their usual output against us.  This past week that unit turned in another valiant effort limiting Sam Howell and forcing him into mistakes and sacks aplenty.  The only difference is that in this most recent game the offense caught up!  Fresh from his elbow injury in Week 1, Jeff Sims led an explosion for 39 points starting at the end of the second quarter!  This was our first win against an AP Top-25 team in what felt like an eternity.

Let's not crash this wave of momentum too late!  This team has shown us what they can do when they're truly locked in!  I've said it before and I'll say it again: these guys can hang with anybody!!  Let's keep it going!  

And all together now.................

GAMEDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (WEEK 2 vs. KSU),"IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTT'S

GAMEDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

""But I already have great focus!""
""Your focus needs more focus.""

Let's sit down and have a little chat.

Remember when I said to take the season a game at a time and let the results surprise you?  Remember how I said to take it to heart because it goes both ways?

Well once again we were on the wrong side of the ""let the results surprise you.""

A good amount of it was execution.  We didn't get a fast start in the first half; had we done that we might be talking a different story.  Unfortunately, even as we got things going towards the end of the first half and during a good portion of the second half, we couldn't hold off one final charge.  The fact that all of this happened against a G5 school that hadn't won a game last year is enough to compound the frustrations we're all feeling.  Not to mention Jeff Sims had an unfortunately sluggish game that ended in an injury.

However, if you're looking for positives (like I do), there were some.  
# First off, we weren't as penalized as last year.  
# Secondly, we only had one awful turnover (almost had two, but that second one would have been bullshit). 
# And third, may I reintroduce you to an oft-forgotten member of the Killer J's: Jordan Yates.  Thrust into the fire when Jeff Sims hurt himself trying to fall on his own fumble (and unfortunately may be out for the year), he gave us some rhythm.  He had some tough runs and orchestrated the offense well (apart from that second-to-last drive which....what was the plan again???).  It'll be interesting to see if CDP will expand the playbook for Yates to run more of the offense.  Especially given he's been here a year longer than Sims (when we still had a lot of flexbone personnel).

But we can't dwell on this loss for too long.  And neither can the players.  For as much as they fought and fought yet came up short, extended time for reflection isn't a luxury they have.  It's back to business; time to learn from these mistakes and face down the next opponent.

Kennesaw State University.

And these guys are gonna be ready and raring for battle.  The Owls are gonna bring their flexbone attack orchestrated by Brian Bohannon and look to keep us reeling heading into the conference schedule.  And we can't afford to give them that opportunity.  We gotta refocus.  We gotta get and stay locked in.  And we need to keep improving and build on whatever positives we can pull from the last game.  The schedule isn't gonna get any easier from here on out, so let's get at it!

I understand that a lot of people complain that people are complaining here. I understand that Reddit just has a negative vibe, it is an echo chamber.

I’m not unsure if the folks complaining about the folks complaining all drank the kool-aid, have nothing better to do than to complain about the complainers, but complaining on r/gatech is pretty dope. You might not realize it now, but once you start looking at the ‘real world’, you’ll realize that we live in a society.

Look for the silver lining, and you might be shocked by what you find.

Edit: I would add that part of the culture of r/gatech is the chamradere that comes from complaining about people complaining, but it seems worse this semester for some reason.

What to do when you feel like your submission was not respectfully graded?,"TLDR: I got a 45/100 on an assignment that I think is poorly graded and head TA rejected my regrade request. The requirements was not clearly communicated to students. My next option is to take it to the professor. What to do? 

I am a MSCS student. I recently submitted a report and received a 45/100 for it, which I feel like wasn't fair grading. 

The report asked for answers to 5 questions, which I have all answered to a certain extent. What I wasn't aware of was that apparently I needed to explicitly those answers in their own separate sections in my report. For example, the prompt asked me to discuss efficiency, so I needed a specific efficiency section. 

Now here's why I feel like it was unfair: this was not explicitly communicated through the assignment page. If you examine it, it does not describe how or what you should do to format your answer. Only on canvas, when you specifically dig into each assignment, can you find the assignment rubric. Even then the rubric doesn't really communicate how your answer can be structured. Plus let's be honest, no one really digs through canvas to find a rubric for a specific assignment. Students usually look at the assignment description for the deliverables. 

Another unfair things was the rubric criteria. For a lot of the points, it's all or nothing. For example, one of the criteria was ""paper uses lecture terminologies,"" and you either get 17.5 points for thorough discussion, or 0 for not having discussed at all. I clearly used lecture terminologies but I got 0 points because it wasn't up to their standard? So do all students who didn't discuss it clearly get a 0? 

We are expected to learn by drawing inferences from often times high level, vague lectures, or research papers that need prior knowledge. But when we submit an assignment that needs you to draw inferences to meet the deliverables, it's not allowed and you immediately get a 0? Wtf?  How does this follow realistic researching and learning? 

I submitted a regrade request and it was refuted because they believe it was graded fairly. The TA told me if I don't like it I can escalate to the professor. What if the professor doesn't agree with me either? What can I do from there?",1632547879,1,0

“It's not about talent. It's about heart. It's about who can go out there and play the hardest. They're not gonna give you anything. So you gotta go out there and you gotta take it.”

HOW 'BOUT THEM JACKETS?!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Last year we faced Clemson in Bobby Dodd and got our asses whooped.  It was an epic beatdown and the most lopsided conference game in ACC history.
And this year???
This year we faced Clemson in Death Valley as 28-point underdogs and lost by...........6 (SSSSIIIIIIIXXXX!!!!).
And you wanna know how it happened?
We played without fear.  Our defense was locked in and attacking the ball-carriers.  Our offense hit on some big plays and was able to move the ball down the field.  Sure we only scored 6 points on that side of the ball (and then two more from the defense on a safety), but we held Clemson well below their usual output against us.

Simply put, this team played their asses off.  And nearly caused mayhem a week ahead of schedule.  In fact, we were ONE DRIVE away from extending the game to overtime where we could potentially have pulled off a massive upset!

And now we get another chance at a statement win with a matchup against unc at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.  Sam Howell and company may have looked weak against Virginia Tech in their season opener, but they look to be back on the train again.  In their last game they dropped 59 points on Virginia.....
....as they let Brennan Armstrong drop 554 passing yards on their defense.  Looks like every one of those points was very very necessary.
You wanna know what that means?  We might be treated to an absolute gunshow in the Benz!  If you thought Georgia Tech vs. Tennessee was a spectacle (even if we lost on a 2-point conversion), this might be even better.  Jordan Yates still leads the offense, and while he may not be as explosive as Jeff Sims (who's probably still healing his off elbow), he's still a really good quarterback!  And now we aren't going up against the veritable brick wall that is the Clemson defense!  Although UNC's front seven is pretty good in their own right, that secondary looked vulnerable against Brennan Armstrong and Virginia, so guys like Malachi Carter and Kyric McGowan might be due for big games.  How this passing game performs against a relatively weaker secondary remains to be seen, but if they can get clicking it's gonna be a lot of fun!!
Of course this will mean nothing if the defense can't handle Sam Howell.  They did a fantastic job against the Clemson defense and I'd like to see a similar effort against another top-25 team.  Because if this team can put together efforts like that, outcomes against top-25 teams like the Clemson game will become more frequent.  And eventually we'll transition from just simply hanging with these teams to coming out on top! 

If there was a game to build on the momentum from the last game, a loss as it may have been, this is it.  It's time to show the conference that our showing against the Tigers wasn't just a fluke, that it wasn't just lightning bottle, but rather a reminder of how good we can be and will be.

[And hey, exposing unc as frauds is always fun xD](https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/unc-investigation-athletes-pushed-into-fake-classes-by-counselors/)

Want To Help Pick GT's Next Vice President for Infrastructure and Sustainability?,"Hi all! 

SGA &amp; Grad SGA typically get invited to participate in the student interview process for high-level administrative positions at Tech; however, I have a strong belief that students outside of SGA &amp; Grad SGA should also get a say in who fills these important roles that impact our every day lives as GT students. So, I want to open up the opportunity for any undergraduate or graduate student to participate in the interview process for the VP role detailed below. 

**Vice President for Infrastructure and Sustainability**

Georgia Tech is currently conducting a national search to permanently fill the Vice President of Infrastructure &amp; Sustainability position at Tech. This VP position oversees the following departments at Tech:

* Sustainable Building Operations (Office of Campus Sustainability &amp; Kendeda Building)
* Capital Planning and Space Management
* Operations &amp; Maintenance
* Environmental Health &amp; Safety
* Design &amp; Construction

You can also check out where this position falls in the [GT Executive Admin org chart](https://president.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Org_Charts/org-a_president_as_of_february-2021.pdf) (the position is currently called ""Vice President, Sustainability, Facilities &amp; Safety"" but has since been renamed in line with the restructuring of the Admin &amp; Finance unit)

Four finalists for the position have been selected and student interviews with each of the finalists are scheduled for:

* Candidate 1 – Friday, October 15, 12:00 PM – 12:45 PM
* Candidate 2 – Friday, October 15, 10:30 AM – 11:15 AM
* Candidate 3 – Friday, October 22, 3:45 PM – 4:30 PM
* Candidate 4 – Friday, October 22, 10:00 AM – 10:45 AM

**Participate in the Student Interview Process**

By participating in the interview process, you'll get to interact with candidates, ask questions, and provide an evaluation of each candidate.

*Requirements*

* Must be a current undergraduate or graduate student at GT
* Must be able to attend all four on-campus, in-person candidate interviews (date/times listed above)

If you're interested, send me an email at [emmett@gatech.edu](mailto:emmett@gatech.edu) with the following information:

* First &amp; Last Name
* Year/Major
* Willingness and ability to participate in all four on-campus interviews
* Why you're interested in interviewing candidates for this position
* What perspective you can bring to evaluate candidates for this role

In an effort to ensure that every student who participates gets an opportunity to interact with each candidate, we can only have a very limited number students participate. So for fairness, you can send in a request to participate through Saturday, September 25th at noon (EST). Next week, I'll reach out to those who've been approved to participate in the student interviews.

Feel free to reach out with any questions.

Can we cancel an apartment lease for serious crime in the building?,"I’m looking everywhere for documentation and previous cases and found  https://homeguides.sfgate.com/can-break-lease-people-were-killed-apartment-complex-96580.html

Apparently a “sketchy guy” actually ended up tailgating and asking a resident to buzz him to the 27th floor (a guy in the groupme said this so not for certain) but the fact that someone coming back at ~1130ish on a Wednesday which doesn’t sound too outlandish could potentially be in a situation where they’re in the same elevator as someone with an armed weapon is very very scary.

(rant) why does the CRC only have heavy dumbbells???,"The CRC has 4 of every weight above 30lbs yet only a few of the lighter weights that literally everyone uses. I am yet to see anyone pick up a dumbbell over 60lbs which is half the rack they have. There's so much wasted time where I'm just waiting for someone to finish with the 25s since practically everyone uses them. I mean just look at them, they've been used so much that the handle is smooth meanwhile the 110s have never been touched (yes, they actually have 110lbs dumbbells at the CRC...) There is one set of 15s, 20s, and 25s. ONE SET (2 dumbbells). They have more 110s than 20s! 

So the first thing I thought was: ""well maybe the CRC just doesn't have the money to buy more dumbbells."" I mean the pandemic is still going, supply chains are messed up and home exercise equipment is really hard to get rn. BUT THEN the CRC buys brand new benches to replace all of the completely fine ones they already had!! There was nothing wrong with them, I have no idea why they even replaced them. Maybe there's something I don't know about the benches but the one I used last Friday seemed perfectly fine to me.

This has been a problem for years so who do we need to talk to in order to fix this because its ridiculous.",1632368756,5,0

And i also understand that each factor has a weighted point total.

Per the A-T Fund website: "" ***Why are A-T priority points important?""***

""Football and men’s basketball season ticket relocation requests, season parking requests, football away game and postseason tickets, and men’s basketball ACC Tournament and NCAA tournament tickets are all allocated in A-T priority point order. Every point counts!""

2. Does the AA message you to notify you of when an opportunity is available based on your cumulative point total?
3. FWIW Every time I have contacted the AA to request season tix or away/bowl game tickets my points were never even mentioned.

Should I stop working to fully focus on school? (and take GeorgiaTech's PE Data Science &amp; Analytics Bootcamp),"Hello! I am a Freshman Math Major at Georgia Tech taking 13 credits. I currently work 40-50 hours a week for $15/hour at Target/Starbucks and it is killing me. I've been doing this to avoid spending any of the loan money that went over the cost of tuition (though I will have to in order to buy things like a laptop, maybe pay rent on a month I might be short, etc.). This past week has shown me that what I am doing is not sustainable at all and my mental health is at an all-time low. I just moved across the country by myself for Tech and now I am considering just stopping work, accepting that I will be in debt and actually utilize the loan money for a while to then go hard at my academics, internships, and throw some applications out for more corporate-y jobs that could actually foster a career post-graduation. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the very least, I've already decided I could easily go down to 16-24 hours a week and use maybe 1/3 or 1/2 of my loan disbursement which I feel would give me a better work-life balance between work, school, friends, boyfriend, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I got an advertisement for [Georgia Tech's Data Science and Analytics Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.pe.gatech.edu/data/) that covers a lot of things I've wanted to get into career-wise. I was wondering if completely cutting off work and sinking another $10k in tuition to do this part-time 24-week boot camp while doing my undergraduate studies would be worth it and potential help with landing a good internship Summer 2022 or Fall 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

Also apparently [MIT has a similar version](https://professional.mit.edu/course-catalog/applied-data-science-program) but it would be 12 weeks of full-time education, but is only $3.4k in tuition. I definitely could not apply for the next start date of Oct. 30 but maybe the round after? However that would mean I would be doing two sets of full-time education/classes during Spring 2022 semester while taking Analysis... though it sounds better than full-time classes and full-time work.

&amp;#x200B;

I probably am coming off as delusional or just completely lost haha but I do appreciate any advice and input. \^-\^' Not even a month into the semester and it's hitting me this hard :/",1632263825,1,0

Question about transfer equivalency.,"I'm a high school senior currently in the application process. I wanted to see whether or not the ECON 2105 DE class I took and passed at GSU over the summer would transfer to GT. I checked the transfer credit chart and it says:

Advise regarding MS in Robotics at Georgia Tech (Fall 2022),"The MS in Robotics program is a great program offering courses from diverse backgrounds. However, one has to select one home department (among Aerospace, Mechanical, Computer Science, Computer Engineering and others).

As an outcome of the program, I am looking forward to working in perception and planning, working more on the computing.  


I have a few sets of questions regarding the program:  
1) If I apply through Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) or Mechanical, will I be expected to take up courses more from the home department?  
2) Is there any major difference in courses taken by students admitted through different departments?

The full document is located at [this handsome and finely crafted link.](https://www.usg.edu/regents/assets/regents/documents/board_meetings/Agenda_2021_10_12-13.pdf)

----

Old:

&gt; Each institution shall conduct post-tenure reviews of all tenured faculty members five years after 
the most recent promotion or personnel action for the faculty member. Reviews shall continue at 
five  year  intervals  unless  interrupted  by  a  further  review  for  promotion  or  personnel  action.  An 
administrator who has tenure will not be subject to post-tenure review, as long as a majority of the 
individual’s duties are administrative in nature. If and when an administrator returns to the faculty 
full-time,  the  individual  will  be  placed  into  the  post-tenure  review  cycle  described  above. 
Institution presidents shall review  and approve their institution’s post-tenure review policies, as 
well as any subsequent revisions, both of which must conform to University System of Georgia 
procedures for post-tenure review and should address cases in which a tenured faculty member’s 
performance is deemed unsatisfactory.

----

New:

&gt; The  post-tenure  review  process  shall  support  the  further  career  development  of  tenured  faculty 
members as well as ensure accountability and continued strong performance from faculty members 
after they have achieved tenure. 
 
&gt; Each tenured faculty member shall participate in a post-tenure review within five years following 
the award of tenure and again at least once every five years thereafter. The first post-tenure review 
shall assess the tenured faculty member’s performance since the award of tenure, and subsequent 
post-tenure reviews shall assess the performance since the most recent post-tenure review. 
 
&gt; A  tenured  faculty  member  may  voluntarily  choose  to  participate  in  a  post-tenure  review  sooner 
than five years. If this voluntary review is successful, then the faculty member’s next scheduled 
post-tenure  review  will  take  place  five  years  after  this  voluntary  review.  In  addition,  a  tenured 
faculty member whose performance is evaluated as unsatisfactory or not meeting expectations  – 
whether  overall  or  in  any  particular  area  –  in  an  annual  review  process  will  be  provided  with  a 
remediation  plan.  If  the  faculty  member’s  performance  is  evaluated  as  unsatisfactory  or  not 
meeting expectations – overall or in a particular area  –  again the next year, the faculty member 
shall  then  undergo  a  corrective  post-tenure  review.  That  review  will  not  alter  the  timing  of  the 
faculty member’s regularly scheduled five-year post-tenure review thereafter. 
 
&gt; Each tenure-granting institution must create its own specific policies for implementing this post- 
tenure  review  policy.  Each  institution’s  policies  shall  be  developed  in  consultation  with  the 
institution’s faculty and shall include appropriate due-process mechanisms. Institutions will have 
flexibility in their implementation to create a process appropriate to the campus context. Prior to 
implementation, institutions must submit policies and evaluation criteria to the Chancellor or the 
Chancellor’s designee(s) for approval. The Chancellor or the Chancellor’s designee(s) will provide 
institutions with more specific guidelines for their post-tenure review policies and procedures. 
 
&gt; Consistent  with  those  guidelines  and  institutional  policies,  post-tenure  review  shall  include 
evaluation  of  instruction,  student  success  activities,  research/scholarship,  and  service  as  is 
appropriate to the faculty member’s institution, school or college, and department. The post-tenure 
review will also incorporate findings from the faculty member’s annual reviews from the years 
since the last post-tenure review. The faculty member shall provide review materials and additional 
information, as provided for in the institution’s guidelines, to aid the review process. 
 
&gt; The  post-tenure  review  will  include,  at  a  minimum,  feedback  from  the  faculty  member’s 
department chair and a committee of faculty colleagues. The results of the post-tenure review shall 
be conveyed to the faculty member. The results of the post-tenure review shall be considered in 
subsequent decisions on promotion, merit pay, and other rewards.  
 
&gt; If the results of the post-tenure review are unfavorable, then a performance improvement plan shall 
be created by the applicable department chair and dean in consultation with the faculty member. 
The  necessary  elements  of  such  performance  improvement  plans  will  be  described  in  the 
guidelines  provided  by  the  Chancellor  or  the  Chancellor’s  designee(s)  as  well  as  in  each 
institution’s post-tenure review policies. 
 
&gt; If the faculty member successfully completes the performance improvement plan, then the faculty 
member’s next post-tenure review will take place on the regular five-year schedule. If the faculty 
member fails  to  make  sufficient  progress  in  performance  as  outlined  in  the  performance 
improvement plan (or refuses to engage reasonably in the process) as determined by the department 
chair  and  dean  after  considering  feedback  from  the  committee  of  faculty  colleagues,  then  the 
institution shall take appropriate  remedial  action  corresponding to the seriousness and nature of 
the faculty member’s deficiencies. The President will make the final determination on behalf of 
the  institution  regarding  appropriate  remedial  action.  An  aggrieved  faculty  member  may  seek 
discretionary review of the institution’s final decision pursuant to the Board Policy on Applications 
for Discretionary Review. 
 
&gt; Remedial  actions  may  include,  but  are  not  necessarily  limited  to,  suspension  of  pay,  salary 
reduction,  revocation  of  tenure,  and  separation  from  employment.  The  institution  must  give  the 
faculty  member  notice of  the  possibility  of  such  remedial  actions  when  the  performance 
improvement plan begins. The determined remedial action will be imposed in accordance with the 
guidelines provided by the Chancellor or the Chancellor’s designee(s) as well as the institution’s 
post-tenure  review  policies.  The  institution’s  imposition  of  such  remedial  action  will  not  be 
governed by or subject to the Board Policy on Grounds for Removal or Procedures for Dismissal. 
 
&gt; Each institution shall also develop and implement procedures to conduct post-tenure reviews with 
tenured  faculty  members  who  hold  administrative  positions.  These  procedures  shall  address  the 
distinctive nature of administrators’ work and leadership roles, include constituent feedback, and 
reflect that tenure is held in faculty positions not in administrative positions. Each institution shall 
compile  and  submit  an  annual  report  on  post-tenure  review  activity  to  the  Chancellor  or  the 
Chancellor’s designee(s).",1634312339,1,0

I once again pull an all nighter,"I never mean for this to happen, but it always seems to sneak up on me when I least expect it. 

I’m watching lecture videos for my flip dynamics class. Between my brain’s delirium of getting a collective 12 hours of sleep to show for the past week and this class breaking my perception of reality, I no longer understand things when they move. 

The smiling professor places a wheel onto an inclined plane. A wicked smirk plays on his face. “Which way is the wheel going to move when I let go of it?” he asks, “up or down?”

I am crying. I do not know anymore. Truly anything is possible I suppose. But surely, my base level understanding of gravity won’t betray me now. Surely there is at least one thing I can say I know for certain. 

I watch in horror as the professor releases the wheel and it rolls up the incline, defying my expectations, gravity, and reason.

i-owe-you pet care system for student pets/ESAs ?,"(please remove if this is not allowed, but I can't find a better place to post)

I am graduate student living off campus. I have pets that need attention during holidays and was wondering if there was a Discord or GroupMe for students who have pets that need attention while their owners are away. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I will be in town over Thanksgiving break and could watch someone's animals (check in, give them food, empty litter, feed the fish, get mail or packages, etc), but during Xmas I will be gone for 6-7 days where I would need someone to stop by 2x or 3x during that week and just re-fill bowls and empty litter.

"[GT students making airline travel ~calmer~, by giving you the data. [Class Project]","It's Winter break. All you want to do is get home.  
But now its time to fly and you're running late to your flight, can't get through TSA, and there's a thunderstorm so who knows if your plane is even at the gate...

Its 2021, why can't your phone tell you that your plane is there, that the TSA wait time is 17 minutes so you should leave at 3pm, that your checked bag really HAS made it off and will be at carousel 3. Very simple, yes.. Just give **you** the info so you know what's going on and can focus on getting to your plane.

We'd love to gauge interest in this idea, thank you all!

\[This is part of a class project, but honestly think it is a fun idea that larger airlines should pickup for new/casual flyers.\]

Did anyone receive a paid shopper email in the past few days?,"I swear I got one of those but I can't seem to find it in my outlook anymore. It seemed super sketchy and I wanted to investigate it further, but it seemed to have disappeared from my emails.",1634170798,1,0
"Second academic misconduct, what's next?","I screwed up..  The first miscoundct occured last year, where I immediately dropped the course and informed my miscounduct that I cheated and modified code from an online repo.  I worked out a faculty conference resolution that I was able to drop the course and received a disciplinary warning.

The second misconduct occured this semester. It was a group project, I retook this course and committed code that I wrote from last semester to the group repo, hoping to use as reference. The deliverable as not for the code itself, but required reports only, so I didn't think much thinking the code wasn't required anyways, I should be okay commiting the code that I wrote last semester for reference(because project is almost the same).  I received an email of misconduct and accepted the second FCR. I shouldv'e been more thoughtful, I messed up, I wasn't planning on cheating intentionally, but I was deemed there's academic misconduct anyways.  I was told the FCR will be notified to OSI, because it was mandatory.

After doing some more research online regarding my issue,  will I receive an disciplinary probation?  Or will this considered to be my second violation? Which results to disciplinary suspension? I'm graduating this semester and what I did was not intentional at all. I'm devastated, I bang myself to the wall every time I think about this, how could I make this mistake. I have no one to blame but myself.  I'm hoping to receive a disciplinary  probation, based on the first case was not sent to OSI but recorded after FCR. Same to this case as well.  

Can someone please tell me what's going to happen to me? I feel so devestated, is there a channel for me to petition if I were given disciplinary suspension?",1634169813,1,0
