Problem with a math TA....,"So I'm (21F) taking a math class right now (I'm a sophomore) and my TA (around 23-27F) has been really hard on me. Here's all she's done so far (the class is on Zoom):

1. On the first day she gives us an assignment, goes through the ideas on how to solve problems in the assignment on the Zoom meeting, and tells us to submit it in our own words on Canvas by midnight. She is saying repeatedly that we have to submit the assignment as a pdf, but I don't think about it. I don't know how to convert the file into pdf so I send her an email a couple of hours after class about scheduling a zoom meeting so she can help me do it. She does not respond. Ever. I miss the deadline because of this, and submit it the day after since I got my friend to convert the file. She gives me a zero, and then compromised and said after that I can submit in any type of file I want, as long as the file works.
2. She never turns on her camera. Ever.
3. She says I should send her an email if I want tutoring. I send her a Canvas message and it takes her three days to get back to me.
4. Sometimes my Canvas will not work so I submit my work via email. She marks it as zero continuously, then says ""she will fix it"" but it always takes like a week for her to fix it and I am getting very stressed out.
5. Not helpful during office hours, at all. She will not give answers, just hinting at the problems vaguely, and she just keeps asking ""do you remember what this definition means?""
6. I went to office hours earlier this week and she was like 30 minutes late, and said ""she was accidentally in a different Zoom link""... Ok?
7. I feel like she is reading out loud the definitions from the instructor manuel rather than understanding it. I know I can't say for sure, but I feel like since it's on Zoom, she just keeps two tabs or something open and keeps going through the stuff from the instructor manual. I googled the exact words she said and it comes straight from the textbook. I feel like she does not understand anything, even though she is doing a phd in math.
8. On Fridays, she usually gives us a quiz that we have 1 hour to do. It's on Canvas. Now this Friday she gave us 7 hours to do it, since ""she didn't want to stress us out because we have a midterm coming up"". Okay. It's still the same length, but I realized it's very unfair because I have to go to one class in between and I may not get the full use of the 7 hours other people might. I sent her an email and it has currently been 5 hours and she has not responded.

So yeah, that's all. Should I email the department chair and ask if I could talk to them about this? I feel like this is effecting my mental health in a bad way.",1632552367,1,0

[Slugbotics](https://slugbotics.com/) is a student organization focused on hands-on engineering that you won‚Äôt find in a lecture hall. We design Underwater ROVs for the [MATE robotics competition](https://materovcompetition.org/), and self-driving 1/10 scale racecars for [F1TENTH](https://f1tenth.org/).

In Fall quarter, we hold ‚Äúonboarding‚Äù classes, where we teach all the skills you need to contribute to the team, and we‚Äôre able to offer this as a 3-unit university course through CRSN 151C-1. Through the onboarding courses, you should learn all you need to know to help out for the competition, so **no prior experience is required**. In Winter and Spring, we start designing our ROV and programming the racecar. You can join different sub-teams that focus on CAD, machining, electronics/PCB design, low-level systems, or advanced programming.

To sign up for Slugbotics, go to the [‚Äújoin‚Äù page on our website](https://slugbotics.com/join/) for instructions to join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/slugbotics/shared_invite/zt-vsaw28wm-qb41gydqnwkbPHDhvW6gZQ) workspace.

"Best place to attend remote class on campus, as off campus student?","Hey all! 

I transfered in last year but today is my first day on campus. I live off campus. I'll be getting out of one seminar class Monday at noon at the Social Science 2 building, and need to immediately attend my next one, which is remote. I'm trying to figure out the best spot on campus to be on Zoom for a few hours. I'll need a decent wifi connection, and the closer to Social Science 2 building the better, but most importantly, it needs to be somewhere it won't disrupt anyone else around me. 

I've checked out McHenry but even the ""non quiet"" areas seem pretty quiet. Seems like it might be weird to be chiming into class discussions there, but I'm not sure, I've only been here for a few minutes. It's a small seminar class so there will be plenty of talking. 

I've already checked with the professor to make sure I have a few minutes to get where I need to go, so while the quicker I can get there the better, the big concern is just finding somewhere with wifi that's an appropriate spot.

Local Job Market,"#  Annual Job Fair Supports Santa Cruz County Economy

***Companies Eager to Hire Local Applicants***

Local nonprofit organization, Access 2 Employment, hosted its 30th annual job fair on October 13 at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, where more than 30 businesses met with potential job applicants and shared insight about their company, available positions, hiring process, workplace culture, and recruitment incentives.

The in-person event was a welcome change to the virtual reality of hiring talent the majority of companies have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mandated state health regulations in March 2020 forced many hiring managers to alter their recruitment methods to online platforms. ‚ÄúWe use social media quite a bit; specifically Facebook, Linkedin and Instagram. We also use Indeed, Craigslist, SantaCruzJobs.com, and student job boards at UC Santa Cruz, Cabrillo College and local high schools,‚Äù said Carol Siegel, Senior Talent Acquisition Specialist at Santa Cruz Seaside Company.

Promoting employment opportunities is only part of the challenge employers have faced during the pandemic. Concerns of COVID-19 exposure have drastically minimized the number of candidates applying for jobs. ‚ÄúAlthough the local unemployment rate has continued to improve in recent months, trying to recruit and retain employees during the pandemic continues to be a struggle. Hiring managers are overwhelmed with the number of positions they are actively trying to fill. There is an abundance of employment opportunities, yet few applicants are responding,‚Äù said Patricia Greenway, President of Access 2 Employment.

Some employers have developed incentive programs to increase interest in working for their companies. Despite no education or work experience requirements for Bus Operator positions at Santa Cruz Metro, the local transit company has struggled to recruit applicants. ‚ÄúOur biggest challenge during the pandemic has been getting candidates to apply. Our Bus Operator position would normally bring in an overabundance of activity. We‚Äôre now seeing close to no applicants,‚Äù says Monik Delfin, Human Resources Deputy Director for Santa Cruz Metro. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve implemented a $4,000  hiring bonus, hoping this will encourage people to start a career with SC Metro. We also offer paid training and an excellent benefit package that includes pension through CalPERS.‚Äù

Healthcare companies have also had an inefficient number of job applicants. ‚ÄúWe care for aging adults in our community, and there is an alarming staffing shortage for Caregivers,‚Äù said Jamie Cabral, Talent Coordinator for Lifespan Care. ‚ÄúWe have had to think outside the box to attract candidates. Getting in front of students, increasing our advertisement budget, producing a recruiting video, developing on-the-job training, and offering employees a $200 new hire referral bonus are some of the recruiting tactics we have implemented.‚Äù

The education sector has especially had difficulty in filling open positions. ‚ÄúThe number one position we are noticing the most shortage is Substitute Teachers. It has also become increasingly difficult to fill positions for Yard Duty Supervisors, Crossing Guards, Paraprofessionals, and after school program staff,‚Äù reports Heidi Winner Odom, Director of Human Resources for Live Oak School District. She says her participation in the Access 2 Employment job fair offers the chance to encourage people to get their Substitute Teacher permit, and those new to the workforce to become a Paraprofessional or work in their after school programs. ‚ÄúMany of our classified, non-teaching vacancies are between 10-26 hours per week. These hours could be a great fit for parents with children who are in school or retirees searching for extra income.‚Äù

Alongside employers, community resource agencies will be present at the job fair to create public awareness of their services. The County of Santa Cruz Workforce Development Board will be in attendance to promote their Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) program, which offers job search assistance to the public. ‚ÄúWe look forward to promoting our free programs to those that have barriers to employment, and allow them to access the resources they need to obtain self-sufficiency and promote a thriving local economy,‚Äù said Amanda Winter, WIOA Career Center Operator. ‚ÄúWe want to let the public know there are resources still available despite the pandemic, and that we intend to continue offering services.‚Äù

Exhibitors participating in the event included Bay Photo, Big Creek Lumber, Cabrillo College, Cambrian Home Care, County of Santa Cruz, Encompass Community Services, Expertech, Friends of Santa Cruz State Parks, Homeless Garden Project, Imagine Supported Living Services, Lifespan Care, Live Oak School District, Mobile One, New Leaf Community Markets, Performance Food Group, Safe at Home Senior Care, Salud Para La Gente, Santa Cruz Seaside Company, Santa Cruz Warriors, Santa Cruz Metro, Target, Threshold Enterprises, UC Santa Cruz, UPS Store, Workforce Santa Cruz County, and more!

**About Access 2 Employment**

Founded in 1990, Access 2 Employment is a non-profit organization that hosts Santa Cruz County's largest job fair. Held annually in October in observation of National Disability Employment Awareness Month, the event is free to the public and offers a resume review station where job seekers can receive effective resume writing tips from recruitment professionals. The mission of Access 2 Employment is to educate employers about the benefits of hiring applicants from disadvantaged groups that face challenges in the job market including people with disabilities, seniors, youth, and ex-offenders. The volunteer based organization is made up of representatives from various local agencies and businesses with a common goal ‚Äì to improve the economic outlook of Santa Cruz County by connecting job seekers with employers and employment resources.

What to ask during professor's office hours,"Hello!

I've always heard that going to professor's office hours is great to knowing and getting closer to professors for research opportunities, recommendations for Master's Programs, etc. However, I'm not really sure what to do during office hours.

As an introvert, I sometimes have no clue what to ask the professor. I've asked basic things about the class, basic fundamental questions, and generic questions about research opportunities, but how do I go further and ask more meaningful questions and form stronger connections? I think I may be applying for a Master's program soon, so I would need at least 3 recommendations for that. Honestly, I think although I've been to a couple of office hours, I doubt the professors even know my name because my questions are quite generic. Thanks!",1634321735,1,0

&gt;Dear Senior EOP and STARS Community,  
&gt;  
&gt;As the campus resumes in-person learning and living, we have heard from some EOP and STARS seniors about two issues impacting you. We are reaching out to learn more about students in the following situations so that we can better advocate for your needs:  
&gt;  
&gt;1.) You are enrolled in fall 2021 courses being taught in person, however you have not been able to secure housing locally.  
&gt;  
&gt;2.) You are enrolled in a full schedule of remote courses in fall 2021, and you will not be able to come to Santa Cruz to take in-person courses in winter and/or spring 2022.  
&gt;  
&gt;If either of these situations are true for you, ***please take 2-3 minutes to*** [***complete this very short survey***](https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7WbLgMnestKbw6W) ***before October 25th***.

Walkway between RCC footbridge and Porter,"Hi üëã I am a single dad. I live in FSH between rcc and porter. We are family student housing. Students just like you but who are married or in partnerships, and many of us have kids. We also have 8am classes.

Please for the love of god do not set up camp and have a SCREAMING dance party next to us. There are endless places to do this on campus, in the woods, away from your dorms, on the fields, by the squiggle, ETC, and yet you choose to do it in the rudest and most unkind way possible.

Physics 5A with Dhar,"Hi all. Im currently taking physics 5A with professor dhar and i just gotta say he is in no way as bad as people made him out to be. Before entering the class i was so scared by all the Reddit posts and rate my professor reviews but having almost made it through the quarter i can definitely attest to the fact that he‚Äôs actually a good professor. Like on this past midterm every single problem covered content that he explicitly went over in class. All you had to do was take notes and follow along with the examples he gave and you would‚Äôve been able to pass easily. Keep in mind I‚Äôm pretty shit at physics lol but still managed to do good on it. 

Overall i just hope this helps anyone who was planning on taking physics next quarter; don‚Äôt believe all the bad stuff online bc in reality if you put in the bare minimum effort you‚Äôll do well in the class. 

Alsooo if ur questioning my legitimacy i know i just made this account but i really am just a student lol, my period got me feeling all empathetic and shit so I thought I‚Äôd stick up for Dhar since he gets such a bad rep for no reason.",1636716063,1,0

"Should I take CSE 30 In Winter, or wait?","I am a CSE Game design major, a freshman. I have to take CSE 30 (advanced python) as a requirement for my major. 

I am currently taking CSE 20 (beginning python) and I am feeling confident enough in my python abilities so far to try my hand at CSE 30 next quarter.

However, the only time I can find for the class starts at 8, in the morning! I usually don‚Äôt even wake up that early, much less have the time to get ready for and walk to a class (the meetings seem to be in person, somewhere called classroom unit 2, it doesn‚Äôt give much of a description).

If I take this class, I will need to drastically change my sleeping schedule (I usually wake up between 9 and 10), and it will be a pain to get going to class right in the morning. However, if I wait a semester (and hope the scheduling is better in the spring), then I fear I may get rusty in my python abilities.

Another WiFi Rant‚Ä¶,"it seems like every other night, res wifi and guest wifi are unjoinable for any of my devices. I‚Äôve talked to ITS several times but they don‚Äôt seem to have any clue as to why. But whatever. I can live with that. 

Today‚Äôs rant is because i was trying to take my 8am midterm in an S&amp;E study room, but couldn‚Äôt connect to guest wifi or eduroam. I even left the room, but still couldn‚Äôt join for more than a second before i got booted off. I know i‚Äôm the dumbass for trying for so long, but i spent like 40 minutes doing this. Finally I go to the other side of the library, and of course the wifi is fine over here. 

I‚Äôve had this problem with a couple of rooms in mchenry before too, but am extra annoyed because i came here right when they opened and spend so long trying to get on the internet. 

Actually, wtf?? there were like 5 people in the library, so it definitely wasn‚Äôt a bandwidth issue (i‚Äôm no wifi expert). The guest wifi just doesn‚Äôt let me join, but eduroam and reswifi spit back ‚Äúincorrect password‚Äù errors when they are 1000% correct. It‚Äôs not even that the speed is slow, i either get good speed or no internet connection. 

I fully appreciate how un-constructive this post is, but can anyone give me answers?!?! Why does this happen? why can some people connect (on their own identical hardware) when i face these issues? I have 2 laptops and a phone with me, none would connect. Is this due to crappy routers? what can i do?? i spent last year on another campus and never faced issues like this so regularly.

How to confront roommate about drug use in dorm.,"We were friends in high school and are now rooming together as freshmen in college. Recently, he‚Äôs been coming home around 3 am, waking me up, and snorting a bunch of coke in our dorm. I was visiting home for a weekend and since I returned this started and has only gotten worse. I want to confront him about it because it is not acceptable to be waking me up at those hours when we have class in the morning and I obviously don‚Äôt want to be legally liable if he gets caught. But I also don‚Äôt want to be an asshole about it since we have been friends for years. IMO he needs to get some help but I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm qualified to tell him that on my own. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1636486454,1,0

Should this exam be nulled?,Hello everyone. This is going to be long hold on tight. So I took a physics exam with professor Barun Dhar and there were 3 questions that were worth 24% of the exam. There were also 7 MC questions that were worth approximately 3 points each. In this exam one of the 24% questions would give a negative value when it should‚Äôve given a positive value. This exam was also 50 minutes. 10 minutes before the exam ended the professor sent out an announcement to each breakout room and said that the value had been incorrect. Then 5 minutes later he said that he would only grade off expression. This stunted my progress to go back and check other work because I had spent so much time on that problem that HE got wrong. Now my grade for the exam will suffer for HIS mistake. Any advice on how to approach this? If he doesn‚Äôt take any steps to make our test grade somewhat better I want to talk to a higher up. It‚Äôs ridiculous that my grade will suffer because of his mistake.,1635605735,1,0

Free Mock Interview Simulator,"Over the past few months I‚Äôve been trying to build a mock interview simulator ([www.preparo.net](http://www.preparo.net/)).

It tries to mimic an interview being done virtually.

The reason I built it is when I was preparing for my graduate interviews in tech companies I absolutely fumbled my way through the first ten interviews before I finally actually got a job and I put a lot of it down to being quite stressed and filled with nerves because I just wasn't properly prepared for it.

I lost out on a significant amount of time working and salaries due to not being good at interviews. I wanted to fix that by building an online interview prep system.

I‚Äôve loaded in over 20,000 random interview questions from industry experts and you can select to do interviews by competency, behavioural or randomly. You can also load in your own questions you anticipate might come up.

**It‚Äôs totally free all I ask for is feedback and suggestions!**

If this is something you‚Äôd be interested in please check it out.

Thanks a million and best of luck in your interviews.",1635523611,1,0

COMP SCI freshman question.,"Q1. Okay so I‚Äôm struggling in my current intro to python class. I don‚Äôt know if im going to pass type of struggling. 

I wanted to ask if I withdraw from CSE20. Would that count as a fail for my required classes. I have no idea what the withdrawal would do for my chances of just being able to declare as CS. 

I got into the CS program but I don‚Äôt yet qualify for the major. I know I need a 3.0 in the required classes tho. 

So would it look better if I withdraw now? Or possible fail? 

Q2. Also CSE20 isn‚Äôt apart of the required classes to be in CS, technically it starts at CSE30. 

So if I were to stay in the class and possible fail CSE20, would that count as part of the required classes? Would it count as my only allowed fail?  Cause I could totally just take the class again. 

I really want to do CS but auto grader is killing me.

Senior Bioinformatics Major Concerned over Salary and Job Opportunities After Graduation,"Hey Y'all, 

I am a senior Bioinformatics major and I was wondering if anyone who graduated with a bachelors in Bioinformatics could give a rough estimate of what the entry level salary is like in the bay area. I don't have any research experience but I do have two summers of internship experience at a tech firm so I have moderate coding experience. 

Also the changes in Bioinformatics curriculum seems to have made the major more coding heavy which should mean by the time I graduate I should be a relatively alright coder. 

If I were to get a job primarily in primarily software and data analytics within a biotech company what should I expect salary wise. Along with this will I be okay with finding a job with just a bachelors and no research experience? Any advice, tips, etc, appreciated;.

Shout-out to the University for deciding I don't deserve Financial Aid anymore,"My family has never been very poor, but balancing our budget was tough from the start of the recession all the way until about 2017ish. At that point my mother landed a decent job which paid the bills, and decided to make herself more competitive in the workforce by going to graduate school (all while raising 2 kids single handedly, no I don't know how she did that on top of full time employment and schooling). After I graduated high school my mother got her master's and managed to get herself a better position, and the additional funds help pay off debts incurred from the recession (and long ignored home repairs) and also pay off her student loans. However, the University doesn't know that, all they see is a salary jump and now I've lost my health insurance grant, uni grant, and subsidized Federal Aid. My mother has a small college fund saved up for my sister and I and I'm very grateful, I know a lot of my peers aren't given that opportunity, but whoo boy is there now a gap of roughly $4000-5000 per quarter that ain't gonna be met.

CSE 13S is Underrated,"Well well, since it seems 71 people are about to get sent to a joycamp due to being ""flagged for cheating"" and with that resulting in much discussion about the course, I thought I would add my own piece since I don't believe anyone has expanded on what I'm going to say. For those outsiders, let's start by clearing some of the misconceptions that I see.

&amp;#x200B;

**Misconceptions on Cheating**

&gt;Looking up things is cheating. Using a TA's code and forgetting to cite them is cheating. Talking about a project with your friend is cheating. Talking about your code with your pet dog is cheating.

Any sane programmer has to ""look up"" how to do a particular thing (even basic things) or collaborate with others depending on the needs of the job, do you really believe professors don't know this? That is why a magical thing called citing exists, it's there for you to acknowledge that you've done this thing called research. However, there is a difference between looking up the exact answer and simply copy pasting it without fully understanding it, and taking parts of a solution to a similar (not exact) problem, fully understanding those parts, and adopting them into your own solution. As long as you don't do the former, and actually show in the assignment itself (usually with code comments and/or the design doc/write-up for 13s in particular) that you understand what the code you took is doing and ***why*** it is taking that particular approach in relation to your assignment, then 100% you are not going to be sent to a joycamp. 

&amp;#x200B;

Congratulations! You've done what's called learning! I think it may be one of the outcomes that any class wants you to achieve, but maybe you can double check that with your pet dog if I'm wrong...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The professor and the TAs have made a lot of threats to get people to turn themselves in, claiming MOSS is unbeatable.

**TA:** *Hey Dr. Long, I've ran the MOSS reports on the batch of students you wanted me to grade, one of them had a small helper function that was flagged from some Stackoverflow question, but they cited it and judging by their wonderful write-up and design doc that looks like they spent a lot of time on, it really seemed like they knew what they were doi-*

&amp;#x200B;

**Long:** *Silence. MOSS is our holy lord, and all of it's findings perfectly indicate cheating since they're blessed with its divine authority. Gather the 12 holy crusaders who serve MOSS, track this kiddo down, and bring them to their trial. The council will decide their fate.*

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming you read the section above, I don't think I need to say anything more.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why the Course is Underrated**

Yes I know the assignments are hard and take a long time (I wouldn't be doing this if I hadn't gone through it myself), and maybe the professor does show off his ""ego"" from time to time. Those two reasons pretty much sums up all of the bad ratings I've seen for this course, and often people describe how you have to be this ""legendary C programmer"" to do well in regards to the first reason. News flash: I never considered myself a legendary C programmer and I still did very well. Why?

&amp;#x200B;

Contrary to what the name of the course suggests, the primary outcome of the course isn't to ""learn C"". Instead, it's to build good habits when writing software (through design docs and write-ups) and strengthen your fundamentals of Computer Science (and C just happens to be a very good language at doing just that) or rather *Software Engineering,* which is the job that title that often gives the salary you likely wanted when proposing this major. There's a reason these assignments take a long time and are not easy, it's simply because writing high-quality software often takes a long time (your phone's OS has been in development for over a decade) and is most definitely not easy. You will have to suffer through bugs, ""Segmentation Faults"", and finding flaws in your design, same with literally anyone else who's ever written a meaningful program.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I could go on for hours about this. Though if there's one thing to take away here, learning matters more than your grade, and if you truly understand the value of this course, you'll be more motivated to become a better programmer and ultimately get a good grade in the course. It isn't rocket science.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously the course isn't perfect, I do believe the course should make its true learning outcome more clear, and while you may not agree with everything the assignment speck or syllabus says, at the very least you become well prepared for what's to come after.

&amp;#x200B;

If I made you angry in any way, down vote me all you want, it's your opinion and I respect that, but you probably didn't make it this far anyways. Lastly, good luck to everyone finishing the course, you'll thank yourself for getting the hard part done sooner.",1638496857,1,0

I...don't want to do that. I have work the first week of classes as well (Dining Hall) and I'm not sure what to tell my work. In all honestly my parent just doesn't want me on campus, but I don't know if that's valid enough to tell them? Does anyone have some advice on that?

What do you all think about classes becoming remote for the entire Winter quarter?,"With omicron spreading so fast, UCSC students already talking about testing positive (see other posts), flight cancellations, having to test for covid before and after arriving on campus and then every 2 weeks, and having no plans whatsover what happens to our studies/grades etc if we end up testing positive (other than quaratine for 5 or 10 days which doesn't really answer that question), I am personally thinking that we all just might be better off with remote classes for the entire Winter quarter.

How to enroll in community college courses as a full time student at UCSC," 

Hello to everybody! I was hoping someone might clarify how to enroll at a community college for 1-2 general education programs. I am a full-time UCSC student, however I understand that we have consortium agreements with De Anza and Cabrillo Colleges. According to my adviser, I may enroll in two 5-unit UCSC classes and a 3-unit Cabrillo semester class and still be a full-time student. I know I would need to fill out the consortium agreement request ([https://financialaid.ucsc.edu/archive-forms-pubs/21-22-forms/2022\_consortium\_agreement.pdf](https://financialaid.ucsc.edu/archive-forms-pubs/21-22-forms/2022_consortium_agreement.pdf) ) but besides this, can my financial aid I get from UCSC pay for my Cabrillo classes? I'm also curious if the information on this website is current. [https://oakes.ucsc.edu/advising/howtoguides/takecoursescc.html](https://oakes.ucsc.edu/advising/howtoguides/takecoursescc.html)

If you're planning to come back on the 3rd and are used to driving on snowy roads, then it shouldn't be much of a problem for you. Else if you're unfamiliar with snowy roads, then express caution while driving. Or avoid going on Highway 17 altogether.

Advice for a herper choosing a college and a major,"Hello, I‚Äôm hoping this is an appropriate place to ask your opinion. 

Hello, my son has been accepted to Humboldt State for 2022 (Zoology) but he has yet to hear from Cal Poly SLO or the UC Davis or UCSC where he would major in Evolutionary Biology/ Ecology. (is that the major you would recommend for a future herpetologist, with plans for grad school?) 

We visited all the schools and I believe that HSU‚Äôs campus, culture, class sizes and the Zoology major are the best fit for him. He is a herpetology (reptiles and amphibians) fanatic, and loves the climate of Humboldt, nature and fishing. We also loved the campus at UCSC but we didn‚Äôt get an official tour because of COVID, so it wasn‚Äôt as pleasant of an experience as HSU. 

He is hoping for UC Davis, UCSC or Cal Poly SLO because he wants to study abroad and thinks if he is lucky enough to get into one of these options he should go for those opportunities, as they would look better for grad school and his future career. 

Any thoughts or advice for us? 

I just want him to be happy and not as stressed as he has been these last two years of high school. He is a 4.0 student, always doing homework when not herping or doing internships.",1637489911,1,0
I've learned a lot this week from starting a student org of my own,"I started working on building a student org earlier this month, but so far, this week has been the most rewarding. I've learned so much from meeting people- students, alumni, a few club leaders, faculty, staff; learning what works and what doesn't work.

Unexpectedly, I've learned a lot about myself in this process too. Although the org is still in its early growing phase at this moment, I've been confronted with challenges that made me question big, abstract things like: what kind of leader I want to be? What sort of impact do I want to make? How do I want to do things differently?

One thing I'm proud of doing this week came from making an IG account (5 days ago) for the org. I was told that doing a giveaway was a great way to get people engaged, so when I considered the pros and cons of doing one myself, I had to assess a few things: what is the single-most important thing I want to gain from it? And what are the problems I'd have to work around on?

I know that having followers and likes is great and all, but it wasn't a priority. What I really want, *and really need,* is a great leadership team to help me realize my vision for this org. So I strategized, modified and improved the giveaway event to get me just that.

No one had to like anything, or follow, or repost anything on their account (god forbid I ruin someone's aesthetic). I made it very simple: just tag 3 friends to a post about our available leadership positions.

And I have to say, I couldn't be happier to give away $50 from my own pocket, because it was so worth it. All said and done, I'm so incredibly excited to see this org expand and soon meet its full potential at school.

You can check the org out on IG [here](https://www.instagram.com/ucscwib/).",1637479408,1,0

Seeking education/ career advice help in regards to medical assisting," Hello! I'm thinking of enrolling in a medical assisting program, but I'm having trouble deciding. I am now enrolled at UCSC (University of California, Santa Cruz) and intend to major in computer science. My ambition is to use my degree in a medical discipline such as bioinformatics. I've been thinking about going into patient care lately, and I don't want to let this opportunity pass me by. UCSC has a consortium agreement with Cabrillo College, and I was planning on taking some general education classes at Cabrillo, but they also have¬†a medical assisting program. I am permitted to attend classes at both universities at the same time, and I am trying¬†to figure out if a medical assisting program is still in the ballpark (specifically the clinical medical assisting certificate).¬† I'm hoping¬†to hear from others who have pursued medical assisting while earning a bachelor's degree in something else and how they managed to make it work. Also if anyone has taken courses at Cabrillo and UCSC at the same time how was your experience?",1637473036,1,0

Teach me Tagalog?,"Any fellow pinoy/pinay willing to teach me Tagalog?

A little about me, I‚Äôm a 22 year old male living on campus this year as a transfer student from SoCal. From the title you could assume I‚Äôm Filipino but I‚Äôve never actually learned Tagalog mainly b/c my parents never took the initiative to teach my native language when I was a child, which is how a majority of Filipino-Americans learn Tagalog.

If you or know someone who could teach me please dm me I‚Äôd also be willing to pay, name a price :). I‚Äôd prefer to stay on campus as transportation in the area can be tricky. I‚Äôve applied to Bayanihan so hopefully exposure to more Filipinos will boost my confidence. 

Sorry if I‚Äôm posting in the wrong thread, Thanks!!",1637448851,1,0
