Looking for help with a Unity/C# project for VR (Quest 2),"Hi all,

I am looking for a Rutgers engineering or CS undergrad that's familiar with writing script in C# for the Unity game engine. I am working on a VR project using the Quest 2. There is already a Unity interface in place to interact with the Quest 2, but some scenes need to be tweaked, some bugs need to be fixed, etc.

This is a good opportunity to get involved with Cognitive Science research and gain some experience in Quest 2 development.

Pay is $20 an hour. We could try to get the work done remotely as much as possible, but meeting in person on Busch campus may be needed on occasion.

Tips for getting through a required core class that you absolutely can't stand? Math 250,"I'm majoring in math and physics. I love math and proofs; I enjoyed pre-calculus topics (big algebra fan) and did well in calc one and calc 2. However, I am taking math 250 now, and I am struggling. I am a fan of theory and proofs, so all the computational stuff is killing me. I can't stand how little theory there is, and I wish I could start in math 350, but 250 is a requirement for math 300. The textbook is Friedberg Linear Algebra 2e matrix edition, and I highly dislike it; it is one of those books that give you an example after example then ask you to do it.

Anyone else lowkey really miss online school?,"Don't get me wrong when I was in online school all I wanted was to be in person and I'm glad I have that.

Maybe I just have my rose colored glasses on but I remember the online school days really fondly tbh. 

I think the main reason why is because,, now that I'm in person again, everything is almost too much. We went from basically 0-100 and now I'm really overstimulated and just kind of exhausted. And I'd rather be bored and under-stimulated than be overwhelmed, u get me?

Because back then, any kind of social interaction really meant something. I really cherished it. Like Japanese Conversation Club meetings used to be some of the only things getting me through the week. To hop on the zoom call and all my friends are there and we just do an activity and then chill afterward; back when I was alone that shit used to rlly help me. I remember one time we played Among Us after the meeting and i felt on top of the world lmao. and now I can't even go to the meetings bc I have a 9am the next day.

When we would have the breakout sessions in a class and just talk about anything i remember mfs used to vent their whole life to me we wouldn't even be talking about the class and all that. 

Or like the youtube channel Genius did a virtual concert for The Kid Laroi and that show was literally soooooo much fucking fun I paid $5 to get into the ""backstage"", which was really just a zoom call with Laroi and a bunch of fans, but it filled a void, yk what I mean? 

And im not even gonna lie, i miss my mama and my dad bro. I got annoyed over the summer months bc,, idek man sometimes u just get into it w: ur family it is what it is. But i miss them i wanna go on a car ride w/ my dad talk about music w/ my mom bro,,

And i never really had friends in my hometown but being locked in my room during quarantine kinda made me go find some. I made friends w/ some ppl from my work and as the world opened up i used to go on hikes or go to diners and shit w/ them. I used to think my hometown was just a generic suburb with a bunch of nothing but they really showed me how to find fun in the small things. I miss tF out of them im probably gon call one of them up after i post this shit

Its just like nowadays people come and go bc it just matches with the pace of life. and I enjoy them being here but being back in person really made me realize the impermanence of everything. I just feel like everything is happening so fast and I'm exhausted. i wish I got some time to adjust back to everything.",1634488293,1,0

The internet speeds on campus are absolutely horrific!,"The first thing I did when I came to Rutgers was do a Speedtest. I can't barely get more than 100mbps up or down at any student center, building, or library! I feel like that is unacceptable. Most of the time, it is even less than that. Here is a [Speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net/result/c/8644734d-1178-4af8-b7ac-4d70e29ca323) from Cook Student Center when there was barely anyone there. I couldn't have a Zoom call a few minutes after that and had to use my hotspot to finish up the meeting. Even at Student Centers, the speeds are still unacceptable to have Zoom calls for classes and stuff. My professors are cutting out, ""internet connection is unstable,"" I've missed important information, have had trouble taking quizzes, and so much more. On a good day, I can maybe get speeds of 80mbps+, but most of the times, the internet sucks. I've tried College Ave, Livi, Busch, and Cook/Douglass and the speeds are all the same and are not acceptable in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, you can always ethernet in, but I don't feel like that is a perfect solution because it's just one more thing to carry around for an ethernet port you may or may not find. If I can't even have a Zoom meeting without interruptions, I feel like that's a big problem. I've tried it in different places on different campuses, and sometimes, it's better, but the problem is consistent and that's really annoying. I can barely watch my lectures at 2x speed or skip around to certain points in the lecture without a massive delay. Maybe I'm just using to decent internet in other places, but I'm sort of annoyed with what Rutgers offers us because it isn't even adequate for online classes, let alone majors that have require a very good connection for their projects.",1632529621,1,0

Spring 2022 Application,Hi everyone! I submitted an application to transfer to Rutgers-NB in the spring and I was wondering if anyone knows how long they take to get back to you with a decision? I know since I submitted before October 1st that I'm guaranteed a decision by Dec. 1st but I'm an anxious person so I'm hoping someone with experience can share if they let us know sooner than December. I read online that it can take two to three weeks is this accurate? Thank you all for your time and I hope to join you in the Spring!,1632520978,1,0

Transferring from NJIT to Rutgers CS,"Hey guys, Im a sophomore at NJIT and I'm looking to transfer over to Rutgers in Spring 22'. I wanted to ask this reddit a few questions. Do most credits transfer over from NJIT to Rutgers? Do you think I can still graduate on time (spring 24')?. The classes I have taken so far are 

Calc I, II, III

Physics I,II

Physics Lab I,II

Chemistry 

Humanities I, II

20th Century World History 

Econ 

CS 100 ( Which is python so Im sure I probably won't get credit for this since it isn't offered at RU, but still glad Im taking it for the knowledge tbh)

CS 101 ( C++)

Fundementals of Engineeering Design

I have not taken Intro to Programming because I just recently changed my major from General Engineering to CS, So Ik I would be in the same spot at RU as NJIT. But will my credits transfer and is it possible to graduate on time? Also I read on another thread that I could possibly take 2 math classes that also count as credit for Discrete Solutions I &amp; II. Im also taking CALC 3 rn so I heard I could possibly finesse a math minor which would be dope.

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone in RU CS, how do you guys like it? Are there any internship probabilities ?

&amp;#x200B;

Would you guys recommend transferring for the spring or wait till fall?

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly I am in the EOF program at my school, I read somewhere online that it is possible to transfer schools and still maintain your EOF status. If that is true how do I go about doing that ?

ATTENTION FRESHMAN AND SOPHMORES,"Please learn bus etiquette. We are 4 weeks into the semester, it should not take this long to learn the basics.

When getting on a bus, let the people getting off GET OFF FIRST. When you try to push past them to get on the bus it wastes time and it just pisses people off. Wait your turn to get on the bus and everyone will be happy.

When getting on the bus at a full station, MOVE BACK AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. Move all the way to the back of the bus and sit in any available seat or stand where there is room. You are able to stand in the raised back section, it is not just there for decoration. When you block the steps or the door when getting on the bus, people are unable to get on behind you which means people are unable to get on at all.

To end this on a better note. A helpful tip that people may not have learned yet. Tap on a seat before sitting in it. Rutgers busses are known for dripping water on seats and it sucks when you sit down and stand up with wet pants. 

Bus etiquette will make everyone‚Äôs live more enjoyable while we all live and go to school together. Have a good semester.",1632453730,1,0

Cutting Weight in the Caf,"Hello, I want to cut weight but I don't know how it would go being that I only eat at the caf.

Right now I eat twice a day normally an omelet and potatoes in the morning and then just an absolute pile of food at night. My concern is calorie counting. Early in the semester, I struggled with not eating enough and would wake up in the middle of the night absolutely starving. I lift 3 days a week and roll Jiu-Jitsu 3 days a week.

Thanksgiving Professor Cards,"So this technically would be more appropriate during teacher appreciation week but that was back in May and I'll forget to make this post by that time next year.

The main idea is for this post is to have a bunch of comments that say something along the lines of ""I'm thankful for my Rutgers Professors because \[x\]"" It can be general or about specific professors.

As the week before Thanksgiving break comes closer, I'll make various posts with digital posters and cards that hopefully will show Rutger's facility that their hard work over the course of the entire pandemic is being recognized and appreciated. Also, Rutgers professors that brose this subreddit might get a needed morale boost.

Idk why, but ever since I got out of high school my perception of teaching as a career has really changed. I've learned to see teachers as multi-dimensional people instead of just some random adult that's supposed to spout a bunch of info on a topic and not care about me or if I understand the info. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of teachers/professors that clearly do not care about their job or if students' needs are being met but they still deserve some recognition. 

TL;DR: I want to help spread good vibes to professors this coming thanksgiving.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø",1635559367,1,0

conflicted on chem 2 professor choice,"I was checking out the schedule of classes for chem 2 next semester: for context, I'm a freshman that ap'ed out of gen bio/gen chem, and I'm taking gen physics right now. I want to take chem 2, because the year I took the AP exam (covid) they cut out a lot of the material that is fundamental to chem 2 and I feel like it would be beneficial to take it again just to refresh myself. There are three professors, Guerra, Langowski, and Kimmel. I've heard that langowski is the best, but I'm not really a morning person, the lectures are on cook douglass, and it is 4 times a week including recitation. Kimmel has classes only 3 times a week including recitation, and it is on my campus (livi) so that makes it convenient. If I'm pretty confident in my chemistry abilities would it be a bad idea to go with Kimmel over langowski?

1) How much has changed following the recent faculty changes? From what I've heard, there have been a number of outgoings and incomings in the teaching staff. If you could clue me in on what changed, and if there are any differences in instruction I would appreciate it.

2) What is the workload like? By all accounts it seems like a tough and rigorous program, but is it to the point where there's almost no free time available? If so, this would pose a bit ot an issue for me since I would like to balance acting with my aspirations in writing novels and plays.

Will I not be able to make friends if I don't have an iPhone,"Hi, I'm an international student joining Rutgers this spring.

This sounds kinda ridiculous, but I've talked to some American friends too and they've told me that all their friends use iPhones and iMessage (they're in high school though). I just wanna know if this is actually true or if its just a few isolated cases coming together to seem like a big problem. I currently have an Android and I'm pretty happy with it, and I don't want to ask my parents for a new phone. But I also don't want to feel like an outcast.

The thing is, I am very serious about my education.

What are some other things I should know about New Brunswick versus Newark?,"I'm a high school senior who thankfully got accepted into both New Brunswick and Newark. **I plan on majoring in computer science, and possibly double majoring in CS and Math as well.**

I'm trying to decide which one to go to, and I have a list of pros and cons for both.

# New Brunswick:

**Pros:**

1. Very nice campus.
2. Generally smarter students here.
3. More resources, since it's the biggest campus.

**Cons:**

1. Unfortunately a big one. It's a 1.5-hour-commute by train. Well first, I'm gonna have to drive 10 minutes to the train station, but I would have to pay the parking fee  to park at the train station. My mom says that she can drive me to the train station, but I feel bad about waking her up early (I also don't know what my dad is gonna think about me making my mom wake up early to take me there). She wakes up at around 7 am, and she works at home, so she would have to wake up probably  an hour earlier when she has to take me to my 8 AM classes. And I heard she's gonna do hybrid working by early next year, so I don't know if she can drive me to the train station.

I absolutely cannot drive all the way to New Brunswick, because the car I'm gonna get when I get my license is from 2005 and is on its last legs. My parents say it's too unsafe to drive that far.

2. I cannot have a job while working. I was kind of wanting one. Another option I had for transportation was to just buy a new car to drive there, but I can't do that without a job, because my parents aren't rich enough to buy me a car. I don't really care about buying personal things for myself, the job would just  be for a car.

3. Not allowed to have a second major or even a minor, which my parents told me. If I'm gonna have to spend a total of 3 hours everyday commuting, they told me I could not handle that much commuting AND all the work with two majors.

4. I probably won't have the time to do any clubs.

# Newark

**Pros:**

1. Simply closer, close enough to drive to. A half-hour drive.
2. Am allowed to have a job at Newark.
3. Am allowed to have a second Mathematics major.

**Cons:**

1. The campus is just... terrible. It looks like a community college. And the city is just so... run-down, and filthy, and ugly. Horrible.
2. No BS degrees offered at Newark
3. Not as much resources. 
4. My siblings go here already. 

In short, at New Brunswick, I like the environment FAR more than at Rutgers, and I feel like the campus and student body is the biggest reasons why I'm considering New Brunswick, but I'm worried that it'll simply be too impractical to commute a total of 3 hours everyday. At Newark, it'll simply be easier to commute there, but I honestly loathe the campus, and I want to be surrounded by students smarter than me. All the high-performing students go to Newark.

But what else do I need to know about both schools? I need to really think about my decision.",1640839703,1,0

But what's Intro to the Study of Languages like? I didn't want to take it, but it's a prerequisite for some of the Spanish linguistic courses like Spanish Phonology &amp; Phonetics.

Also, has anyone taken the Spanish court interpreting class? What's that like?

I also saw there's a Don Quixote class, and I really want to take it, but you need to take a Spanish literature course as a prerequisite, and idk about that. I took AP Spanish Lit my senior year of high school, and I only got an A because my teacher literally didn't grade anything. I don't know if I'd survive a Spanish lit class, because I'm not good with a lot of reading. Idk if it'd be worth it though, because I really enjoyed reading Don Quixote, but do I really wanna take a literature prerequisite. If I do though, which one seems most do-able? here are the options:

Graduate schools offer these options, as do community colleges. Want to show up? Great. Want to stay at home and watch a recording after work or simply because you were sick and had to miss class? Great. Tuition money is tuition money.

Help: roommate is a sociopathic creep,I've done everything I can to discourage him but he doesn't get it and it only gets worse the more I make it clear I want nothing to do with him.  And to make matters worse I increasingly get the impression he spreads rumors about me when I reject him because after I do so I seem to get hit on by guys a lot the next day.  I've been trying to bear it gracefully but am done with it.  The first day it was cold and rainy he stood in front of an open wind for hours until he got a cough then started calling people until I called him out on trying to make himself sick and he gave me that hand caught in the cookie jar look.  I can hear him pause outside my door frequently and think he hacked my wifi so I only use a wired connection.  I'm open to any reasonable suggestion at this point.,1636725158,1,0

Places on Campus Where I Can Use A Mac? [CS Use Case],"So, I currently have a MacBook as my daily computer. Recently, with the transition to M1, I've been having a lot of work flow issues with my Intel Mac, along with some other problems specific to my use case. Because of that, I've been thinking about selling my current Mac and getting something like the Framework because I love the idea of that laptop and it genuinely seems interesting.

However, one of the main reasons I got a Mac was so that I could learn Swift and use Xcode to develop for iOS and Mac. I still want to sell my laptop, but I want to have a backup in case I can't get a Hackintosh image running on the Framework.

So, is there a place on campus where I can use a Mac? Will it let me install Xcode and/or have Xcode installed? I am a CS Student, so maybe if there are Mac machines specific to CS students that I could go use?

Scheduling Help - Biological Sciences (Please Help LOL),"Hello, Im trying to make my schedule for the spring and I need some help. So Im a sophmore and including this fall semester I have completed 69 credits. I have done most of my SAS core classes except for my HST, 2 writing courses. Classes for my major I need to complete are, orgo, orgo lab, physics, physics labs, 3 labs, 20 credits of life sciences, and 14 credits of upper level courses. 

Next semester I was planning to take essentials of cell bio and neuro, genetics labs, orgo 1, and history and work in the US 1880 to 1945. That would take care of 1 lab, 1 orgo, 3 credits of life sciences, 1 HST, and 1 writing course.

I wanted to take any easy semester to focus on orgo. I need to take one more class to pass 12 credits. Now my question is do I have enough time (Junior and Senior year) To finish my life science, upper level courses, physics, and labs? Is there enough time to finish those requirements comfortably and graduate on time? If not should I add another science class this semester or should I get an easy class and focus on orgo and cell bio and neuro?

What is the best way to study for orgo 1 and Gen physics 1?,"I‚Äôm currently taking organic chem 307 as well as gen physics 203 and I‚Äôm having a hard time managing these two classes since they‚Äôre both very time consuming. For physics, I‚Äôve been watching the videos on the physics website and attending lectures but whenever I complete the textbook/homework problems they‚Äôre a lot more complex than the ones in the videos and I always feel like there are some gaps in my knowledge of the material. As for orgo, I don‚Äôt really know what else to do besides going to lecture, completing the textbook problems, and watch YouTube videos if I need further clarification of the material. Also, I don‚Äôt really have a set study schedule since it takes me a while to do my homework and I end up having to change my schedule everyday.

For those who managed to get a high grade in either of these classes, please let me know what helped you study/prepare for exams and quizzes and what is the best way to study?",1631472480,1,0

My thoughts regarding testing,"I know there was a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/pkproo/covid_testing_petition_thread/) here recently regarding requiring testing regardless of vaccination status, and I just wanted to share my opinion on this. I like the idea of mandatory testing so we have more transparency on the covid situation at Rutgers, but if we were to implement this, we NEED to know the severity of the cases reported. The vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent infection, but instead work to prevent you from getting sick, and work *really* well against severe outcomes and death. As a result, if case numbers are high but severe outcomes and death remain relatively low, it means the vaccine is doing its job.

If we were to implement mandatory testing regardless of vaccination status, we need a breakdown of the case count, with information such as how many of these are asymptomatic, or only had mild symptoms. I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/p476e4/some_encouraging_news/) on this a while ago, but last month there were covid clusters reported at duke university, but most cases were asymptomatic and even if not, they only had mild symptoms. This shows that the vaccine is doing its job.

In summary, I believe that mandatory testing is good in theory, but ONLY if we get a breakdown on case severity. We want mandatory testing to feel more reassured about the covid situation at Rutgers, and seeing real-time evidence of the vaccine doing its job will hopefully give us some reassurance. On the other hand, if we only get a raw case number every week with no context, it could easily have the opposite effect and cause people to panic.

I Have One Fear...,""" Classes at Connecticut College will be remote and students are in what the school is calling cautionary quarantine after dozens of students tested positive for COVID-19. ""

""... students who had contracted the virus had been socializing in cars, in friends‚Äô rooms or apartments, at parties or in bars without wearing a mask."" 

""Connecticut College students were required to get vaccinated before returning to campus and very few were exempt. According to a spokesperson for the college, about 98 percent to 99 percent of the student body is fully vaccinated against COVID-19...most of the students who tested positive this week were vaccinated and the cases are a direct result of not following masking protocols.""

Transferring after 1 semester?,"I'm a freshman at Montclair State  and I want to transfer to Rutgers. I wanted to know if I should apply for SAS NB Spring 2022 for transfer or wait till a later date. I was unsure of what I wanted to major in so I applied as undecided for the Fall 2021 semester, but I was not accepted. I was accepted at SAS Newark but ended up choosing Montclair instead. I recently decided to major in Computer Science, and wanted to transfer to Rutgers NB since their CS program is better (and the in-state tuition.)

I understand that they will look at my high School grades since I graduated in the last two years. My unweighted GPA was about 3.1 and weighted was 3.42 (at the time of applying for Fall 2021, it was about 3.19) , as well as a 1250 on the SAT. I didn't focus on school my freshman/soph years but I am confident that I can finish the semester with a great GPA. 

I understand that CS credits tend not to transfer so I wonder if it'd be better if I transferred earlier into my 4 years so I won't lose as many if I were to transfer later(please correct me if I'm wrong).  If it helps, the courses I'm in for this semester are

* Fundamentals of Programming I (Java Course)
* Python Programming I
* Fundamentals of Speech
* College Writing I
* Applied Precalculus (I took Precalc in High School but they put me in here since the Calc I classes were full. I'm still seeing if someone will drop one of the classes so I can take Calc I, which isn't looking good unfortunately, or if I can take it at a community college and transfer it over.)
* And a 1-credit New Student Seminar which I heard doesn't transfer

I'm not sure so any advice is greatly appreciated.",1631377941,1,0
