Announcing intabs - The ultimate companion to finding your next internship!,"With recruiting season kicking off, we’re so excited to share [intabs.io](http://intabs.io/) with you all – a site designed to make your internship search easier!

We’re a team of CS students that have gone through the struggle of finding an internship, from trying to find up-to-date salaries on cluttered job sites, to searching through months of Discord or Reddit posts to learn more about the role.

We built intabs to alleviate some of these pains – you can think of this site as an all-in-one “Glassdoor for interns”, with curated reviews, salaries, and timelines from real students and just for interns.

Here are some of the features you’ll be able to use right now:

* Search for company salaries by graduation date and season
* Share reviews of the best (and especially the worst) places to work anonymously
* Prepare for your upcoming interviews by viewing previously asked questions
* Discover when people are getting online assessments, interviews, or offers
* Keep track of the status of your applications with built-in process tracking

We’re working hard to keep our site updated, and we currently have over 400 salaries, 100 job postings, and 300 reviews from current students and past megathreads. If you have any salaries or reviews you’d like to share, we would really appreciate it if you add them as well to help grow the community.

Check out intabs [here](http://intabs.io/)! To anyone looking for an internship in the future we hope that you find this helpful – we're always trying to improve our site, so we would love to hear your thoughts and feedback below.

Thanks!

MS MS&amp;E Admissions (fulltime vs. HCP/part-time)?,"Hello all! I hope all is well and that you guys are staying safe and healthy. I'm interested in applying for the MS in MS&amp;E for Autumn 2022 and have an important question:  


I graduated undergrad this past June and have been working as an Associate Product Manager at a Big N tech company but now leaving to work on my own startup that I fortunately just raised money for. My question is: would you guys recommend I apply for full-time or HCP? Candidly, my startup and team will be fully remote for the foreseeable future so technically I have the bandwidth to apply to either as I'm local in the Bay Area as well. From a bandwidth/workload perspective, either works fine for me. I just don't want to send a ""bad signal"" or what have you so frankly I'm open to whatever the admissions team believes best fits my application better.",1633395314,1,0
Advice for an East Coast kid hesitant to be so far from home?,"Posting for child who prefers TikTok and doesn’t yet appreciate the power that is Reddit.

“Trying to decide where to apply early decision. The final 4 are Brown, Stanford, Wash U in St Luis, and Yale. 

Brown and Yale are currently highest ranked, mostly because they are a few hours from my apartment now. However, literally every family member is leaving NYC when I go to college. There are so many things about Stanford and Wash U that make them a great fit for me, but they are so far from home. Has anyone had that anxiety? Did you find a way to overcome it?

Background. NYC specialized high school senior, IB diploma, queer, suffers from diagnosed anxiety, really loves cats. Planning to study psychology. Only travel was back and forth between Florida and New York for a decade of acrimonious divorce and custody battles and forced visitation. Travel for me, at least right now, is not an activity associated with good experiences. Can’t bring the cats. 

I also don’t know how to ride a bike. Or drive. And I don’t drink. 

They’re all exceptional schools, and they’re all incredibly hard to get into. Stanford has arguably the best psych program in the world. It also seems to be the only school that openly states financial aid considers cost of living adjustments. I’ve done pretty extensive research (Gsheet, url links, color coding, conditional cell formatting, and weighted averages). I want my first shot to be my best, but I also want to make sure it’s the right target.

I find myself wishing there were some sort of club or group chat or discussion group where we could feel comfortable socially/emotionally regressing and talking/acting like children, without having to worry about having to be mature and logical and grown-up and normal. I feel like I missed that fundamental stage of development and need to go back and figure things out from there.

I'll try to set up a CAPS appointment when I can, but for now I'm just trying to see if there's anyone else out there with these sort of needs, since having a supplementary mutual support base probably can help in ways that CAPS by itself cannot.

Hate how isolating EVGR can be,"I’m normally a social butterfly, but COVID/shit from this summer has made me so tired to do anything other than study. Like I can’t do small talk anymore, I can’t wade through shallow friendships rn to get to good ones, even if that’s what needs to happen. 

Living in EVGR doesn’t help. Last and only time I went to a call out, I ended up sitting with the RA and their grad friends which ugh just made me feel so awkward. 

EVGR is so nice but there’s no community and it feels like everyone else has friendships already in place. I love this school but part of me hopes that I find some community and it gets better or I can be reassigned to diff housing, cause I’d rather have better friendships with people in my dorm than my own bathroom at this point.

As an incoming post-doctoral scholar, I was wondering what the best way to get gym access at Stanford is. I'm looking for very basic stuff for strength training (a couple of weights and bars let's say).

I know there are subscriptions that contain bundles with more stuff that I may not need, so I was wondering if access to ACSR can be done with membership to just that (or even if my Stanford ID lets me get access without further memberships?)

Also, are there other recommendations for alternative places with basic equipment?

"Stanford MSEE: Admissions, MSCS Overlap, MEng","Hello. I am a recent Computer Engineering graduate from a reputable university now working as a software engineer. I am currently looking to apply into Stanford MSEE and had a couple questions regarding the program.

1. From my research online, the acceptance rate to Stanford MSEE is roughly 16%. Is this correct? And as an undergraduate, my cGPA is only 3.3 (tough adjustment, but gradually improved from to sessional GPA 4.0), but I have decent work experience and extracurriculars. Will Stanford consider the difficulty of my program at a prestigious university (in comparison to better grades at a lesser university)? How heavily is the GPA weighted?
2. For my three letters of recommendation, I have a PHD graduate who was also a capstone project advisor and two professors. From my research, it seems that professors are preferred because they are more reputable. Is it worthwhile to keep the PHD graduate who knows me better, in hopes of a more personable recommendation, over just another professor I happened to take a course with?
3. Any key tips or pointers for the statement of purpose? I understand the general intent is to demonstrate purpose and passion in the field, but is there any advice you would give to a potential student beyond the general stuff?
4. I am more of a software guy, but open to some parts of electrical engineering. As an MSEE, would I be allowed to take some CS courses as well? And would I be able to cater my curriculum a bit more towards software/hardware? The reason I am applying to MSEE, and not MSCS, is because of (nominally) easier admissions and my aversion to advanced, theoretical mathematics such as proofs.
5. I just wanted to confirm that MSEE is indeed a course-based program. And if this is the case, why is the program not considered a course-based MEng as opposed to a research-based MS?

Thank you if you read all of this. And I apologize in advance if any of these questions are bad. Any feedback or guidance is much appreciated.",1633146126,1,0

Laptop recommendations,"Hi folks,

I’m looking for a good laptop for a family member (not living in the US) with the following criteria that isn’t a MacBook (we’re leaning towards a MacBook Air, but would like to explore other options as the size isn’t ideal)

Thought this might be a good place to ask :)

This is the criteria:
- target price: $1000 with a max of $1400
-screen size at least 14 inches, around 15.6 is ideal
- will be used for reading, writing, researching (general college stuff), but nothing too heavy like graphics (maybe a bit of coding). They are considering doing bioinformatics as a career later, but I don’t think this requires a super substantial amount of compute power
- durability is an important factor

Help deciding which linear algebra course to take,"Hello, 

I am a rising sophomore looking to major in CS (AI concentration). Of course, linear algebra is pretty useful for what I want to do so I need to learn it eventually. My math background is up to multivariable calc. 

I thought about doing math 51 last fall (frosh year) but decided to do math 21 instead due to several reasons such as adjusting to college, supposedly worse curve in Fall, etc. Overall I disliked Math 21 and it was my worst class. College math was a step up for me even at the Math 21 level. Because of this, I focused on other academic areas and did not take any more math classes my frosh year (this was also partly due to the fact that I wasn't looking to take M51 online). 

This brings us to the present in which I am in a bit of a pickle and quite frankly, not that great of a situation. I don't remember all of calculus in great detail and my math thinking isn't too sharp right now I suppose. 

So what should I take between Math 51, ENGR 108, and Math 104?

I am leaning towards ENGR 108 since it looks a little more applied than theoretical and has applications to keep up the interest. Would this course be easier than Math 51? I know M51 is a pre-req but the course description states the LA concepts are built from scratch. Say I take ENGR 108 as my only LA class... can I get away with that with a little bit of self-study? Maybe ENGR 108 then a course like CS 205L or EE 263? 

I am also hesitant about Math 51 because of the fall curve, notorious difficulty, and the multivariable might overlap with what I already know (though I am sure I forgot the details of some things). 

Another thought is to jump into Math 104 possibly next quarter and learn some of the prereq material (I believe the syllabus stated a brief list of particular concepts one must be familiar with). 

I think an optimal route might be to do engr 108 this quarter to get a feel for LA than jump into Math 104 next quarter. Is this a viable option or would I still be missing some prereq content for math 104? Maybe even ENGR 108 --&gt; Math 51 --&gt; Math 104? 

It seems I am beating around the bush of math 51 here so please let me know if I should just take that instead.

It would be nice if Stanford just had one set linear algebra class to take that doesn't throw in calc things in there too. Of course that stuff is useful for AI though.

Open to any thoughts.

[Guide] Approaching Math 51,"There have recently been lots of posts on here about Math 51, so I wanted to compile a list of answers to some common questions. For reference, I took Math 51 in the Fall with Christian Taylor. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Is Math 51 hard?**

Math 51 isn’t easy, but I wouldn’t call it hard. Math 51 is difficult but fair. Most of us went through high school without struggling academically, so Math 51 catches many of us off guard. The class is fast-paced with lots of new content being introduced weekly, and the concepts take time to fully understand. Despite all that, Math 51 never seemed unreasonable, neither in terms of difficulty nor workload. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Is Math 51 curved?**

This question has caused lots of debate on this subreddit. Many past students have said that Math 51 downcurves, which leads me to believe that this was at some point true; however, Math 51 DOES NOT downcurve any longer. During my class, Dr. Taylor explicitly stated that Math 51 would either upcurve or would have no curve, but the curve would never hurt your grade. Whether or not there is an upcurve depends on the average of the class.

For those unfamiliar, downcurving is when a high average would result in grades being DECREASED to reduce the number of As given in the class. An upcurve is consequently when a low average would result in grades being INCREASED to increase the number of As, and no curve is simply your grades as-is. 

Another common misconception is that the assignments are curved. While this may have also been true at some point, Math 51 does not curve homework, quizzes, or tests. Rather, it is the final grade that is curved. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Is Math 51 harder in the Fall Quarter?**

This is a question that I wish had been better answered when I was taking 51. The content is NOT harder in the Fall quarter (although instruction quality may vary by professor). What makes the Fall seemingly harder is that the students taking 51 in the Fall are often more advanced, which results in higher grade averages and thus “ruins the curve”. I do believe there is some validity to this. When I took Math 51 in the Fall, there were several students who already had a background in linear algebra. When final grades were released, the curve was a decimal. Compare this to Math 51 in the Winter, where the grade averages were lower on each exam/quiz, and the curve was large enough to move students up a letter grade (or so I’m told). 

Despite the worse curve in Fall, this does not mean that it is impossible to get an A. Even without any background in linear algebra, I still managed to pull through with an A, as did many other students. The lack of a curve simply means that your grade is less influenced by the performance of other students, which is not necessarily bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Should I take Math 51 in the Fall or Winter?**

If your schedule allows it, I would recommend taking 51 in the Fall. Math 51 is a requirement of many STEM majors, and it’s best to get through it as soon as possible. The goal of many majors is to get through the Math 50 Series by the end of your Freshman year, and starting in the Fall will help you stay on track. At the end of the day, the curve during Winter quarter is not worth putting off 51 for another quarter. You’ll also notice that by the end of the 50 Series, the difference between those students with a background in linear algebra and those without is minimal. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Will I be behind if I take 51 in the Winter?**

In the short-term, yes. I would under no circumstances recommend doubling up on Math 50 classes, so you will likely be behind in math for a quarter. In the long-term, no. Unless you’re a Math major, being behind a quarter on Math classes is not a huge issue because you’ll catch back up fairly quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

**Should I take Math 21 or Math 51?**

Once again, Math 51 is a requirement for many majors, so you’ll have to take it at some point. Taking 21 just to delay the inevitable is not an advisable choice. If you have taken AP Calculus AB, then I would recommend 51. (The course also recommends AP Calculus BC, but I never saw much need for the content.) The Math Placement Test is also helpful for deciding, and it is worth noting that you are NOT restricted by your placement results.

&amp;#x200B;

**Should I take Math 51 or CME 100?**

I have never taken CME 100, so this information comes from my ADA. If you know you’re going into engineering, then CME 100 is better suited for you. If you’re not completely certain, then take 51. Most engineering classes will accept Math 51 or CME 100, whereas most non-engineering STEM classes (i.e. physics, math) will only accept Math 51.

Alternative Math Courses beyond 51/61 for Frosh,"Hey y'all,

Current profro (soon-to-be frosh!) here finally taking a look at courses in preparation for enrollment during NSO, and it seems that most, if not all, freshmen who have studied at least calculus in high school end up taking the 50 series or 60 CM/DM series.

Initially, I was planning on taking 61 DM, but after taking a look at the homework from the [class homepage](http://stanford.edu/~jacobfox/61DM) from 2018, It didn't seem as if I'd be able to learn much from the course.

I am a rising sophomore and I still do not have my major and future plans stuff figured out, and I am starting to get a little concerned. My frosh year was not super productive in terms of figuring things out. I was absolutely miserable staying in my room all year and I did not take full advantage of different opportunities and classes to narrow down my interests. I understand that I am young and I am not supposed to have things figured out but I seriously do not want to just wander around for another year taking classes in different fields and hoping that I get some a-ha moment and suddenly figure out my life. I do not have a great idea of what my specific interests are, what my skills/talents are, and as a result I am struggling to go about picking a major and career plan for after university. All I want is a concrete goal for the next few years so I can then work my ass off and try to achieve it instead of just going about things with little direction.

Does anyone have experience starting with Math 61CM during your first year?,"I'm a freshman who is trying to decide between the different math sequences. I'm still undecided on my major, but it probably will be something related to math (not sure about doing a math major though). My high school didn't have a lot of math classes and only went up to AP Calculus BC, which I got a 5 on. I don't have much experience doing proofs besides what I learned in my geometry classes, but we did go over basic things like proof by induction, etc., and I definitely want to learn more about proofs. I took the math placement exam and it suggested that I take Math 51 (I don't think that exam can even place you into the Math 60s sequences?). 

However, I saw that the only prerequisite for the Math 61CM sequence is a 5 on the Calculus BC exam. Looking over the syllabus, the class definitely seems interesting to me, since I am very interested in learning about proofs. I also saw that you have quite a while to drop down to MATH 51 if you think the class is too difficult (you have until you get your first midterm grade back I believe). I decided to register for MATH 61CM with Jonathan Luk because of this safety net, but I'm still really worried that the class might be way too difficult for me. I also heard that everyone who takes the MATH 60s sequence is a crazy math nerd who has a ton of prior math experience, and I'm really worried that I'll be on the lower end of the curve with my background.

How possible is it for someone to shift from career in HCI to Private Equity?," 

Professionals in Human Computer Interaction help in creating websites and apps for tech companies, SaaS cos, FMCG companies, etc; which is using the ideas of 'mass psychology' for commerce.

Using the skills accrued while working in HCI, MBA should help get the aptitude to slide into Private Equity; as managing / flipping a business is largely about knowing market consumption i.e. what market wants and cash flows  
(not entirely though, talent management and etc too are required);  
Hence, an HCI degree will have transferrable skills of how consumption works and then MBA will help get foot in the door for buy side finance.

I have a degree in finance from a regular college in Mumbai with a 3.0 GPA. Worked in State Street Bank for a year and then slid into advertising during the pandemic. Private Equity takes the elite of the elite of B School recruits and the aim is to sharpen your profile as one, hence I chose HCI as it is a easy transition for me as I am already doing the same work in advertising. The intent is to have a great profile and preferentially work in Management Consulting (as Accenture and BCG too have Ux roles) to sharpen up my profile and skills in making products for mass consumption and then get my MBA to transition in Private Equity

My questions

1. How possible is it?
2. What do I have to be prequalified with before applying for an MBA? Would CFA work? (large part of that is corporate finance)...Would courses from Wall Street Oasis, Peak Frameworks, Corporate Finance Institute work?
3. Do they need pre MBA industry experience or will it be the same ritual ie working in M&amp;A for an investment bank first after MBA and then get in PE after some experience?

Also, the aim for MBA is either Ivy League like Stanford or bust",1636649999,1,0

Research position in SAIL as a sophomore with minimal AI experience,"I'm a sophomore really interested in doing CS research, preferably in AI, starting winter quarter. The only CS courses I've taken so far have been the core courses, since I wanted to get a strong foundation first.

For some SAIL groups, they explicitly ask for 200-level AI courses (221, 229, 224N etc) on their applications. For others, any underclassmen in the lab seem to have done AI research before (like ISEF). 

**Given my background, is it reasonable for me to reach out to professors in SAIL?** If so, which ones? Even if I do get a position, I'm worried I may not be adequately prepared to actually contribute.

After tons of researching about which major to choose, I dropped my pin at the Design and Innovation, starting out by looking at the curriculum and work culture of EDI at Northwestern and Design Impact at Stanford.

Loneliness at Stanford," Hi everyone! 

My name is Noah and I am a senior undergraduate in anthropology. Over the past few years, I've been working on a project trying to better understand the issue of loneliness at Stanford (as well as to raise awareness).

I know from having done some interviews that loneliness is a very significant issue for some on campus, but I still feel like I haven't reached enough people. Because loneliness is something that doesn't get discussed a lot at Stanford, it has been difficult to develop a broad perspective.

To that end: if you are a graduate or undergraduate who has been dealing with loneliness or social disconnection, I would be grateful to hear from you. I of course understand this is a sensitive issue. Everything would be totally anonymous and I have no right to judge :)

If you are interested, I have a very open quarter and would love to do a brief informal interview via phone or zoom. Ethnographic interviews are open-ended and we can talk about whatever you'd like. I'm really just trying to round out my understanding to help improve campus mental health.

Feel free to reach me on Reddit, or by email. My full name is Noah Louis-Ferdinand.",1635886386,1,0

what to do on a day trip to Stanford?,"hey all, im a ucsc student visiting stanford this saturday for the w soccer game against berkeley. im a huge stanford woso fan but this is my first time actually going to watch a stanford game in person and i wanted to make a day trip out of it. 

so i was wondering what i should do in the area for fun on my lil trip. i’m not really that interested in the campus unless there’s something i absolutely *must* check out. but if y’all have good food recommendations in the area, nice parks to visit, a cool downtown area, etc. lmk. i have a car so i can do whatever. 

also lmk if there’s anything to be aware of in terms of going to woso games ? like should i get there super early? is the game gonna be packed bc its against cal? is parking hard to find? im hoping to make this a more regular thing cause ucsc isnt rly big on sports. thank you all!

Struggles and experience with STEM courses,"Hi, I went to university (comp sci and applied math) about 15 years ago. This summer, I took the coursera machine learning course and wonder if the struggle moments are something others feel in STEM courses. Reading Malcolm Gladwell's, Outliers, book gives me hints others do. If you have 10 minutes and are comfortable sharing, please comment or DM me.

When you last went to (or watched) a STEM lecture. Did you experience any of these? If yes, describe what happened (DM might be more appropriate)

1. I was stuck but then realized it was because:  
the teacher wrote something wrong.  
the teacher forgot to tell us something.  
the teacher implied it but never said or wrote it.
2. I asked other students:  
if they wanted to share notes.  
if they wanted to share ways to better understand the lesson.
3. I felt slow, behind, inadequate, stuck, lost, or didn’t belong.
4. I  ran out of time to learn to the level I expected.
5. I felt I couldn’t do it, so I switched to something else.

How much time (i.e. 20 min, 2 hours) did you spend on

1. rewriting the class-provided notes into your own?
2. rewriting your own notes you took during class?
3. writing notes from assigned reading?
4. practising and studying from your notes?(i.e. how to get from this to that)
5. other, I work differently…tell me more",1635687570,1,0

Voluntary Research Study,"Hi everyone! (Moderator approved)

My name is Cici; I'm an MS student at Palo Alto University, assisting a clinical psych PhD student specializing in chronic pain/illness. I am recruiting for a voluntary, brief online intervention for chronic pain as part of a PhD dissertation, testing whether the intervention would be helpful for people to regain parts of their life lost to their pain.

Good LOR from Community College Professor vs. mediocre LOR from university Professors,"I attended a community college before I transferred to UC Berkeley, where I will be getting a degree of science in EECS. I am applying to some Computer Science master's programs this fall, and I need three letters of recommendation. On one hand, I can ask for letters from my teachers in community college, with whom I have forged very good relationships. I have TA'ed for them for a few semesters, and they know me really well. In other words, their letters would be personal and strong. On the other hand, I have also found some professors at UC Berkeley who are willing to write me a letter. However, they barely know me. The only connection between us is that I did well in their classes. The letters they write will be simple and short.

I am graduating soon, so doing things to bond with professors for the sake of good letters is too late now. I'm inclined to just have my CC teachers write my letters(only 1 of them have a Ph.D.), but I'm also worried that in this case, none of the three letters would be coming from the institution I graduated from.

Which should I go with, CC letters or university letters?",1635199478,1,0

Schedule Advice -- Psych 50 for AI track CS major?,"I’m a sophomore CS major on the AI track, and I needed some help with my schedule. I’m currently planning on:

* Math 53
* CS 110
* CS 224N
* Psych 50

Some relevant courses I’ve already taken are CS 107e, CS 161, Stats 202, CS 221, CS 103, CS 109, Math 51, and Math 52. 

My main concern is Psych 50. I was originally thinking of adding either CS 234 or ENGR 40M instead of this class. However, CS 234 conflicted with the 110 section, and I was concerned that adding ENGR 40M might make my schedule too heavy. 

I just happened to find Psych 50 on ExploreCourses. I have no background at all in neuroscience / psychology, but looking at the course materials, it seems like the content could give a unique biological perspective on machine learning topics. At the same time, I really want to take courses that will help hone my technical skills. 

Are there any technical courses you recommend replacing Psych 50 with? Would you recommend a CS major interested in AI to take Psych 50?

SOS Housing Situation,"Hi everybody. I'm a current senior in a really hard situation. I drew into a subpar and very cramped spot on the row back in the summer, and though circumstances were conducive to it early in the quarter, a recent set of events has seriously begun to consume my mental health. I haven't been eating. I hardly been able to turn in assignments, and these past few nights have been some of the hardest ones I've had in all my time at Stanford. For context, I would agree to take a Math 51 exam every week for an entire quarter, if it meant I could have space to myself for the remainder of my final year here.

In the past month, I have already gone to my neighborhood's housing front desk, only to be referred to my neighborhood director, whose only assistance to date has been sympathy for my bad luck. I was referred also to R&amp;DE Housing Assignments, but they have fumbled communications and are not grasping the severity of the issue.

"Prospective ICME Masters student, few questions about the program and Honors Coop","I'm planning on applying and was hoping to chat with current students/alums about their experience with the program. I have a jack-of-all-trades background (Math/CS degree, lots of physics, some Applied Math) and got more interested in computational work towards the end of my undergrad. I've been working in tech since then and have been wanting to reconnect with academia - Stanford ICME Masters looks like a good fit for my interests, but I have a few questions.

I have some notion that many people do the part time Honors Coop with a CS Masters degree while working, but haven't heard about this for slightly niche programs like ICME. The ICME website indicates this is possible, but do you actually know of students who have done the part time co-op with ICME?

What kind of trajectories do ICME Masters students take? Do they tend to use the Masters as a jumping point to phd programs, or to industry? I already have a decent software job but with only a bachelor's, there's not really any path to jump to some of the really cool experimental/research teams within FAANG companies. I'm curious if ICME Masters students manage to connect with these research teams in industry, or if you need to be a phd student to get those roles.

I've been looking at the Data Science track and the general ICME track. Aside from a difference in course requirements, are the tracks ultimately that different in terms of opportunities, research prospects, cohort segregation etc...? 

I'd be very excited to hear your experiences, and happy to chat over dm's if that's your preference.",1637201785,1,0

"Stuck at a crossroads: professional development, or personal fulfillment? (New York vs Santiago)","**TLDR; I am struggling very hard to choose between my head (applying to Stanford in New York) and my heart (the BOSP Santiago program). The deadline for both is tonight; I can only choose one.** 

For context, I am a junior. I have been struggling a lot with my attempted transition from the creative sector to the private sector (think business operations). In short, I feel I don't have enough ""serious"" professional skills, and I've had a really difficult internship recruiting season this fall and lost some great opportunities because I lacked ""business experience."" As such, I feel a lot of anxiety when thinking about my future postgraduate opportunities.

In my head, I would like to go to New York this spring, get a Stanford-sponsored internship, and gain some more professional experience and training before applying for full-time jobs next fall. However, in my heart, I would really like to study abroad in Santiago. My family is from Latin America, but because I moved away when I was so young, I feel really disconnected from my extended family members (I am the only member of my family who cannot speak Spanish fluently). Furthermore, I would love the opportunity to travel and experience more of the world. 

However, I worry that I'll end up having a great cultural/soul-enriching experience in Chile and regret it when I end up not getting the kind of job I want in my senior year.

Questions about Stanford Biosciences PhD Home Programs,"Hey all, I'm applying to Stanford's Biosciences PhD program for Fall '22, and I've identified faculty I'd like to work with as well as done tons of research on the programs, but I'm still struggling with a couple things that I was hoping some of you might be able to provide some insight on?   


1. You can apply to two home programs within the Biosciences with one application. However, since it's one application, your recommenders can only send one letter. Would you suggest that I tell them to just broadly recommend me to the Biosciences PhD Program as a whole, or would it better if they mention one or both programs in the letter? 
2. The main reason I was curious about the above issue is I've identified 3 potential home programs I'd like to apply to, and I'm actually still struggling with which 2 would be best for me.   
For ease of explanation, the three programs are Immunology, Microbiology and Immunology, and Biochemistry.  
The professor that I am most excited about working with, currently resides in the Immunology department, which is why I think it would make sense to apply there, given I also have interest in other faculty in that department.   
However, I don't think that the immunology department itself would view me as a good fit since I don't have any background in immunology besides a class that I took and it's a very specialized competitive program.  
I think given my extensive background in biochemistry and microbiology/molecular biology, the other two home programs admissions teams would likely view me as a better fit for their programs and I feel (perhaps naively) my chances for admission are higher there. And I know that the Biosciences allow rotations in any other department, but I still don't know if they'll look at my application weirdly if I apply to these other programs, but I tell them that I'm really excited about working with this professor who's in the immunology department.   
Generally, I'm just interested in learning about how to apply research to address problems related to degenerative disease and aging, which is very interdisciplinary and wouldn't be constrained to any one of these topics, and because of that, I'm not sure if I should just go for the programs that get me the best chance of getting in since the program itself probably doesn't matter?  
**TLDR:** Should I pick the two home programs that are the best ""fit"" for my background/experience and maximize my chances of getting in OR pick the home program that I have no direct experience in, but contains the faculty I \*most\* (emphasis on most because there are faculty in all the programs I'm interested in) want to work with?  


I know this is a very specific question, and I hope this is the right place to ask this (Apologies if it isn't!). Any insight would be appreciated. Thank you!",1636902661,1,0

Hypergrowth crypto startup hiring,"Hey everyone,

Due to the remote environment, it’s hard to meet other fellow Stanford students especially like minded people in person so interested to gather feedback here.

In advance, sorry to be vague. It’s *extremely* easy to identify who I am and what startup we are due to the exposure we’re fortunate to have gotten within crypto. Happy to chat more via DMs but some notes about us:

Background —
- We’re a crypto startup working on a very nascent space with huge TAM; we basically created a new category and have found strong PMF in a mere few months. Growth is nuts on all sides so need to aggressively hire (team is in between 10-20 folks)
- Closing a massive yet to be announced fundraising round that will mint us as a unicorn in less than a year
- Compensation is actually top tier but full transparency we are very lean and heavily focus on low quantity but high quality folks; happy to share more via DM
- Backed by all A-list investors
- Great team that’s highly technical (all of us are) + strong backgrounds (FAANG/Unicorns/Top Quant firms)

Looking for —
- Strong fullstack engineers and/or backend engineers that specifically know or strong interest in learning Rust
- Will consider flexible work opportunities but dependent on the right people
- Fully remote anywhere for now open to change based on whatever the team wants
- Actually flat and try to avoid as much corporate BS as possible to focus on delivering value to users and the ecosystem

We move fast and although the problem we’re tackling is already rewarding, it’s also very difficult so strong engineering fundamentals are a must.

If you sound like you fit the above please DM me, I’d love to hear from you. It’ll definitely be worth your time.",1639388682,1,0

Internship Recommendations after LoA,"I am coming back to winter quarter after being on a leave of absence since fall quarter of 2020 (so 4 academic quarters off). I haven’t had a class with a professor at Stanford since early covid, and haven’t had a professor I connected with since the winter before that. 

I am hoping to apply for Stanford funded internships (specifically Cardinal Quarter/sig) style internships, but I’m wondering if it’s possible to have a non-Stanford letter of recommendation from my employer of the last year and a half, or if it would be better to have a professor who barely knows me. Do you think it would be possible to get an internship with a non-Stanford Rec letter?

How can I make the most out of Stanford to become actively detrimental to society?,"I’m a junior with a passion for societal harm, and I was wondering if you guys had any recommendations for classes, clubs, or other activities that I should pursue in order to maximize the damage I inflict upon society.

I’ve decided to major in CS, and I’m leaning towards the AI or HCI track. Last quarter I took Coding for Social Good to learn how to accomplish the contrary more effectively, and while the class provided a decent overview, I found it lacking in technical depth, particularly for the implementation of biased algorithms that achieve optimal racial prejudice. If anyone here is majoring in STS, I’d also be interested in hearing more about the tech-related social issues I could potentially help exacerbate.

I’m open to taking classes outside the major as well. Last year I took a few intro psych classes to better understand how to instil belief in fake news and drive political polarization in the United States. Looking ahead to future quarters I’d appreciate some suggestions for classes about the history of oppressed groups (maybe CSRE or FEMGEN?), as I’d like to gain better insight into the oppressor mindset and methodology (something that fulfils ED would be a bonus).

Career-wise I’m pretty undecided, but mishandling biometric information for a startup like Clearview AI seems appealing to me. Last summer I interned at a FAANG company but I was ultimately left disappointed by their respect for user privacy, feigned or not. On the entrepreneurial front, I considered hiring someone else to build me a quirky social media app that stores sensitive user data in a misconfigured database, but that seems to be a saturated market here at Stanford.

Any advice would be welcome - thanks in advance!",1640620176,1,0

Data Science/Machine Learning Interview Participation Request,"Good evening,

Among current circumstances, I hope this message finds everyone well. I am a current high school senior student in the state of Illinois seeking potential data science professionals or prospective data scientists willing to participate in an interview for my AP Research course. To provide a general overview, my institution is currently partnering with College Board's AP Capstone diploma, a diploma program that develops student’s skills in research, analysis, evidence-based arguments, collaboration, writing, and presenting skills based on two-long year courses: AP Seminar and AP Research.

As a student currently enrolled in the AP Research course, and an expected requirement, I am tasked with the year-long process of exploring an individual area of interest that may be an academic topic of choice, idea, or circumstantial issue. This year, I am centering my research on the effects traditional mathematics subjects retain in minority students academic success, primarily Latino(a) students and students of Hispanic origin, as well as assessing the measure of academic success of collegiate students or professionals in attaining a post-secondary education, degree, and/or career.

It is worth noting the State of Illinois does not offer any data science education within its public school districts, and is an objective I would like to have implemented in my community. I have tried to establish contact with potential participants, but have had no success. Therefore I have decided to post my objective here in hopes to gain participants. Though I am willing to take 20 participants who are interested, I am seeking those who have been previously enrolled in data science course throughout their secondary institution or enrolled in a current post-secondary DS course.

If you are interested in participating or know of those who may be interested, please do not hesitate to contact me for further information. I am more than willing to set up a date/time through either platform, Zoom and Google Meets, and address any questions or concerns.

Thank you for reading this lengthy post, and happy holidays!",1640406654,1,0

Should I return on time?,"Given the news the Stanford will hold the first two weeks of courses online, I am grappling with the decision of whether to return on time or wait until the 18th. Here is the basic gist of my circumstances:

* I will not be flying home (driving), and therefore have no obligation (and will not be affected financially either way) to set any plans in stone right now
* A vast majority of my courses will be music courses, and I will need continual access to very loud brass instruments multiple times a day, every day. Normally, I would be able to use practice rooms, but given these new circumstances that would mean I would have to move electronics *and* heavy instruments constantly, and daily, to join Zoom meetings. If the practice rooms were full, I would be out of luck. I could of course do these from my dorm room, but I can only imagine how disruptive this would be to my dorm mates, let alone my roommate. At home, however, I have a dedicated room only for music and quiet studying.
* While I fully understand the intention for us to return on time to minimize disruption in the case of a positive test, I am fully vaccinated, will be boosted, and have had the virus before. I also live in a very low-rate-of-positivity area and intend to isolate before returning to campus.

As noted, these are *my* circumstances, and some points are more unique to me than others. In speaking with my peers, a vast majority are intending to return on time.
