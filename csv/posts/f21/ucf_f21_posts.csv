Professor Unethical Behavior,"I have the joy of taking QMB 3602 with Sara Willox. We recently took an exam.

She even sent out an announcement of the final day of the exam window explaining that she was not allowing calculators in the exam and we were not to bring them to the testing center. Well, it turns out that there were certain algebraic (breakeven) problems on this exam that required solving for an unknown, dividing decimals, etc.(which takes a long time to divide a decimal number by hand) On top of this, there is a calculator built into the lockdown browser that Sara Willox conveniently failed to mention even existed and me and other students didn't even know about it until after the exam.

Some people go just to party, some take the opportunities given to them and some don‚Äôt. I am the type to take school seriously and not fuck around, but I often feel that caring a lot about my plans is not as important if I am not happy. (Of course you dummy) I try to get my stuff done, drink water and have undergraduate research under my belt. Yet I feel that I need just a bit of social life once in a while.

Its like a dark green olive color. I feel like someone probably has just taken it by now and I dont blame them, but Im desperate to find it so this is my last resort, thank you.

Masks,"To all you lovely people who refuse to wear a mask yet spend all your time on campus practically hacking up a lung.....What is absolutely so terrible about a piece of cloth over your face to prevent the spread of mouth fluids and what not. Like at this point idc about the people who aren't sick that don't wear a mask as it's on them if they get sick. But the people who are sick and don't wear a mask and just cough and sneeze with no attempt to cover your mouth and nose, how can you be so selfish? Call me paranoid all you want idc but I am utterly terrified of catching something and then going home to to my family that already have people that are immunocompromised. Like I said I wouldn't care if you don't wanna wear a mask if you aren't sick but if you are at least be considerate enough to stay home if you can or if you absolutely have to come to campus just PLEASE wear a mask.

Right now, my Spring 2022 schedule is:
- ACG2071
- FIN3403
- COM1000
- MAN3025H (I'm in the Honors college which requires us to take 8 courses and 2 upper-level courses for our major through it and MAN3025H is the only one offered in the Spring that satisfies the upper-level requirement but I'm wondering if I should take it or just take those courses later on)

I'd like to take MAR3023 in the Spring, but I can't figure out if it's offered online in the spring semester or not. Where do I go to see what courses are offered online?

For the love of god don't engage with the crazy religious people,"Yes they're annoying and stupid.

If you want to be more active about it, organize a counter protest or speech near them but don't crowd around them or you'll just add fuel to the fire. The more angry people that crowd around them and listen to them speak and shout at them, the more they feel the need to stay and 'spread the truth' and 'save everybody'.

Pre-Exam Week Issues :)))))))))),"My pre-exam week is going fucking phenomenally.

1. Today, the Saturday before exams, **the internet for all of Tower 3 has been out all day.** They announced that Tower 3 floors 1-4 had some difficulty at **1:50pm** and later gave and update that explained that, somehow, all of the building had lost internet. At **4:30**, they said that UCF IT was on site monitoring everything as it came back on. **It was finally (supposedly) fixed at 6:18pm (I'm not on campus, as I left go go to a friend's to study, so I don't know if it's actually up).** I'm almost positive most professors are gonna give the bullshit, ""Oh, this is why you prepare early silly :) things go wrong,"" reasoning.
2. Last Wednesday and Thursday were the last of mostly every class, right? On Wednesday, one of my classes had a **final review** in Classroom Building I at 7:30PM. **It was locked** because of the Christmas event going on right outside. This included all keypadded lecture halls' **inside entrances.** The professor showed up, said something that most people didn't hear, and sent an email out 30 minutes later saying he was giving an online review. (Obviously not his fault at all, but it sucks because I wasted more than an hour on a final review that never happened.)

We've had so many issues this semester, **especially with Towers internet,** which is ridiculously bad for how expensive rent is. I can barely drink the water, the dishwasher does essentially nothing, the beds are fucking atrocious, and mostly everything that's given is low quality. **I can't fucking imagine how bad other students' living experiences are,** because Tower 3 is considered one of the best living spaces on campus. **This shit needs to change.**

"Three years ago, I posted this. (big story of recovery here)","https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/a4smn7/where_do_i_begin/

It was an unreal period. In 2016, I was pretty miserable. Finished my AA and was stuck at home, struggling to get the most basic jobs. I questioned if I was going to make it to 30. Eventually, I made close online friends and they were hugely supportive of me and motivated me. I moved out for UCF in 2017 and argued so much with family at the time. My online friends were there for me while my family wasn't. But once I moved out and started living on my own for the first time, I became unreasonable. I reacted aggressively to any mistake I made. I was underweight and couldn't handle it. I ran to my friends every single time I felt bad about something and got frustrated when they didn't respond. I kept putting them in situations only professionals were equipped to handle. I just treated them poorly. Even when we met up in person and had a great time, I still acted unreasonable and potentially manipulative after the fact. Eventually, it did get to a point where my closest friend blocked me, and they moved on without me.

I had no one. No emotional support. Nothing. And I did it to myself. I couldn't see the good therapist at CAPS anymore and only saw awful ones after the fact. I had been Baker Acted multiple times, the first time being at the very, very abusive Aspire ward. They treat patients over there like they're subhuman. I lost motivation in school, I developed PTSD from the whole ordeal, and went into academic probation and then subsequently disqualified. I managed to land a job at 63 South and it went horribly. I was convinced after that I couldn't even work anymore. That was when I made that post.

Shortly after that, I was Baker Acted again and subjected to verbal abuse by UCF's person of concern detective. Not that that's the fault of anyone who was concerned and called- it wasn't. I appreciated the concern, even if I couldn't bring myself to reach out to anyone. And there had already been numerous times I reached out to people and ended up getting ghosted, so I couldn't do it anymore.

I managed to successfully file for medical withdrawal and came back in late 2019. I was under the guise that I would possibly reconcile with my old friends. I was told it wasn't going to happen. The bridge was burned. And that derailed me mentally and physically. I was enrolled in 4 courses and dropped 3. I managed to get an A in the remaining course, but I was so damaged it didn't even matter. I couldn't get the medical hold lifted, and by this point I was seriously done. Over it. There was no helping me, there was no saving me, my mind was completely made up and not changing. I was too far gone now to reach any of my goals and my life was over.

Well, at least, that's what I thought for 16 months.

While I was out of school, even though I was set on it, it was also way too difficult. I found myself distracted- mostly by twitch streams. I started watching many streamers play Mario Maker 2. I regularly visited them, and I liked chatting with people, even though I knew at the time my life was over. Eventually, in January, there was one night that someone I had gotten to know asked me how I was doing. And I was honest. She reached out to me and I told her the truth. But then she kept reaching out to me, and kept messaging me first every day, and... I didn't feel like I was bothersome. One day I ended up with an overdraft and I felt irritated at myself. Often felt worthless because I'm bad at taking care of myself. She offered to send me money but it didn't feel right to ask someone online for that much. She wasn't taking no for an answer. She sent enough that not only covered the overdraft but allowed me enough to buy groceries. I couldn't believe what I was witnessing. What did I do to deserve this kindness? And two days later she gifted me a book. Her friend was also concerned and checking in on me too.

At this point, it kinda just... hit me. I thought about my suicide plan and I just wasn't certain about it anymore. It was a very slow transition, and at first I wasn't sure if I was truly making the right decision by continuing. But I thought about what I needed to do to return to school and it seemed a lot more manageable than just the week prior. It felt so unusual. I still had a giant mess to confront, but I did have people to ask for help, which made it that much easier and motivating, even though it was still difficult. Eventually, I realized what happened. I felt loved.

That's how I'm still here. I hadn't seen her in a while, but I also did make more online friends through that stream I had gotten pretty close with. One of them is even like an older sister to me. I also got into streaming myself. I've been seeing a therapist who has been my best therapist since pretty much the first one I saw after moving here. I've struggled, but I've finally found peace and been able to put that traumatic incident behind me. I'm no longer cornered by it at every turn. My mindset is different. I'm able to see the glass as half full, and not blame myself so viciously for any mistakes I made. I wasn't sure if I'd be able to continue school after all that mess, but I returned for fall semester and ended up with 2 A's and a B. Although I still have bad habits I need to fix, and the circumstances weren't the most normal, I proved to myself that things were possible; although there's still a lot left I have to figure out and learn.

Sorry if this is long as shit. I felt compelled to share this though. I've been living here for 4 years. I wasted a lot of time and money, but I don't care anymore. Two different times this year I broke down in tears crying tears of relief that I didn't want to die anymore. And I'm hoping this reaches someone else who might be struggling and gives them hope too.

Any Physics majors on the Astronomy track that could take a few mins to chat and answer some questions?,"I'm currently a Mechanical Engineering student at UCF. I've been in school since 2016, slowly progressing through classes due to workload and outside factors. I originally wanted to go to college specifically for astronomy and its related subjects. I started my community college's astronomical society, was heavily involved in outreach, and even remember taking physics I and talking to my professor about a degree in something like Astrophysics. However, talking to advisors, and people in STEM, I was under the impression that I needed to generalize my area of study so that I would be more likely to get a job after graduation. So I went to Astroengineering, and then Aerospace, and then Mechanical because engineering is a sought-after role and mechanical seemed to be the most diverse.  I got approved for my minor in Astronomy and now that I'm getting into my 3000 level engineering courses, I'm starting to realize how much stress and anxiety they cause me. I'm finding it harder to maintain any level of interest in the courses and really only look forward to the semester if I'm taking one of my Astronomy electives. I'm torn because I have no idea what that route would even look like because I know at UCF you have to major in Physics with a focus in Astronomy. How many of my courses would even transfer over? Who at the school could I reach out to? I'm just looking for some opinions from students in the degree to see how they like it, what their thoughts are, and if it's even worth reaching out to an advisor to see what that change would look like. I hate to think that I've wasted the last 4.5 years of my education but I hate the idea of being miserable the rest of my academic life/career worse.

Delinquent financial aid:pt advanced standing MSW online,"Hi all, my fin aid activity was due yesterday Oct 29th- I completed the activity on Oct 18th. I‚Äôm part time taking one 7 week course at a time (2/semester) I woke up to see that although my financial aid activity was submitted,my professor has not ‚Äúgraded‚Äù it yet.

of $100 has been placed on my account for late payment of tuition.

GEB Courses Survey Results,"Good afternoon,

I previously posted the link to a survey on this subreddit to ask students who have taken or are currently taking GEB 3006, GEB 3005, GEB 4223, and GEB 4004. I am prepared to share with you the \*current\* results I was able to obtain. 

Before I share, please note that Survey monkey limits how many responses I can collect. In order to see more responses, I was attempting to purchase a subscription just to increase the number of responses, but **Accidentally bought a plan for $1260.** I was able to cancel it, but not before I recorded on my phone the 22 responses collected.

I will now share these 22 responses, and I would appreciate it if we could somehow find a way to create a survey with more questions. **A larger survey without response limits can help us pinpoint problems more accurately.**

**NOTE: all 22 participants I was able to record finished the survey and didn't skip a question.**

Free Mock Interview Simulator,"Over the past few months I‚Äôve been trying to build a mock interview simulator ([www.preparo.net](http://www.preparo.net/)).

I lost out on a significant amount of time working and salaries due to not being good at interviews. I wanted to fix that by building an online interview prep system.

I‚Äôve loaded in over 20,000 random interview questions from industry experts and you can select to do interviews by competency, behavioural or randomly. You can also load in your own questions you anticipate might come up.

Can't register because of hold,"I have hold on my account that I think is because my high school never sent in my transcript and this whole situation is so frustrating. My parents and I have requested my transcript to be sent in multiple times and now it's time for spring registration and I can't register because someone's lazy. UCF has been really unhelpful as well. I had to go around to three different offices only for the last one to make me wait 45 minutes just to hand me a business card with the email UAoperations@ucf.edu. When I sent a message to this email explaining my situation I immediately received an automated email that basically just said they aren't going to read my email because they're getting a lot of them right now. It just told me to check my undergraduate application status, which is not helpful because I know what I'm missing I just don't know how to make it happen. I'm incredibly frustrated with the whole thing and at this point since it says transcripts can take 2-6 weeks to process, I'm feeling like I won't be able to register for the spring semester at all. I don't know how this happened or why I was allowed to register for fall without my transcript, but now I can't? Has anyone else dealt with this?

How do we feel about back-to-back early morning classes?,"With the way my classes are arranged, I think I might have to take 2/3 classes back-to-back. I start off early in the morning for pre-calc (8:00 A.M‚Ä¶ this was not my choice), then I have another class at 9:30 and another at 10:30 A.M.

Do you guys recommend this..? I tried changing the time for my bio class (the 10:30 A.M class), but it keeps clashing with the lab time I have for pre-calc. This sucks because I heard Porchia‚Äôs labs are all online, so I could technically multi-task, but it clashes in the system regardless. I also really wanted Yeargain for bio :(

I am also trying to avoid adding more days to my schedule ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm already going to have to drive 40+ minutes to get to campus on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

I was alright with taking these classes this early since it‚Äôs essentially what I did in high school, but my friends are calling me crazy. I also don‚Äôt have any other choice for math.

Do I just suck it up and endure? Will I be okay?

I've asked COS advising services but there seems to be some confusion on the matter so I was wondering if anyone here had any knowledge on that. I'm just a little worried that since I was only able to take one class while disqualified from UCF since I already have my AA that the COS will see that as a lack of evidence that I will be able to perform well at UCF if readmitted.",1635991652,1,0
Do I need to apply for grade forgiveness for a course I withdrew from?,"Last Spring, I took a statistics course online, and needless to say, I had to withdrawal from it after falling behind on the content. I tend to work very slow with math courses, so taking it online (plus the stress of Covid) was a HUGE mistake. I managed to do so before the withdraw deadline leaving a ""W"" on my transcript. 

Is it still considered grade forgiveness if I were to retake it next semester in person? (since idk if a ""W"" is really considered an actual grade) I ask because I am a transfer student who used up the limit in my previous institution. My major requires one of two stats courses, so in worst-case scenarios, I can always take the alternative course, but I would much rather retake it seeing that I will somewhat remember the content- which would be a HUGE advantage for me seeing that I'm slow at learning math.

Should I graduate early?,"Hey friends!

I‚Äôve recently discovered that I can graduate a semester early if I want to (summer 2022 instead of fall 2022) if I take 15 credits in spring and 13 credits in summer. 

I was planning on 9-10 credits per term in 2022, but my internship is making me be full time (12 credits) in spring. This would leave 8 credits each for summer and fall, which is a super light course load. 
Not to mention that I‚Äôve taken all my difficult classes already, so it‚Äôs really just getting to 120 credits now


However, I would need to start GRE prep ASAP and apply to graduate school by February 1st (I‚Äôd also need to get letters of recommendation before applying).

What would you recommend for me to do? 15 credits is manageable for me, so that‚Äôs not a concern. Just conflicted as to what I should do

I am applying for UCF's History MA program for Public History. They just removed the GRE requirements (after I paid the nonrefundable $200 to take it) and replaced it with a writing sample that states ""academic papers, term papers, and other projects"" are acceptable submissions. My sister says I should write a whole new one but ... I am so burnt-out that I'd rather submit one of my term papers that I love so much. Do you think a paper I've already written will be okay or should I try to write a new one? Any experience submitting an already written paper and getting accepted? 
Thank you so much!",1631294314,1,0

"About the ""Respectful Knights"" Email","I was in the student section last game and there was a pretty loud ""f*** you boise!"" chant that was shouted multiple times throughout the game. And fingers thrown (me and the 20 people around me were throwing them up every bad play and aiming them at boise etc) 

I'm pretty sure this is what that new email we got was about, regarding us being respectful to the other team. 

To be honest, I was chanting this f*** you boise chant too. Everyone around me was as well and at the time, it was really motivating. I'm not defending it, just giving an explanation. 
I understand the reasoning behind the email and can acknowledge that it wasn't right to chant that, but being real it's gonna be really hard to stop chants like that from happening. Drunk/tipsy me apologies and I'll be more mindful next game and just not participate next time.",1631291033,1,0

The verge off campus housing &amp; health services HELP,"I just moved into The Verge and for the past two weeks I've been suffering with a really scratchy cough no other symptoms just the persisting cough and some phlegm. My roommate has also been getting asthma and had to use their inhaler which isn't something they regularly deal with.  I thought it was because of the vents/filters in my apartment because when I am not in my apartment for an extended time I feel much better and I cough less and as soon as I get back my cough starts back up. We put in a service request for the vents and it hasn't been addressed for two weeks. I am starting to think it may be a result of mold??? Not only that, but I have had to deal with over 10 roaches in my apartment, basically a new one every day indicating the facility isn't very well-kept and it is likely that there is a bad case of mold.

My plan of action was to visit ucf health services (bc it's quick and easy) to see if they could do some tests? I was wondering if anyone knew if they are capable of doing this or if I should see an outside provider?",1631253309,1,0

Goths/emos at school?,"Hey! I'm a pretty deep-in emo kid and was just wondering if there's anyone around UCF who's been looking for fellow subculture fans.

Recently my friend group got chopped into just my online friends, and I'm trying to find friends irl again. I just wanna find friends who like the same edgy music and goof around listening to Hawthorne Heights MCR Fall Out Boy From First To Last yaddah yaddah you know the list if you're familiar with the music haha. I will say I don't think we'll get along if you refuse to listen to other music genres and think emo is The Genre to end them all and none others are valid. You gotta respect the TAI and the Cobra Starship and the like haha

But yeah, I just thought this subreddit might be my best bet to find some genuinely cool people that I get along with.

Also, might as well get it out of the way, if you're not cool with trans people, you will not be cool with me",1637868407,1,0
