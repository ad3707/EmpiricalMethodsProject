Are penises still being inspected during covid,"So i‚Äôm currently a freshman and i‚Äôve ben extremely anxious about penis inspection day with daddy gene. However, i have not seen any official notification from either the UCLA Registrar‚Äôs Office, the UC Office of the President, the Associated Students of the University of California Los Angeles, the Sexperts, or the UCB Kink Club about this notorious event. As the days go by, my schlong just gets more and more tired from having to keep it ‚Äúprepared‚Äù all day (i‚Äôm a grower not a shower‚Ä¶ hehe üéâ. ). But basically i was thinkeng maybe it‚Äôs just because of covid and they‚Äôre afraid that the easily excitable bruins will release some virus-infused fluids onto the inspector. I certainly would not want to get any ‚Äúcondensed milk‚Äù on myself while preforming an inspection (if i had the gracious luxury of being accepted for such a distinguished role). Obviously, papi gene can clearly handle this sort of sexual shenanigans but the man himself does not have time to inspect the penises of all 31,636 undergraduate students. Ive been told that the most well-endowed students get inspected by daddy gene himself while the less fortunate students are compelled to be inspected by UCPD officers at the same time they are busting students for smoking weed on Tongva steps. Apparently sometimes this creates a problem in which the second-hand effects of the ‚ú®MARIJHUANA‚ú®   causes all these unfortunate bruins to suffer from a mild case of limp dick, which i was extremely nervous about. Fortunately i have now been informed that if i suffer from this malady i can easily rectify my plight by simply going to the University of California Los Angeles Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center and ordering a DIY-penis enlargement kit (only covered by UCSHIP).üëÅüëÑüëÅ Apparently these are very easy to use and if you need any help you can always stop by the Kerckoff Coffee House and meet up with the UCLA Jacker Offer who is an expert in all things penile-related. Anyway all i have to say is talking thru this has made me feel a little bit better. My main worry now is that the penis lengthening process will cause me to get balanoposthitis* and i will have to reverse the length to fix it therefore making my dong so short that big papi block needs his sissy blue spectacles to see it. Needless to say, if this happens i am confident that my charming personality and my 14-inch strap on will get me through the day. 

* Balanitis is inflammation of the glans (head) of the penis. If the foreskin is also inflamed, the condition is called balanoposthitis. Symptoms of balanitis can include penile pain, swelling and itching, a rash on the penis, and a strong-smelling discharge from the penis. The most common cause of balanitis is poor hygiene in uncircumcised males. If the penis isn't properly cleaned underneath the foreskin, bacteria, sweat, dead skin cells, and debris can build up around the glans and lead to inflammation. If an uncircumcised male has phimosis (foreskin that is difficult to retract) and cannot clean under the foreskin, risk of inflammation increases. Other causes of balanitis include dermatitis and infection (yeast infection or sexually transmitted infection). If infection is the cause, treatment will include antibiotic or antifungal medication. If balanitis is severe or recurrent, circumcision may be the best treatment option.

I wasn't sure what subreddit to post this in but hopefully someone here has applied for TAP and gotten into UCLA and can help me with my question.

I currently attend a community college out of state but am moving to California in January. I have completed 1 year of community college in my home state so about 30 credits (semester). I plan to attend a community college that has a transfer program with UCLA when I move there (even though i know it's not guaranteed) and want to know how I should go about it.

Firstly, can I even apply for TAP? I've already completed 1 year of community college in an out of state college. Is there a minimum amount of credits i'm required to take at the California Community College I will be attending to be eligible for TAP?

Secondly, if I plan to apply to UCs in Fall 2023, when do I have to submit my TAP application? (I have read some of the articles on TAP and am unsure of how it works)

Black and Native American students make up the lowest percentage of students at UCLA. Pacific Islander students also make up an incredibly low percentage of students at UCLA. If most of the students who apply to UCLA are white and Asian students, what does the future hold for other minority students?

It doesn't matter what race you are or what political party you support.

Transfer from csulb to ucla as a business econ major. Odds of getting in ?,"Hey guys so I‚Äôm currently a sophomore (2nd) year at csulb and wanted to apply to try and get into ucla as either a business econ or Econ major. I for sure have the credits required for me to transfer and all but 1 or 2 courses for my major specific courses that I need which is math 31a and or 31b. So now I have a few questions.

1. Do I need to complete the equivalent math 31a and it 31b course at csulb next semester or can I take it over the summer if I get into ucla. Or even take it at ucla? (is there a counselor or academic advisor at ucla I could speak to, to ask this question)

2. I‚Äôm currently on track to take 70 semesters units by the end of spring semester. Which is equivalent to 90 quarter units for uc‚Äôs. How many of those 70 do you think will be transferable to ucla. 

3. I know my odds of getting into ucla are stacked against me cause I would be transferring from a csu and uc‚Äôs specifically ucla likes to give the opportunity to cc students more (which is understandable and a good thing). That being said my grades are good, I‚Äôve been working, and apart of a few clubs. Are my PIQs the only thing that will make a difference whether I get in or not ? 

4. If the 3rd question is true that the PIQs are the only difference maker then I might be screwed cause I don‚Äôt know how to correctly answer the prompts. Writing has never been my strongest subject so what would I need to do to write good PIQs that will get me into ucla. Like I have stuff that would answer the prompt but with my writing I don‚Äôt know if it will appeal the person that‚Äôs reading my PIQs. 

Thanks P.S - I love ucla more than my own school right now. I‚Äôve been to the campus multiple times for competitions and am in love with it. I‚Äôve been repping them since Brett Hundley was the QB there.",1632500684,1,0

thoughts on joining greek life 3rd/4th year?,"hi! so, i‚Äôve just entered my third year here at ucla and i feel like i have virtually no close friends. well, maybe a couple, but not like best friend or ‚Äúsister‚Äù level.

tbh i‚Äôve always wanted to join a sorority and have that sisterhood and community of best friends (especially since i grew up an only child and pretty independent), but being asian and in the community of friends i had, i was afraid it would paint me as an ‚Äúabg‚Äù. so i pretended and even made myself believe that it wasn‚Äôt my scene and that i didn‚Äôt want to rush. however, coming back to school after being home for 18+ months from the pandemic has made me realize that i‚Äôm done putting up that illusion and i actually really want to be a part of a sorority where i can feel like i belong and have best friends. 

however, the second that i make that decision, i go onto the ucla panhellenic website to find out that registration for formal recruitment literally just closed mere hours before (i had checked on the 20th at like 1-2 am, and it closed the 19th at 11:59 pm lol. &lt;/3). so now i‚Äôm stuck with the decision of waiting it out to see if some sororities will do informal recruitment/cob later throughout this year (which i‚Äôve heard only bottom tier sororities do since they‚Äôre typically the only ones who don‚Äôt reach quota? [and side note: what/who even makes up the bottom tier sororities?] so i don‚Äôt know if i should do that because i know i‚Äôm not exactly in a position to be picky, but no girl wants to be bottom tier.) which if they even do, i know rushing as a junior is hard too so i don‚Äôt even know if i could manage that? OR i could wait it out until next year when i‚Äôm a 4th year and try for formal recruitment then (and get the whole fun experience with bid day and everything; all that jazz) BUT i also know that apparently it‚Äôs really hard getting a bid as a senior since you only have one year left and they prioritize freshmen :/ so like it‚Äôd be really embarrassing and also a waste of time and money if i went through formal recruitment just to not get a bid. 

or maybe it‚Äôs too late for me and i just shouldn‚Äôt rush in general? like would it even be worthwhile and give me the experience that i‚Äôm hoping for if i join this late? idk, i‚Äôm just lonely and i want to feel like i belong here. everyone says college is supposed to be the best years of your life, but i haven‚Äôt found that to be true yet :(",1632476234,1,0

what gym has the most strength equipment,"I'm new to UCLA (current research assistant at Anderson), and was thinking about getting an on-campus gym membership (which sadly isn't free, even though I work for UCLA). My main problem with the commercial gym I go to is that it's too crowded and only has 2 benches. So, I have two main questions:

1. What are the best times, as in least crowded, to use John Wooden (or any of the other gyms on campus)?
2.  How many benches does John Wooden have?

When your UCLA roommate tries Adderall for the first time ....,"TLDR... My roommate missed his essay deadline, but wrote another essay to appeal missing the actual essay. He also cleaned our kitchen

Hello Professor,

I hope you are doing well!¬†

Assuming you don't recognize me just by name, my name is Andrew Andrew (PSEUDonym) and I am a student in your Global Studies 102 class. I don't know if you've seen this yet, but I just wanted to let you know that the reason my FDI essay submission was submitted around 5 seconds past the deadline today is because I put in as much time and energy as I could this morning trying to perfecting both the FDI and Trade Policy papers before turning them in. Unfortunately, I just barely overestimated myself and ended up not having time to indent citations of my FDI works cited page. I stopped to get my submission in on time, only to see that that I was seconds late regardless. I am convinced, however, that you or whichever TA reads my essays will quickly see that these last-minute efforts were not in vain, and that I tried my very best to accomplish the reading quizzes and write the papers to the literal best of my ability. I hope that my efforts can be recognized when you consider how severely you mark me down. I know a harsh penalty is always the best lesson, and admittedly, much of my frustration stems from the fact that I don't usually work as hard as I can in most of my classes. The topics of the essays for this class happened to strike a special chord that made it easy to spend literally 14 straight hours (5pm yesterday to 9am today) and 1.5 unprescribed adderall pills perfecting essays that already appeared nearly finished prior to yesterday. For some reason, I was invigorated to completely restructure both essays to make them as good as they can possibly be, and it nearly took an entire rotation of the Earth to do so. I can't remember trying so hard for a class before, and naturally I want to see those efforts payoff as anyone would. I'm sure you can understand how frustrating it is to think that such small margins could derail all that. But all that being said, that's life, I don't regret working too hard, and I won't complain any further. It's my fault and I accept responsibility for the penalty, but between me and you, I just wanted you to know that I tried my hardest.¬†

Regardless of how you or the TAs decide to proceed in scoring my paper, I mostly wrote this because I wanted to thank you for making it fun again to try my hardest on an interesting project in school. For reasons not entirely related to the adderall, those 14 hours flew by and I truly had fun learning everything I did. I know grades will come and go, but these are the experiences that remind me why I came to this school in the first place.¬†

Moving forward, I know to be more diligent in completing future assignments for this class ahead of their hard deadlines. I know you've warned the class to do this already but our young minds just always work best when the pressure is highest for some reason, so it was hard to listen the first time. Just in case you received other annoying e-mails from fellow procrastinating peers like me, I wanted to make sure this was at least more entertaining to read than the others. In the event that I am the only one who made this mistake and you feel that your time has been wasted and disrespected by the egregiously inappropriate length and tone of this e-mail, I deeply apologize. My brain is still in essay mode on no sleep and a hint of residual adderall in the system and I am just too exhausted not to be fully transparent and casual here. Ultimately, as it pertains to the actual assignment, once again I accept whatever you decide is the appropriate penalty for my late submission and I look forward to making up for it on the next one... but you can also let this one slide unpunished if you feel overly compelled by this emotionally-charged e-mail that I have also been writing and perfecting aimlessly since around 9:05 AM.¬†

Warm regards,

Andrew

PS: If the mentioning of taking unprescribed adderall gets me in trouble or further lowers my grade on these essays, I was legally just kidding about that part. In my defense, and as my family would likely testify, I should've been prescribed them by now anyway and definitely would've been if it wasn't for restrictive protection barriers creating an artificial supply scarcity in the pharmaceutical industry. For now, I'm just kidding, and I look forward to seeing you in class on Wednesday and hope this e-mail is received with the reciprocal warm intentions it was sent with. Just to be clear, you are easily my favorite and most engaging professor this quarter and probably this year as a whole, and I want to assure you that the energy and tone of this youthful, naively-written, and unquestionably inappropriate e-mail should not be mistaken for disrespect. If it makes it any less disrespectful, it could be worth knowing that I did hesitate to send it for quite a while. Nonetheless, here we are, and rather than dwell on a lost 5 minutes, I suggest you consider this e-mail as a testament to your approachability and effectiveness as a professor. You can also rest assured, considering I'll be diligently turning in my future work for this class properly and trying to avoid the anxiety of participating in all future large zoom lectures ever for any class in this life or the next, this likely brings our communications to a close, and to conclude the weirdest e-mail you've received this year and maybe ever, I would simply like to say once again that you are a great professor on the off change you don't hear that enough already. I know I haven't said that enough to those few professors I've had who I believe deserve that special praise, but I'm going to start now. Thank you.¬†",1634542326,1,0

Can an oos student establish residency in California if he or she attends California community college for 2 years?,"It says that if he or she is older than 24, one does not need to demonstrate financial independence from his or her parents. So the only requirement he or she needs to satisfy is that he or she stays in CA for 366 consecutive days. But there is a clause that states that if one stays in CA for educational purpose, it is not counted towards the 366 days. So if a 25 years old green card holder or a US citizen who is not a CA resident attend CA community college for 2 years and during that 2 years do some part-time job and pay tax to California, can he or she establish CA residency?",1631385768,1,0

After making the decision to cut all ties with him, I thought to myself, ""I wonder how he treats other girls?,"" ""Am I the only girl that he speaks to like this?"" Those thoughts had pondered my mind for quite a bit. It wasn't until months later after a post on Instagram that shed light on him, came to my attention. When I found out about the abuse towards other young women, I felt like it was too late for me to speak up about my experience. I was dehumanized, objectified, and degraded by John Kim.

shoutout to ucla housing for breaking my stuff and trashing my room,"i‚Äôm sure everyone knows by now about how some rooms in sproul cove got ‚Äúflooded out‚Ä¶‚Äù as someone who was one of those rooms, had 30 minutes to pack for a week, and then was relocated to a room with spiders, stains on the walls, and unfiltered water, we finally get an email today that our room is all good to return back to. 

we come back to our room to see that it is completely and utterly trashed. my bed, the bottom bunk, looks as if people have been sitting  on it or rolling around on it. my posters have been ripped off the walls. my desk looks as if someone grabbed it, violently shook it, and caused EVERYTHING on it to fall to the ground. my picture frames are completely shattered and my jewelry is scattered all over the ground (this is the worst part for me because the part of our room that got wet is on the complete opposite side of my desk.) there‚Äôs suspicious dust littering our desks and chairs, and there‚Äôs pieces of metal and pieces of the wall in our trash can that no one bothered to take out. 

i‚Äôm absolutely infuriated that after being banished out of our rooms for something that was completely out of our control, we come back to this. i don‚Äôt even know if housing is going to do anything about this when i call tomorrow, but even just a simple ‚Äúsorry that we completely trashed the room that you pay so much money for and broke your personal belongings‚Äù would suffice. screw this school",1637733665,1,0

"I wish we would tell future new students that if you want friends, you need to make them early on","People always say ""it is okay if you don't make friends in 0 week, there is always more time"", but the reality is that the beginning of the school year is the only time where so many people are open to meeting with each other. It is the only time of the school year where your peers keep their doors open for others to come in or to hang out with you in the lounge or whatever. 

Later on in the school year, especially once midterms start, everyone is so busy with their current social group and classes that they have no time to really bother making new friends. UCLA is especially academically challenging and free time is hard to come by, so people really don't have time to make friends later on in the school year. A ton of clubs also really don't accept new people in the middle of the school year. Sorry, but people who keep telling others at the beginning that you have an infinite amount of time so don't worry are just wrong.

3) We have meals given out at the dining halls (steak at BPlate)

4) We have a rivalry with USC - comparative to that of Gi-Hun and Deok-Su or Sang-Woo

5) Our classes are like the games, where we have to follow the rules (academic honor code) and are judged on our performance. Some people have harder classes than others (like the dalgona candy shapes)

6) Following from the last point, during our classes (the games), we have some really industrious students who are (a little too) competitive (ie Deok-Su) and we have some slackers. Typically, those who survive are those who worked hard but sometimes, being too competitive makes you worse off (Mi-Nyeo pushing Deok-Su)

Thoughts on Online School,"This is in response to the rise in people saying that they are fine - or even excited - that classes might be going online. While you have every right to your opinion, online school is NOT for everyone and does NOT work for every major. I want to share my experience as a foreign language major. 

When classes went online for the first time, I was still doing lower division courses. The adjustment was difficult at first, but the nature of the material made it somewhat easy to transition to online. So I can understand where a lot of people are coming from when they say that online isn't that bad. I believe a lot of these people have either only been taking lower division courses that are not product/performance related, or they have upper division courses that already have a lot of basis online to begin with. 

The next year of online, I started doing my lower division language courses and upper divisions. Since I am continuing with the languages, I can sincerely say that online learning did NOT prepare me for in person language classes. 

Now to clarify, I‚Äôm taking two ancient languages (Latin and Ancient Greek) primarily based on reading rather than speaking. Before coming to UCLA, I had absolutely no experience with these languages. The Language classes are split into three levels - elementary (3 quarters), intermediate (2 quarters 1LD 1UD) and advanced (however many quarters you have left). For all of my elementary courses, they were entirely online. Open book open note exams and quizzes. Memorization was not important. This has been an egregious obstacle to overcomes now that I‚Äôve taken intermediate courses in person and will soon progress to the advanced courses. The professors say so, I‚Äôm saying so. I plan on going to grad school, and these languages are the entire basis of my degree. There is absolutely no real quality or value to my learning in taking these language courses online. There is no real way to create module based learning, because since quarter 1 up until quarter 8 and beyond, everything is cumulative. The holes in my learning are showing and destroying my confidence. I cannot compete with the people who have in person experience. 

I feel like the people who are excited to go online are so because they don‚Äôt face the same problems. They enjoy the GPA boost from open book exams because they won't have to touch that material again for quite some time. I think anyone who has had to take a series course partly online and partly in person can sympathize with me here.  

For people who say that the social aspect doesn't matter, allow me to pose to you an alternative to parties, get togethers, or other non academic social events. There are opportunities at this school that simply cannot and should not be forced to go online. For the past quarter, I've been developing a class to teach to undergraduate students. I have done thousands of pages of reading in preparation for this course, gone through pedagogy training, and created a syllabus. The thought of having to take all my work, all my planning, and basically scrap it to instead create an online course (if they will even allow us to offer the course at this point) is incredibly scary and disappointing. Now, I know some of you might say ""if you can't readjust your course, you shouldn't be teaching"" or that ""it isn't THAT bad"". To that I say, once you spend hours every week creating a course from SCRATCH, with absolutely no other precedent to go off of, and then have to TEACH that class to 20 students, talk to me then, and give me a strategy to adjust my course. What I'm saying by this, is that there are other opportunities on campus that aren't primarily social, but still are. Research. Clubs. Things that you do because they enrich your experience and resume. Things that JOBS look for in the future. Proof of product outside of class. A company or grad school won't read every paper you wrote for a class, or review every project you did. They'll want to hear about what you did because YOU enjoyed it and because YOU wanted to do it. They'll want to hear about what YOU did with other people, because that is how you'll be working for the rest of your life. I believe that to say that we don't need these things, when this is a large part of what we're paying for, is a very privileged viewpoint. For some of us, UCLA has been the main source of opportunity for us to grow academically independently from classes. 

This is a lot, and honestly I could have more to say but I'm just flustered right now and scared. I don't think I can mentally handle online school again. Not everyone's home is conducive to a good learning environment. Not everyone's degree is worth much if it's conducted online. There is more to being in person than just parties. I'd be happy to address any questions or concerns in the comments.",1639853351,1,0

"retaking chem 30a, physiological science major"," I emailed the chem department with this question but they won't reply until the quarter starts, so I'm wondering if anyone has any advice about this plan. 

So I got a C- in Chem 30A. I was going to stick with it, but I do want to retake it and I also decided that I want to switch into the physiological sciences major which requires at least a C. I'm a 2nd year and have to take it before the fall of my junior year for the major. I am planning to retake the class it but I already enrolled in Chem 30B and Chem 30AL. To my understanding I can't take these courses before retaking Chem 30A. So my plan is to drop Chem 30B and Chem 30AL and just do some GEs and other major prereqs in the winter. I am planning to take Chem 30A in the spring or summer before junior year (really whatever classes I can get now that everything is filled up). Does anyone know if Chem 30A is usually offered in spring or summer? I'm also wondering if the physiological science major requires some sort of application besides fulfilling the course reqs. I didn't see anything on the major requirements page but I'm not 100% on it.

I'm also just worried about this being a really big setback for advancement in my degree, so if anyone has experience with retaking a course and having to move loads of stuff around I'd love to hear about your experience.",1640793761,1,0

International student here. I'm thinking of majoring in computer science at UCLA. However, it's expensive to attend for an international student.

I don't think I'm an outstanding student, so I predict that I would only be able to get average grades since there are many smart people around.

Nonetheless, I think I should still try my best to apply to scholarships. I've looked at many resources about scholarships located in the university's website as well as others.

Unfortunately, I'm really overwhelmed by all the information and need some help. Most important to me is that I'm not sure how to effectively and efficiently go about getting scholarships that suit my circumstances.

Just a heads up to the new students about a black dude called Andre asking for money on campus for the homeless people. He is a scammer that's been on campus for many years.

The meme is that he has been scamming for a long time and still doing it. When they say ""legend,"" it is actually in a negative way.

Go straight forward and don't talk to him, he is not a nice guy, and when he gets the money, he would just keep them instead of donating to charity.

Please warn others about him instead of just memeing, and it is difficult for others to get the meme if they do not know the story.

Has anyone considered a Reddit meetup?,"TL;DR- I think we should organize a quick coffee or lunch meet-up.  If people were interested, maybe even make it a weekly occurrence.  

I'm a grad student here and I mostly just browse this subreddit.  I don't even live in los angeles county.

I've been really saddened to see the amount of people feeling lonely and disconnected.  Two of the top posts right now are ""I finally cried"" and ""Homesick and Lonely"".  I see constant posts about people feeling sad, anxious, and isolated.  It hurts my heart to see so many people feeling like this.  Maybe it's always been there, but reddit just allows us to express it.

As an outside observer, UCLA looks like a lonely place.  It's a gorgeous campus, but there is no real ""college town"" feel to it.  I went to UCSB and loved every minute of it.  Living in Isla Vista was a blast and I made so many life long friends.  Literally half of my current friends are folks I went to undergrad with.  They're great people and we've stayed in contact over the years.

UCLA looks like it has a big frat scene.  Much of the ""party scene"" seems tied to Greek life.  Thankfully, UCSB had a very small presence because I think greek life is bullshit.  I'm sorry if I step on any toes, but it's the absolute truth.  It's completely antithetical to academia and I'd want no part of it.  I worked three years at a sorority as a hasher (food prep) and it's just not something I agree with.  It's surprising that we leave high school and then form these new cliques.  I know plenty of fraternity guys.  Many of them are good friends. The whole purpose of their existence is to fuck women. Again, I'm sorry if that's crass, but it's the truth.  I think it's hilarious that UCLA and schools preach inclusivity and then tolerate these little drinking clubs.

I've also been floored that clubs can deny people.  Like, what the fuck is up with that?  The whole point of a club is to bring people in.  I don't understand how you have to apply for these clubs and basically try out.  I get it for something like the ski team of something, but why would clubs get to deny people?  Again, if we're really a school of inclusivity, why are we literally rejecting people.

So here's what I recommend we do: let's just make a weekly or monthly meet-up for coffee.  No agenda, no schedule, no ability to tell people ""no, you're not welcome"".  Everyone is welcome.  It'll just be a good space for people to sit down and have some good old fashioned human connection.  Maybe you'll make some friends, maybe you won't.  I just want people who are feeling disconnected to be brought into the fold.

I hate to recommend something and then not follow through, but I'm kindly asking someone else to set this up.  I'm only on campus twice a week and I have a whole other life. I go to class and then head home.  I really don't know the dynamics or even where a good place to meet up would be.  That said, if there is interest and no one wants to set it up, I will.  Could people at least recommend a place around campus that would be a good place to meet for coffee?  I'm on campus Tuesdays and Thursdays and I'm done a little after noon.  Quick coffee meet up and people can stay as long or as short as they want.

To the people feeling alone:  You're not alone.  We're all in this crazy world together.  We are all connected.  I'm going through my own stuff right now because life is fucking hard.  But I guarantee you that you are not alone and there is a place for you here.  If you got into UCLA, you are a fucking superstar.  You are a top-tier performer and you deserve to be here.  It's okay if you don't know what you want to do with your life.  I'm fucking 36 and I literally just changed careers.  Life can be so hard, but it's so fucking beautiful too.  You have so many great adventures ahead of you.  Again, you're not alone and there are so many people out there like you hungry for human connection.  It's okay if you're fucking weird.  It's okay that you've got baggage.  You're a human being and you belong.

To the people who are doing well: good on you!  Try and bring some of your classmates into the fold.  Go sit down with a new person at lunch.  Say ""hi"" to the shy kid in class.  Put down your phone when you walk around campus and smile at people.  I had the pleasure of living on hawaii for 3 years and i bought into the ""aloha"" lifestyle.  It brightens people's day when you smile and say hello.  You never know what your peers are struggling with.  A simple ""hello"" can make their whole week.  I challenge you to show some of that aloha and love around campus.

BJJ: i can start a whole other post on this, but if you're athletic and are looking for connection, give jiu jitsu and / or muay thai a try.  I started bjj as an undergrad at ucsb and it changed my life for the better.  it's certainly not for everyone, but it's one of the best things i've done with my life.  amazing way to build confidence and find a community.

maybe this will be downvoted, but i just want to remind people that they belong here.  let's take care of one another.  sorry, not proofreading this, and it's written on my phone so i hope it's not a complete disaster.",1635694680,1,0

I feel so lonely. I literally have 0 friends. My confidence and self-esteem have never been so low. 

Got no friends from last year cuz it was all online. I thought it‚Äôd be better cuz I got a housing offer and decided to live in the dorms to meet people. But this isn‚Äôt the same dorm experience I remember back when I was a freshman at my old school; I‚Äôm normally kinda shy but I at least I was able to talk to people and easily make friends.

Neurosci vs Psychobiology?,"Need help deciding what major to choose guys, I think I'll preface by saying what my intent is for my career and all that first. 

So essentially, I've always wanted to do something just to help with the advancement of cure/treatment possibilities for neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer's, Parkinsons', etc. This is because my dad was diagnosed with it about a decade ago and it has heavily impacted my life since. In high school, I had wanted to major in Biomedical Engineering and hopefully specialize in nano/neuro engineering to see if something could be done there, but as the years went by it felt more and more likely that I would work in something different with a BME degree. Thus, I am now in community college (rejected UC offers bc of finances and home life at the time, etc) and will be transferring around this time next year. The pre reqs for the majors are about 90% the same, but here comes the dilemma. I really, REALLY want to make sure my career ends up working with neurological disorders, and I would love to be able to go to med school to do so but that doesn't necessarily HAVE to be the case. A lot of people I know have recommended against Neuroscience as a major even if i'm interested in neuro research and have a love for the field because the average gpa is 2.7 as opposed to psychobio''s 3.7 or something...I'm sure neuro prepares you for the MCAT equally as well but that is a drastic change in gpa, and I doubt I would have any remote shot of getting into med school w that. Another option I considered was doing biopsych with a neuro minor to avoid the 101? neuro series, but at the same time that very series and neuroanatomy look so interesting to me it kinda hurts not to take them. And lastly, I considered doing psychobio and then later doing grad in neuro, and then applying to med school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel really lost and don't know what to do or choose anymore, I thought that I had it decently figured out but now everything seems so vague and its kinda discouraging :/ I AM fine being a neuroscientist/doing neuro research as well but I would much prefer to do a medical path",1635664357,1,0

Positivity Posting (+ ideas on how to make friends),"Just scrolling down this subreddit and everyone seems sad, angry, or empty. A lot of people seem to really be struggling with making friends, new connections, going to parties, etc.

Most undergrads at UCLA right now have never stepped foot on campus before, so it is going to take some time to get everyone back. A lot of people have also missed out on social interactions in the last  year and a half, which makes anxiety even higher.

Everyone wants to go to parties, make 200 friends who all link up at the beach, go to Disneyland, get a SO, find a job, ace their test, and so on. There is an absolutely overwhelming checklist of what makes up  the ""college experience"" and it's intimidating to even think about. Don't feel pressure to make up for lost time, just try to make the most of it.

Here are some fun ideas that you can ask casual acquaintances to join you with (no friends required):

* Go play a game the whiteboard on your floor, or just draw a funny, high effort meme that people will think is funny.
* Go get boba / meetfresh after class or midterm (works with class buddies!)
* Find a running buddy / group! There are a lot of running groups on campus.  You don't need to have sick social skills, just go for a jog with some  people and runners high should make it easier to talk with them.
* Find a plug (someone over 21) and throw a small kickback of your own! Just invite some of the nice people on your floor to come over and vibe, buy  some Malibu and solo cups, and don't get written up by your RA.
* Pumpkin carving? Or you can offer to pick up some mini pumpkins for your floor in your groupme. ""Hey anyone want me to grab them a  tiny pumpkin from Whole Foods? They're only like $2"" Then you become  known as a nice person and also get to meet a few people who inevitable  want one.
* Join literally any club. This is one of the ""duh"" options, but many people  take it for granted. Not all clubs need to be academic, just try to join  a club that you think you would enjoy.
* Spend more time in the lounge / common areas. If you are a familiar person, people will be more friendly.
* Say yes more. Say hi to people you recognize and try to make conversation. Help people in your class groupchats and try to engage with strangers. 

Don't sweat too hard about feeling behind, just do your own thing and try to branch out.

Homesick and Lonely,"It‚Äôs been over a month since coming to UCLA, and I am still extremely homesick. I moved here from across the USA, so I can‚Äôt easily see my family.

I also miss my own bedroom and house and town and best friend‚Ä¶ etc. I feel like I have lost my confidence at college. 

I‚Äôm struggling to find the right friends here too. Everybody is so cool and funny and outgoing, but all my hobbies are very introverted. I‚Äôm not a very funny person and my interests are pretty weird. People  don‚Äôt gravitate towards me like they would to others.

I don‚Äôt like parties at all (I have been to one frat party since coming here, and I will be perfectly happy if I never go to one again) or anything super social. My idea of fun is movie nights or video game nights. Or just nights all to myself, tbh. 

Everybody just seemed to adjust so quick. Everybody loves it here. And I don‚Äôt HATE it‚Äîthe food is great, the area is nice, the campus is stunning, my classes are decent‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt love it.

* Join literally any club. This is one of the ""duh"" options, but many people take it for granted. Not all clubs need to be academic, just try to join a club that you think you would enjoy. 
* Say yes to more things. You miss every opportunity you don't take. 

In my freshman year I went to a total of 2 parties and they were both boring af. Don't sweat too hard about not being let into a frat party, just do your own thing and try to branch out.

Grad student and friends,"I feel like it‚Äôs been much much harder trying to make friends as a grad student especially since my program is online but despite people living in Weyburn‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs few people who‚Äôs up to spend time together.

I‚Äôm a fairly young grad student so I thought about getting into clubs with undergrads but where and how I‚Äôd do that is a mystery to me. I went to another UC so I don‚Äôt have much info where to go for certain things at ucla.

I‚Äôd ask students in my department but they aren‚Äôt as willing either and some are pretty pretentious and seems rude

Overall, I‚Äôm not overly desperate for friends but it‚Äôs so tiring being nice to people hoping they‚Äôll like you and trying to form friendships. I feel like I‚Äôm pretending for a good amount of time before I can be myself it‚Äôs exhausting.

Of course I‚Äôm not owed anything but at the same time it‚Äôs just tiring being a grad student with basically no ties at my university. it would be nice to have at least ONE friend to spend time with and not feel like I‚Äôm annoying them

What are my chances at UCLA?," 

Texas OOS....I'm mainly applying because there is a chance that my parents move to California so I am applying to a few UC's in case we do move as my parents don't want me to live on campus. However, I don't really think I can get into any of the UC's as they are really competitive especially for OOS, so if you think I don't even have a slight shot to get in please tell me, also tell me if you think I have a decent chance at being able to get in (I know it's a crapshoot).

I kinda just want consistent friends since it's my first and last year on campus. So yeah, if anybody's down to hang out in whichever way, let's do it.
