Are official transcripts used for cross campus transfers ;,"I was thinking of dropping a class and was wondering whether or not official transcripts are old for cross campus transferring.

Crush on the BBB?,"Every morning I ride Bursley Baits to go see Bob and Betty Beyster's Blazin Basement Burger Bar üçî 

Yes you read that correctly. A secret passage in the BBB takes you to the Basement of the Building where a marvelous Burger Bar cooks up some Blazin Buns. 

Also, I just cant resist seeing the superbly slippery, stripper-pole designed, scintillating staircase which lights up to fill my heart everyday. 

So, what do you guys think. Do I have a chance? And what can I do to increase my chances of having BBB's Burger Buns all to myself(without affecting my relationship with Bursley Baits)? Any advice would be appreciated!

Any other trans/non-binary folks really tired of the performativity here?,"Basically the title. When I first came for orientation and saw people giving out pronoun stickers I thought ""wow cool"", but since then it's just a string of disappointments including:

\- being asked for pronouns in a group, saying I'm not sure, then being insisted that I give one. Rest of the group (all year 3+ senior graduate students) proceeds to ignore it anyway, including both the person who asked and the person who insisted.

\- similar group setting, but people ending up awkwardly using my name repeatedly instead of just using the pronouns I gave.

\- getting misgendered at a department event by the student staff member literally handing out name tags with pronouns printed on them

\- setting up an appointment with the prof in my department most vocal on social media about diversity and inclusivity, to talk about how to navigate situations above, only to get misgendered by her on the very next time we meet. She did quickly correct herself but it still feels really ironic. 

\- asked to set my pronoun roles in a club discord group, proceeds to get misgendered in voice chat anyway. One other member who has done so has since came out as non-binary but never acknowledged their actions towards me 

I TA a class this semester, and when I gave my pronouns half the class just whipped their head towards me as if I said some shocking news or something. It's gotten to the point where I don't even want to give pronouns at events because it just feels like setting up myself for disappointment. I know people say that oh, cis people should declare their pronouns to help normalize it, but the normalizing of declaring pronouns is being pushed so much ahead of educating non-trans (and this includes non-trans LGBQ+) people that other people may not use the pronouns that align with their apparent gender.",1632376309,0,0

We've done one lab so far and I just looked at the next one and was so confused by the code I just kinda gave up reading through it.

A short rant about post-COVID teaching practices,"What follows is just a rant, not actually anything helpful:

I'm taking a high-level stats class, and the professor has decided that the administrative parts of his class can be handled by making us watch lecture recordings of past semesters where he explained it to the present audience. This basically means that his 90 minute lectures are functionally unlimited in time! But I know that the assignments themselves aren't taking any less time, because the videos we have to watch outside the class detail the assignments. What makes professors think that it's OK to just add additional lecture material outside their allotted time? It's so rude. I'm already spending 3-5 hours a week physically in your room, if you count office hours, and even more on homework already. How is that suddenly not sufficient time to teach a class that worked just fine for years before COVID? Lecture recordings are supposed to help students who can't physically be there, not professors who can't be assed to actually teach their classes. I'm pissed.

Animania (anime club) Mass Meeting happening today (9/10) at 6PM in the League!,"Animania is the anime club at the University of Michigan! Our goal is to provide an inclusive environment for anime fans to create friendships and have fun. We are a social club that is passionate about anime and offer our members a wide variety of activities and events.  

We're super chill and super low-commitment. I think something that really speaks to how great a place it is for making friends, is how alumni often still stick around and hang out! Personally, I can attest that it really helped freshman me make friends, and here I am a few years later with large social circles because of it.  

I know ""anime club"" doesn't have the best rep, so... I don't really know how else to say this, but we're more organized and well-adjusted than your high school anime club (you know what I mean), I promise lmao.  If you're *at all* into anime, I highly recommend joining the hundreds of others on our **[Discord server](https://discord.gg/bkM7UvJ)** and seeing if the vibe appeals to you! Joining the server isn't any sort of commitment, but it's really a great place to meet others and chat about whatever anime/manga/games/music/etc you're into right now. For example, there's a ton of us obsessed with Genshin Impact right now, so join the conversation in its dedicated channel if you're into that!

AWFUL and FRUSTRATING MDP program,"I am an international student. Last week, I received the industry offer from MDP. This is my first choice in application and I have been thinking about doing it for a REALLY long time. However, today I received a reply saying that all industry sponsored program require CPT, meaning that they will revoke my offer since I have been fully online and not satisfy the 8 month physical presentation in US requirement necessary for CPT qualification.

I made a careful preparation in MDP, writing resume, making interview videos and writing cover letter to show how I really love and fit in this program. They should have planned everything beforehand. Not when I think my effort finally pays off and then they wanna take it back.

Plus, I heard some other school who offer similar programs do not require CPT. So why can‚Äôt our school‚Äôs employees figure out a way to bypass this requirement??? Or can‚Äôt it be treated as a normal class taught by some external instructor??? This policy shouldn‚Äôt be that strict.

The morning sun filters through the autumn leaves outside my window. The aroma of my Jimmy Dean sausage egg and cheese fills my lungs as it rotates in my microwave. Even the cool touch of the linoleum floor against my bare feet feels vibrant, for it reminds me that I am still alive.

Even though this test may very well vanquish me, it has gifted me an understanding of life. That is that life is given its significance only by the certainty that death will come for us all. No matter how hard we fight its cold onset, we all parish.

Transfer Considering,"Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm considering coming in as a sophomore for (hopefully) LSA CS. 

I initially did not apply at UofM due to my highschool GPA that tanked during Covid (3.82-3.68) this is mostly due to how everything in my life spiraled out of control for a solid two years lol) but I‚Äôve truthfully always wanted to go there because of my love of Ann Arbor, the community and the opportunities available. 

It‚Äôs looking like I‚Äôm ending my freshman semester at my in-state university with a 4.0 with solid classes (taking about 15 credits). 

My ECs in high school were very strong and my ECs in college (so far) have surprisingly also been strong.

Share your experiences: catastrophically bad first semesters,"Right now I‚Äôm in my third year at U of M (I‚Äôm a transfer student) and things have been quite good overall the past few semesters, but I remember my first semester here (fall 2019) being so bad I contemplated switching schools for a while. 

I was wracked by imposter syndrome, felt I didn‚Äôt belong anywhere since I didn‚Äôt have any group to belong to, had pretty much no friends on campus and was stuck in somewhat an abusive relationship with an older friend which messed me up. 

I remember struggling in classes which it seemed like I shouldn‚Äôt have trouble in (likely me becoming accustomed to Michigan standards) and after studying extremely hard for an exam I knew I flunked after I put down my pencil, I remember walking around in the autumn rain late at night blasting Black Sabbath‚Äôs Born Again and not giving a shit what happened to me because I thought I was just utterly useless at life. Sounds a bit edgy now, but it was just an utterly frustrating time. 

I was depressed to an extent that I was fired from a job because I wasn‚Äôt doing enough and had become essentially redundant all at the same time lol. My roommates were nice at least, but we were regularly harassed and threatened by other guys in the apartment, including one crazy guy who started cop knocking my door and screaming in my face over something I had no involvement with lmao. Remember contemplating suicide several times. 

As bad as it all seemed then, I actually have some nostalgia for the time even though it was only two years ago, as it was such a strange crossroad in my life. My first time being away from home, and having to live in my own place. The frustrations of comprehending a completely different hierarchy where you‚Äôre completely insignificant, have to determine things for yourself, and take responsibility. I wouldn‚Äôt be the same person if I hadn‚Äôt done it. I finally started taking medicine for my illnesses and it was another important step in my social maturity.

Now this isn‚Äôt just all me whinging about relatively innocuous and everyday struggles. It‚Äôs about your first days at U of M and how you look back at them. Was it a horrible semester and did it change you? Are you glad it happened or do you regret it entirely and wish you took a different path in life?

"Why are the language departments, specifically French, so strict on absences and everything in general?","There are 15 allotted absences without penalty, but I‚Äôve either been trying to rest to recover from post-Covid symptoms or have been at doctors appointments. Doctors appointments are not excused. Being sick is not excused. Everything falls back on that 15 number. It actually used to be 5. 

I had Covid-19 earlier in the year, which they excused those absences. (Probably reluctantly since they‚Äôre assholes about absences and it‚Äôs university policy) But, I did not feel well enough after being released from Q&amp;I housing, so I decided to stay in my house to rest and feel better. I understand this may not be an excused absence, but the rest of my LSA professors were lenient. 

I began coughing a lot, so when it was bad, I wouldn‚Äôt go to class in case it was something contagious. It was so bad I had to leave the classroom to cough. This has been going on since post Covid, but it‚Äôs been worse the past week and a half. 

So, I go to an urgent care clinic yesterday (Monday) , since UHS is booked, and of course I test positive for the flu. We‚Äôre not sure if this will be an excused one! My cough is so bad and I have the flu, but they still want me to come to class! Their only response is ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt pass the ResponsiBLUE, then don‚Äôt come to class.‚Äù But, is flu included in that? No! It‚Äôs for Covid-19! 

How uncaring can the language departments be? Do they not care about students? Is there anything I can do about this? My lecturer can‚Äôt really do anything, since everything in the French department is written by some other higher up person and my lecturer just grades and lectures. My lecturer is actually very nice and understanding, but it‚Äôs the department that sucks.",1636479092,1,0

I lost out on a significant amount of time working and salaries due to not being good at interviews. I wanted to fix that by building an online interview prep system.

I am in the midst of planning my winter semester out, and am planning to take SI 110, SI 106, and CHEM 215/216 together. I understand that the addition of chem seems very weird, but I swear I have a reason lol. 

I do not have any formal experience programming/coding, so I am a bit worried that SI 106 will be very difficult for me and that I might end up spending most of my time on it. On the other hand, I have also heard that it is a very beginner friendly course and is significantly easier than EECS. 

Would anyone who has had experience taking SI 106 be able to talk about how the difficulty of the course or how much of a workload it was,  or perhaps offer some advice as to how to do well in the course?

Thanks in advance, and I hope all of your midterms have been going great so far!",1635446758,1,0

Should I go to office hours if I am confused to the point where I can't understand lecture notes??,"Hello, I am a sophomore currently taking discrete math (EECS 203), and needless to say, I am very confused with what is happening in lecture notes.

My grade is already poor, and I had to drop orgo in order to be able to focus better.

I feel nervous, as there is also a bad trend when it comes to homework, and I feel very stuck overall.

"For the average international CS major that has a 3.3 GPA, how do you go about getting scholarships?","Hi all!

International student here. I'm thinking of majoring in computer science at the University of Michigan. However, it's expensive to attend for an international student. I'm thinking of applying to some scholarships to help decrease my financial burden while I pursue a rigorous education. I don't think I'm an outstanding student, so I predict that I would only be able to get average grades since there are many smart people around.

Nonetheless, I think I should still try my best to apply to scholarships. I've looked at many resources about scholarships located in the university's website as well as others.

Unfortunately, I'm really overwhelmed by all the information and need some help. Most important to me is that I'm not sure how to effectively and efficiently go about getting scholarships that suit my circumstances.

Any out-of-state upperclassmen have tips for dealing with homesickness?,"I'm aware that this is probably a very common issue for OOS freshmen like me. This post is half asking for support, and half asking for advice.

I was planning on commiserating with my roommate about it, but he's in-state. Like, his house is 10 minutes away from our dorm, he's got a bunch of high school friends here, and he's pretty familiar with the city, so I don't think he's feeling super homesick rn

NFC-Not for Credit when taking MATH 215 and 217 concurrently.,"My friend selected MATH 215 and 217 in this semester in order to get in the Math major sooner. However, when we checked his Unofficial Transcript and Audit Report tonight, both reports said MATH 215 is NFC, which is not for credit.

He is a transfer student without any transferred MATH course, but he had previous Calc II experience. So the advisor told him he can do 215 and 216/217 at the same time.

Is this a rule? The only thing I could get from Department of Math website is that if you took a prerequisite class after finishing sequential course(s), the credit will not be granted. I understand 115 and 116 are sequential, if you take 115 after taking 116, 115 will be NFC. But it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to say 215 and 217 are sequential.

I just want to ask if this rule exists, or if anyone encountered before, since it is frustrating for my friend, in addition to the upcoming 215&amp;217 midterms, gun shot threat and the covid trauma.

How to make an exam fair for students who take it in-person vs. at home?,"Hi all - I'm a GSI and we had a really frustrating situation come up during an exam. The exam was supposed to be done in-person today, but the website students used to take the exam was down in our classroom. This has never happened in the 3 years before the pandemic - I think the website must have poor maintenance or something this semester. As a result, the professor has decided to have students take the exam at home (no books, other websites, or friends allowed) anytime between now and Friday.

However, we had several students already finish the exam earlier today in-person - they were able to complete it because they took the exam at the Services for Students with Disabilities office. But a couple of these students (very reasonably) are unhappy that most of their classmates will be taking the exam at home this week and will have extra time to study as well as the opportunity to cheat. I already know from previous experience that something like 25-50% of students will cheat in some way when taking this exam at home (either by briefly looking up a couple answers or just outright taking the exam with friends).

What is a fair way to deal with this? I've thought of the below options, but I'm not sure if the students will think it's unfair in some way.

1. Make the first exam weighted less heavily than the next two exams. The exams are worth 75% of the overall grade (each worth 25%), so we could make the first exam worth 15% and the other two worth 30% each. Students who took the exam today, in-person at the SSD office would have the option to opt in or out of this new weighting, and they could decide anytime before the last exam occurs.
2. Exam weightings will stay the same for students without disabilities, but those who took the exam today at the SSD office will have the opportunity to opt in or out of the new weighting anytime before the last exam occurs.

Also as an FYI - the exam is not graded on a curve. This is in a subject where the average exam grade is typically 85-90%.",1633389634,1,0

I wish I could have a different roommate but I don't want to create any sort of conflict/drama, so I don't want to involve an RA or anything. Am I overreacting/being too sensitive?

Based on the fact that we are still required to wear masks in classes that are much smaller and less crowded, it made me think either masks in those classes is overkill, or this party was too blas√© about covid safety.

How to avoid distractions and work efficiently?,"I can imagine my mom's voice saying, ""apopDragon, it takes you an hour to do something your classmates did in 20 minutes. Work more efficiently otherwise you cannot survive in college.""

&amp;#x200B;

And how tf did that just come true!

Even the few days that I manage to work without distractions, I waste too much time on the little formatting that doesn't really matter, I keep on correcting a paragraph that's 95% good instead of writing the next paragraph. Whenever I feel like ""how should I write the next section?"" instead of thinking about it, I just forget about it, hoping that the problem solves itself but it doesn't.

Now of course, I still managed to get assignments turned in on time and I am getting 95%+ on most of them. But the effort-to-grade ratio is **terrible** and all my classmates finished the same assignment like its a joke.

If you add distractions into it like instagram and even posting this, my efficiency is lower.

**TL;DR:** Sure I get good grades and turn things in on time, but I gotta work more efficiently? How do I do that since I know I shouldn't spend almost the whole day only on homework while others have time to camp, hang out, do extra-curriculars and achieve the same grades as I do.",1633317735,1,0

"Research opportunity for programmers interested in developing ""empathy"" games.","We are a team of 5 researchers at the School of Information working on designing digital games that help build empathy between opposing groups by correct misconceptions about the other side.

We are looking for folks with some knowledge of ReactJS and NodeJS, or are willing to pick them up quickly.

**What do we expect from you?**  
We have an MVP version of the game built on ReactJS and NodeJS. We are looking to expand features while we playtest and iterate. The time commitment would be about 5-10 hrs work/week.

**What will you get?**  
You'll get to build real-world games backed by decades of social science research. You'll be working with other programmers and UX designers, and be exposed to the full game development cycle. We are aiming for an app rollout by Dec 1st.

**Is there any compensation?**  
At this point, we can't offer monetary compensation. But, in the past, we've had great success working with undergrads culminating in [co-authored research](https://ashwinrajadesingan.com/files/cscw_2021_crosspartisan_strategies.pdf) \[pdf\]. You can also gain independent study credits.

Do timesheets for UROP (as work-study) now or later?,"In a bit of a sticky situation and the people I've contacted haven't responded yet so decided to post here.

I'm also curious, is there anything about the UofM curriculum that makes you think, ""this either a) sounds impressive b) is impressive or c) definitely something i would never ever mention to a person going to my college""?

I‚Äôm not sure do people like me( I believe many Chinese students may face the same situation) still need to get the booster even if we‚Äôve already taken 4 shots?

**AN OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT MARK SCHLISSEL AND PROVOST SUSAN COLLINS**

In light of the recent surge of COVID cases at numerous campuses and the decisions of [a number of institutions](https://www.chronicle.com/article/omicron-is-here-and-colleges-are-scrambling) to [cancel in-person exams](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/12/ithaca-campus-moving-alert-level-red) and events for the rest of the fall semester, we write to urge the University of Michigan administration to reconsider our plans for the winter semester.  It seems clear that bringing students, faculty, and staff back to campus directly after a week of holiday activities that typically include numerous gatherings of friends and relatives and often take place in crowded venues is a recipe for a major COVID outbreak in the first week or two of classes.  The Omicron variant is already sweeping the nation, and doubtless will pick up speed post-holidays.  We would like to see UM respond proactively by making some adjustments to the Winter term in advance rather than after a major outbreak has occurred.

**The key move, we believe, is to delay in-person teaching by at least around two weeks (post-MLK day).**  There are many ways that this might be accomplished, including: 

‚Ä¢ simply moving the current winter term schedule back two weeks, 

‚Ä¢ condensing the schedule to remain roughly within the current end-of-semester time 

  frame, 

‚Ä¢ beginning the semester virtually and then switching to in-person instruction.

We understand that each of these possible scenarios brings with it a number of issues that would have to be addressed and so we hope that the administration would seek advice from and work together with faculty, staff, and students to devise a suitable alternative.  **We also hope that the administration would at least consider leaving it to instructor discretion whether to teach virtually or in-person as long as there is a significant threat of a serious outbreak on campus.**

As we work toward a good solution, we should also keep in mind the enormous toll that the last two years of living in the time of COVID have taken on all members of the community in terms of our mental health.  Any ways in which we can provide extra time for rest and recuperation before starting another COVID semester seem important to consider.  **We must also be sure to provide some kind of break during the semester, whether it is in the form of maintaining the current winter break or an equivalent number of teaching-free days scattered throughout the semester. They serve a crucial role in supporting mental health.**

What is critical, we believe, is to act now and not wait until a last-minute decision is forced upon us by circumstances.  UM should lead the way in devising a strategy to address the problems that return to campus will almost inevitably entail.  

In addition to modifying the winter term schedule, **we urge you to give serious consideration to requiring all members of the community who are medically able to receive booster shots if their initial full vaccination is more than six months old as well as to ensuring that everyone has ready access to the booster.**  And we should be mindful of the unequal impacts that a severe outbreak of COVID would have on the various constituents of our community.  **Ensuring the collective well-being must remain a fundamental priority**.

We look forward to hearing your response to this letter and to a reconsideration of the plans for the winter term.",1639787667,1,0

A Controversial Opinion About Math 116,"This is coming from someone who bombed their math 116 finals so hard, my gpa for that class dropped 2 letter scores. Also, please note that my experience won't be reflective of that of everyone else's for that class. I personally had a really great professor and I know a lot of people had GSI's who were less capable in teaching. I just want to share my opinion of Math 116 after having taken it.

So as someone who has been on the uofm subreddit for a while, I've heard all the nightmare stories about ""Michigan Math"", about the impossible exams and how everyone would probably be better off taking the calc sequence courses at a CC or through AP exams. However, let me just say, this hasn't been the case for me. I've had a whole semester of Math 116 and tbh I feel like I've learned more math in 3 months than in all 4 years of my high school career. Let me explain.

Like 90% of umich students, I was a top student in my high school, but esp in math. I remember from my first year in algebra to AP Calc AB for all my exams, I would simply spend 15-30 minutes writing a list of formulas/common problems each night prior, and maybe spend \~1 hr before each exam making sure I've memorized all those formulas. Then I would walk into each exam and get an A. This may sound fantastic for most people, but it was also the main reason I've never liked math throughout high school. All the rote memorization, the plugging in numbers into random equations or into my calculator, teachers never really teaching the concepts/applications behind what we were doing, it made me feel like a robot. I was getting very good at reading a problem for numbers, plugging those numbers into equations we were told to memorize, and using my calculator to find an answer.  There was no cleverness, no fun, no tricks, no problem-solving, no real math.

I still remember some distinct memories with math from high school. For one exam, I asked my precalc teacher why I got a question wrong. She told me it was because I didn't use the right formula. I asked her why my method didn't also work, because even though it wasn't what she taught us, it was still something that should've worked logically. She simply said it was wrong and told me to use the formula. When I looked at the problem again, I realized one of the numbers I used for the angles was wrong. I was overjoyed because that meant the method I used/ logic I used was still correct. I pointed it out for my teacher but she repeated about using the right formula and didn't even bother to listen to what I was telling her. 

After that year, I remember being soo confused throughout AP Calc. I didn't understand what an integral is, other than it being ""the area under the curve"". I didn't understand related rates, so I just memorized a method a youtuber used for solving those problems so I can score high on the quizzes. I hated math that year. It wasn't something that was simply boring. It was boring and hard at the same time. I was doubting my decision in going into engineering but I already applied. After reading various posts, I was worried about Math 116 but I had no other choice since I needed the class for several prerequisites so I added it to my schedule.

Fast forward to today, and I'm really glad I took Math 116 at umich and not at a CC or through Calc BC. For one, I feel like I understood calc. Not just memorizing equations to get a high test score. I understood concepts, the application of those concepts, how to use my knowledge of the concepts to approach random problems I've never seen. I now know that the reason why I didn't understand integrals back in high school was because my teacher never really explained what dx is; I just know it as something that goes in the back of an integral. I didn't understand what it represents, or what its significance is. When I watched my professor explain the solids of revolution and work units, I was fascinated by math for the first time, because the concept of ""slicing"", and then using the volume/work from one single slice to find that of a whole solid, whether that be a cone, an aquarium, a bracelet, was just so clever and interesting. I went over the pictures I copied down into my notes over, and over again, imagining one slice spinning into part of a solid, and the rest of the slices that followed. I spent an afternoon doing calc problems, deriving all the formulas myself without even looking at my notes. I started seeing the problems I've worked on as something neat and elegant, and was at times even excited when I was wrong on a problem because I admire the cleverness in looking at how others solved for the actual solution.

Again, I don't think the majority of students will share my experience but I've seen so many negative posts about the calc sequence I thought it would be nice to have a post that says something positive about it. Even though I bombed my finals for that class, I would still say 70% of that was my own fault for not taking care of my mental health and messing up my sleep schedule prior to the exam and maybe only 5% of it was the fault of the math department. Overall, I think the math department has a somewhat unfair bad rep. I can understand the complaints about bad professors or bad GSI's but I don't think the content of the class is ""unfair"" or ""too hard"" in any way. Yes, it is very very challenging, esp for students who make the transition from hs math to umich math, but it is also stuff you can do well on with the appropriate level of studying, not to mention very interesting and rewarding. Overall here are some tips based on what helped me in the class

1) Learn to love the process

If you are just practicing problems for the answers, you will no doubt find the class very frustrating, since each time a new unit begins 90% chance your answers will end up being completely wrong. Instead, learn to love the process for solving for the answer, the thrill of deciding how to even begin, finding your right ""tools"", finding the logic in solving for the problem, treating it as a game, or an engineering puzzle ready to be solved. If your answer is wrong, rework your way through the entire problem, seeing if there were any holes in your logic, if there was a computational error, etc. If you are still wrong, you can look for the correct solution, and oftentimes, it is very clever, and you can admire the methods that other mathematicians use to solve your problem. 

2) Go to OH

I see a lot of people complaining about the team hw and this wouldn't be a problem if people just went to OH. If your schedule doesn't work, zoom math lab works as well. I remember spending 4 hours on a team hw assignment only to be told by my professor during OH I am completely wrong and have to redo the entire problem, but I didn't mind at all because I was just happy I now know the correct way to do it.

3) If you are frustrated, drink milk tea

At night esp, when I feel very frustrated with math and chem hw, I just go to my dorm library with a cup of hot strawberry or peach flavored milk tea. Trust me, this helps a lot.

Lastly, just in case any professors or the course coordinator is reading this, I have a few suggestions about improving the course as well

1) Improve the topics sequence

One of the most confusing things when I was taking the course was the sequences. One day we are doing improper integrals from chapter 8, the next day we are somehow at probability density functions from chapter 4. Most of the time this makes no sense and my friend in the class had trouble keeping up with topics for this reason. Please fix the sequence.

2) Stop picking at little details just to take off points

Seriously, if a student wrote on their test an integral converges bc of p-test, why would you ever take off points because they didn't write what the p-value is? Obviously they know what it is or else they wouldn't know it converges. Also why would we need to write a series is an alternating series before applying the alternating series test? Obviously we know it is alternating otherwise we wouldn't write about the test!

3) Please teach content correctly

I didn't say it at the time but I admit I was a little triggered during the work unit. Yes, work is force times displacement, but that does not mean F is always equal to mg. Most of the time we were doing problems with lifting things so work should really be Ftension times displacement, or F=ma. The only reason why mgh works is because Ft=Fg but this isn't always going to be the case, so it works only when there is no net force. If there is a net force, Ft would not equal Fg. This isn't even counting the ignoring of the entire cos theta part of the equation. Just because theta happens to be 0 in the examples you use, that does not mean it's not important. I know we are learning math and not physics but if you are going to teach physics, please teach it correctly.

Overall, I wrote this post to express my appreciation for my math 116 professor and the people who designed the course. I know I wrote mean things in the back of my final exam but I promise this was because I was frustrated and I'm sorry about that. Anyway, 9/10 course, very unique and engaging compared to high school math garbage, totally recommend it over CC but again this was just my opinion. Gl to my fellow engineers doing umich math !",1639707710,1,0

Getting good grades but not learning much,"I just wanted to see if anyone had similar experiences. For reference, I'm a junior btw. This semester in particular, I feel like I learned very little. I took an upper-level chemistry class that was very conceptual and involved quite a bit of physics but due to the format of the class, it wasn't too hard to get a good grade. Retrospectively, I don't feel like I learned very much. Like I figure out how to solve basically random math problems and do well on the assignments. if someone was to ask me to broadly explain what I learned, I honestly could not. It feels bad because I basically wasted a bunch of time and money just to get a good grade but personally I got very little out of time. Similarly, for a sociology class I took (400 level), honestly, I can't say I learned very much either. most things that we talked about seemed very obvious and self-explanatory. There were assigned readings but I don't have time to spend like 5 hours reading random sociology papers. I feel like I gained a very minimal amount of knowledge from discussions and lectures.

I'm really not complaining or anything like that, just figured I's share and maybe yall also have some similar feelings/experiences. I also don't mean to say this is true for all of my classes. I learned a lot in my biology and physics class and don't have much to say about that. 

Also I realize that if I put more effort into maybe trying to extract information and did a bunch of supplemental work I would have learned more. I didn't do that thought and basically only did what I needed to do to get an A. Idk if that matter but might as well mention it",1639706019,1,0

COVID P/NRC and Major Requirements,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

Fall of 2020 while we were online and off-campus, I unfortunately did not have a stable Internet connection or access to one. I still took my courses and passed them, but received grades I did not want on my transcript, so I converted them to P's. This was under the assumption that the P/NRC guideline would not be subject to the ""no P/F for major requirements"", but now looking at my transcript it says I'd taken the classes as P/F and I'm super concerned that I totally screwed myself over for declaring my major, as many of those classes were prerequisites for my major. The thing is, I had meetings with my advisor about my major plans and grade conversions and this was NEVER brought up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone give me some guidance on how this policy works? Does the P/NRC guideline work differently than a normal P/F because of circumstances? Do these credits count as completed towards my major prerequisites or am I going to be stuck retaking classes because of this?

Would also like outdoor seating, but hey, would also like to be in Miami.

This may be tricky with Covid + New Year's Eve, and many former fave places never reopened after shutdown, but GoBlue never stops, so somewhere should have it on!

Thanks for any suggestions. Will be coming from Tribeca.",1640879096,1,0

"Outdated, Offensive Terminology in Electrical Engineering Classes","In EECS 270 our professor made the wise decision to abandon the traditional master-slave terminology when discussing one electronic device controlling another, and went as far as to call it racist, and opted to use the terms leader-follower devices. However in other EE classes, EECS 312 and EECS 373 for example, the department approved curriculum still says the words master and slave on the slides over and over again. I'm just trying to learn electronics, it's a distraction that I don't want to learn to ignore. I think for students of color this is unfair, just my opinion. If this terminology is not critical to describing and referring to these concepts, then it should be abandoned and replaced. I expect the counter argument is that this is the prevalent industry standard, but Umich and other top engineering schools are a key part of technical industries and this is an example of a harmless change at our school that could make a small impact towards diversity in a relatively non diverse space, who cares if it irritates some boomer engineer who's retiring soon anyways.",1640873397,1,0

Econ 101 difficulty for a CS major,"Hi guys, 

I‚Äôm a CS major in LSA trying to get some distribution requirements done with. My schedule for next year is EECS 281, MATH 214, ECON 101 and a Race &amp; Ethnicity course.

EECS 270 vs 370 workload,"Hey all I'm in CSE and next semester, I'll be taking either: EECS 281/376/370 or EECS 281/376/270.

I was hoping to get some opinions on which schedule would be the lightest. or just opinions in general. I'm interested in taking EECS 270 because I may end up taking EECS 373 (intro to embedded systems), which requires eecs 270.

I know that taking 3 EECS classes isn't recommended but I don't have that much flexibility since I transferred in pretty late. Currently I already plan on graduating a semester late too. The classes mentioned above are the only classes I'd be taking as well, so I'd only have 12 credits. Or maybe 13 if I end up taking eecs 201.

For context, I have taken EECS203 &amp; EECS280 so far. I did decent in 203. I personally found 280 to be pretty fun and easy, though mostly because of my programming background. I don't have much experience working with anything low level though, or implementing my own data structures.

"Getting fit at UofM? CHAARG, fitness clubs, exercise buddies?","Hello UMich fam! I'm looking for a student organization that focuses on improving health and fitness for UMich students. Specifically, I would like to find a club that is pretty active (pun intended) with weekly or biweekly events. And I need for the members to be non-clique-y and any exercise events to be relatively accommodating to people of various fitness levels. I've started working out and eating healthier some on my own, and I've done a fitness class at UMich, but I'd like to find a consistent support group with similar goals. I am female, like 50 lbs overweight, and in my late twenties. 

In the Maize Pages, I found CHAARG, which seems to be exactly what I'm looking for. But the cost of membership is like $50, or $75 if you want the TShirt. I'm totally cool with paying this, if it is what I'm looking for, but I don't want to spend that much money if it's an inactive club or consistently utilizes exercises that are currently unrealistic for my body. Also, does anyone know if this money covers classes or anything?

Does anyone recommend CHAARG or any group like what I am talking about? I think it would be especially cool if an organization did healthy cooking classes, healthy luncheons, tried various exercise classes, went on walks together, etc. I would also be super happy to just find one person or a small group of people who want to do these types of activities together, and is willing to commit to going out at least a couple of times a month (and is okay with my current fitness level).",1640636851,1,0
I need you all who are begging for in person start to the semester to take a step back and think this through.,"I am 26, when I was 8 years old, one August evening, I began getting sick. I was eventually taken to the ER because I had had a surgery the day before that and was not responding to my mom calling to me because I was shutting down. The ER didn't take me seriously, because it was busy and I had, what seemed like flu symptoms.

Well, 20 minutes or so after I got there, I started shaking. My mom panicked and went to the ER desk demanding I got my temp checked as we already knew I was burning up. 104. They finally fucking got that I was in danger and ran around figuring out what to do with me / how to help me. It turned out I had bacterial meningitis. Caught at some point during or after my ear surgery. I had to get helicoptered to a hospital that could help me. Before I was put under for an operation, I suddenly lost my right ear's hearing. It was to never come back. Woke up to that reality being confirmed and my parents communicating with me via notepad. I proceeded to spend 3 weeks in the hospital due to shunt complications. The hospital I was waiting in the ER in was Walter Reed. One of, if not the top military hospitals, and because no one was able to see me, I lost my right ear, and almost my life.

&amp;#x200B;

That was due to negligence, but right now, our hospitals, really are overran by Covid cases, to where there are people like 8 year old me, dying of preventable causes every day, because the hospitals are overcrowded. 

I don't care if you choose not to feel sorry for the unvaccinated getting hospitalized. I don't like their choices either. I do deeply care about the people getting permanent damage and death because there's no room for them in the hospital. People are getting and will keep getting hospitalized with Covid, especially after a holiday season where so many are desperate to see family after not getting to last year. I get it and am all for seeing family. But I am also for responsibility. We need to be reasonable and stay away from class settings JUST FOR TWO WEEKS, just to get past this initial post holiday spike, so we don't overwhelm the hospitals. I get it, it sucks, I trult am sorry it is like this. I didn't get to have a real college experience, and I know how much that sucks and I wish it wasn't like this.

I just want for everyone to have the chance to live happy lives after this. You can swear all you want that you are a young, healthy, vaccinated person. I was a young healthy vaccinated 8 year old, and I still got meningitis. I still live with that today. You can say the hospitals aren't full right now but that is no indication of what it will look like in the next two weeks. I'm honestly begging you to, for just two weeks, go along with a remote class option if offered or mandated. You don't want to be that 8 year old and you don't want others to be that 8 year old.. I know some 400IQ people will just dismiss this as Anecdotal or whatever. I'm not trying to be manipulative. I'm trying to share why this debate makes me so personally heated and how I feel about it, in the most raw way I can. Thank you.",1640631682,1,0

CS department understaffing,"I feel like even with the huge amount of IAs, GSIs, professors that the department hires, the classes are still extremely understaffed. if you login to the office hour queue at the exact time it opens, even a week before the project is due (meaning you‚Äôre not exactly late, or early, just in the middle of ur project), you‚Äôre guaranteed a minimum 30 minute wait which is more like a 2-3 hour wait for 10 mins of help. if there are ~20 people in the queue then u get ten minutes, which often isn‚Äôt enough time for them to look at ur overall code if you‚Äôre having trouble with organization and your earlier errors are causing the current errors. So u spend multiple hours trying to get help since the only people who can see your code is the staff. And its frustrating that you‚Äôre told to start projects early countless times as if that is the only solution to this. Despite starting early, it has always been a problem for me. Most people are not finishing their projects the same week it‚Äôs assigned, meaning they don‚Äôt really have access to short lines when they are really getting into the main parts of the projects. It makes me wonder that even if the staff is already huge, why don‚Äôt they double it etc if there is a clear short-staffing issue?

(But honestly we all end up paying only a fraction after financial aid LOL) 

At least just from looking at Michigan's OOS tuition, it's not that much different from other top 30 schools.
