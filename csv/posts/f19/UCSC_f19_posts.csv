**In the morning of Tuesday at 9am in 2015** Six UCSC students blocked the Highway 1 southbound right here Highway 17 merges at where what's known as the ""fishhook"" and thus completely disrupting traffic, commute to work,  local businesses/companies on both sides of the hill to bring awareness to Tuition Hikes and Black Lives Matter. It took police and firefighters five hours to break apart PVC pipes protesters had their chain-locked arms in, through a garbage can with 700lbs of cement.

I'm understanding of causes, but disagree with certain methods. In this case  I thought this trivialized the seriousness and movement which they said to have protested for. Focus on one cause, and stick with it. Tuition hikes, Police Brutality  and Black Lives Matter?.. Might as well throw rent control, our opioid problem, homelessness, white supremacy, or anything else that would further water down whatever issues they wanted to bring acknowledgement towards. Regardless, the outcome of this were some of the protesters having regrets, one with a felony and the other five misdemeanors. Locals here feel already feel a certain way towards UCSC students by the way.[https://www.ksbw.com/article/police-arrest-6-uc-santa-cruz-students-highway-1-reopens/1056102#](https://www.ksbw.com/article/police-arrest-6-uc-santa-cruz-students-highway-1-reopens/1056102#)

**Every year there are different protests/picket lines** that consists of both entrances to the campus being blocked by students whiles classes were still in session. My experience: I get off the bus with my bike from base of campus and ride up, protesters won't negotiate/budge. There seem to be a lot of tension in the air or some sort of preparedness for exchanges of words as if that's what has been going on all day.. It was hot and sweaty, quiet, and a lot of them looked tired and fatigue. I tell them to stay hydrated as I ride off and took the dirt road on my bike to get to class (more longer and tiring). I made it to class, out of breath and met with classmates who conveniently live on campus to get to class. As I ride off they a handful of them said thank you collectively in appreciation upon reminding them to stay hydrated. While I was there another guy insisted on getting through the linked-arm picket line.. they wouldn't budge. So he broke his way through and manage to disconnect the armed linkage between protesters and kept on his business while student protesters were shouting and berating him.

Guaranteed a protest will happen, how you handle or engage is up to you. Funny thing is I don't know if anything ever changed or if these protests had any influences in any decision makings regarding what they were protesting for. I had a friend share with me that some girl was running amok up and down the dorms barbarically knocking on everybody's door including her door, waking her up to have her join in on their protests during dead week (week before finals). I'll leave it up to your imagination on how that 'conversation' went as well as how interactions between ""join me in this protest"" girl and students on her floor were for the rest of the year.

"Stolen mattress, I won't ask questions or be mad.","Hey all,

I was leaving my mattress out on the side of a ramp. It is green on one side and brown on the other. It's inflatable by leaving it out in the sun. I went into my dorm briefly and 2 minutes later it was gone when I looked out my window. It got stolen at around 5:30. Please call this number if you have it. 424-644-7764. It was really expensive. I know the person who took it must live around here. You know who you are. I will not be mad. I promise. I won't ask questions. I just want it back. 

I am hoping that the person who took it thought someone was giving it away. I am hoping this is a misunderstanding. Whatever it is, quite frankly, I do not care. I just want it back.

Thank you",1569288005,15,0

Afraid and nervous about being a transfer.,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôll be a prospective cognitive science transfer student next year and I‚Äôm super nervous about being a transfer student. I‚Äôm afraid of people looking down on me since I didn‚Äôt make it as a first year. I did a program called college advantage as a senior (class of 2019) in high school so technically I am a sophomore year transfer, however, I will be admitted as a junior student anyway; will being a year younger than all the new transfer make an impact on the social aspect? I‚Äôm wondering if the transfer students have any advice or insight on what it‚Äôs like being a transfer at UCSC. In addition, what‚Äôs the housing like? I‚Äôm not sure how the housing situation works. I really like college nine and ten but do they house transfers? Or just freshmen? And for those of you who were admitted as a four year student, do you notice the transfers? Are they left out? 

I‚Äôm sorry for the long ass post but I think my pride is getting the best of me. I experienced some exclusion during the first two years of high school and I hate the idea of being excluded/looked down upon since I‚Äôm transfer and I‚Äôm just afraid I won‚Äôt be able to meet new people and experience the college social life.",1570431050,2,0

Computer Science Transfer Questions,"Hi Everybody 

I am currently in my second year here at Canada College I will be applying this year to transfer next fall as a Computer Science major BA. My first question is will I be considered competitive since I am taking the new transfer requirements that consist of python, Computer assembly line and arch, and C++. I believe that the majority of the people applying for next fall will be taking intro to Java, data structures in Java and discrete math. The reason that I am asking this question is that If I were to take the old requirements, I will have to take the courses that I am currently taking at Canada once I transfer to UCSC. My only concern is the course articulation why you may ask is that here at Canada there is only one python course but it articulates to CSE 20 instead of CSE 30, CSE 30 is a new requirement to transfer here at UCSC. I have been informed that I can test out of it which I forgot if it is either CSE 20 or CSE 30. Another course that is in the new requirements is CSE12/12L, here at Canada there is only one Computer assembly line and arch but it has never been articulated to CSE12/12L. If this two courses were not to be articulated, will I still be admitted even though there is no courses that are articulated to CSE 30 and CSE 12/12L at any community college near me like CSM and not having the minimum GPA which is 2.8 in at least 3 courses that will be completed by the end of this semester.",1570251673,0,0

Gym Etiquette 101,"The new academic year brings many new people into the gym. Welcome! I suspect for many of these people it's their first time being in a gym before based on some things I see them do. I thought I would make a post for people who have never been to a gym before so we can strive towards a cleaner and more considerate gym environment for everyone.

1. **Wipe down your equipment!** If you use a machine or bench, it's crucial to wipe off your nasty sweat after. There are spray bottles of cleaner and rags as well as trash cans with gym wipes on top all around both floors of OPERS gym. The bottles and rags are usually attached to pillars and closer to walls than the middle of the gym. *Please* use them. Nobody wants to clean up somebody else's ass sweat!
2. **Re-rack your weights.** Remember where you picked up your dumbbell, barbell, kettlebell or plate? Perfect! Put it back when you're done. This ensures that others can easily find it and use it when you are done and that the floor is free of tripping hazards.
3. **Get off of a machine or put away equipment if you're not using it!** Everyone needs to take a short break between reps sometimes, but try to avoid sitting on a machine staring at your phone for several minutes straight. Other people want to use it too!

These are the the three most essential things to keep in mind at the gym in my opinion. Doing these three simple things helps the gym be a cleaner and more functional place for everyone including yourself. Now go get those gains (and wipe your equipment, rack your weights, and keep track of time)!",1570238179,37,0

Right now I'm taking hard upper division classes as well as need to wake up early. They know this, but keep having people over on the weeknights during the time I would like to study/go to bed.

Last night was especially bad, they invited what looked like 20-30 people who all hungout in the living next to my bedroom until I had to come out and ask them to go outdoors.

"Got an F in a class, now I don't know what to do","Hey Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I took CE100/L, a GE, and another major class that had no lab.

I failed CE100 and it's lab because of super unforeseen personal circumstances.

But, I passed my other two classes( P and an A- ), so my term GPA was around a 1.2ish and I got academic my probation.  

My cumulative GPA however was still pretty health sitting around at a 3.2ish 

&amp;#x200B;

But now that I'm checking my financial aid I'm missing two UCSC scholarships  :( 

The terms said that as long as I stayed in Good academic standing I would get my scholarships. But it also said that it was still valid if my GPA was above 3.0.

I'm going to visit Financial Aid , but I'm dreading the worse.

If I complete the series at my community college I'd be here for another year just taking that class and physics. However my chem prof. said I could apply for internships and do volunteer work in the meantime.

I have been here from fall 2016 to now.  I feel like I am ready to leave but everyone keeps advising against it without completing the series.

I want to gauge interest on a couple of things,"CW: climate grief/anxiety 

I wanted to see if there would be any interest amongst the general student population in either or both of two types of clubs/gatherings.

The first would be a support group to address climate grief. As more and more news reports come out detailing ominous signs of an impending ecological collapse (ice cap loss breaking the big records, deadly wildfire seasons every year, widespread crop failures, Amazon deforestation, ocean acidification, permafrost melt releasing massive amounts of methane triggering further warming, a recent widespread public safety power shut off in our region)  it is becoming impossible to ignore the growing emotional toll of the climate crisis. There are so many feelings associated with this crisis: fear, anger, powerlessness, hopelessness. Many people my age I speak with candidly don‚Äôt see a future in which it‚Äôs safe to have children. Many fear we could see widespread famines, water shortages, and wars in just the coming decades. Many people are already being directly affected by climate change including those who experienced the devastation of hurricane Maria and more recently Dorian, those who‚Äôve lost homes to wildfires and floods, and countless others. Climate change is a very real, very imminent threat and there are very real anxieties, fears, and feelings around it that need to be addressed. I‚Äôd like to start a group where people can talk about and work through their grief in a community. I would base the group around the Good Grief Networks ten step program for personal resilience and empowerment in a chaotic climate: https://www.goodgriefnetwork.org. Please let me know if a group like this is something you would be interested in. 

Secondly, I noticed there aren‚Äôt any groups centered around how to live sustainably, self-sufficiently, or even many skills based groups. I‚Äôd love to start a club where we got together and learned a myriad of skills needed for a self-sustainable life. Some topics could include: canning and preserving, sewing, basic first aid, basket weaving, plant identification, archery, backcountry medicine/cooking/fire making, basic maintenance of things like bikes, cars and appliances, HAM radio, etc. Please let me know if this is something you would be interested in.

The one dude even called me an idiot and said he would never do something like that. It was a great cherry on top for how life has been. So to those people, who went out of their way to be horrible for no reason, screw you. And to everyone else on campus, please do your best to be kind, because you have no idea what someone could be going through.

Advice for Winter Quarter Human Bio Frosh (or any bio major),"I was hoping someone could give me advice on their schedule for their first year as a bio based major, i know theres that 4 year plan but it does not list GEs.

I'm thinking it would be: Calc 19B, Chem 1C, Chem 1C Lab, Writing 2, does this sound doable and how demanding is the chem 1C lab and class in general in comparison to Chem 1A?

Should I retake physics 6A before taking 6B?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a MCD Biology major and transferred from a CC having already taken the equivalent of physics 6A - however it was almost a year ago and the concepts are really rusty. It's also been a half a year on top of that since I took the calculus series. I have time to fit a physics 6A retake into my schedule, but was wondering if it would be necessary to take 6A again to do well in 6B? 

Do the concepts in 6B build upon 6A content or is it general concepts I could review without retaking the course? I don't really want to pay for it again, but I definitely don't want to fail 6B if I'm lacking foundational info. 


Thanks for any advice! Good luck finishing out fall term.",1573262993,1,0

Think I'm going to fail CS major...,"It's just now fully soaking in with me that I'm not going to graduate.

Well, here I am taking another 2 courses, one of them I think I'm doing fine at, the other is CSE112, Comparative Programming Languages. The class has had me completely stumped since day 1.

Now there's a 3rd homework assignment due in a few hours and I'm just sitting here staring at it, watching webcasts, reviewing resources, looking at piazza, nothing makes sense. I can't do this. I'm going to fail another course and they're going to kick me out. Now I just feel useless and my life is meaningless and the last 7 years of my life was a waste of time.

a (hopefully) helpful mega guide for depressi spaghetti banana slugs,"Hello my slooty slugs!

I've been seeing a lot of especially bad struggling going on this quarter, so I'm writing this post in hopes that it can help someone. I know how scary it is to seek help, especially when you don't know what to expect, so here I'm going to write everything I've learned about the CAPS and DRC process in the two and a half years I've worked with them.

**Notes:** This is the information I can give as a UC Ship student, I don't know the details for non UC Ship students, but if you walk in they will 100% tell you what they can do for you. If the thing you're struggling with is ADHD, CAPS is very limited in the help they can provide. I believe they require a full examination to diagnose an attention disorder, and even then they don't have ADHD medicine readily available in the campus pharmacy. I'm not entirely sure, though.

*The CAPS center is across the street of 9/10, upstairs and the OPPOSITE side of where the stairs lead you (right above the pharmacy). The DRC building is located in the Hahn Student Services building, which is across a bridge from the McHenry library.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**CAPS Therapy:**

You can choose to either schedule an appointment over the phone or walk in and fill in a form for them to process you into an appointment. If you feel you're in need of immediate care, you should walk in and express this. You can be connected to a crisis therapist, who will make sure you're okay and not in danger of hurting yourself. 

When you walk in, you can take two different routes as you fill out the check in form. If you check off that you have been feeling suicidal, they will find a therapist for you immediately to make sure you're going to be okay and safe. I will strongly advise that **IF** you want to check off feeling suicidal that you check off that you do NOT have a plan on suicide if you don't want to risk getting a 5450\*\* form filed on you. It might take up to 15 minutes tops for them to find you an available therapist, depending on how busy they are. You'll almost be guaranteed a same day check in though. If you do not check off either of the two suicide boxes, they will feel you aren't in any immediate danger or in danger of hurting others and will probably schedule you for a different day appointment.

When you talk to the therapist, you just have to make sure they understand that you are not a danger to yourself. If you mention you feel depressed and unmotivated, that's enough for them to give you the help you deserve. You don't have to mention you are suicidal. If you mention you have vague suicidal ideation but that you would never follow through, it's very unlikely that they will involuntarily hospitalize you. If they think you need it, they'll give you a short term therapist to help you through the next one to threeish months probably. However they do not offer on campus long term therapy. If you want a long term therapist, they will give you a referral and you'll meet with a therapist off campus. I hear that there is a place near the Metro Center, so it'll just be a short bus ride and a small walk.

\*\***What is a 5450?** A 5450 form gets filled out by a doctor if they feel you are a danger to your own safety. It's what leads to involuntary hospitalization. Generally you don't want it to get to this. It takes away some of your legal rights for up to (but not always) three days, and you are put under the care of a hospital that will monitor your condition. If it comes to this, you'll be okay, and you'll be safe. Just stay calm, and remember that the people handling you want the best for you. They're on your side. I've been to the local psychiatric hospital, and the staff are so very supportive and sweet. Trust them, because they're there for the sole purpose of helping you. 

&amp;#x200B;

**CAPS Medication/Psychiatric Services:**

If you express you want medication, they will assign you to a long term psychiatrist. You'll talk about your needs and they'll start you off with a SMALL dose of a medication, where you can pick up downstairs at the pharmacy. They might tell you to get your blood drawn sometime soon downstairs to make sure you're good to take medication. They'll continue meeting with you every one to two weeks so they can monitor your side effects, health, and needs. Most likely you'll jump from prescription to prescription until you find one that suits you. They might raise or decrease the dosage. They might put you on more than one to find the perfect dose for you. **Keep in mind that all of these changes are 100% YOUR CHOICE**. They will NEVER force you or pressure you to take medication. They're only there to advise you on what they think is best. You will be in control. 

The process might be a struggle, but try not to lose hope. Medication isn't for everyone, but even when it is it takes a while to get it right. Try your best to be completely honest. Feeling 10% better? Don't tell them you're good, admit that things are better but that you aren't completely happy, and they'll talk with you about if they think you should keep trying to find a better dose. It's also normal for medications to lose effectiveness after a while. Don't be discouraged. It's all part of the process. After over two years of medications, I kept making little improvements, but I only found what I think is the perfect prescription 5ish months ago. It was a long journey getting to this point, but I'm the happiest I've been in actual years. If you're feeling good about your prescription, they'll change the appointments to every month, and if you feel great and ask them, they might make it every other month etc. If you ever develop side effects and your appointment isn't until next week or month or something, they'll always be available through the Health e-Messenger.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vacation Coverage:**

Your UC ship coverage lasts through the summer even if you aren't taking summer classes, so you don't have to worry about getting cut off for summer. They'll give you referrals to meet with people in your area over the summer, and give you the medication you need. If you can't find one close to you, they'll even go as far as to pull it up and help you find someone you can meet with. You'll also be able to access them through the e-Messenger.

&amp;#x200B;

**DRC Accommodations:**

You know those little blurbs at the bottom of every syllabus talking about disability resources? It's not exclusive to physical or severe mental disabilities. It applies to anything academically debilitating, including depression and anxiety. You can make an appointment and they'll go over what accommodations they offer. If you have a note from a therapist it'll be much easier to get approved, but I think they also give accommodations without it. I'm not entirely sure. If you get approved, a new menu option on your student portal will be added for Disability Services where you can check off boxes for the classes you need letters for. Go ham and check them all off, whether you think you'll need them or not. It's a safety net. The Accommodation Letters will be emailed to your ucsc email after a few days. 

Being a DRC student is a godsend. Seriously. They offer things like absence and tardiness excuses, deadline extensions, and laptop approval during lectures. The effectiveness of these letters is up to the professor, so don't abuse them. Still, they'll usually be VERY understanding and will work with you a lot more leniently to help you pass. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Emotional Support Animal (ESA) on campus:**

I'm hesitant to cover this, because I don't want people to glamorize the idea of having a pet on campus. It's not some fun cutesy college experience aesthetic bullshit- do NOT try and get an ESA unless you truly believe it will help you get you through your depression. Pets are not accessories, they are not feel-good tools either. They have needs, and if you're having trouble taking care of yourself, you need to think long and hard about whether you're prepared for the commitment of taking care of a whole other living being. 

**Questions you should ask yourself before deciding whether you should apply for an ESA:** Are you capable financially and physically of caring for this animal? You should have a solid few hundred dollars saved away AFTER buying all the basic care materials, in case of a veterinary emergency. You have to be capable of remembering to feed and groom and pick up after your animal every single day. Will you be available emotionally for your animal as they are for you? An ESA does not solely exist to comfort you. They are living being creatures too, and need love and affection and constant care. If you'll be gone all day sometimes and you live alone, consider the emotional well being of the animal, who will feel abandoned and alone. Will you be able to take care of this animal for potentially the next 10 years? This isn't a fish, they'll be alive for a while, and they'll bond with you. Have a solid plan for how you'll have your ESA with you after graduation.

**Still want an ESA?** The ESA application can be picked up at the DRC. If you have a note from a therapist, it'll be much easier to get approved. The approval process will take a few weeks, and then you'll schedule a meeting with your housing coordinator to go over the rules. When you get your ESA, you'll meet with them again to give them your pet's health records.

**Getting an ESA:** You can bring a pet you already own at home, or adopt one if you feel ready for the commitment. If you're struggling a lot with the common symptoms of depression (fatigue, lack of self care, inability to go outside) and you really want an ESA, please get a cat. A dog needs a lot of extra care, and for you to give them the best quality of life, you'll need to be able to walk them every single day for a good amount of time. For where to get the animal, the first main options I considered were Craigslist and the Santa Cruz Shelter. However, Craigslist results will mostly be in neighboring cities, so be ready for a drive to meet and pick them up. For the local shelter, you need to be over 21 to adopt. Soooo I personally had to fall back on Petsmart's in store shelter, where I met my best buddy Bailey. Also be aware when adopting, that you are responsible for any damage or disturbance your pet causes. A loud or destructive animal is definitely not a good candidate.

Be aware that there is usually a 100-150$ adoption fee, on top of needing to buy a brush, scratching post/litterbox for cats, toys for dogs, and pet food and potentially litter regularly. Be prepared to spend 200$ straight away. Then also be ready to pay the monthly fees for care. I personally have to spend \~40$ every month for litter and cat food. 

*When you adopt this animal, you are adopting a new friend and family member, so don't fuck around and be a good owner for your good boye/gorle.*

**ESA Housing Rights:** An ESA is actually protected by California law in terms of housing. Any apartment, including ones that have a no pet policy, cannot turn you away or charge you more for having an ESA. If you provide proper documentation, they must allow you to keep your animal with you as long as they do not damage the property or cause a disturbance of any kind. However, this is in terms of housing only. ESA's are *not* Service Animals. Service Animals are trained and are allowed basically anywhere, but your ESA is basically just another pet in every other aspect. Hopefully though, this housing protection will help you stay with your animal after graduation.

*If you abandon your ESA after the school year ends, I will send PG&amp;E after you.*

**Don't be afraid to get the help you need!**

If you're depressed or struggling, you deserve to get the help you need. Don't ever feel like what you're going through isn't real or important enough to be addressed. It might help and it might not, but don't ever forget that there is help and support available for you. DMs are always open.",1574413409,1,0

Opinion: people shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to be RA‚Äôs more than twice,"I mean TBH my gut feeling is that you shouldn‚Äôt even be able to be an RA more than once but for the sake of my argument I‚Äôll say ‚Äúmore than twice‚Äù. 

Basically, I think being an RA for 2-3 years is a little bit selfish and probably shouldn‚Äôt be allowed. I mean, maybe if the RA hiring process was more anonymous my feelings would be different, but the way it‚Äôs set up now, it‚Äôs super easy to just hire your friends and re-hire each other. Year after year of this means that less and less people have a legitimate chance at being recognized for having good RA‚Äôing skills. Like, okay, maybe it‚Äôs reasonable for people to RA for two years, maybe they‚Äôre really passionate about that themed hall or maybe they‚Äôre crazy fucking good at it. I get that. But don‚Äôt you think three years is kinda pushing it? Like you get three years of free housing just because your friend lowkey tag-teamed you in? 

I‚Äôm not trying to say that being an RA is easy, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs really stressful and taxing and justifiably worth the free housing compensation. But three years just seems to be pushing it a little....especially in a city with this bad of a housing crisis. Like help a comrade out you know? ‚ÄúFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needs‚Äù or whateva.

One major takes five minutes to declare and the minor takes two weeks?,"I‚Äôm declaring as a Sociology major with a minor in Education. I met with the Sociology advisor today and brought my Petition and Academic Plan paperwork. The whole meeting took 5 minutes, and she had me officially declared for Sociology on the spot. She then sent me to the Education office, saying I had to meet with them to declare my minor.

I met with a peer advisor, who was lovely, but couldn‚Äôt sign-off on it and could only forward it for processing to the actual advisor. She said my Education declaration could take up to two weeks.

Now I don‚Äôt want to go all entitled customer here. I understand that people are busy, departments get backlogged, welcome to college. But I can‚Äôt wrap my head around the discrepancy. The declaration paperwork only requires a look-over for correctness, a signature, and what seems to be a few strokes of the keyboard, at least from the looks of it. Why can I meet with the advisor in charge in one department and they can instantly declare me, but I can only meet with a student in the other department, and won‚Äôt be declared for up to two weeks? Is Education just a much larger major with more students? Is the declaration processing more complicated for Education on MyUCSC?

Why I'm glad I took distributed systems with peter alvaro in college.,"I graduated spring 2019 and I'm a data engineer now, meaning it's important to know how distributed systems work in the back of my mind because of all the distributed whatever tools I use from a day to day basis. The class itself teaches a lot about API fundamentals and a lot of interviews ask you to use an API and do something with requests you make to it. I for one had never worked with APIs because I've had no technical background prior to college and I never had a personal project, so it took me the longest time to understand what it is in the first place. This class teaches you a lot of practical skills beyond just the concepts. If you are scared of whether or not you should take this class, don't think twice. It's hard but it's VERY rewarding. It's one of the best classes to take to help you get a job imo (I'm not being a teacher's pet for peter alvaro. I barely spoke to the guy when I took it). I just wanted to say how valuable the things you learn in this class are and I gotta say, I would be a lot more clueless at my entry level job if I didn't take this course.

More demands to the University,"Some personal demands to the University:

Provide a Cost of Living Adjustment for all. The largest employer in Santa Cruz county and the greatest contributor to the city‚Äôs population, UCSC is substantially responsible for driving up local housing costs. Recognizing this negative impact, UCSC must provide a monthly COLA in order to bring all full-time employees and half-time student employees out of rent burden. No worker may earn poverty wages. No hours may be cut to meet this demand.

Cops off campus. No arrests for civil disobedience or non-violent offenses. Funds released in this manner can go towards the above demand.

Suspend tuition. Return to pre-1975 cost of attendance. 1/2 of the federal government‚Äôs assets are comprised of student debt.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 4c2ih7n0nm441...*

Guarantee free room and board for all incoming students. This will help ensure a campus growth rate based on sustainability rather than profit.

Abide by a binding and transparent democratic procedure for community decision-making and campus resource management.

Provide free parking to all students and workers.

Appeal to the state overlords to fund the above demands. If education is a public good, demand higher taxes on the wealthy.

Divest from the Thirty Meter Telescope to meet the above demands.

Liquidate financial assets to meet the above demands.

Starting from the highest paid employee, redistribute campus salaries as necessary to meet the above demands.

Undergrads need a raise too...," 

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: I got the following information from the internet, so... yeah.

Here's the current TA salary breakdown from the SOE website:

&amp;#x200B;

|Position |Workload|Monthly Salary|Hourly Wage  |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TA, 25%|10 hours per week|$1181.83|$29.55 |
|TA, 50%|20 hours per week |$2363.66|$29.55|

&amp;#x200B;

(Additionally, TAs receive ""remission for in-state fees"". I will ignore this in the calculations.)

The proposed cost of living adjustment of $1,412 would increase graduate student wages (for 50% TAs) to (2363.66+1412.00)/(4\*20)=$47.20/hr. (it's a lot higher for 25% TAs)

For reference, Undergraduates working at the dining hall have a starting wage of $12/hr.

Tuition costs are roughly equivalent for graduate students and undergraduate students, as are the costs of housing.

I support the right of the grad students to share their discontent with their situation, and completely disagree with the university's categorization of the strike as ""illegal"". However, it seems like if anyone needs a pay bump, it's the undergrads. Why should students working for $12-15/hr with the same housing and tuition costs as their TAs be subsidizing a further pay increase to over triple what they are making. 

Degree programs, especially those of graduate students, shouldn't be thought of as cheap or break-even endeavors. The promise of a degree (or at least the hope these days) is to increase future earnings by foregoing current earnings. In a perfect world, both sets of students get raises, but I just don't understand the humanitarian need for TAs to get a $47/hr wage before undergraduates come even close to $20/hr. 

Please help me understand what I'm missing.",1576309334,1,0

UCEAP CS Major study abroad?,"Hey y'all, just looking for any CS majors here who studied abroad and were able to get Major Credit for classes at UCSC. I'm planning on trying to study abroad in either Copenhagen or South Korea next fall, and was trying to figure out if I'll actually get major credit for the classes I'd be taking.

I was looking at the UCEAP Course Catalog to see what classes had been previously used for credit and it seemed like there were some similar classes to some of our upper div electives (Data Visualization, Machine Learning, etc.)

I know BSOE says they need a detailed syllabus and coursework, but does having the course in the course catalog help support that at all? I'd really like to study abroad but I mainly just need Upper Div electives next year.",1575600103,1,0

Vending Machine at Jack Baskin 3rd Floor is Cursed,"Here I am, at Jack Baskin, studying for a test my ass ain't ready for, when suddenly I get a rumbly in my tumbly. No problem, this building is equipped with the finest cuisines available in vending machine form. I exit my study nest and head towards the nearest snack dispensary. I arrive at my destination and see a plethora of nourishment. Being a degenerate I swipe my credit card and enter A6 for a bag of dusty cheezy Doritos. If only I had Mountain Dew to complete this ensemble. But to my astonishment, the bag gets stuck on the spiral mechanism. How could this be? I did not account for this error. Will my hunger go unsatisfied? I try to shake the machine but to no avail. So, as a bonafide Comp Sci major, I muster all my strength to problem solve. Yes, I can feel it. All three of my brain cells are working strenuously, I'm at 100 percent brain capacity just like Bradley Cooper in the movie, *Limitless*. Eureka!!! I'll just pay for the same item again. This way I can dislodge the first bag while getting a second bag of chips in the process. More chips equal less hungry. I swipe my card again and enter A6. I see the spiral mechanism turning and my anticipation grows. The first bag gets dislodged and falls to its inevitable consumption. My eyes glow with excitement, my mouth watering at the thought of tasting them perfectly nacho blasted tortilla chips. Sadly, it gets stuck on top of the tray, with the second bag ending up in the same predicament as the first, stuck on the spiral mechanism. My mind is unable to process these series of unfortunate events and I end up dying from starvation.",1575490365,1,0

I saw that 156L (Network Programming) with Mehrdad is being offered for Winter and it looked really interesting as a capstone class.  I took 150/L last year with Christine Parsa and got an A fairly easily.  I expect this class to be more difficult.

Exchange to UCSC (from the Netherlands),"So I‚Äôm a Dutch student planning on going on exchange to Cali during next year‚Äôs Fall semester. We‚Äôre supposed to list a top-3 of UC campuses we wanna go to, and I UCSC my first pick as for now. 

I do have some questions about UCSC though, because, as a Dutchie, the way the American school system works is very confusing to me.

First of all, are we obliged to take the health insurance UCSC offers us? Or can we look for another one that might be less expensive? 

Secondly, how many courses do you guys usually take in one quarter? At my uni, it is the norm to take two courses in one quarter, but our quarters are shorter than yours.

Lastly, how much do you pay for a form at the UCSC campus? We‚Äôre advised to apply for a dorm at the international house or smt, but I‚Äôve heard that it‚Äôs pretty expensive to live there.

I hope some of you can help me out!

im a third-year and youd think after two years in the Physics program Id have more of a definitive opinion on Physics, but I dont. My soul is also screaming at me to switch majors to Music, which I spend practically all my spare time studying; but anytime I think Ive made the definitive choice to switch majors, Physics whispers at me to come back to it and just finish the damn degree.
Many of my family members who have completed their Bachelors degree tell me it doesnt even matter what your degree is in nowadays so much as simply having one...

Digital notetaking,"Hey, do any of you write notes by hand on a tablet? I've been looking and so far I haven't had much luck. I've always written notes in a binder, but since the lecture hall seats and desks are way too small it's been pretty difficult and I don't want to waste paper/space with spiral-bound notebooks. I'd type my class notes, but my typing is super loud and I don't feel like I retain the information the same that way. Does anyone have any experience with digital handwritten notes?

I've got an old huion drawing tablet that I love, but it needs to be plugged into my computer and doesn't have a display so it'd be pretty difficult to use especially with the tiny desks. Anyone have a system they really like and would recommend? Preferably something less than $300 and with a stylus-only function?

Confused and worried. Could use some reassurance and advice.,"Hey all. Undergrad freshman here. I had recently noticed a comment on Canvas from my TA saying that he couldn‚Äôt find a file I turned in for one of my assignments. Said comment was a week old by the time I saw it. I didn‚Äôt think to check because I thought I turned everything in and therefore shouldn‚Äôt have anything to worry about.

It might be important to note that this assignment consists of multiple components to be turned in, specifically a YouTube video and a document containing my reflection of the process of creating the video. I turned them in separately. The video seemed to have overrode the document, but checking the comment section on the Canvas app on my phone suggests otherwise.

I have also tried to contact my TA via email regarding this matter after posting a comment of my own on that assignment with the supposedly missing file attached to it. I have yet to hear back from him.

I find this worrisome on multiple levels. Was I too late in attempting to take corrective action? Would my TA believe me when I say I turned it in when I was supposed to? What else can I do about this?

The result of this so far is me fretting over whether or not I‚Äôm going to pass this class instead of enjoying my break as this assignment counts for 25% of the grade for this class. 

Also, to avoid hiccups of similar nature in the future, I would like to ask those of you who have more experience with Canvas about how you turn in multiple submissions of multiple formats for one assignment. Thank you in advance.

TL;DR: did not know how to turn in multiple submissions of different formats for one assignment. TA couldn‚Äôt find word document that I thought I turned in. Attached said document with a comment on the assignment, no response from TA so far. Losing my mind due to possibility of failing the class.
