Experienced Problems at OSD?,"Story: I submitted all the documents needed for determining eligibility in June for taking summer classes. I'm a student diagnosed (at a young age) with ADHD and I have received accommodations at my previous schools. I submitted documents and met with XXXX (I do not know if I'm allowed to state the name of the specialist) at the initial intake appointment and was stated I can get accommodations on a provisional basis. After that, I tried contacting her several times (since mid-august) even dropped in at the OSD office several days but no response. The front desk and call answering people kept telling me I cannot meet until after Sept 2nd week. I explained to them several times the summer class is over by that time and why would I need to meet then. 

My final attempt of trying to contact: I dropped into the office still not allowed to meet so I called after one-hour, same response then called again after 3-4 hours (a different person answered) started giving me the same typical story you have to make an appointment bla bla... and I responded back saying you guys keep saying you don't have appointments then how can i meet..... I finally said a bit angrily I need you to transfer me to this person and the person on the line responded back saying she is busy and I told the girl on the phone tell her that I'm calling regarding a summer class and that I need a response. 

She took my name and then finally transferred and here she responds to me I will submit docs to the committee but I cannot guarantee you will get any accommodations (My first thought: was she thinking I gave docs for her to hold on to them or something and what the hell was she doing without submitting docs to committee all this time). She responds to me that my documents are years old (All medical docs submitted were within the last 10 months). I had patience and asked her can you proceed with the current school accommodations letter and the submitted docs and then within 2days I was approved minimum accommodations and she itself told to me meet a different specialist (IDK why).

Long story short: I completely felt like she completely ignored (neglected needs) me on purpose but IDK if that's how the OSD office at UCSD works since this was my first time interacting with the office. I honestly feel bad for those students that cannot get services even with documented disabilities since they have to go through specialists like her.  

OSD office at UCSD should have a better screening process when hiring specialists like her and higher-ups need to stop acting like you don't know/ see these. 

Feel free to provide feedback and if anyone has experienced similar situations at the OSD office share them. Let's fightback to end this!",1568341944,1,0

Be careful of Landlord Practices!!! Beware of this landlord!,"I am an UCSD alumni. After I graduated, my landlord (Joseph Gertz) sent me a long list of items that I destroyed!

Through careful preparation from numerous people such as SLS (student legal services), I won my case. It's not the end because he can still appeal and not pay the judgment!

1. Take photos and videos in the beginning!

2. If there is reading material, read it before the lesson of that material
3. If professors lecture in a certain outline, take notes in the same way
4. After each class, clean up notes + identify things that were not understood
   1. – take these things to office hours / discussions
   2. – combine lecture notes with reading notes
5. Review notes before a discussion class
6. Keep all loose paper from a class in class folder
7. Turn off phone while studying or keep it away
8. Before a party, Netflix, or any distraction be completely done with school work for the day
9. Sleep at least 6h a night and maintain sleep schedule consistent

Immunizations Issue.,"Hey everyone, looking for some help with an issue that just came up. After the first round of Immunization history back in July, I got some messages saying I had some issues with a few. No problem I thought, I'll just go in and get the doses I need. However, my doctor said that two were likely in error because of my time abroad as a child: My Varicella and MMR vaccines. They gave me the one dose they thought I needed and a letter saying that they could vouch for my immunity. The school did not accept the letter, and recommended that I go back and get a blood titer for MMR and Varicella. So I set up another appointment a week later, go in, get my blood drawn, and await results. I got what I was expecting for MMR, immune, but for Varicella, I was notified that I was not, in fact, immune like I was told. Once again I thought that I would just make another appointment and squeeze it in just before the due date. Except that you need two doses 20 days apart. Which means my second dose will be passed the deadline. So I guess my question is will they be ok if I upload proof I am undergoing inoculation? Or will I be penalized in some way?

New tool to help UCSD students choose their classes!,"[TLDR](https://bettercape.com)

Hello! I know many of us are scrambling to pick out classes last minute to round out their course-load for the beginning of Fall quarter. To help with this process, I have built a tool to help us make more informed decisions about the courses and professors we choose, by taking advantage of the thousands of student-submitted CAPEs. This tool was developed to better organize the data provided on [cape.ucsd.edu](https://cape.ucsd.edu). The following is a few features to justify the project's name, [BetterCape.com](https://BetterCape.com):

&amp;#x200B;

* Aggregate data -- Combines all similar courses a professor has taught to give a more complete overview of their class.

[For example, our good friend Gary has taught CSE 15L twenty seven times and over those twenty seven courses students have received an average grade of 3.26. Enrolling in a Gary course might be worth it with those stats :O](https://i.redd.it/2f4jzznd0lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Expand the aggregate data to get a breakdown of all courses.

[Clicking on a row in the table will bring up a modal showing all the courses that make up the aggregate data. Here, by clicking on the Gary row, we can see all of the twenty seven CSE15L courses he has taught, and the stats for each.](https://i.redd.it/pust17zs0lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Course grouping -- Whereas the order in which UCSD displays the CAPE data is sorted by quarter and lexicographically (causing CSE 100 to come before CSE 11, for example), BetterCape groups courses together by their numeric course code ordering and orders by term within that. This makes searching through a whole department much more intuitive.

[Very readable, incredible.](https://i.redd.it/xarqc9c51lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Filters! A feature completely missing from traditional capes.

[Here we are searching for upper division courses in the CSE department, taught during the years 2017 up to and including 2019, with an average received GPA of at least 3.5.](https://i.redd.it/qt2tv7ii1lo31.png)

So yeah, if this looks like it would be useful to you, I would love to have you guys check it out. At the very least, I think it is a much cleaner version of UCSD's capes. I would love some feedback from you guys! If this is something I see people are actually using I would definitely like to expand it to do some more interesting analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if this is something you think would be interested in working in, especially for people who are more talented than I with UX / web design definitely lemme know! (Mobile in particular is garbage at the moment)

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck with your Fall quarter everyone, hope this helps!",1569348770,198,0

Transferring to Bioengineering,"I'm currently a second year Nanoengineering major and I was interested in applying to switch into Bioeng: Biotech. My current transfer GPA for Btech is about a 3.88, but I'm worried that it's probably not good enough. I heard from a friend who's in Bioeng that all Bioeng students get a free switch from one of the Bioeng majors into another so I was wondering if I should apply to a different branch that's less competitive and then switch into Btech. I could also switch into Biosystems, but my transfer GPA would be around a 3.76 since there aren't as many classes that they look at.

What would be the best option?",1569233289,1,0

Minoring in CS as a Cog Sci: Neuroscience Major.,"Hey guys, so I am in my **junior year** and I really need some advice on whether or not I should pursue CSE minor.

Background:

**Cog sci, neuroscience majo**r, and I was pre-med until this year where I realize I want to do research more (so grad school, Ph.D. kinda direction).

So as for now, I should be able to graduate a year or at least 2 quarters early.

Motivation:

So since I decided on the change of my career direction it gave me a lot more free time to take classes that I am more interested in.

The reason why I want to have a cs minor is because I want to have a better understanding and grasp on programming overall with the hope that it will further my career and maybe merge my passion in neuroscience with AI/deep learning and stuff?? Because, I am not planning on staying in academia after grad school and I think programming is just a very useful skill to have.

Worries:

One of my biggest concerns is the tuition.

\- Since I am an international student, I have to pay roughly 16K quarterly. So it is quite a financial burden for my family and I. Because if I decide to just graduate early, I would apply for a lab technician job and start earning some income and then apply for grad school.

Another concern is:

\- are these classes actually useful? Or are they helpful for direct application? Because I know computer science does not equal software development and from the minor website, I saw we also need to learn about discrete math, some Computer engineering-related classes?? So is it really worth the effort and money? I mean I could always just take a boot camp class online to learn what I really need to know for my field. (e.g. Deep learning?)

Current situation:

I have taken cogs 18, cogs 108, and I am taking cogs 109 and CSE 8A rn.

So I would say I feel more comfortable (still have a lot to learn) with python and I had no experience with Java or C.

So what is your guys’ perspective on this?",1571440994,1,0
"@ People who do the readings, when do you them?","im curious about how people who are good at doing the essays on time and are good about coming to class having done all the readings do it. when exactly do you schedule it in? before the quarter started i told myself i would do it in the morning but i ended up sleeping in and having to get in a rush to get to class. dont really have time at night to do it though cuz i have to sleep to wake up early for class.. and so the cycle continues.. 

it also doesnt help that it takes me like over 6 hours to do one reading most of the time. even if i say i have a goal of reading them i feel i am just incapable of doing it.. :(

how do you manage to incorporate it into your life?",1571437791,7,0

If anyone is interested, please hit me up! They'll cancel the surgery (again, non-critical so it's not too important to me) if I don't have some one to take me home.",1575669704,1,0

Due to being evicted this quarter, in and out of the hospital, family health emergencies, I have failed every class. 

I can't withdrawal because if i'm not full time i will lose financial aid. 

I low-key do not have the mental health to face any more school. I'm considering dropping out altogether. I've been  in school a LOT longer than most people and it's getting embarrassing. I just feel like a huge failure. 

I'm out of options. I can feel my friends judging me. 

I work full time, take care of  disabled father and just can't juggle it all anymore. 

I desperately need to call the CAPS emergency line... but I can't financially afford the consequences of what would happen if we talked and they realized the bad place I'm in, and have been in for weeks.",1575654793,1,0

For future Tritons: Don't take 104A w/ Smith,"The class is an absolute soup sandwich in terms of what's expected of you. Grading couldn't be messier. Even if you're passionate about and enjoy reading law, avoid it as it will just demoralize you. It has the hardest curve of any course i've ever heard of because going by raw scores the average *and median* fails every exam. You won't fail (because of the curve it's almost impossible to) but your GPA will take a hit that just isn't worth it.

Of course, it's not impossible to do well in the course if you want to overachieve, go to office hours every week and develop a relationship with the profs/TAs to understand. In a class of 200 that simply isn't practical for everyone especially not for students who don't live on campus. It also shouldn't be compulsory to go to office hours to do well in a course.

What can/should I do?,"This is my first real quarter at UCSD, I was here over the summer and took two courses and passed both. However, before the fall quarter began I went through something devastating and got major depression and I barely got diagnosed about two weeks ago. I wasn't able to focus as much as I wanted to, so I ended up failing two classes, and dropping one and getting a W on my transcript because the class I dropped was a lab. The only class I passed was my writing class.

My major is neurobio and I failed chem 6a and math 10a (the final screwed me up). Im worried about multiple things, my GPA, having to repeat pretty much an entire quarter, having two F's and a W on my transcript, not being able to receive financial aid because I failed two classes and now my GPA is hella low, being put on academic probation.

The chem 6a classes all have a waitlist, and so do the 10a classes and the 10a classes conflict with my BILD 1 class (which I need for my major and college requirements, and atleast this way I'll be able to get back on track with my BILD courses), so I can't drop BILD 1 to put myself on the 10A of 6A waitlist.

For now I have, CAT 2, CGS 105, FILM 87 as my enrolled courses and COGS 3 (for my college requirements) waitlisted. 

 I can't change my major because it's something that I not only want to pursue, but need to pursue. Neurobio is a path I have to stick to.

Where does all the school's money go?,"Ok so it has been brought to my attention in the other thread that international students pay $70k.

Seventy Thousand American Dollars. This year broke the record for the most enrolled students at UCSD, and I think something along the lines of the most international students (don't quote me on this) or at least a very high percentage.

So why do we still lack basic shit like Wi-fi and parking?

When people complain about parking, there are always those who mention ""what's the big deal"", ""the walk isn't that bad"". And yeah, I agree that with walking for 30 mins and leaving early isn't too bad. It gives me a chance to exercise and listen to a podcast..if it were FREE. Paying $30,000 to be forced to park elsewhere, or pay even more to barely find spots is worth complaining about. I get some of you guys are looking this as a half glass full kinda situation, but I don't think some of you realize how much $30,000 is. If everyone becomes content with this, we'll soon pay $45,000 to walk and listen to a podcast.

Anyway, where are all our funds going? Is there no possible way to see how much of our budget is going towards A and B, etc?

This might be a dumb question but I really am curious: why can't we vote on things like this? I feel what we can vote on are pretty irrelevant for the most part. 

It's not like we're asking for valet parking for each student either. Just a paved lot with some paint on it. And whatever it takes to make wifi better? What are you supposed to do to fix the wifi problem? How much would it cost?

Free Photos at MCC on 11/27,"Hello Tritons!

TL;DR? Free photos for you, in exchange for posing for a photo on Wednesday, November 27th, from 10:00 AM until 2:30 PM. Held at Studio 140 inside the Media Center and Communication Building. First come, first served.

Friendly neighborhood /u/CruzedDude here with a fantastic offer. A free photo for you to do whatever you want. Yup. That's right: free.

Desperately need to update that aging tinder profile? Maybe the insta feed needs a different angle? Or just nothing better to do on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving break?

The catch is I'd like you to pose for a photo. The pose in question is incredibly simple in nature: give the camera the bird, while saying, ""~~Fuck you~~!"" or your favorite swear word.

You may be saying to yourself, ""This is quite the odd request. I wonder why in the world would this otherwise normal person, resort to taking photos containing such unpleasant language, and vulgar gestures?"" The answer to that is simple: a recent critique became just a little too heated. After talking to a grad student that I have better rapport with, we agreed that [this is how](https://youtu.be/kjS6bQ5OQ-o?t=40) most critiques in VisArts typically are conducted. We chuckled, but the conversation birthed this fun project.

So if you feel like you like to be apart of gallery, which I have no intention of reproducing beyond my own personal portfolio (treat this post as a form of promissory estoppel), stop by Studio 140 at the [Media Center and Communication Building](https://goo.gl/maps/E6ozwVyvBzVBfvqy7), on Wednesday, November 27th, from 10:00 AM to 2:30 PM. The format will be first come, first serve. 1 pose will equal a photo of your choice (more if there isn't much of a line). You'll get a RAW file via email. 

I want this to be clear: I will not be editing your photos for you. Every digital media lab computer already lets you do that for free with Photoshop, and I do have other classwork that demands my time.

There will be colored gels on hand to select from to give you photos a bit of unique identity. And the only dress code will be that you're wearing clothes, I may be an artist, but I'm not an *artist*.

Hopkins 1st floor flooded. Swimming cars. Bf’s car is half submerged and most likely wrecked.,We can’t get into the car because the water level is above the doorframe. AAA won’t send a tow truck because they don’t want their truck to become submerged. So the car will be sitting in water overnight/until the water is gone. Who should we contact at UCSD to get reimbursed for car repair costs if his insurance doesn’t cover it? This should not be on us financially as it was UCSD’s incompetence that flooded all those cars.,1574327592,1,0

Prejudice against Chinese international students at UCSD,"Hi, everyone! I'm writing this because I feel concerned about what I see as an unfair prejudice some of us American students harbor. Specifically, I think there are uninformed and unkind stereotypes about Chinese international students that as UCSD students, that we should challenge. One of the common stereotypes I see is that Chinese international students only associate with other international students, and don't adjust to U.S. culture. My response to that is, of course that's how some of them act! They are far away from home in an unfamiliar and difficult school, which (as is often mentioned in this subreddit) is not always the most welcoming place. If as English-primary-language people born and raised in the U.S., we were dropped feet-first into the University of Shanghai, we would probably act in a really similar way. I think Chinese international students deserve empathy and understanding for acting differently from the average U.S. student. After all, people are different from each other, and all have their own challenges. That doesn't mean they stop being people.

I think many of us would feel differently about the stereotypes we hear and repeat if we were to actually have a good conversation with our Chinese peers. I confess that I believed some of these stereotypes in the past. But after connecting as people and having conversations about grocery shopping, or the dorms, or shared experiences with classes, my opinion changed because I saw that Chinese international students are just students like us, but from a different place and set of challenges. If we find ourselves buying into this prejudice — and that's what it is, prejudice, because we are pre-judging people we often have not met or known personally — then maybe our first response should be to ask ourselves some questions. We can ask ourselves, have we really tried to understand? Do we even try to speak to Chinese international students? Or are we simply being afraid of something unfamiliar? I know that I didn't ask myself these questions for a long time, and believed mean and often inaccurate stereotypes because of it. As students and as growing, learning humans, we owe it to both ourselves and our peers to interrogate these stereotypes.",1574319612,1,0

A semi-solution to the parking issue that will probably never be taken into consideration - it would help so many students imo,"How about eliminating attendance points for lectures? Podcasting can still be up to the professors, yet certain discussions like Warren Writing where your participation is majority of your grade, can still remain mandatory. Say, if x% of the overall grade is based on participation alone, attendance can be chosen to be mandatory by the instructor.

There are plenty of classes that are podcasted, yet I-clicker points count for every lecture. That would also save you $70. Shouldn't knowledge of the material be far more valued than showing up and listening to the lecture live? I can't even stand my favorite sporting events live sometimes. Plus, many of them choose to sleep through lectures anyway. Why should reliability issues regarding transportation, rather lack of, be a factor in determining your grades? If the professor chooses to share important information before the podcast to reward those who make it to lecture or punish those who don't, such as relevant material on the final exam, then be it. The students' loss. (Of course location and other material should be posted somewhere in case of a student happening to miss class when crucial info like that is announced).

The whole ""legality of funds"" for parking argument doesn't matter imo, because it was the school's choice to get rid of S spots and designate more A and B spots. I'm sure the school can choose to open up more S spots without running into legal trouble.

Greek life toxicity,"I hate the culture that greek life creates at our school, even with it not being a huge part of our campus.

I am not denying that these things wouldn't happen at college anyways, but not from traditions from a national organization.  The ironic part is, anyone I have talked to joined to ""socialize and meet fun people"" but won't give the time of day to anyone without greek letters in their instagram bio, and fraternities hold parties only for the ""affiliated"", does not sound very ""fun"" to me.

How long until NR turns into an F? Anyone experience this?,"The professor has told me that my grade will be late. Probably because I had to make up work.

I don't wanna bug the professor just  yet, because he clearly told me that it will be late, and I told him that it's fine and to take his time.

I'm now concerned because I found out that after some time, the NR turns into a failing grade. Doesn't specify how long until it does tho. 

For those who aren't aware of what NR is:

&gt;""NR"" = An ""NR"" means ""no report."" An ""NR"" can only be assigned by the instructor. An ""NR"" is not calculated into the student's GPA, except for certain careers where it is converted to an ""ED"". An ""NR"" is subject to lapsing to a failing grade (""ED"") for certain careers.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; ""ED"" = An ""ED"" means ""unofficial drop."" An ""ED"" is calculated into the student's GPA as a failing grade. 

I will email the professor soon, don't wanna bug him when he's celebrating the holidays, especially because he clearly told me that he will report it late. I'm just concerned it's going to turn into an F.

Anyone else experience something like this? How long does it take for an NR turn into a failing grade?

When I look at the course descriptions of the sociology courses, they seem much more interesting to me... however, I want to get involved in research when I’m older and I wasn’t sure what the differences would be between the two kinds of research. I’m really interested in the effects of social media as well as the effects of language and culture on an individual... do you think sociology would be better suited for me?",1577224332,1,0
Odds of getting accepted into a Masters Program at UCSD in CSE?,"Hey everyone, I'm currently in the final stretches and plan to graduate in the Fall semester at my college. I was wondering what my odds of getting accepted into the Masters program are. I struggled a bit freshman year which kind of murdered my GPA which is why I'm worried.

Currently I will be graduating from URI. University of Rhode Island. Lived in Rhode Island my whole life. I will graduate with a double major, a BS in computer science, and a BA in mathematics. My GPA in computer science is currently a 3.3 and will most likely finish with a 3.3-3.4. and my Math GPA is a 3.75 and will most likely finish around a 3.7 or 3.8.

I don't know if these grades are good enough to get me in, my grades as of sophomore and junior year have been significantly better than freshman with my most recent semester being 4 A's and 1 A-. I'm just worried I screwed myself.",1577214370,1,0

Tinder Users!!,"Hey guys! I'm with the Sociology Honors Program here at UCSD writing an undergrad thesis and I am looking for a population of college students who use (or have used) the app Tinder and would be more than grateful if any of you guys can take a few minutes to fill out my survey.

Academic Integrity Violation??? There’s no way,"Hi guys looking for some advice, or wondering if anyone has gone through a similar experience. 

So I got a blank grade for CSE 12 with Gary, and I figured it was a mistake. Then I get an email from him stating “one or more of my PAs matched with those of past or current students’ PAs”. Funny thing is, I don’t know a single person  in the class, nor have I ever worked with anyone on a PA. I also don’t have any friends who took Gary that I talked to or asked for help. These PA’s are 100% done by me and done alone. 

I saw on the policies that I can request for documentation which led to the flagging, and I can’t wait to see it. But I still haven’t received an email from the AI office, and I assume I won’t until Jan 2. This is ruining my break, and I’m absolutely fuming. 

I didn’t do well in the class either. My PA average was like 75% and my final grade was a ~70%. 

Has anyone dealt with AI when they were certain they didn’t violate standards?",1577149547,1,0
