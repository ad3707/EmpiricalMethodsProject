Any CAS CS majors frustrated with Wasserman's job-hunting resources?,"Given the school's reputation, the (high) quality of our classes, our location to the industry, and how much this shit costs... I'm really surprised and disappointed at how little Wasserman Manhattan does for CS students. Some points I noticed while focusing on getting myself hired in a new-grad position:

* On Campus Recruitment (OCR) has a negligible selection of tech firms. I signed on right at the start of recruitment season and the only big-name tech company I saw was Microsoft. MasterCard is also there but that's about it. The rest of the listings are all consulting firms or law offices. So now we need to deal with exploding offers, vague interviewing timelines, and all the other BS that goes on with recruiting when your school doesn't stand in your corner. 

* The career fair was just as bad. I could count the big name tech companies on one hand, and some of those felt like an afterthought. The Tandon career fair I've heard is much better, which is understandable. If they're not going to let us into that one, which is again understandable, at least don't schedule it for the *same exact date* so tech recruiters have a chance to visit both. 

* Handshake does nothing that public job boards don't already do. Its only purpose is to give desperate teaching nonprofits a platform to beg undergraduate students to consider them.

* The events are also lacklustre. Pretty much the same firms as OCR and the career fair, and not much is focused on tech. 

* I haven't met anybody at Wasserman Manhattan who actually knows something about the tech recruiting scene. Sure, it's nice to get my resume reviewed, but when they don't know what anything on there means it only goes so far. 

How do you all deal with this? I have very few friends graduated and working in tech that I can ask for advice/referrals from. I have no recruiters I'm communicating with because the career fair was a wash. I just feel blind and hopeless because the ""amazing job center"" we have here is utterly failing me during the critical recruitment season.",1569281694,31,0

Study Spots,"I'm generally just looking for advice on some good study spots around campus. Either specific places in Bobst that people find quieter, less busy, etc, or places outside of Bobst that people like. I'd probably generally avoid coffee shops (I have a severe nut allergy and the rise in nut milks is killing me) and LaGuardia Co-op (I use a wheelchair and it's not accessible) so if people have suggestions that aren't those that would be great!

I also had a couple more specific questions about places I'd seen mentioned in previous posts on this topic. I saw Stern Grad 3rd and 4th floor mentioned a couple of times, but when I went to the security desk at the Kaufman Management Center, they told me that you could only access those if you were in the Stern Grad program. Is this true? Am I looking in the wrong place (i.e. should I actually go to the 3rd and 4th floors in Tisch Hall)? I also saw an article somewhere that said to go to the ""top floor of Tisch Hall, the Stern MBA building.""

TW: Substance use &amp; mentaller illness – Anybody have experience or insight w/ NYU Wellfleet health insurance for inpatient or residential level treatment for substance use rehab treatment or mental health–psychiatric residential care?,"I was hoping to get some substance use inpatient rehab level treatment and/or mental illness–psychiatric residential level care while taking an leave of absence from NYU, but I've been making a lot of phone calls and the person I spoke with who had the most actual experience working with Wellfleet (the company that underwrites the health insurance offered through NYU), a case manager who also had a background in mental health counseling, said that Wellfleet typically only covers 1-2 weeks of inpatient/residential level treatment or care (be it for substance use or mental health–psychiatric illness issues) even for the in-network facilities (in-network status aligns with the Cigna PPO Network, but Cigna does not actually pay for the benefits, but rather Wellfleet which I believe is often referred to as 3rd party insurance company).

"This Friday, 9/20, Midnight Confessions, and Sat, 9/21, Live at the Inn, BYOB, Variety shows","***Both shows*** are in the heart of Greenwich Village at New York’s oldest still-operating record store: **The Music Inn**. The store has been open since 1958 and has been used as a location in such shows as **“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Friday 9/20, Midnight Confessions** is a show where we ask the audience to anonymously write down a confession, true or false, and place it into a hat. The performers then take the confessions and act them out. Between confessions, we have sketches, some of the best up-and-coming musicians, and stand up comedians perform. 

I believe this is a great way for students to let off steam. I also believe this show provides a nice catharsis for students to anonymously share a secret, or their feelings about being new to the City, or the anxiety/stress they feel as a student and to have it externalized and acted out comically.

MS Computer Engineering with undergrad in CS.,"I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and I want to pursue my Master's in either ECE or CS (Tandon) with specialization in ML (Spring 2020). 

I am not interested in MS DS or MS CS (Courant) since I know I won't get in. So it is between Tandon's MS ECE and MS CS, I am leaning towards ECE as I believe it is relatively easier to get in. 

However, my coursework, projects as well as work experience are heavily ML oriented. 

So my question is how do I justify applying to ECE when:   
1. My field of interest is ML.  
2. My background is almost completely composed of programming and CS theory? I have taken a few hardware courses such as Computer Architecture, Wireless Technology and Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems as well as a couple projects but that's that. 

Won't the admissions committee think ""Why is he applying for Computer Engineering when his interest is in ML""? 

I have already checked out the program requirements as well as research and it seems like there are plenty of ECE courses (ECE-GY prefix) related to ML that an ECE student can take. Not to mention that the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering has a dedicated research area for Machine Learning while CS doesn't.  


Please note that apart from the 2 core courses, I have absolutely no intention whatsoever of taking hardware courses.",1568801401,3,0

"[REPOST] Online Study on Middle Eastern Women and Psychological Health ($20 Amazon gift card raffle!!! Must be 18+, identify as a Middle Eastern Female)"," 

MIDDLE EASTERN WOMEN 18 YEARS AND OLDER NEEDED FOR ONLINE STUDY

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Long Island University-Brooklyn and I am asking you to be a participant in my research.  This study is designed to help identify protective and risk factors that impact the psychological health of Middle Eastern/Arab American women. 

You will fill out a series of brief questionnaires.  This study will require about 45 minutes of your time.  Because the study focuses on Middle Eastern women, you are eligible to participate if you are a woman who is 18 years or older living in the United States and identify as Middle Eastern (including Arab or Arab-American from the following countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen).

If you participate, you can be entered into a raffle **to win one of twenty Amazon $20 gift cards**.  Additionally, you may find the study interesting!

You will also provide information that may help clinical psychologists learn about factors that impact the psychological health of Middle Eastern women.   Research data in this area would also provide information that would facilitate the administration of culturally informed psychotherapy in this population. 

To participate, go to:

[https://survey.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_d6I6kpboGmfRjCZ](https://survey.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_d6I6kpboGmfRjCZ)

If you have friends who might be interested in participating, please tell them!

If you have questions about this research, please contact Amira Hanna at [MEWPH2019@gmail.com](mailto:MEWPH2019@gmail.com).

"Is Steinhardt, specifically music there, worth all the money?","Im applying to NYU as a first year student this fall. A while ago i already asked this sub about whether students at NYU are happy, but I’m wondering specifically about Steinhardt and even more specifically music/music technology at Steinhardt. I’ve heard if you’re not going to stern or tisch it’s not worth all the money and stress and some people in mtech at Steinhardt seem unhappy there. I have other choices I really like but I would have to give up going to school in NYC, which I want to do for numerous reasons (I’m from Long Island and love the city, don’t wanna go too far from home, and i would much rather work there than the places where my other schools are located)

TLDR is going to Steinhardt to study music for undergrad worth all the money and stress?",1569598284,3,0

Research Assistants at Economics Department,"Hi everyone,

I am currently in my junior year and am majoring in economics. My plan is to follow through with a PhD in said subject.

From what I have heard, one needs good research experience to make a good PhD application. I sort of have had no luck in this aspect. I have a good GPA, and from what I have seen, I can do the work most employers could ask for. The problem is in that I suspect that I haven’t networked much. 

Until now, my idea was that I would look for professors announcing vacancy through some medium in the department. However, I have found literally no such vacancy notices in the economics department. In fact, all other but professors from economics department post on NYU Job Search portal. 

Of course, there can be some very straightforward explanation to this, but I refuse to believe that NYU’s economics department doesn’t open its doors to undergrads for relevant research experience. 

If anyone has any relevant information that may help me out in landing a part time research assistant spot, I would be highly grateful. 

Thanks.",1569512107,10,0

Should I ED to NYU?,"Hi! I was wondering if y'all could help me decide if I should ED to NYU or my dream school--CMU. Before I start, I know my stats aren't super outstanding, but I am getting anxiety of being locked down to NYU in the very extreme case that I do get into CMU. I don't know if my situation is special or not but it is definitely complicated. The circumstance I'm under is that I studied and lived in Vietnam for 14 years (bc I'm Vietnamese), then I moved to Singapore and studied there for 2 years under their public education system. I got an O-Level grade of 10 which isn't spectacular but its good considering where I went to Singapore. I kind of lack extracurriculars in Singapore because all the students are to prioritize their focus into the O-Level Exam. I moved over to the US mid-year Junior year, so my Quarter 1 grades are missing from my GPA. Moreover, my school wouldn't add my grades from Singapore so my GPA isn't the actual GPA until the colleges I'm applying to do the calculations. I am doing the best I can right now at a competitive school and trying to use my senior year to boost my GPA. I hope y'all can help. Thank you! 

Here are my stats:

GPA (unweighted): 3.67 (not my actual GPA since I moved from Singapore to the USA and the school didn't consider my grades from my school in Singapore. 

SAT: 1420 

O-Level Grade: 10 (O-Level is like A-Level but for Sophomore Kids, it's much like a high school diploma over here. It is a national exam that over 80000 kids in Singapore take in order to continue their higher education)

Extracurriculars: 

\- Student council (Freshman and Sophomore Year in Singapore) (Kinda like class council)

\- Person-In-Charge of Robotics Club (Freshman and Sophomore Year)

\- Member of Executive Committee of Student Council (Sophomore Year) (So I was in charge of an aspect of the student council and oversaw the members in that group)

\- Participated in SASMO (Singapore Asian School Mathematics Olympiad) 

\- Participated in Research Competition at a Local Polytechnic (Singapore)

\- Participated in National Robotics Programming Competition (Singapore)

\- Did a summer research program at NYU (researching in fluid dynamics) 

\- Currently working with a professor from NYU working on research for fluid dynamics.",1569462323,0,0

Leave of Absence Reversal,"Hi there. 

About a week ago, I was considering taking a leave of absence, and submitted a request on Albert. I did not turn in any of the paperwork that my school (Tisch) requires, and did not even offer a reason as to why I was requesting a leave. In that time, I decided that a leave wasn't truly what I wanted, and I quickly emailed my advisor asking how to proceed in reversing the leave. She responded saying she would correspond with someone else on the next move. This was last Thursday. 

My advisor nor the person she CC'd got back to me, I (regretfully) assumed that since I didn't turn in any actual paperwork the request would likely get denied or simply wouldn't process. Flash forward to today, and my request was approved. 

I'm kind of freaking the fuck out. I'm un-enrolled from all my classes and am not able to even view my past schedule. I emailed my advisor, as well as the Registrar office, and left a voicemail for someone at Tisch to respond to, but obviously it's past 5 and no one will respond until tomorrow. 

So my big question in all of this is - am I completely fucked? Has anyone been in a situation similar to this before? To complicate things further, I am currently in housing and the prospect of getting kicked out is giving me terrible anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

PLEASE HELP! 

&amp;#x200B;

NYU's MBA + MSc Biology Dual Degree,"Hi all,

I am interested in NYUs MBA/MSc Biology Dual Degree program. I have searched on LinkedIn for someone who is/was in the program, but to no avail. I am a mid-twenties biotech professional working out of SoCal, however I do not have much ""business"" experience. 

Here are some of my questions:

\- How did the MBA/MSc prepare you for a job in the biotech field? Where were you before the program and where are you after? (or currently)

\- Was there much overlap between the two programs? Did any of your classes cover the intersection of science and business? (such as bioentrepreneurship)

\- What are the advantages/disadvantages of the dual degree program vs. a singular program such as Keck Graduate School's Masters in Business and Science degree?

\- Did the MSc Biology intefere with the MBA events/extracurriculars? (Job fairs, networking events, etc.)

TONIGHT! Midnight Confessions - Variety Show in Greenwich Village!,"Hey NYU peeps,

Some friends of mine are running a BYOB variety show this Friday and Saturday and would love for you to come!

Both shows are in the heart of Greenwich Village at New York’s oldest still-operating record store: The Music Inn. The store has been open since 1958 and has been used as a location in such shows as “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”.

TONIGHT! Friday 10/18, Midnight Confessions is a show where we ask the audience to anonymously write down a confession, true or false, and place it into a hat. The performers then take the confessions and act them out. Between confessions, we have sketches, some of the best up-and-coming musicians, and stand up comedians perform.

This is a great way for students to let off steam. I also believe this show provides a nice catharsis for students to anonymously share a secret, or their feelings about being new to the city, or the anxiety/stress they feel as a student and to have it externalized and acted out comically.

Saturday 10/19, “Live at the Inn”: a variety showcase with comedy, music, and live sketches. Tomorrow's show will be a classic Who-Dun-It Murder Mystery! 

For each show:

Tickets are only $10 and it's BYOB.

Address: 169 West 4th St, New York, NY

Doors open at 8:30pm Show starts at 9pm. Get there early for a good seat.

Trains: 1 to Christopher St.

A, C, D, F, M to West 4th St. NJ Transit is just a few blocks away.

Tisch vs Steinhardt Musical Theatre,"Hello, I know there are a lot of College Confidential posts on this topic, but those are from years ago, so I wanted to make this as an ""up-to-date"" version. I'm also making this because I am trying to decide whether to apply to Tisch or Steinhardt for musical theatre. I will compare them below. Based on what I've read online, I'd say that: 

***Steinhardt...***

* is singing-based, offering more vocal training and less acting/dancing training than Tisch
* also trains musical theatre majors in classical singing, allowing them to be experienced enough to audition for Broadway or opera companies 
* accepts less people than Tisch, but their applicant pool is much smaller than Tisch's
* usually has better quality productions than Tisch
* more camaraderie between students
* has less alumni on Broadway, but has less alumni in general due to consistently being a smaller program

&amp;#x200B;

***Tisch....***

* is acting-based, offering more acting and slightly more dance training and less vocal training
* has more industry-professionals teaching
* accepts more people than Steinhardt, but has a much larger applicant pool
* has worse productions than Steinhardt, grad students get priority in casting
* students develop a more independent attitude, which can be helpful for transitioning to NYC life and pursuing an acting career after graduation
* has more alumni working on Broadway, but has more alumni in general due to consistently being a larger program

This is essentially all I've been able to find on the topic. If the information I have stated is no longer true or never was true, please forgive and correct me. I want accurate info, obviously.

Connecting an XBOX,"How the fuck are we supposed to connect an Xbox One to the wifi. 

I tried in August connecting mine wirelessly to the NYU network. It kept giving me a bunch of different error codes saying it couldn't connect even after I registered it online. I don't remember the exact codes but it said stuff about not being able to connect to the network and something about the DHCP server. I emailed IT and they told me Xboxes couldn't connect wirelessly because of something either with the device or with NYU wifi restrictions - I don't remember their exact wording. 

IT told me I needed an Ethernet cable, which I wasn't able to set up until today. I connected the Ethernet cable and when I go to Xbox network settings it says that I have a wired connection. But it won't let me use the network at all. If I try to login to my account it says ""you need Internet to do this."" When I go to ""test network connection"" it says that I need to authenticate my device or something to join this network (note that this is a different error code than the one I received when trying to connect wirelessly). When I click ""authenticate"" it takes me to the nyu-media device registration site. I go through the entire process of putting the information in and it will say it's registered, but still never connect. It just says at the bottom of the screen ""this page will close once you are connected."" However it never closes, no matter how long I wait. Restarting doesn't help even after I've registered the device and waited several minutes. I am able to connect my wifi to my phone's hotspot so I'm fairly confident the issue is not with my XBOX, and instead is something with the NYU network. Has anyone else had this issue and figured out how to fix it?",1571113163,5,0

[Meta] Community input on the banning of ‘chance me’ posts,"Hello r/nyu!

Recently I have received complaints about the frequency of ‘chance me’ posts and suggestions to ban them from this subreddit. I personally agree because

* An application is a wholistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the best
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's applications

For this reason I was seeking community input in regards to the following:

* Should 'chance me' posts be banned from the sub? Application questions, advice and help will still be **allowed**, but posts explicitly asking what someone's chances of getting into NYU are would not.
* If individual 'chance me' posts are banned, should I make a megathread? Should this megathread be stickied?",1571076358,56,0

NYU Tisch Creative portfolio for film,"Hello! I am a senior in high school applying as a film major and NYU is my top choice. I was hoping to get some feedback and tips on my portfolio! I have a 3.7 gpa weighted, 3.5 unweighted, and got a 30 on my act. I am still working on the short story, here is one of them if anyone has feedback:

The Search for Josephine
“Let’s keep looking,” the lieutenant urged. “This could be our biggest bust and you want to just give up?” Florence Valmonte was the only female detective in her department, and because of this she agreed to continue her search, even though she knew it meant risking everything. 
    Four years earlier, when Valmonte was exactly twenty-three years, seven months, and fourteen days old, she had the worst day of her life. It started out just like any other day, a cold shower to wake up, and a stroll to her internship at the local police station. Only on this day, she decided to stop at the coffee shop, lured by the scent of freshly baked chocolate croissants. She was not one to fall victim to the donut stereotype. As she walked through the door, she saw the most beautiful woman. Florence would describe her as captivating, worldy, uncomparable. As a reliable narrator, I will tell you she was average… a brunette, a couple inches taller than most with large grey eyes. Florence had never felt this way about another woman before, and she watched like a lion stalking its prey. The woman rose from her seat when the barista called out, “Josephine! I have your mocha.” Josephine. Florence locked eyes with her, and for a moment time was still. 
    Their first kiss was just hours later. Up until this moment, Florence had never felt nervous in her life. She was relentlessly brave. After her internship, they met in Washington Square Park. A pianist was playing a graceful tune underneath the arch, which lit their hearts simultaneously as they held hands. Josephine, having done this many times before, made the first move. She leaned in, only to be pushed away. 
“I’m sorry. This is just new to me.”
“It’s okay,” Josephine understood. “We can take it slow.”
Florence shook her head at the ground with disapproval, and turned back to Josephine, grabbing her by the face and kissing her in a sudden motion. It felt incredibly reckless to kiss someone she barely knew. Florence was also aware that some moments are worth any consequences they create. And this kiss would certainly create a whirlwind of troubles she could never escape. 
    That night, Florence woke up to the ringing of her work phone. Her boss at the station was requesting her after the news that the dealer they had been tracking, Brancos, was murdered. As an intern, Florence had filed a lot of the paperwork for the Brancos investigation and knew all the ins and outs of the case. As she stumbled into the office at 11:44pm, what she saw had her paralyzed in shock. Pinned to the board was the main suspect of the murder… Josephine. 
“Who is that?” The room turned to face Florence, surprised those were the first words she spoke.
“This is the girl we are after. Her name is Josephine Bauers, also known as Brancos’ wife,” The lieutenant revealed. “We think she killed him.”
Florence was shocked. Hurt. Speechless. None of this made any sense. 
“Why would she do that?” Another officer questioned, skeptical.
“Well, we found these. Two fake ID’s with their photos and the names Sara and Jonathon Cridell printed on them. Before we summoned you, Valmonte, we made a few phone calls to local banks, and surely enough, just fifteen minutes after his stabbing, this ‘Sara Cridell’ deposited ten grand from their savings in cash, and transferred another two million into a seperate account. We’re running the numbers now.”
    Florence felt her heart racing and was certain everyone else in the room could hear it. She excused herself, slammed the door behind her, and ran to grab the nearest trash bin, hurling out her shock and dismay. Even if the theory was false, she had been lied to. Maybe even used as an in to the investigation. How could she have trusted so easily. 
    Four years and three promotions later, Florence Valmonte agreed to return to the Brancos investigation with much hesitation. As she left the lieutenant’s office, she had a sinking feeling this was a terrible idea. But so much was on the line. 
    Her search began the next morning by the waterfront. The dense fog limited her vision to what was just in front of her. She knew if Josephine were in town it would be by boat, as it was the only way she could travel safely overseas. Everyone in the country was looking for this dangerous woman. Florence however, felt this woman was not a threat. In fact, in the four years it had been since they last met, her feelings had not faded. She tried to move on, meet other people, put the stint with the devil behind her. But it was as if Josephine never escaped her. She was always there; a lingering reminder of the sinner Florence truly was. She had lied. Told the lieutenant she had never seen her before, had no idea of her whereabouts. The truth would come out about their relationship, and it would ruin Florence’s life. But we aren’t there yet…
    We are here. 7:15am. Still waiting. As the time passed her hope dissipated. She had no other leads. Just instinct, an almost magnetic draw towards the docks. Naturally, Florence would see it as fate that just an hour and thirty-six minutes after her arrival, as the fog began to clear, she saw her.
    “Josephine!” She called out in desperation, rising from the bench. She sprinted in the direction of the figure, with no proof it was truly her. Just that feeling again. The same feeling from the past one-thousand, four-hundred and sixty-seven days before, every time she had thought of Josephine. As she approached the figure it turned to face her. Now, short black hair, skin pale from a life of hiding, but those same sparkling grey eyes. 
“I was on my way.” Josephine smiled softly.
Confused, Florence asked, “Where?” 
“To Washington Square arch.”
    With a sudden wave of compulsion, Florence dove into a kiss. She knew it was the very last thing she should be doing. But some moments are worth the consequences.
    As the weeks passed, Josephine explained everything. The marriage, the murder, the disappearance. Not all of her reasons were acceptable, in fact, most of us would say they were the opposite. But Florence understood every word. Her husband was abusive, trapped her in a marriage and threatened to take her down with him if she ever revealed his identity. She wanted freedom and saw only one way of achieving it.
      Florence made a promise she wasn’t sure she could keep. She would hide Josephine and find another lead to throw the case. She did exactly this—  bringing forth every associate, employee, and customer of Brancos— most of whom had already been questioned and cleared. To the best of her knowledge, the plan worked, and the search for Josephine was dropped. 
    Then came light. By summer, they were engaged to be married. They spent the month of June by the beach and fell into a deep love. Secrets were revealed. Florence began to take part in criminal activity led by Josephine, who had taken over her dead ex-lover’s business. As the days passed, Florence became numb to the sins of her lover. Distant from her surroundings. During her time with Josephine she had learned to let go and drift where the water carried her. It was true, sometimes the consequences are worth the moments they create. And sometimes they are not. For that night, out on the water, a gun went off. Distant sirens followed. Josephine Bauers was dead.

I've read the threads and I will not bore/annoy you with the common ""what it takes to transfer"" questions.

I am a CC student, busting my butt to meet requirements and to create an exceptional resume (for being a 24 year old that is now finally invested in an education) for a chance at transferring to NYU Stern. My situation is a bit unique because I have had quite the... life. When it comes down to life experience and the discussion of such in the application and admissions process, how may the school feel about a potential student that has been working in an ""alternative"" field?

If you take another course from Stern, please let me know if it's good for the field I'd like to go into, or enlighten me with other interesting courses.

Ed2 financial aid,"So I got a 1400 on my sat and was committed to go and do ed1 and pray that nyu is going to give me money, but after speaking to a bunch of people, I realized it wasn't worth it to risk so much debt during undergrad. So I was considering ed2 for NYU as it is still a top choice, I want to do Steinhardt for childhood education and I am a Bi asian female ( idk if this matters) my single mom makes around 70k but my sister and I will be in college next year so, she needs to lay for it. I am in state so I can save a few thousand dollars, but is ed2 still bad for financial aid?  Should I just apply regular and hope I get in? 

I was also considering BU as ED1 as they have better financial aid, but am not sure if I can get out of it, if i dont get enough. My stats also dont fit in as well as it does with NYU. 

Any advice?",1572308571,0,0

Campus Cash Printing Refund,"I'm a freshman and already ran through my $50 printing budget for the semester. As a result, I was just depositing campus cash into my account to use to print. 

Two days in a row now the printer has charged me for several documents, and then not printed them. I've lost a total of $33.20 in Campus Cash (which obviously comes from my actual money) as a result. I was looking into filing for a refund and couldn't find any forms that seemed to have anything that would help get a refund for this. The Campus Cash refund form only had three options, a vending machine refund, laundry refund, or campus cash deposit refund. Is there anywhere specific I should go for printing refunds?

I also noticed that the Campus Cash refund form says we can't get refunds until after graduation. I'm way too broke to not have that missing money, and I still need to print the things that didn't print, so I have to now deposit all that lost money again just to be able to pay to print and do laundry this week. Is there any way to rush the refund process so I'm not having to wait this long for a refund?",1572220701,5,0

What’s with the grading scale for theory economics class? Never knew it was that harsh!,"I’m taking Microeconomic analysis and we had our first midterm. The class average was higher 70 and lower 80, pretty high compared to the past year exams as I heard. But in most classes I’ve taken, if the class average is around 80 and I get a 90 I’m pretty much guaranteed a A- if not A. But you know what our scale is? To get A you need at least 98, which is pretty much asking for 100 because there is really no 2 points error to be made on the exam. And to get A- you need at least 92, even 91 means a B+! That’s crazy! In intro classes I remember there was at least 20 percent in class got an A but I doubt if there is even 10 percent A in this class. Does anyone know if the department is deliberately trying to significantly reduce the number of As in intermediate level theory Econ courses?

I have a bit of an unusual request related to my own research and Master's thesis. First of all, allow me to quickly introduce myself. I study at Leiden University in the Netherlands and am currently writing my Master's thesis in Public Administration. I research the crowding in - crowding out framework of welfare states regarding civil society behaviour. Essential to my research is the so-called World Giving Index, which is a framework by the British Charity CAF that tries to measure philanthropic efforts all over the world. They utilize data provided by Gallup, stemming from their World Poll. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the issue. We do not have access to the Gallup World Poll and I am pretty much stuck without their microdata - also I was not able to get access via my previous jobs. I know that NYU has campus-wide access to the database (at least that's what it says on Gallup's website). I am looking for someone who could spare an hour to go over the data with me, extract them and send them to me - it should be fairly quick. Please feel free to PM me or answer in this thread. I would really appreciate the help. Why NYU? Well to be honest I have very fond memories of NYC and have always found the people to be very helpful in their own wholesome way when I lived there.

"IYSSE meeting at the Global Center Tuesday night: ""Race, Class and the Fight for Socialism: Perspectives for the Coming Revolution in America""","This meeting is the socialist answer to the New York Times “1619 Project,” which has been accompanied by an unprecedented publicity blitz, including at schools and campuses throughout the country. The occasion they cite for the publication of this project is the 400th anniversary of the arrival of 20 African slaves at Port Comfort, Virginia.

The Times project raises the question: Is race the driving force of history, as the Times insists? Or, as Karl Marx analyzed, is it class? Is “anti-black racism … in the very DNA of this country” as the Times writes? Or is the history of the United States fundamentally the history of class struggle? As social inequality reaches record levels, is America heading toward race war or socialist revolution?

The promotion of the 1619 Project takes place under conditions of expanding class struggle internationally and a growing interest in socialism among workers and youth in the United States. Its aim is to block the development of a united movement of workers across all races by cultivating racial divisions.

This meeting will refute the historical falsifications advanced in the 1619 Project, explain their underlying political motivations and present the strategy for socialist revolution in America today.

I recently was absent for the 6th or 7th time because of one of the medical reasons, and my professor contacted me saying "" it is an institutional policy to withdraw me from the course"". I asked if there was anything I could do to make up for this and she said she would talk to my advisor and it would depend on her response. This class is a required core course. If i am withdrawn how would this effect my GPA, transcript, and future of classes ( this is a SF1 class, i have to take SF2 and 3 still)",1573696758,1,0

Must the security guards wake students up when we stay overnight . . .,"Was hoping to get a few hours of sleep at Stern before my final later this morning. Took forever to fall asleep in an uncomfortable and cold seating area, only to be woken up an hour later at 3am by a security guard demanding to see my ID. I hear this is the standard practice at Bobst as well. 

Is this really necessary. If we're staying overnight in a non-residential NYU building, we're probably sleep-deprived already preparing for exams and shit, and waking us up in the middle of the night isn't helping. And it's not like we don't use our IDs to get into the damn buildings in the first place.

"Transfer accepted to Gallatin, is it worth it?","I just got my FA package back this morning and as expected, not looking so hot. I have received about 5k in non loan money. Looking at my credit evaluation, I'm projected to graduate in the spring of 2022. I would be doing 5 semesters at NYU if I were to take a normal courseload and not fuck it up somehow.

I studied a double major in English and art history at my current university, and took a semester off on medical leave. If I went to Gallatin, I would want to study more in STEM fields and integrate that into my major, something that I have wanted to do for a while but couldn't because the rigor of the classes at my current university kind of make it impossible. I have very little debt since I went to a state school. I have worked freelance a bit and gotten a journalism internship, but I wanted Gallatin because I want to explore more of what's out there for me.

The cost is giving me some anxiety about whether or not this would be worth it. I'm already flexible about the idea of working off most of the smaller loans as I go and even being an RA or commuting from my home in LI if needed for a few semesters, but I want to know if any current NYU students think this is feasible. I also want to know if it's possible to graduate from Gallatin a semester early or if I need a reality check and I'm not even graduating in 2022. 

I know this decision is pretty personal and no one can tell me ""yes, go"" or ""no don't"" and decide for me, but I want to be prepared for what comes if I choose to attend.

Question about ED2/ Campus life,"Hi, 

I'm an OOS senior looking to potentially ED2 (wanted to do ED2 to present a stronger application) to NYU (Stern), but I was a bit concerned about on-campus life. I heard the campus is essentially just NYC. Personally, I really like big city living, but I was wondering if its hard to throw parties (very committed to the grind, but also parties), make friends, or just have any dedicated studying areas throughout NYC. Also, does anyone know how much merit extenuating circumstances are given because I have a GPA on a bit of the lower side (dropped from top 10 to top 25) , but there is a clear correlation between lack of grades and my circumstances? Also, is it possible to consult anyone about finaid before applying, because my family walks the middle-class line of comfortable enough to not receive FAFSA, but also putting 2 other siblings through college?

Waitlist dilemma,"Hi,
I was waitlisted (yes, waitlisted, not deterred) from LS this past week and have been pondering whether or not to accept the offer.
Just gonna list some various thoughts
- While LS definitely had a bit of what I wanted, I won’t lie by saying part of the reason I applied there was because it was on the easier side of nyu schools (Again, I still liked LS enough to where I would have been fine going there)
- my 2nd choice school (GW) has an EDII option, and in all honesty they offer exactly what I want in terms of major (political communication). I also think I have a better shot of getting in there than with NYU
- I genuinely don’t know if I could stomach waiting 5 months at the minimum to hear back. I have some problems with anxiety and the mere deadline to decision wait this past fall was a lot for me
- I also don’t think I’d have a great shot at getting in off the waitlist, especially considering NYU historically isn’t the kindest with that
Essentially, I’m leaning towards not accepting the waitlist offer. I know anything can happen. I know there’s no real reason not to. But I don’t know if I wanna commit to this place further than I have cause I’m just sort of out of it right now. Is there any strong reason I should or shouldn’t go for it?

However, ECs are heavily geared towards business: started an incorporation with 16,000 sales six fig annual revenue -- 450k followers on ig -- interns @ media company with a snapchat story with over 2 million daily viewers -- production manager at a museum, creates 1,000 products for retail and museum showcase, manages 10+ employees -- intern at a science museum -- leader &amp; founded 2 clubs @ my school -- sports team 

Not sure if I should shoot my shot and apply to stern, although I know the pool for ED2 stern is probably gonna be all ivy rejects with killer stats. Or should I apply to ECON or LSP, work my ass off, then transfer to stern???? I'm aware the transfer process is crazy competitive. Has anyone had any success transferring from econ/LSP to stern?

Prospective LSP Student Questions,"Just got accepted into LSP through ED 1 and I'm ecstatic because NYU is my dream school! I have a few questions concerning the Liberal Studies Core Program:

1.  What are the differences between The Liberal Studies Core Program and Global Liberal Studies Program? How do I know which one I'm in?
2. How flexible is LSP when choosing classes, and is the program especially good for students who still don't know what to major in?
3. I will be spending my first year away at a global site. Is it true that it's harder to find and make friends at the global sites because classes are a lot smaller?
4. Where will I be staying (housing) once I return to NYC during my second year?
5. Does LSP award class credits for AP test exam scores of 4 or higher? 
6. Will all the courses I'm taking for the first two years be very similar to those in other NYU schools (mostly General Education courses)? I've heard people say LSP courses are easier; are the classes not as academically rewarding/rigorous/insightful? 
7. If I know what major I want early on, will I be able to take courses that fulfill the graduation requirements for that major? Will failing to do so prevent me from graduating in 4 years?
8. What's the process of declaring a major at CAS, Steinhardt, Stern, and Tisch after I finish the program? I know there's an application for the latter two schools, and I'm wondering if LSP students get priority acceptance to these schools? I'm undecided about my major and I'm concerned that I won't be able study the major I want once I've made my mind.
9. There seems to be a notion that LSP students are students who barely got in, and are therefore less intelligent/qualified to attend NYU. This statement is disheartening, and I just want to know how prevalent this perspective is held by other students?

I have a 32 ACT, but I have an pretty low GPA (3.4W, 3.2UW) as a result of taking on too many difficult classes and not being able to properly manage my time, had an upward trend though as I got used to it.

I did some research on the program, and it seems like a bunch of philosophical-based, but easy prereq classes that you fulfill in your first two years before transferring easily into CAS. Doesn't seem too bad, though..

1) Do these ""prereq classes"" need to be fulfilled by CAS students eventually as well? If so, is the only difference that they have the freedom to choose when they fulfill them?

2) How is the transition between LSP to CAS Econ + CS? Is the program worse off for STEM/Math related majors? Am I still able to do the double degree within CAS or do I have to choose just one?

Does NYU increase financial aid if you appeal it?,"Currently, I have around a 22.300 dollars per year scholarship as an international. However, this is nowhere the amount I can pay. They expect me to pay 57.000 dollars or so per year when I can only pay 40.000. Has anyone had success with appealing their financial aid to get more? 

Also, would you guys think its worth to pay this much money to any university? I got into Stern, but I'm doubting my understanding of how prestigious and selective it is right now. 

Thanks a lot.",1576269970,1,0

How long until financial aid info?,I was just accepted into the class of ‘24 and was wondering how long it would take for financial aid information to come through. I checked Albert and there was no information but they did receive my FAFSA and CSS. Did I just not get any aid? There is a chance of that since my EFC was very high but NYU is still expensive for me and my financial situation has changed since the timeframe for the FAFSA so I was going to ask for reconsideration. Is it just taking a while to process or should I assume that I got no aid and contact them now?,1576263016,1,0

Really worried about failing a class.,"Throwaway, since my first account has my name in it.

This is an econometrics course. This isn't really my strong suit, and I regret the Economics major in general, but that aside, I am graduating next semester and I have no space for a failed class. I did a bit below average on the first midterm. Second midterm, I got a little bit above the same grade, but all my peers excelled, putting me in the lowest bracket possible. I don't really know the material and am completely lost in the course. With a final coming around, I am very worried about failing the course since I predict a similar trajectory on the final. I submitted all the assignments with a perfect grade. 

Although I know I didn't mention the breakdown, according to the syllabus, less than 5% get another grade besides A,B,C. 

Are failing grades typically reserved for poorly performing or low effort students? Should I be worried?",1576046315,1,0

"Studying CompSci in the UK, what's the best route to end up with a NYC MSc?​","Hey guys,  


I'll be going to university in the **UK** (**I'm Bulgarian**) in September of next year. I've already applied and been accepted into 4 of the 5 unis I picked (accepted in **York, Surrey, Sheffield, Leeds,** waiting on response from **Southampton**, but I'm 99% sure I'll get an offer).  


I want to study **CompSci** and since my end goal is working in the US. I want to use a MSc to jumpstart that (Visa, getting 3 years to work in the US post graduation so I've more shots at winning the visa lottery + I imagine a US degree is more desirable to US employers).  


I'll most likely end up working through uni in a pathetic attempt to save up enough to get out without any financial aid (one of the reasons I'm going to the UK, is that while my parents are well off by Bulgarian standards - big house, luxury SUV, they can in no way afford the 9.25K GBP + cost of living in the UK, let alone the 77K + cost of living in NYC, so I'll most likely either work to pay for uni in the UK or get a loan, and they'll provide the accommodation, etc.), or at least a minimal amount of debt, maybe get accepted to NYU and get absolutely obliterated by the monstrosity the living cost + college cost are.

Really hope the UK BSc can land me a decently paying job (even 60K will be a godsend, I'll get 3 roommates and live in Alphabet city to save on rent lol) so I can at least cover cost of living and put away cash for the debt I'm about to pick up thanks to NYU, without being on the verge of homelessness.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck me the debt will be **crippling** even if I work while studying.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm wondering is, what's the best way to get accepted into NYU? I've got straight As, will do anything in my power to graduate from uni with a BSc w/ Hons, but I'm unsure which university to pick - which one of the five is more highly regarded in the US? From what I've looked up, Southampton, Leeds and Sheffield are the best out the 5 and all rank within the top 100, but I'm hoping to get some input from people who've actually gone/are in NYU - hopefully maybe an international student who took my route?  


Tl;dr: I'm Bulgarian, going to study CompSci in the UK. End goal is working in the US. Out of these 5, which is the most highly regarded in the US/will grant me the best chance of getting into NYU - Southampton, Leeds, Sheffield, Surrey, York?

Graduating in 3 years? (Computer Science),"I'm looking at colleges to transfer into for Computer Science (after my current freshman year). I'm really liking NYU in general.

One of my most important decision factors is graduating early (i.e. graduating as a 3rd year/junior). I'm not planning on traveling abroad and am willing to take summer classes (to the extent they won't interfere with a necessary part-time internship or two). 

Given I'm studying computer science, is this possible? And for the sake of graduating early, would Tandon or CAS work better?",1574955394,1,0
Stern RD: question about score sends,"Hey, I will apply regular decision to NYU Stern this year and I am not sure which scores to send. 

Im an international student with a predicted IB score of 43/45 and an SAT superscore of 1440. 
I am having a hard time deciding if I should send both scores or only the IB score. 
Stern’s average SAT is about 1470 so I would be below average. 

I will also send, regardless if I send the SAT score or not, my SAT Math II score: 750.

I am a saluditorian and have a very high GPA 19.1/20 (my school does not have GPAs out of 4)",1574955241,1,0

Is NYU worth it for the money?,"So I got accepted into Stern ED and right now my issue is that I’m not sure I can attend because I wasn’t awarded any financial aid. I’m pretty lucky because my parents are giving me $125k for college, but with just undergrad being at least $320k before student loan interest it still leaves me at around $200k in debt. It’s my dream school and it’s just hard to have to think about letting it go for financial reasons because I’ve worked so hard for it. On the other hand though I’m not sure if possibly being in debt for a good amount of my adult life is worth it. I’m  pretty sure I can get some scholarships but I’m not sure if I can get close to the amount I need in them. So I’m at the point where I’m having to weigh what the benefits of going would be. I’m also considering Northeastern and Boston U but I’m not sure if I’ll even get in and if going there vs NYU will make a huge difference in opportunities. I’m also considering if I should go somewhere else for undergrad and then try for grad school at NYU. 

Sorry for the long post it’s just getting close to the time I have to make my decision and I’m still really unsure what to do. So if anyone has any advice for affording NYU or maybe how I should approach this that would be great!

Right now I'm choosing between a dystopian dark comedy (which is ""quirkier"" I guess - but might be a little ""in your face""), and a very straightforward, ""safer"" drama film that's won an award at a student film fest in my city.

Strong AP Scores over SAT?,"Senior. I've been looking for an answer to this all day and haven't come up with anything tangible. Here's the rundown: 

1330 SAT (710/620) My math score is garbage and its due to some earlier stuff (kinda had to teach myself the 8th + 9th grade while traveling, skipped a lot of simple, yet fundamental pre algebra stuff and some algebra I material that I tried to study for but turns out learning and implementing two years worth of work in 4 months of prep will not result in much improvement). GPA is good, EC's good, not really what I'm here to talk about so moving onto

AP SCORES (Junior Year) 

APUSH - 5  

English Lang - 5 

Physics I - 3 

\+ takin another 5 ap's this year. 

I was suped with my AP Scores. They were the highest in my grade, with 4/30 kids passing the physics exam (all of which took pre-calc at the time, I took Algebra II because human trash ig). There will be other kids from my school applying to NYU, so maybe this comes to my advantage?? Idk man. 

Basically I would like to submit my AP scores instead of the SAT. I know people on here are encouraging applicants NOT to submit a 3, but considering the rigor of the class itself and its pass rate, do you think it might be better than the SAT? 

Intended major is a double, music and physics (heh, ik) in case that clarifies anything.",1577128009,1,0

The State of this Subreddit: A Discussion,"Now that finals are over, I believe now would be a great time to discuss the current status of this subreddit. 

I am no moderator but I have been pretty active on this subreddit for the last year and a half or so and believe I may be able to vocalize some concerns I have personally experienced and what I see other users complain about. We attend the largest private university in the United States as well as one of the most globally spread and it's quite discouraging that our subreddit is relatively inactive amongst our current students and bombarded by redundant and easily answerable questions by prospective students. Here are some changes I suggest:

1. **New Mods:** The change first needs to come from the people able to make the change – the moderators. Most of the moderators, however, seem to have gone inactive due to having graduated or other reasons. I have only seen u/mrmbuceta be active in recent months and I applaud them for doing what they can, especially during the stressful Tandon semester. With more mods, the sub may not have to always rely on u/mrmbuceta to see the post or other users reporting ChanceMe's and admissions questions for action to be taken.
2. **A new sidebar**: Whether a prospective student or a new redditor, it can always be helpful to have NYU-specific information regarding the rules and function of this subreddit. A new sidebar would hopefully prevent the need for more work to be done by the mods. A sidebar such as the one sported by r/uchicago or r/rutgers may be informative to new and old members, directing prospective students to more relevant subreddits to them, including r/ApplyingToCollege and r/ChanceMe, thus avoiding the need to remove questions that belong there.
3. **Post flairs**: Post flairs would work to organize and categorize posts as news, school-specific inquiries, memes, and more.

Please let me know if I missed anything that you would like to add or remove and I will do my best to do so!",1577066543,1,0

I haven’t turned I the final paper yet (incomplete)... but I don’t know if it will even be worth turning in if I’m going to fail. 

I’m also really afraid because I left for my medical leave in the middle of the semester, I had to withdraw all of my classes, leaving me with bad SAP standing. I was on conditional financial aid and one of the conditions was that I need to have no F’s or W’s. I’m so mad and wish I could have done better but I don’t even know how to start explaining what happened .. I feel like I’m at a loss and I don’t even know what to do anymore.

Aspiring Music Composition Major,"Hello!

I’m currently a junior in high school, and I’ve found myself intrigued by the Music Composition major offered at NYU.

Would my GPA and ACT score necessarily matter as much as it would with other schools when applying for music comp? My GPA isn’t bad by any means, but I’m just curious how these two things would play out when applying.

I also noticed that one of the audition requirements were “Three or four scores of original works in different instrumentation and style”. What exactly are they looking for? Is different instrumentation required for each score? Being a band kid, I’ve composed mainly wind ensemble compositions and arrangements.

Additionally, what should I look out for in general as someone who wishes to apply to this program?

Does anyone feel that letting college graduates from other universities take a Tandon second bachelors cheapens the degree?,"&gt;If you already have a bachelor's degree, the [Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) and the [Rory Meyers College of Nursing](https://nursing.nyu.edu/academics/baccalaureate/accelerated-15-month) both give you the opportunity to earn a second one.

[link here](https://www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/how-to-apply/more-applicant-types-and-programs/second-bachelors-degrees.html)

Nursing is more of a vocational degree so it isn't that big of deal. but  engineering school is less so, what other engineering school does this?

Language placement tests?,"I transferred to NYU CAS from another urban private school. I took a semester of Intermediate French II at my previous university, but I was told I would still have to take a placement test to determine what class to take at NYU. On the online exam I placed into the level after Intermediate II (can't remember the name), but when I took the placement exam I was told I would have to take Intermediate II again. I am currently registered for the class, and received an email from the professor with the class materials and I found that it is the SAME CHAPTERS of the SAME TEXTBOOK, with the SAME ONLINE LEARNING PROGRAM. You may guess, I am quite frustrated with this because I got an A in this class at a comparable university with the same class materials.

SO, my question is this: does anyone have a similar experience they can share? Were you able to petition the university to let a previous class count for the language requirement, or at least take the paper placement test again?

NYU Upperclassman Dorms,"Currently applying for housing for next semester (I'm abroad now) &amp; was curious on input of upperclassman dorms. I'm mainly looking at Palladium, Carlyle, and Coral tower.  

What are the pros and cons of each/what would you recommend?

 I'm also very sensitive to noise, and that is a very important factor when picking a dorm to me.

Thanks! :)",1573595414,1,0
What happens when you score the highest level in the foreign language placement test?,"Hello. I am a student in NYU Steinhardt. In NYU Steinhardt, 2 language courses are a requirement, so they cannot be waived by taking an exemption exam. I took the Korean (which I am fluent in) placement test over an year ago (prob around an year and 3-4 months... by the way placement tests only last 1.5 years), and it said "" Consult the department for appropriate course placement"". Right now in Albert, I am not able to take the Advanced classes. I wonder if I still can try taking the Korean courses (my academic adviser did not give me a clear answer), because I really cannot afford to take a beginner's course in a different language.  Many of them conflict with my schedule and most of them meet 3-4 times a week which will simply break down my system of how things should go. My only C in high school was Chinese, which I really struggled at, so that reflects that I am not very good at learning other languages. Where shall I try asking for this information? I went to the NYU Academic Resource Center today and they were not able to help me. I want to hear what happened to other people who scored ""too high"" on a foreign language placement exam. Thanks.",1573593030,1,0
