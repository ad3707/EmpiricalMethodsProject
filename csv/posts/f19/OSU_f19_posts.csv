Please listen to the new petitioners!! They want Ohio to switch to renewable energy!,"I know, the petitioners the past few weeks were aggressive, annoying, and we all wanted them gone. We will call the annoying ones petitioner A. 

There are new petitioners on campus right now, I will call them petitioner B. They have new sign sheets that are vertical, whereas petitioner A sheets were horizontal. 

Petitioner B is a petition to have Ohio switch to more renewable energy sources instead of using coal. They were here awhile ago but OSU banned them for a couple weeks because a student got into an altercation with one of them (I don’t know all the info on that)

Petitioner A will be directly affected by changing to renewable energy, they work with coal and their business would lose a big chunk of money if we switch to renewable energy. However, renewable energy is so much better for the environment and would provide a large amount of jobs to replace the jobs we would lose in the coal business!! 

Also, petitioner A people were getting paid per signature, petitioner B people are purely activists trying to have Ohio switch to more sustainable practices. 

PLEASE, if you care about the climate, please take a second to sign their petition. They won’t be here very long, they only have about a week to get all the signatures they need.  Thank you!!!",1571338271,1,0

The truth about energy petitions on campus,"Hi everyone, 

As I’m sure you’ve noticed, there have been tons of petitioners flooding campus talking about government bailouts, climate change, and energy efficiency standards. Currently a battle ensues between the coal and nuclear lobbyists and the environmental organizations.

Earlier this year, House Bill 6 was signed by the governor allowing two of Ohio’s coal companies and two nuclear companies to disregard Ohio’s energy efficiency standards. In addition, they are increasing Ohioan’s energy taxes to provide money for four governmental bailouts of those same companies. When a bill is signed by the governor it goes straight into effect without receiving votes from citizens. 

There are two petitions currently floating around campus: one by the environmentalists and one by the coal/nuclear lobbyists. The environmentalists are petitioning to gain ballot access on a referendum to house bill 6. This allows a vote on Election Day for, or against, this bill, hoping to kill it at the polls. These petitioners are identifiable by a large paper packet attached to their petitions, containing: an explanation to what the petition is, a certification from the attorney general that this is a legal petition, and they always ask if you’re a registered voter of Ohio before allowing you to sign the petition. Some of them are paid, some are volunteers. However, NONE of them are paid per signature. The other petition is from the coal and nuclear companies who hope to stop the referendum from reaching the polls because they assume people will vote against it. They are identifiable by one page petitions with a statement of certification at the bottom. They are not verified by the attorney general, so have no seal of approval to verify they are real. This is a political tactic called blocking. Blocking is used to confuse the public into thinking they already signed the petition so there is no need to sign again if they are ever approached by the environmentalists. People doing this are called blockers, and are paid $8 per signature. They typically do not ask if you’re registered to vote. 

I hope this clears things up!",1571326381,109,0

Solar district cup team,"Hi Everyone!

I am posting this on behalf of a friend, but she has a team for the solar district cup! She originally had a team, however she hoped as the deadline drew near, they would help more but that never happened, so here we are!

She has had to work on most of this on her own due to the group not helping.

**What is it?**

The solar district cup is a team event to create a solar panel system using a mixture of comp sci, chemical, electrical and similar type of engineering!

**What do I have to do?**

The first part is a lot of paper writing and catching up on the research, but my friend would be able to help immensely.
The full task is not due until April of 2020, but there IS a deadline due Nov. 21st. 
There is more info below!

**Who do I contact?**

Just let me know in the comments or PM me and I will get you into contact!

I heard 180 credit hours was too much for a certain OSU money policy before graduation?,"I’m amongst the honors freshman putting together their academic plans, and while I absolutely won’t run into this problem, one of my roommates said his plan would finish him at 173 credit hours by the time he graduates. Before anyone freaks out, this is mainly from how much AP credit he has. With his current plan he actually doesn’t have many classes during his senior year and has to add more to even be full-time. 

Anyways, with the preface all done, I recall hearing in my survey class (from the instructor) that after you get 180 credit hours, osu stops giving you some sort of monetary benefit? I don’t remember much about it, and we can’t find anything online saying it yet. Can anyone elaborate? Thanks!",1574461920,1,0

Avoid the OSU optometry clinic,"I don’t have vision insurance (most people don’t) and I needed some new glasses so I tried the optometry clinic. You’d think (since a student is performing the exam) this would mean it would be dirt cheap... well nah it’s $145, about 2-4 times what they’d charge you without insurance at a regular eye doctor. 

The student was friendly, but he scratched my old lenses when checking my prescription (I went back to complain and got free lenses so there’s that) and the entire exam took nearly 3 hours (you’re a guinea pig and the student goes through a lot of tests that aren’t necessary for a young adult). An actual doctor needs to check the student’s work... you get bright lights and lasers shined in your eyes not once but twice!

The student got really serious and said things like “your optical nerve is badly misaligned,” and I started to panic. The actual doctor took a look and scolded the student, saying I was fine.",1574452246,1,0

College fucking sucks.,"Im majoring in misery so my social life has been extremely limited, My SO told me i'm an awful person and took the dog and cats and packed her bags and hit the curb. I pay for tuition in cash I earn from 50+ hour work weeks because I have no family to rely on, and I just can't fix my grades, my relationship, or my dying succulent plant all at the same time. I've slept 10 hours this week trying to fix all the above, and I am currently typing this in a recitation room Ill spend the night in since I also have an exam I haven't started studying for yet. 

To whomever is having it hard, know you ain't alone. These moments are what build us into greater people in an ever evolving narrative. Its okay to not be okay. That's ultimately one of the many things that make life worth living, for if there were no bad times, we wouldn't have a reason to value the good times.

1) Someone is going to transfer me the tickets (we're meeting IRL, so there is no scam). What app do I need to receive the tickets, and what do I need to have done prior to the transfer.

2) I have a Carmack 5 parking pass (WC5) and one of those Event Access keycards. Does that mean I can park in the Carmacks. Or in any of the parking garages free of charge?

3) Lastly, its most likely gonna be raining, so where can I buy a relatively cheap poncho (even if its just a one-time wear then dispose).

I need help but I don’t know what to do,"Hello all, 

This semester has been probably the hardest of my life. Im in the engineering field and I honestly don’t know what to do. Its my 3rd year of college and i feel helpless. Its my first semester on the main campus i spent the last 2 on a regional campus. Im currently looking at most likely getting all Ds or Ds and Cs my current GPA is 2.4. ( yes i know my gpa really isnt that good however over the first 2 years of college i had a lot of untimely deaths in my family and close circle of friends life was hard) My course load has been 2 different engineering courses one high level math course and a general chemistry course. Its not that i don’t care about my academics because i really do. I’ve been too embarrassed about my academic struggles to go to people about them especially with my family because they would probably shun me and I’d be viewed as a disgrace or disappointment. Obviously i want to do well and i want to graduate from this school. I really enjoy the track i am on and the things I study in class but i get this feeling that I either A) don’t belong there or B) cant keep focus long enough to grasp all concepts in lectures. My recent failure has ultimately pushed me into a hopeless depression that I can’t seem to free myself from. I do live on campus as well. Yes i made a throwaway account for this because people might know me. I appreciate any meaningful feedback on what i can do to fix this and I appreciate anyone who actually took the time to read about my personal problems i don’t ever open up about my feelings to anyone.

Financial Aid Not Disbursed,"I recently enrolled in classes for the spring 2020 semester. At the advice of my advisor, I enrolled in three courses totaling 15 credit hours. I wasn't able to get a seat in one of them, so I was only enrolled in 11 hours worth of courses, technically not a full time student. 

The tuition payment date for spring semester is coming up in december and when I looked at my buckeyelink statement of account I found that only a small portion of my financial aid was being applied to the total. I've enrolled in an additional class now, thinking that maybe my credit hours were the issue (this was about 30 minutes ago).

If anyone has had this problen before, should I expect the rest of the financial aid to come through soon, or should I be worried?

Late Scholarship Payment and Fees Due,"I have a few external scholarships that I have to send updates in order to receive money for the following semester (term grades and the new bill).

Does anyone know if making such a payment will alter my financial aid package in any way (i.e., will I get hosed of my refund if I make this payment myself rather than allowing my scholarship to pay it and missing out on a chunk of my refund due to late fees)?

I have to take a fifth year to finish up at OSU, but I have spent both of my off campus years in a high rise apartment building 2 steps from campus making it perfect for avoiding violent/confrontational crime at all costs.  However, it's incredibly expensive and I can't afford to keep living there for another year and so my sorry butt is now left frantically searching for living options with no experience with dealing with the dangers that seem to come with housing literally any further.  Is anyone else just tired of seeing the neighborhood notices spread closer and closer to campus and further West of High and North of Lane? Some of them sound like absolute horror stories to me, some in the middle of the day, early night time, it doesn't seem to matter where or when you are anymore.  I have no idea where to even try looking for housing with the combination of not having roommates, a budget, and what may be an irrational fear of Columbus and that itself terrifies me too.  As in to the point of wishing I could take all my last classes online so I can move back home to a place I can walk to my car at 5 PM without fear of being held at gunpoint.  These notices have long spread from 4th street, too.  Almost all of them for the past year or two have been north of 13th it seems and many near Waldeck (very close to campus and very north).  I know I'm being dramatic about it but honestly I don't have people to walk everywhere with, and how do you even leave the house after 5 PM during winter? Maybe I'm done with OSU in general at this point from being here so long lol but I'm ready to leave these muggers behind.

I checked my Financial Aid Awards tab and it showed nothing. I've kept up my GPA requirements and am enrolled full-time, so neither of those are issues.

Also, I've taken the entire 2019 year off to do internships. I did enroll with my college's relevant course for students doing internships, so my enrollment never lapsed. I suspect this year off may be relevant, but I'm not sure what the issue is.

It was a lab activity book so the best most of us could do was get used copies on Amazon, full of writing and ripped out pages. At the end of the semester, She revealed she'd weighted all our grades incorrectly on Carmen the whole time. So she redid all our grades privately and entered our final term grades as different from what was displayed on Carmen. On top of that, she also did not put in grades for 2 major assignments that would have significantly changed the class's grades before the final. I don't know if it violates any university policies, but it doesn't seem fair to have the incorrect grade in Carmen for the entire semester, and then change the grades in private without even updating the grade page or entering in all the assignments.",1576708246,1,0

Oracle Application Portal Down?! Ph.D. Chem Admissions due TODAY!!,"I'm a current M.S. in organic chemistry and am applying to OSU for Autumn 2020. I was only waiting on my undergraduate advisor's letter of recommendation. I did two years of undergraduate research with them and it was a great experience besides the point now that they're a huge procrastinator and told me to remind him every day since Wednesday to write my letter of recommendation, and a phone call to them friday afternoon informed me that they were too busy graduating their Ph.D. and needed to write it this weekend. 

Now trying to check on the Oracle application portal its giving me an error saying I cannot login at this time to check the status and I still don't know if I have my application completed or not! I am only applying to Ohio State since I'm moving to Columbus regardless after I finish my Masters degree. Does anyone know why I am having these issues and if a technicality screws me over will it be fixable past the due date?

Thanks in advanced!

TL;DR- a letter of recommendation got procrastinated by my undergraduate research advisor and the application is due today but I am having trouble accessing the application portal. Help!!",1576418196,1,0

Prof problems,"If you believe a professor is being unfair with his grading, is there any way to resolve it? 

Can I go to someone higher than him and bring it up? 

Here’s the deal, this professor doesn’t have point rubrics, so basically everything he grades is based on his personal opinion and mood. Despite meeting all the criteria he outlined (in syllabus) for each assignment (but no mention of point value for specific criteria), and turning in great work, he has taken more points from me and my classmates than we think is right or fair. 

His justification for the point deductions is weak, and everything has been along the lines of “but I wanted this...” - which has been mentioned after the assignments were turned in and not before.

Final Exam Stories,"With the approach of everyone’s favorite week of the year, I thought I’d share my favorite final exam story I’ve had so far.

Last semester I had a class that normally started at 12:45 and the final was from 12-1:45. I wrote down the correct time of the final and everything, but on the day of, I mixed the two up and just had the idea that the final was starting at 12:45 instead of 12. My boyfriend called me a few minutes after 12 and asked what time my final was, and the slow horror set in that my final had already started. I was at home, so it took me about 20 minutes to run to my class, but when I got there, **the professor wasn’t there yet**. The class was completely full and everyone was just as confused as I was. Turns out he had made the same mistake I had and thought the final started at 12:45. I couldn’t believe my luck.

If you're looking for someone to take your lease, or someone to lease with please send me a message with details. Ideally the apartment/house would allow pets (dogs and/or cats), and would be close to campus or a bus stop/shuttle.

Complaining about 2 PSYCH professors,"So I’ve had a few experiences with 2 Psychology individual professors that I believe have hindered my ability to learn in their classes.

Professor 1) Their office hours where during my classes so I followed the advice listed on the syllabus and emailed them to schedule office hours outside of their normal ones. The first time I scheduled with them I waited outside their office and they never showed up, after emailing them to ask where they were they responded by saying they’d completely forgotten we’d made an appointment. The second time I scheduled to meet with them I again waited outside their office and when they didn’t show up I emailed them and they said they’d written down the wrong date in their planner and weren’t there and didn’t show up again. Afterward, we finally arranged to meet before class started, they walked in at 10:10 when class began at 10:20 and gave me the midterm I’d wanted to go over and told me to ask them if I had any questions, the whole experience felt rushed and was generally unhelpful as they tried to cram it in just before class began.

Professor 2) I again tried to arrange office hours outside of their normal ones because theirs were during times I had classes. We had arranged to meet before class time, at 9:15 when the class started at 9:35. I arrived at 9:15 and waited for them as they weren’t there yet, they strolled in at 9:25 and when I went up to the podium to ask them go over the quiz we’d recently taken (which I’d explained in our email exchange) they claimed we “didn’t have time before class.” This bothered me because they were the party that showed up late. Afterward he came up to me individually and claimed we’d never officially scheduled an appointment to meet before class. After going over our emails I’d had said to him “thank you, I’ll see you before class on Tuesday” so we definitely had made the appointment official. I emailed him a screenshot of the email we’re I had confirmed our appointment and asked if we could make another appointment before our next class, he never responded and the experience in class made me uncomfortable with going to him for help going forward.

Sorry for the long explanations but I was wondering if either, both, or neither of these situations are grounds for filing a complaint against these professors? Thank you for your help in advance.",1572455802,4,0

Switching to Nursing,"I’m nearing the end of my first semester here at OSU as a Neuroscience Pre-Med major, and i’m starting to think it isn’t the right path for me. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love health care and (in the least morbid way possible) I love being in a hospital, so i’m 99% sure I want to work in one.

I thought I wanted to do Pre-Med, but as I look to my future I’m starting to realize that I chose that as a way to make my parents happy and not as a way to make myself happy. I played around with the idea of doing nursing in high school and got really interested in it, but my parents shot it down and told me I would be “wasting my education” if I did that, and I believed them, so I got rid of the idea completely. 

Now as the semester comes to a close, I’m realizing I’m struggling with my classes because I’m not passionate about the future I’ve created for myself. I’ve been joking about switching to nursing since i came here, but now I’m feeling really serious about it. I was going to stay in Neuroscience and do their Pre-Nurse Practioner path, but I realized I wasn’t a huge fan of the department recently and now I’m thinking I’m going to switch to the Nursing major. 

I looked on the website and I won’t have the gpa after this semester (because I was struggling) to switch to the Pre-Nursing major, so I’m thinking I’m going to stay in Neuroscience but ignore the classes they tell me to take and take the classes I need to apply for the Nursing program. The good news is, I already have credit for all the courses Pre-Nursing majors are taking now. I emailed the department, but since it’s scheduling season, I was sent an automated message telling me not to expect a reply for 2-3 business days so that’s why I’m turning to Reddit to help answer some of my questions.

I’m a little confused about applying to the program. Do I have to have all of my pre-requisite classes completed by the time I apply, or do I just need to have them scheduled and ready to take? 

I’m also very stressed about the gpa I have now and the odds of me getting into the program because of it. I am in Chem 1210 and Bio 1113 this semester (which I’m realizing are difficult to take your first semester of college, especially when you don’t have solid studying habits) and I know I’ll probably get a B or B+ in Bio, but Chem is a toss up because of the weighting. It’s looking like I’ll probably get a B- though. Even if I do very well next semester, will my odds still be low to get into the program? I’ve seen people say they were stressed about getting in with a 3.9.",1572380330,1,0

My professor is homeless and living in their office.,"Hi fellow OSU students, 

I need your feedback on a sad and slightly odd situation. It has recently come to my attention that one of my professor is most like living in their office. I by no means want to expose their identity or get them in any trouble, I just want some feedback and other people’s thoughts on the matter. I have begun to connect the dots that they most likely can not afford to live near campus, as they claim they are. I have asked them where the live (never inquiring directly as to whether they’re living in their office lol) and the answer only furthered my suspicions that they are homeless. My question is this: 1) how can I help them without embarrassing them, and 2) should senior faculty be made aware of their living situation? I try to show kindness and do nice things for this person, but it breaks my heart not knowing the full truth as to what’s really going on.",1572827106,15,0

I’ve seen a lot of weird and bad shit in my life so it didn’t bother me personally too much but I know it could be a lot for other people (it still creeped me tf out). I was so in “keep walking mode” and “don’t look back” as I could see him staring at me whilst still standing the whole time I walked by in my peripheral I didn’t get the house number to potentially report it, but if you’re walking down Neal somewhere around the intersection with 7th (I think) beware of this creep He’s probably done with his show now but I’m not sure when the next showing is.

I don’t want to say this guy was definitely an OSU student, but he probably was because of age and location and man, if you’re on here what the actual fuck. Not only are you a creep but I’d hate for people (especially as it looks like a lot of parents are visiting this weekend) to think this is what all the young guys at OSU at like because I know they are not. 

Idk if this violates any sub rules but this really upset me for a lot of reasons and wanted to put this PSA/Rant out there.",1570386737,82,0

Anyone here that was undecided between ECE/CSE? How did you plan out your courses?,"CSE has a lot less prerequisites than ECE, and I won’t be able to apply to the ECE (Computer Engineering specialization) major until second spring of sophomore year. My plan is to start in CSE and if I like it, stick with it. However, these prerequisite courses for ECE are tough (physics 1251/chem 1250) and I don’t know how I’m going to plan my CSE courses around them. I’m already taking physics 1250 at C-state this summer, so I can’t take Chem 1250 with it (unless this is doable, but my advisor suggested against it.) 

The good news is the ECE- CE specialization still has programming classes, so it’s not like I’m going into something completely unrelated.  Still, I’m not really sure which one I prefer so I’d like to plan accordingly.",1570331448,1,0

Selling student football tickets to non-students/young alums with BuckID with move to mobile tickets? How is this playing out?,"  

Old fogey here! I graduated a few years ago but kept my BuckID and the paper tickets made life so easy the past couple of years to go to the games.   
 

I pay above face value for some of the premium games (but waaaaaay below Stubhub, etc.) – college student makes some extra cash. We all win.   
 

I had no idea OSU made the move to e-tickets until this skull session a few weeks ago: [https://www.elevenwarriors.com/skull-sessions/2019/09/106696/ohio-state-football-urban-meyer-competitive-retire-coaching-student-ticket-decline-sales-alabama-plan-bribe](https://www.elevenwarriors.com/skull-sessions/2019/09/106696/ohio-state-football-urban-meyer-competitive-retire-coaching-student-ticket-decline-sales-alabama-plan-bribe)

 

Not surprised given most sporting events are moving to 100% mobile but wondering how this is playing out at OSU. I saw a few Reddit threads on this early in the season but didn’t sound like people had a handle on what was going on. I figure there were a lot of out of town people visiting for the UC and Miami games – how did that go? How hard was it to transfer student tickets to non-students?  
 

So cutting to the chase, if a couple alum friends and I want to go to game and possibly sit with our grad school friends – how do we do that? Going to Cbus for homecoming this weekend, on the fence about the game due to the new ticket policies.   
 

I’m skeptical of screenshots since doesn’t Ticketmaster use rotating barcodes now? Is adding to Apple Wallet a way around this? How much is the fee for students to upgrade the ticket to transfer to me?  
 

Any insight, guidance or advice would be great appreciate. Go Bucks!",1570205356,0,0

Has anyone had any experiences with OSU disability/ Housing services and do you think they would be willing to do anything to move me out of the building I'm in?
