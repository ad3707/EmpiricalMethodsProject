Subject to Dismissal?,"This past quarter I doubled the amount of hours I work, was way too involved with an extracurricular (it ended up taking up several hours of time a week), struggled with anxiety, and was overall just bad at balancing things. I am a 4th year hoping to graduate in the spring or summer!

After a really challenging quarter, I ended up getting a C+, a C, and an F in NPB 101. I am a psych major but I am doing the BS (NPB is required for that). I got about a 1.3/4 GPA this quarter and received a subject for academic dismissal notification. I have scheduled my counseling appointment and am working on the thing youre supposed to fill out, but I am incredibly worried.

I absolutely cannot be dismissed or even take a quarter off. I am ready to work really hard next quarter (quitting one of my jobs, taking time off from extracurriculars). Has anyone had an experience where they were subject to dismissal but were just placed on probation/ were ok to continue as long as they got their grades up? any advice?",1577754912,1,0

Feeling defeated,"I ended my first quarter as a transfer with minimal progress and a very low GPA because I would barely go to class and always try to catch up before an exam. 

I was extremely homesick and just too depressed to leave my apartment. I tried to make appointments with a counselor but they just never had availability and even cancelled on me on one occasion.

Every time I go back home I dread coming back to Davis, even though I have some friends and hobbies I enjoy doing. It just kills me to come back knowing how bad I’m doing up there in every aspect. 

I have been considering dropping out but I feel like I need to keep reminding myself. “It’s your first quarter!” But I also find myself daydreaming about going to school closed to home.

Do most students understand how curves work?,"I am a Junior and I've been thinking about this for a while.

For the past 2 and a half years, after every single exam (especially after the final grades are out) people seem to constantly flood piazza (or any other choice of communication) with questions regarding curves. A lot of them just didn't make sense to me. I wanted to discuss about this for a while.

So basically what I noticed is that professors usually aim for a 70~75% average on an exam, and set that as a C or C+. If the average is close enough, or if the average is higher than the target, the class usually isn't curved (unless the average is too high, in which case a downcurve can be applied in very rare cases)

If the average is lower than the target, professors curve the class to have a C or C+ average. For example, getting a 66% on an exam where the average was 50%, you will likely get curved to a B or B+. 

Students also seem to ask for curves even when the class average is well over 80% with plenty of chances given by the professor for extra credit and whatnot. Most of the time if someone asks a question about a curve, it gets serenaded with a thread of replies asking about the same thing.

We're all lonely. Let's fix that: UPDATE,"Wow! This gained far more traction and excitement than I expected! Let's do it!

**The goal of this event** is to provide an open forum and easy opportunity for us, who are feeling a bit lonely, to make some new friends. I understand some are more reserved/introverted than others but judging by the comments in the first thread it's clear to me that this will be a very open and friendly community. It's okay to approach at your own pace, no one will force you; we're happy you're here.  
**Remember:** We're here to make friends, it's wise to avoid hot topics. We all come from different backgrounds and hold different perspectives, they're all valid, let's respect that. Let's be a positive and welcoming environment.

**WHERE/WHEN UPDATE:**   
***When***: 4pm, Sunday, October 20th. After looking through all the comments on the original post I saw that Sunday late-afternoon would be a more fitting time.   
***Where***: E-Street Plaza. Due to so much interest we are moving the meetup spot to the E-Street Plaza. This location is very public/open and will allow us to make plans by ear and find what can accommodate us best. E-Street Plaza is in downtown Davis and has Baskin-Robins, Taqueria El Burrito, and is across from De'Veres Irish Pub. [https://goo.gl/maps/6LCXL1uF4EnScSxi8](https://goo.gl/maps/6LCXL1uF4EnScSxi8)

And he said, and I quote, “I know, but I’m too lazy.” 

So later that night, after he went he went to bed, I fished out all of the textbooks from the trash can and febreezed them. 

The next day I went to the bookstore and his books got me $180.

A clarification.,"To a specific user who I've already blocked early this morning and will not be named:

The whole reason I wasted what little money I have on chocolate and face paint was not for ""attention."" If I wanted attention I'd do something a lot cheaper, like jumping off a building or getting hit by a bus.

The reason I bought those things--with personal money, mind you, not the group's--was to draw more people towards the movement. There are a lot of people who have no idea what's going on, all the American students see is a bunch of strangers yelling in a foreign language.

I figured, hey, *I* like chocolate, so therefore, other people must like chocolate too! So if people like chocolate, they're going to naturally be thrilled by *free* chocolate. I thought it would be a good way to pull people into the protest who would otherwise have no reason to get involved, and hopefully in doing so, teach them about the movement and get them on our side.

As for the face paint, I wanted a way for the protestors and protest supporters to express their beliefs without vandalizing the school. Posters can be torn down, and chalking is against the rules. But there's no rule against face paint, and you can't easily remove it from someone else.

Not only that, but posters can only be in certain stationary locations. You know what can go anywhere, though? All of *us*! We can wander around the school bearing the Hong Kong flower and words of support, and not only will people see it, but they'll have the opportunity to ask the painted person, ""hey, what's all this about?"" So they're not just *seeing* our support. They're interacting with us, and learning about Hong Kong!

I mean, I get where you're coming from. The protests have been bloody and it's not something to make light of. It's a serious subject, and the protestors deserve respect and recognition. Which is exactly why I'm trying to attract people towards the movement.

My hope is that when people see the painted faces tomorrow, they'll want to ask, ""hey, what does that flower symbolize?"" ""Hey, why does it look like your eye was shot out?"" ""Hey, what do those foreign symbols mean?""

I want to make people curious, because curiosity is what drives people to educate themselves.",1571362965,0,0

Pro-Chinese Government Propaganda in this Sub and on Campus: Observations and Patterns,"**Introduction**

In the many discussions in this sub regarding the pro-freedom protests in Hong Kong, I’ve observed several recurring themes, talking points, and strategies by commenters and posters who have taken a stance in favor of mainland China’s authoritarian government (hereafter, the “CPC” for ""Communist Party of China""). Below is a brief summary of these rhetorical observations, along with brief rebuttals.

For background and reference, the protestors in Hong Kong have five demands and objectives. The first, “the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process,” involves the main precipitating event of the protests, which is a proposed bill that would remove the limited due process that is currently protected in Hong Kong by exposing Hong Citizens to direct political persecution in mainland China. The last, “the resignation of Carrie Lam and the implementation of universal suffrage for Legislative Council and Chief Executive elections,” would ensure a degree of democratic self-governance in Hong Kong while remaining part of China. The remaining three, “the retraction of the ‘riot’ characterization,” “the release and exoneration of arrested protesters,” and “the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests” are meant to address the ongoing brutal attempt by the government to suppress and discredit the protestors.

For China’s part, democratization in Hong Kong presents an existential threat to their regime. Historically, nothing destabilizes an authoritarian regime more consistently than bordering a democracy. It’s hard for subjects to accept authoritarianism and oppression when free people live on the other side of an imaginary line. China is currently separated from its closest democracies by seas, mountains, and buffer states. The prospect of a free democratic Hong Kong bordering the Chinese mainland has motivated a strong and violent response against the protestors by the Chinese government, even in the face of international condemnation.

Below, I’ve catalogued nine of the recurring themes, talking points, and strategies in pro-CPC propaganda on this sub. Even this post, which ended up being longer than I expected, captures neither the true breadth of the problem nor the depth to which some users have bought into China’s propaganda. A deeper rhetorical analysis would require more space than this post can afford and more time than I have to offer. For starters, I made the decision not to directly quote any specific user spreading propaganda, partially because I don’t want to call out anyone in particular or encourage brigading, although I recognize the lack of direct quotes may weaken my generalizations of those users’ arguments. I also don’t provide supporting evidence for my claims of extensive police brutality—which will likely be noted by those commenters who favor the Chinese government—because the main purpose of this writeup is to discuss the rhetoric on this sub, while I assume by now we’re all too familiar with the plight of the protestors.

&amp;#x200B;

**Using the term “Brainwashing”**

The first and perhaps most clever recurring theme in the pro-CPC posts is the use of the term “brainwashing.” Why would pro-CPC Redditors use this term so consistently? “Brainwashing” is a term that evokes a cartoonish image of people getting hypnotized by pocket watches. The term is meant to immediately denigrate any discussion of China’s extensive and pervasive propaganda campaign. Joking about the term “brainwashing” is also a great way to endear oneself to the audience. But, as we have seen, while the pro-CPC commenters in our sub aren’t brainwashed with swirly eyes, they have bought into much of the Chinese government’s propaganda and are parroting it here.

Pro-CPC commenters using this strategy will say things like, “We’re not brainwashed, we want to hear both sides of the issue” or “I’m just a scary brainwashed foreign student here to answer your questions lol.” Notice that these kinds of phrases make any following discussion of propaganda seem silly while also making the pro-CPC commenters seem reasonable and even funny.

While we’re on the topic of manipulative terminology, it’s worth noting that there are far less clever but equally purposeful attempts to control the narrative through specific terms. The most notable, of course, is to refer to the protests and protestors as “riots” and “rioters.” Other tactics, like using “western values” instead of “human rights” or using “China” and “Chinese people” instead of “the Chinese government” get their own sections below. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Cultivating Apathy**

When people think of the term “propaganda” they often imagine an authoritarian government trying to make their people believe incorrect or even impossible things, like that time that North Korea told its subjects that it found an ancient unicorn lair. The most effective and insidious propaganda isn’t a spread of lies, but a spread of apathy. Getting people to believe your lies is hard, but getting people to stop caring is an easy and effective way to control people. In short, authoritarian governments usually try to get their people to believe that their own beliefs and actions don’t matter, because the outcome will be the same regardless of any action they might take or opinion they might hold.

This strategy has been very noticeable among the pro-CPC posts in this sub. When confronted about their opinions of the Hong Kong protestors’ demands, the response is usually something like, “I don’t care either way, because they’re not going to get their demands met anyway.” Then, having dodged the question about content of protestors’ demands, they can move onto the other recurring themes and talking points of the propaganda.

&amp;#x200B;

**Twisting Hong Kong’s fight for freedom into a persecution of Chinese people**

The protests in Hong Kong are a conflict between the people of Hong Kong and an oppressive authoritarian government. The outcome of the conflict will determine the fate of human rights for millions of people living in Hong Kong and their descendants.

The authoritarian versus freedom fighter nature of the conflict puts the Chinese government in a bad light, obviously. So what is the best way for the government to spin the conflict in its own favor? The answer is to recast the conflict as an imposition of western values on the Chinese people, thus making the discussion one about cultural colonization, racism, and the preservation of Chinese values.

We see this in our subreddit whenever those defending the Chinese government attempt to frame the goals of the Hong Kong protests as “western” or suggest that democracy or human rights in general are somehow incompatible with Chinese values. This ignores that both democracy and a respect for human rights have been successful in a wide variety of cultures throughout the world. This is not only true in Asia in general (see India, the world’s largest democracy) and East Asia specifically (see Japan and South Korea), but even in an actual country populated by Chinese people (see Taiwan, which even if you don’t want to call it a country, is at the very least a functionally independent Chinese island democratically governed by its own people). Democracy has been successful in such a wide variety of countries because the core tenents of democracy—that people should control and be protected from their own government—is not incompatible with any culture, it’s merely incompatible with authoritarian political interests.

Don’t let the rhetoric distract you from the fact that this fight is one between the Chinese people and the Chinese government over their human rights. Siding with the people against their government doesn’t make you a westerner, it just makes you right.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conflating the merits of their opinion with their right to have an opinion**

In the specific case here at UC Davis of pro-CPC students holding their own counter-rallies, we see one of the oldest talking points of those who would use freedom of speech against itself. Several times, we have seen commenters say that they just want to have their own rally and table to share their own views of the Hong Kong protestors. How can you be against the pro-CPC rally if you support the freedoms of speech and assembly?

Those who have lived their lives in oppression might think this is a clever or even profound argument, but those who have lived in the free world are more than familiar with this fallacy by now. It’s the same question every time, always in a new wrapper. “How can you be against Nazi’s marching down your streets yet call yourself a defender of freedom?” or “How can you criticize that person’s remarks? Even if they’re sexist, what about their freedom of speech?”

The answer, of course, is not that we’re against anyone expressing him/her/their-self. If you want to spend your time in a free country to speak out against freedom, then go ahead. But respecting your right to speak doesn’t mean that we have to like your message or respect you for sharing that message. Nor does it mean that we can’t or won’t meet your speech with our own. Freedom to speak is not a mandate to be heard.

&amp;#x200B;

**Refusal to engage with the content of the protestors’ message**

&amp;

**Focusing on the protestors’ symbols rather than the protestors’ message**

I believe that most common strategy of Pro-CPC commenters is their refusal to directly engage the substance of the Hong Kong protestors’ message and demands. Every attempt to solicit a response regarding the five demands of the Hong Kong protestors are ignored or met with quick deflection. This is not surprising, because the demands are far too reasonable to attack directly, leaving deflection as an obvious strategy.

Many of these deflections are to other talking points discussed elsewhere in this post. Here, however, I want to discuss one specific form of deflection—the focus on symbols rather than message. Shifting the discussion to symbols from messages is an incredibly effective strategy when backed into a corner; I’m sure we all employ it from time to time. Symbols are powerful, yet easy to take out of context and easy to assign one’s own meaning. But let’s humor the pro-CPC commenters for a moment and take a look at the actual symbolic arguments they’ve made to distract from the substantive arguments against their government.

For those who don’t know, the UK returned control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, ending over 100 years of foreign rule of the city. Many in Hong Kong feared that the turnover would end many legal protections of their rights that existed under colonial government but which were not protected in China. As these fears have turned out to be very justified, some protestors have turned to the colonial flag of Hong Kong as a message to Chinese and local governments that they and their rights were stronger under foreign occupation than they are now under domestic rule.

Pro-CPC propaganda, however, has seized upon the protestors’ use of the old colonial flag to claim that the protestors are secretly intent on independence or-quite ridiculously-upon return to British colonial rule. This allows the Chinese government to shift the conversation to the preservation of the Chinese state instead of focusing on the actual demands of the protestors, which are quite limited in scope. Don’t let them deflect to symbols; keep the focus on substance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dehumanization of persecuted groups, namely Uyghurs in China**

When confronted about the extensive state violence against the Uyghur population, keep an eye out for two key responses. First, of course, is deflection and minimization (e.g. “I haven’t heard that much about it, but I don’t think it’s as bad as the media makes it sound"" followed by a subject change). The second is the oldest trick in the book for oppressing minorities: dehumanization. This second point seems to have a lot of buy-in from Chinese commenters, which isn’t surprising because people everywhere have always been eager to buy into any narrative that presents different people as inferior.

In the case of Uyghurs, look for commenters portraying them as especially violent (e.g. “the government had to ban knives where Uyghurs live because they keep trying to stab each other”). This, in turn, builds into a narrative that any state action against the Uyghur population (which, they insist, is minimal) is necessary for the Uyghur’s own good and for the protection of the rest of China. If these themes sound familiar, they should. We’ve seen it many times before, at home and abroad. States don’t persecute minorities for their own good, they do it because the minority group is in the way.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cherry-picking, Exaggerating, Hypocrisy, and False Equivalence**

The hypocrisy and cherry-picking of the pro-CPC commenters deserve their own post, because there is a lot to unpack. In this one section, I want to briefly highlight what to look for.  

All messages, politics, and symbols aside, there are two indisputable truths about the Hong Kong protests. Firstly, the protestors have been extraordinarily peaceful. Even if the very limited but very repeated allegations of violence by the protestors were true, the violent crime rate among the protestors is much lower than a given city of equivalent size. Do the propagandists really not think that a protest of well over a million people wouldn’t have any bad actors? Or are they hoping that we’re that stupid? If anyone tries to convince you that the protestors have been anything other than restrained and peaceful, especially given the circumstances, don’t give them an inch of respect, because they aren’t giving you any.

Secondly, the violence perpetrated by the state against their people in Hong Kong is extraordinarily excessive and atrocious. This is not the actions of a few bad actors within the police force; it is a coordinated and widespread effort by the state to violently quell, intimidate, and suppress their people. Do not let them convince you that both sides are at fault. One side is marching for their freedom, the other is attacking the people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Imposing their own Rules, Ignoring History**

Above, I noted that the propagandists will highlight even the most isolated incident of violence by the protestors as evidence that the protests are generally violent. I also noted that the propagandists try to frame the protests as a secret succession movement. But while it’s abundantly clear that both accusations are patently false, I ask, “why would it matter if the protests were violent riots for independence?”

The propagandists have tried to establish a premise in the debate that all violent protest and all calls for independence would delegitimize the protests at large. But have they forgotten American history or have they also forgotten their own? Weren’t the origins of current US and Chinese states built upon violent uprisings against the incumbent governments? Furthermore, aren’t these revolutions seen as morally justified in their current respective countries? Violence in popular uprisings doesn’t invalidate the uprising or, if it does, then both the United States and China are both built upon illegitimate foundations. In short, the propagandists have been so busy trying to trick us into thinking the Hong Kong protests are violent, they haven’t actually made a case for why they shouldn’t be violent. They are, after all, fighting for their freedom.  So if someone tells you that the Hong Kong protests are too violent, tell them that means China should surrender itself to Taiwan, the last remnant of the government mainland China violently overthrew 70 years ago.

The case of commenters discrediting the protests as a secret independence movement is a somewhat hilarious example of propaganda meant for a Chinese audience finding itself in the wrong forum. This talking point is meant to pander to a common and strong desire in the Chinese population for a unified country, by evoking the specter of succession. This obviously doesn’t land too well in the United States, which was built around the idea that violent succession is justified and necessary in the pursuit freedom, liberty, and democracy. So, as a tip to the pro-CPC commenters, maybe avoid talking points that make the American readers associate the Hong Kong revolutionaries with our founding fathers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Justifying human rights abuses by China’s economic growth**

One final common pro-Chinese government talking point is that the numerous, large, and ongoing human human rights violations throughout China are justified by China’s economic growth over the past few decades. Let’s breeze past how morally repugnant that argument is, because if you think that’s a legitimate justification, no internet rant is going to save you. Instead, let’s take a look at the causal claim that China’s growth is due to its humanitarian atrocities. I argue that with proper perspective, China’s growth has, at best, happened despite its authoritarian government and, at worst, has been greatly delayed by its authoritarianism.

Authoritarianism in general is strongly associated with lower economic growth, although the causal relationship between government type and economic performance is not entirely understood. China is the exception to the poor economic performance of totalitarian government. And even then, controlling for its large population, it’s not an impressive exception with a GDP per capita roughly equivalent to Mexico.

China is the largest country in the world by far, controls resource-rich territory, and has had its current regime for 70 years. The fact that they are now the second largest economy in the world isn’t surprising. The question isn’t why it’s doing well now; the question is why it took so long to catch up. Apologists for the CPC might say that China simply started with next to nothing 70 years ago following the Japanese occupation. Nonetheless, the numbers speak for themselves. Of the other top-ten economies, almost all were devastated by World War Two, yet they managed rebound faster and stronger than China with just a fraction of the population and without committing crimes against humanity. And if we’re talking about growth rate, sure it’s high, but it’s easy to grow a lot when your baseline is so low.  China’s government, policies, and actions have delayed their inevitable economic growth by decades.

You can look into my post history where I believe it shows that Im in a quite neutral position regarding the HK movement, and I think my experience as someone from mainland can give you an indepth view of the side that you don’t usually see — the side of mainland Chinese students. The majority of mainland Chinese students do not support and are against the movenment in HK for two main reasons to my knowledge, and I will go over each one of them and explain why they see it that way. 

1. They believe HK protest is a violent separatist movement that’s trying to make HK an indepedent country.

They view it this way mainly due to how the protests are displayed by the state media. The state medias show footage of police and mainland Chinese getting beaten up by masked protesters, pictures of protesters waving British national flags, videos of protesters damaging the public properties, and more. Did these things really happen? Likely yes. Did they do it just because they are violent thugs? Probably no. Do they make up the majority of the protesters? Likely no. However, the state medias use this footages to paint the protest to be about HK independence and mentions nothing about the five demands. Many of you asked in the AMA why HK independence is a bad thing and why it angers mainland Chinese so much. HK independence is a highly sensitive topic due to two things. First, it is just not possible in anyway. HK has no military of its own, is in the middle of mainland China, and has its infrastructures, such as power plants and water reservoirs, are all in mainland.  Second, it’s due to history of HK. HK was a colony leased to the British in 1800s, and the lease has always to be seen as a shame over the entire Chinese race because it shows how weak Chinese were and how Chinese were treated like slaves that would just give out their territory for opium. Fortunately for people in HK, British brought in a western democratic system, trades, and modern technology, which improved the economy by a sustantial degree. This sounds pretty positive, but it leads to the next reason that mainland Chinese dislikes the movement.

2. Many mainland Chinese believe HKers see them as an inferior race.

Under British rule, HK exceeded PRC (People’s Republic of China, aka mainland China) economically by a huge amount with its GDP being higher than PRC for decades. Because of this, many mainland Chinese immigrated to HK, and as what usually happens during a period that had a lot of immigration, discrimination and xnophobia happens. Mainland immigrants were given derogatory terms, such as “阿燦”, “大陸哩”, “大陸仔”, “支那人”, etc (you have to google them since each one has a history). Later during the infamous Chinese Milk Scandal, many mainlanders went to HK to buy milk powder for their children because they lost trust in Chinese brands. They bought so much that many HKers couldn’t even buy for their own because they were OOS. This brought mainland Chinese a new derogotary term, “locusts.” And of course, the state media reported all of this to the mainland Chinese to show them how HKers see them as inferior. 

(Below is a personal experience that I first hesitated to include because I could be biased due to many factors, but i tried my best to write it as close to what happened as possible. Sample size of encounters is not large either where N ≈ 15)

When I went to HK over several ocasions,  i found some really consistant patterns of how people treated me. I do not speak Cantonese, so I have to use Mandarin or English. Although HKers dont speak mandarin, they use very similar written language as mainland (traditional vs simplified Chinese). Because of this, I would type out things in traditional Chinese and show it to then. All of the questions pretty mich started with “hi, sorry for bothering. I’m from mainland and can’t speak Cantonese. Can you show me how to ...”. With this method, people most of the time responded in a really cold manner without any facial expression. I was just thinking maybe it was just that HK is a busy city and everyone is in a hurry until I started asking questions in English. Whenever I asked in English, people tend to smile a lot and respond my questions patiently. I am not the only one who have had this experience and was surprised when one of my friends bought up experience of his in a conversation where he found this pattern, too. Was it due to xenophobia or the bad stereotypical image of mainland tourists? Maybe. Was it just due to HKers feel more comfortable with English than mandarin? Perhaps. But one thing for sure was that I felt uncomfortable with identifying myself as someone from mainland and many people in China see this as discrimination.


Because of these, many mainland Chinese have a very biased view on anything that HKers do. Even if they did know the five demands, it would still be difficult to make them support the movements because of this nationalism and ethnicity related bias.",1571338717,45,0

"Has anyone gone through dismissal, retroactive withdrawal, and/or readmission?","Has anyone had a retroactive withdrawal approved or have gone through the dismissal/readmission process? 

I was dismissed for the 19-20 school year because of minimum progress and gpa standing. I spoke to the college dean advisors and they said one of my readmission conditions would be to retroactively withdraw from the quarter(s) that put me in a gpa deficit. If my petition for withdrawal goes through, I may be eligible to continue in winter/spring 2020. If my petition doesn't go through, I would have to wait until summer session 2020 to fix my gpa and minimum progress deficits. I believe my petition is strong as I do have a valid reason for my poor performance, but the "" [to drop or withdraw retroactively are the most difficult cases for the Committee to evaluate](https://academicsenate.ucdavis.edu/committees/grade-changes)"" from the grade changes committee page has me worried because its an understandably strict policy action. 

My withdrawal petition won't be evaluated by the board until the 15th of next month but the winter readmission application is due at the end of this month so I've nonstop stressing. I just don't know what I'll do if I'm dismissed until next summer as I'm unable to work and going back home isn't an option. I'm a transfer so I have no leftover lower division courses left take at CC and I'm two (!!) quarters away from graduating. 

I just feel so alone because I'm in this situation and I can not talk to my friends (who can't relate) about it. If anyone's been through dismissal/readmission/retroactive actions and can give me some advice or input (pm is fine) it would be greatly appreciated.",1571312158,6,0

We have seen many many posts about loneliness among UCD students, especially since the quarter has started. I feel like we're all feeling lonely in one way or another (you're not alone!) and I'd like to encourage us to do something about it.

I'd like to propose we organize a time and place to actually meet up and socialize! I would guess Saturday evening to be a time people are generally free, and downtown or campus a good place to meet. I'd vote maybe 6pm at Phil's coffee.

Please comment below any interest in this along with your major, your currently academic year, and some of your interests/hobbies.
I.e.: I'm an economics major who just transferred (3rd year) from San Diego. I like cars/motorcycles, the UCD minecraft server, and memes 🤙

Winter Quarter Jobs,"Hey guys!

 I was wondering how hard/easy it would be to find a job as a coffee shop barista/retail associate/similar jobs in winter quarter? I know employers tend to look for new employees with the come and go of each quarter, but where should I look for them? I've tried google, snagajob, and other job boards, but I haven't had much luck (for beginning fall quarter). Also, should I apply late december? Or wait until I'm back to Davis before I start filling out applications?

Thank you so much!",1572408853,9,0

Vista Energy,"To anyone that doesn’t know, Vista Energy is a 3rd party energy provider that often claims they’re part of PGE and that they can lower your bill.

Life after graduation???,"Hello, I'm currently a 4th year psychology major and I'm graduating in Spring 2020 (hopefully!) I know it's a little far in the future to be thinking about what I'm going to do immediately after my lease is up in August 2020, but um yeah the thoughts loom anyway. 

So ultimately my long-term goal is PA (Physician Assistant) program. But of course, if you're familiar with the pre-reqs, I have to gain anywhere between 1000-2000 hours of experience before I can even think about applying for a PA program. I was thinking of gaining this experience by getting my Medical Assistant (MA) certification.  Here is like my general timeline of how I want things to go:

Spring 2020: Apply for a MA program at a CC.

Fall 2020: Hopefully start MA program. I don't think MA programs are full-time, so I'd like to be working as well. I've been thinking about some entry level job as an administrative assistant or something, idk. Any help with this would be amazinnggg.

Spring 2021: Hopefully be done with MA program. Start looking for jobs.

Fall 2021: Hopefully I have an MA job. During this time, I was thinking of taking/retaking some classes at a CC that I need for PA school (Physiology, Anatomy, Stats, etc). 

\*fast forward to Fall 2022..maybe even Spring 2023\* apply for PA programs!!!

Anyway I got really off track, but like my ultimate question is where the heck do you find entry level jobs? Did you move back home after college? Did you get your own place immediately after college? I really wanna get my own place but rent is so expensive. If you're also on the PA route, what's your plan look like?  &gt;.&lt; HELP pls",1572302399,6,0

Room for sublease during the upcoming fall term,"Hey Ags! 

I am Andreas from Germany and I take part in the GSP of the UCD in my major aerospace engineering. I am looking for a sublease for the upcoming fall term. My budget would be 700$/month.

Some information about me: I started studying mechanical engineering in 2013 at the Technical University of Munich, Bavaria. I finished my bachelor's degree last year and now I am about to finish the master's program of my home university. I like to travel, hang out with friends (and drink the delicious beer from Munich) and do sports. My favorite sports are football (both, the European and the American version), baseball and sailing.

I would be very thankful for every offer or advice.  I would offer myself as a host during the Oktoberfest to whoever helps me out.

I am already in Sacramento, so if you wish to meet me in person, just write me a message here on reddit!

Have a nice day!",1568223512,2,0

STOLEN BIKE,"Hey! My bike was stolen yesterday roughly between 4:50pm-7:55pm from the front of Asmundson Hall. It's a black Raleigh Superbe Hybdrid. Frame Type: F.

Just to clarify, it’s registered under TAPs, I've already filed a report to the police about it, I’m checking for it on Craigslist, and I know it's not likely to be recovered, but I’m hoping somebody might've spotted it.

TIFU by Forgetting to Turn in a Paper... Help?,"Hey everyone, just made a huge mistake so I'm feeling pretty anxious right now. Woke up this morning and felt sick to my stomach, so I elected not to go to class, and ended up falling back asleep. Woke up again and realized I had missed the submission deadline for a research paper by about 20 minutes, and the assignment on canvas was closed.

Immediately I sent an e-mail to my professor and TA with a copy of my paper, apologizing and asking them to please consider my paper in spite of the professor's ""no late papers policy"" due to how little I had missed the deadline by. Waiting to hear back from them now.

This is a pretty big bummer, because I did well on the midterm and thought I did a good job on the paper, so I was hoping to get an A, but now it's possible I won't even pass... I'm a senior and applying to law school to boot, so failing could hurt me pretty badly.

I was just wondering if anyone here had any advice on how to proceed? I know that I messed up badly, but it feels like a huge punishment for an honest mistake. I'm already feeling pretty crappy at the moment, so it kind of feels like the world is ending lol, I guess I just need to know that it's not, and if anyone has any recommendations on how to improve my position, that would be a nice bonus :)",1575413899,1,0

Stuck in Cow Town - and shit sucks.," This campus is too large to make friends easily, and even with friends, it's impossible for everybody to make enough time to have healthy relationships in my group because we are all undergrad stem majors who don't know how to manage time and grades.

Academically, I can barely handle the minimum unit requirement. The mindset in lecture halls feels like a ""don't ask a question unless you know you're right"" one. Along these same lines, ive found students in my major (ANS) to be competitive to a point of pushing me down mentally to step ahead. I don't feel comfortable stating that I don't know an answer anymore. All of my discussion TA's for general classes (chem, bis, ect) are international male students who can't explain things very well, and it gets frustrating very quickly (To no fault of their own, I know they are trying). I  hate the learning mindset this school has, which often doesn't leave room for mistakes and as soon as you get behind there's no returning to your original pace.

I'm depressed and The SHWC doesn't even have enough therapists to see all of us, they're booked out -2 weeks. The online resource crisis line is literally scripted and didn't help at all ""did I help you move from a 'hot moment' to a 'cool calm' today?"" (Yes, that's a quote. The whole conversation went like this). All I needed was human connection and guidance earlier than the two week waiting period they offered.

Davis is accepting more students than it can handle and it's causing issues across the board, from mental health, class impactions, and housing space. 

I don't know how you upper-grads handle this but ive just been smoking weed to manage my anxiety and depression and it's obviously not helping. (no need to lecture there, it's a short term gratifying solution, I know) I don't know what to do, I feel alone, uncared for, uncomfortable, and destined to fail. 
I regret choosing Davis and wish I had gone to CC. I think I just can't handle the pace of this school, and maybe it's just a me problem. I feel it's too late to back out or even transfer to another UC now, I'm in my second year and don't know what my options are until after break because it was the soonest appointment I could get with an academic counselor. 
How do you guys manage it? It's too easy for me to fall into this pit of procrastination and depression, and it's a ruthless cycle.",1575350659,1,0

I’m adjusting poorly here even though I was very excited to be attending here,"Hey y’all, the title pretty much says it all. I feel like a complete loser and what makes it worse is that I’m not a freshman. I’m a transfer student who is very familiar with the quarter system.

I feel so dumb struggling like this because I feel like by now I should be used to this. I’m going on my 4th year of college and I still have no clue as to what I want to do with my life. Fall quarter was extremely rough me having to do deal with being far away from home, the loneliness, struggling class despite putting my hardest efforts, issues with tuition and just overall my poor mental health. 

In cc I was struggling as well because I was in a major that I was unhappy in. But I had Davis as my largest motivation. Prior then, I visited the campus multiple times, met with many advisors and I overall felt safe and excited to one day be coming here. I wanted to attend Davis because I wanted to do well academically and just be in a space where I was happy in. In addition to transferring into a major I was working hard towards. 

Now that I’m here, I’m just reminded of how much of big loser I still am. I’m struggling so much in my classes, I’m having trouble making friends, my plans for covering tuition is falling apart to the point where I have no clue on how I’m gonna pay for next quarter’s tuition, and I’m approaching my last few years of college with no clue as to what I want to do with my life. I’m so scared for my future y’all, all I want to do is call it quits and just go home. I’m starting to think I made mistake coming here despite my initial pure excitement and joy of being accepted here. 

But I’m too terrified of doing that as well. Any advice is much appreciated. I’m just tired of crying every night in my apartment.",1575248877,1,0

Does this seem fair or unfair? What should be done by my peers or I?,"Our midterm chem grade came in and the avg was a 55/103. The head TA claimed in the email some students (my peers and I) did not get 5 minutes and something about the mean in all the test rooms were the same, so nothing will be done about to give my peers or I extra points.
Of course, he is lying a little. Our test room ran out of tests twice, and the test was supposed to start at 730, but we ended up starting at 755, which he gave us until 900, but everyone had to make it to their next classes, so people starting leaving at 850. The test was supposed to be 80 minutes, but in actuality we had around 55-60 minutes. I think it’s unfair, but what should I do about it. I felt like if I had extra time I could have gone back and thought out my answers and checked answers, but I felt rushed, so my performance was bad. I don’t know if telling the professor is worth it. Or if he even cares? Is he going to take the TAs words or believe what we have to say? Any suggestions?
Some people I know have already emailed the professor to make appointments with him to address the issue. But, what he will he even do about this?

How likely am I to get off the waitlist for MAT 145 (Waitlist #13)?,"I was registered for ECS 32B because I wanted to brush on some CS skills before diving into upper-division CS courses. I'm an incoming math major transfer. But this morning  just found out that  I got kicked out of the course because I already met the course equivalence for it (I took Data Structures) at my CC before transferring.

Now I am met with the dilemma of trying to get registered for another course. My two top choices would be ECS 120, and MAT 145. I would rather take MAT 145 this quarter as I heard it wasn't too tough of an upper division math class. Hence, it would make the transition a little smoother. The problem is, there are people on the waitlist already:

ECS 120 - 3 people on the waitlist  
MAT 145 - I am currently #13 on the waitlist

Should I give up on my MAT 145 waitlist odds, and just try to get ECS 120?

Accounting Minor,Hi I’m a junior transfer Man Econ major debating on whether or not to go the Accounting Minor route.  I saw that accounting here at Davis doesn’t actually help furfill the requirements for the CPA even though it’s not something I planned to do. I read somewhere the major is now considered “STEM”?

The thing is class scheldued already seems hectic for me but if I don’t start with the minor this quarter I feel like I might fall behind since some of those classes are only taught once a year. So it’s like is it worth going for this minor even though I’m unsure to pursue this as a career along with this major.

Conflicted between choosing my GE,"Hi! I’m an incoming freshman and i’m lightweight stressed about two of my major classes so i’m trying to find a bearable (not necessarily easy because I know there’s never an easy pass class) GE that won’t hinder my GPA. 

I’m conflicted between choosing AHI 1A with A. Sofroniew and a UHP course COM 139 Shakespeare and the Classical World with Cheryl Ross. They both seem to have good rating on rate my professor but i’m unsure of the workload.

Anyone had any experience leasing an apartment at Davis thru private listings?,"Just a first-year trying to get a head start on housing for next near and I recently discovered some listings for apartments at Davis on third party apartment listing websites (not from the UCD off-campus housing fb page) and also ASUCD's community housing page.  So the listings are of apartments near campus, but there doesn't seem to be an official name affiliated with the apartment complex.  It just seems to be privately owned by one person, if that even makes sense.  So instead of having a name for the apartment complex with an official site, like The Colleges at La Rue for instance, the listing just shows the address of the apartment.  The amenities seem great though, with the apartment being fully furnished and utilities are inclusive.  Is this too good to be true? Are these listings legit and would you say it's reliable to lease from?",1576712382,1,0

a lot of problems- subject to academic dismissal &amp; late major change,"This winter quarter, I got a D+ in chem and only took 14 units. I was on academic probation last quarter as well and because the grades in my other classes weren't significant enough to pull my GPA up(\~1.9 for this quarter), I'm going to be on my second consecutive academic probation. I don't want to be dismissed from UCD and I've done some research here and there that says I can appeal my dismissal. I know I'm not passionate about my major at all and that's why my grades are so low as they are but I really want to fix that. Through my entire life I've been pressured by my family a lot to become a doctor, but I really want to pursue art so I want to change my major to Design. Problem is.. I've been so stubborn about changing majors for so long that I'm already a third year and I'm not sure if I can change my major into something completely different (especially because I already have 134 credits and on the UCD Letters website, it says something about not being about to change after 135 credits) . I'm also not sure whether or not my looming academic dismissal will play part into that either. I wanted to schedule an appointment with the Dean's office ASAP to talk to a counselor about this but it looks like they're completely booked so I can't do it over the oasis appointment booking.

Thoughts on this? (winter quarter),"So, I'm a first year currently taking BIS 2B, MAT 17A, and 2 GEs, and I'm debating which ""path"" I should take. I know I can talk to advisers , but I want to get a student's perspective on this:

\-Take MAT 17B, BIS 2C, and Chem 2A only (start chem series and have 2 labs) or take MAT 17B, BIS 2C, and 2 GEs again to try and finish GE requirements by the end of my first year. The big thing that I'm looking at is i should take Chem now or wait till the beginning of my 2nd year. I know quite a few people saying to take chem now because they wanna take OChem their 2nd year (which I know I'll eventually take)... so if I wait to take gen chem, will it set me back and give me a disadvantage... why not take ochem your 3rd year? 

\-Chem 2A is not offered Spring Quarter and so If I go the Chem route now (Winter: MAT, BIS, CHEM &gt; Spring: MAT, CHEM 2B, 2 GEs) then there's that. I won't be taking BIS 2A till fall quarter next year. Though, if I don't do chem now, can I still be okay taking BIS 2A?

I did a whole 180 for my fall quarter schedule because I was so sure I’d switch my major but I did not do so well on the exams so it has been making me feel more depressed and unmotivated because I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I study everyday, I try my best to go to tutoring and office hours but my work has gone to shit. I sound dramatic but I really am lost. I feel like it’s too late because I’m a sophomore right now and I should’ve thought about it more last year. I feel so stupid and lost, while everyone I know is starting to do internships and clubs for their career path. It feels like I’m back to square 1 while everyone’s ahead of me. I have high goals and expectations for myself but I feel like I shouldn’t aim high because My results aren’t satisfactory. I’ve been isolating myself from everything fun because I feel like I shouldn’t enjoy anything due to how shitty im doing.

What second math class to take with 21C?,"I want to take two math classes next quarter, but I am in a weird spot with taking 21C.

I want to take 67, but that requires 21C as a prerequisite, and also does 22A.

I was thinking of taking 108, because the prerequisite for that is 21B, but I would rather take 67 to satisfy my linear algebra and abstract math.

So, is there another math class that I can take besides 108 for a math major? Or should I just take 108 anyways then 67 because 108 is more in depth than 67. Or, what are the hopes of petitioning into 67?

Sexual Assault,"I want to phrase this carefully so as not to jeopardize my friend's trust or the case that has been brought against her. I just feel frustrated and I want someone to offer insight from the outside. I don't know all the details so that works against me here. My friend was blackout drunk (she had a drinking problem at the time, partially based on the sexual assault she herself suffered a few years prior), at like a house party of a group of UCD students who are part of an organization associated with UCD. The group she was with was also drunk, and some of them possibly blackout drunk. My friend (hereafter ""Friend"") and another girl (let's call her ""2nd girl"") end up in a room together, I know not how. A 3rd girl walks into the room and sees my friend on top of 2nd girl, trying to make out with her or possibly actually making out with her while 2nd girl appeared unconscious. 3rd girl, hereafter ""Accuser,"" accuses my friend of sexual assault to the organization associated with UCD, and ultimately to the appropriate UCD office. Some details: my friend and 2nd girl are comparable in size, 2nd girl being somewhat fitter and taller; my friend has some serious self-esteem problems, history of self-harm, food issues, and hx of severe depression; 2nd girl seems not to have wanted to pursue the case right after it was initiated, but Accuser has a very strong personality and is now spearheading the effort, and getting other members of the group to also contribute to the case (such things as Friend grabbed the crotch of one male of the group while sitting on his lap, Friend inappropriately touched the butt of 2nd Accuser during party, amongst other filings); 2nd girl mysteriously befriended myself and my Friend on facebook maybe a week after the incident. 

I'm not sure what I'm hoping to accomplish by posting this here, I just wish my friend didn't exist in such a vacuum of self-hatred and despair. I wish there was a group on campus not associated with the school that could help her with this. I wish someone non-judicial could intervene. She's like 22, highly intelligent, and she told me she's very suicidal. Don't tell me she should seek professional help or school counseling, I will disregard you, as she would disregard me. She insists on dealing with this herself because she is incredibly stubborn and incredibly hard on herself. Also, she has to spend all her savings on a lawyer for this case. Her family is a little emotionally abusive and has no sympathy for her. She works and lives off-campus. She's afraid she won't graduate and that the sword of Damocles is hanging over her head (my phrasing) so it's difficult for her to do school work, and she normally would be getting straight As (she's STEM). It's just so fucked she feels all persecuted and alone, and I know Accuser is moving forward with the accusations and I think 2nd girl and maybe one other person are going to corroborate, but damn this girl doesn't deserve this.",1573107487,0,0

Looking for Friends,"I'm aware that people have made numerous posts similar to this one so I apologize if this is redundant.

If you don't like reading controversial stuff, then don't read below. 

**Context:** 

2nd year engineering (M)

**Detail:**

So, I've been speaking with a few individuals at this school and I find that I don't 'click' with anyone because we don't have shared mutual interests, so here are mine:

* Philosophy 
* Economics (very little)
* Politics
* Foreign policy

Warning: libertarian rambling below.

**More Detail**

So, I've decided to give some selections regarding what my viewpoints are:

Philosophy:

* reality exists, man can perceive reality, reason is the means of perceiving reality, we have free will
* God doesn't exist, faith is immoral
* mysticism and totalitarianism are linked; for example, Nazi Germany primarily resulted because of Christian faith/self-sacrifice (Plato)
* rights belong to man because man can reason, non-human animals have no rights
* rights are the property of individuals
* taxation is immoral

Economics

* The mixed-economy results in racism. Since people have to create political unions to organize for 'rights,' they do so on grounds related to race. Thus, the lack of free markets encourages racism.

Politics:

* I believe hate speech is free speech
* there shouldn't be as many regulations. for example, there should be no American Medical Association, which is just a cartel. People should be able to receive surgeries from people who have no experience at all so long as they consent
   * corporations 'buy' the gov. to grant them favors. regulations are used by the wealthy to keep competition down.
* cocaine, suicide,etc should all be made legal (although I think of them as immoral)
* i support clean energy but environmental policy would unintentionally harm the poor so I'm against it
* I believe gun rights are a technicality but today gun violence is just a means of political demagoguery
* not planning to vote during the next election. 
* democracy is not inherently good. an ideal gov. would be more akin to a confederacy
* universities should be privatized and deregulated to lower cost and increase quality

Foreign Policy

* should cut military funding by over 70%
* should return from middle east
* unsure regarding israel/palestine. support peaceful resolution.

Social

* racism is bad but those who seek to punish racism have gone the wrong route (I believe in forgiveness and sympathy as a means of ending racism, not totalitarianism)
* i think that women should have the ability to have an abortion during the first trimester. second tri. is a technicality. third should be illegal.
* immigration is a technicality. moderation",1570245544,0,0

I just found out that the OChem series I had taken at a different college will only count as CHE 118A here in Davis.

Has anyone been in a similar situation that could maybe shed some light on what steps I should do? Or does anyone have any insight or advice? Is it possible to petition or argue the evaluation decision? 

As a non-traditional transfer student, I'd actually like to finish my degree on time this time. But it seems like I won't and it's both frustrating and disappointing.

UC Davis TAG/General admission question," So this entire thing has been stressing me tf out lately:

I'm currently a sophomore at De Anza College and am applying to transfer to a UC for the Fall 2020 term. I applied for TAG for UC Davis, and despite my belief that I had met all the requirements for UC Davis for my major (Computer Science), my TAG was not approved, with the stated reason on my UC transfer admission planner portal:

*""Your GPA in a selective major preparatory course or course group falls below the minimum required for your major at the time of TAG submission.""*

The computer science selective course requirements for math for Davis are Math21A, Math21B, and Math21C. I cleared both Math21A and Math21B with my Calculus BC AP Score of 5, so I did not have a GPA for those two courses. So the only course in this series that I was able to take at De Anza was Math21C, which I got a B in. But since Berkeley and UCLA require taking the entire math series, I have also taken additional higher level, more rigorous math courses in which, including Math21C, I received an overall GPA of 3.5 in the MATH-specific selective courses. Here's basically a summary of what classes I took in each series and the grades I received.

\- Math1C (Calculus): B (3.0)- Math 1D (Multivariable Calculus): A (4.0)- Math 2A (Differential Equations): A (4.0)- Math 2B (Linear Algebra): B (4.0)- Math 22 (Discrete Math): In Progress**Overall Math series GPA: 3.5 at time of admission, higher than required GPA of 3.4**

In addition, here is a summary of the Computer Science specific selective major courses I've taken at De Anza:

\-CIS22A (Intro C++): A (4.0)-CIS22B (Intermediate C++): A (4.0)-CIS29 (Advanced C++): A+ (4.0)-CIS22C (Data Structures): B+ (3.3)-CIS40 (Intro Python): A+ (4.0)-CIS41A (Intermediate python): In Progress**Overall Computer Science series GPA: 3.86 at time of admission, higher than required GPA of 3.5**

**My overall UC-Transferable course GPA at time of admission is 3.72, also higher than required GPA of 3.4**

With that being said, since I was not approved for TAG for this special circumstance of having previously cleared both Math21A and Math21B with my AP Score and not allowing them to be counted towards my GPA does that mean that I'm also not eligible for transfer for general admission either, despite having went above and beyond their requirements for math? 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically my question is, **if I wasn't eligible for TAG, will I still be eligible for general admission?** Or am I royally screwed and need to wait another full year at deanza to try and take those two courses for a grade before I can even try to transfer again? (Would be a waste of an entire year of my life).",1574619417,1,0

This may seem contradictory, but I’m not too interested in hands-on stuff, but am attracted to the design aspect of engineering (which is why I’m leaning towards research in engineering) or the theoretical concepts that applied physics might better provide.

Any insight is appreciated!",1574409245,1,0
