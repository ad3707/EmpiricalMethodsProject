and showed science/mathematics ends in meaninglessness

1)Mathematics/science ends in contradiction:an integer=a non-integer

Mathematics ends in contradiction:6 examples

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/MATHEMATICS.pdf

2) the theory of evolution ends in meaninglessness

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/books/philosophy/Natural_selection.pdf

3) biology is not a science

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/Bbiology-is-not-a-science.pdf

3) biologists dont know what a species is-thus theory of evolution is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense",1569912634,0,0

It doesn't seem like much but it adds up. It's like writing letters to your senator or voting. It's a football faux pas to cheer when your team is on offense.",1568942917,55,0
Visitor student for CS Classes,"I'm an intern in the Palo Alto area, and I'm taking a gap year to do a series of alternative learning challenges. I'm living right off Campus and I wondered what you think about auditing multiple classes as a visitor? 

  
I have flexible hours and just enough CS experience to do my work well, but I'd love to build a stronger base and have more bg knowledge in both areas I'm working in, CS and Education. I've already reached out to some professors, but I don't have access to the class schedules or the myths about which professors tell the best stories and make the info memorable that are helpful when deciding between classes.  

  
If you have class recommendations, I've built live apps but don't really understand the systems well enough to abstract the problem-solving strategies (i.e. I don't think I could use what I know about mobile apps to reason about AR or Robotics), or if you have Ed Class recs for someone looking to work in EdTech I'd love to hear!  

  
Also, if you'd be willing to give me an inside scoop about class schedules and good prof––maybe even how to navigate the campus :) that would be sweet too! Thanks.",1568925227,4,0

"Questions about CS? I'm a Stanford transfer, coterm, and CS 106AX head TA. Ask me anything","Hey reddit! My name is Ryan. I transfered to Stanford from community college in 2016, graduated from undergrad in 2019, and am now working on my coterm (which is a master's degree started concurrently with undergrad, for those new to Stanford).

I'm pretty involved in CS at Stanford, and I wanted to see if I could help answer people's questions. Some things I can speak to:

* Course selection: I'm familiar with most common CS classes here and am happy to give advice on classes to take. I am head TA for a new intro CS class this quarter (CS 106AX), so I'm especially interested in helping people new to CS start off in the best class for their background.
* Teaching: I have TA'ed several different classes, both as an undergrad and a grad student. I also lectured (as the primary instructor) for CS 110 (our Unix systems class) last summer.
* Internships and software engineering: I've worked in a national lab (Sandia), at a startup (Expanse), at a big company (Facebook), at a nonprofit (Khan Academy), and started my own startup in a past life.

I'm also happy to answer other questions about my Stanford experience. Some topics off the top of my head:

* Transferring and adjusting to Stanford
* Staffing in an undergraduate dorm
* Playing/recording music on campus
* Anything on my website (reberhardt.com)

Advice for a senior/coterm applying for internships/jobs for the first time? (Specifically CS/data science),"I'm going to graduate either spring 2020 or fall 2020, so I'm looking for summer 2020 internships, and to be honest I have no idea how people get jobs. Specifically I'm looking for data science/analytics positions, and all but one of my previous internships have been via connections. My background is: random quantitative undergrad + CS coterm and previous intern experience is:

* freshman summer: big tech company/software engineer (via Handshake);
* sophomore year: financial services firm/data scientist (Stanford-funded program)
* sophomore summer: research institute/quantitative analyst (via connections);
* junior year: large retail company/data scientist (via connections);
* junior summer: random startup/data scientist (via connections);
* senior year (I have not yet decided if I will accept the offer): large media corporation/data scientist (via connections), but they have no plans to hire another data scientist full-time;

I also don't really want to return to any of the companies I previously worked at, so that is an issue. I guess I can think of a few possible ways to get jobs, but I am not sure if any of them are effective.

Career fairs: I went to all the career fairs (fall general fair, engineering fair, spring fair, random BEAM center fairs, social impact fair, etc) every year and gave out my resumes, but I didn't really get anywhere, so I'm not sure if I was doing the process wrong, or if now that I'm a senior, companies will take me seriously. Do people actually get anything from these routes? Also, a lot of companies just say to apply online.

Handshake: I did get a small handful of interviews and 2 software engineering internship offers freshman year after applying for 300+ software positions on Handshake (it was awful). But I tried to apply for positions during sophomore year and junior year (although they were more stats/data science focused) and never got invited to interview anywhere. Also, a lot of companies just redirect you to apply on their official website, which never leads anywhere.

Company talks: tech companies come give a presentation on campus and hundreds of people pack the room and drop their resumes. The recruiters/company engineers just get swarmed with a bunch of people. Are these ever effective?

Referrals/connections: Most of my friends are not working in tech (yes, surprising), or I have already gotten referred by them. I am only close with a few professors, so that is another option.

Stanford worth it,"Hi,

Please be patient and open-minded as I spill the details of this story. I am extremely grateful that I’m an incoming fresh at Stanford. It was just the perfect fit for me. The resources seem boundless. I’m from an upper-middle class single home. My mother came from a low-income family(she’s first gen—first to go to college), immigrated to the U.S, worked her butt off to become the physician she is today. We essentially started off as working-middle class(when my twin and I were born), by 10 years of age we were middle class, and by 15 years of age we were upper-middle class—she essentially broke the cycle for the family. I have a twin(going to a top school on the east cost—same name brand) also, so that’s two people going to college at the same time. She’s a single parent, so she’s the only person paying for both our fees. She’s extremely proud about us the colleges that we’re attending. The caveat is that she’s paying almost full cost for each person. I feel guilty sometimes because a good chunk of her salary is going into paying for 2 people at the same time while taking care(financially) of family members back in her home country. Sometimes we hear the complaint about fees—jokingly and un jokingly, which is perfectly understandable. 

Both my sibling and I want to go into medicine as well. I understand that there are quicker and more lucrative option to wealth than going into medicine. At an event today, my mom’s colleagues essentially hinted at me not to go into medicine when I’m paying such high cost to go to Stanford. They were suggesting I explore other routes out there that will make me a higher income in a shorter amount of time. They basically said keep an open-mind—you’re around Silicon Valley make all that fees worth it. They suggested that one going into medicine didn’t need such an expensive school, so if I’m going there I might as well take advantage of all the other non-med related resources.

Now, my mom has been supportive of whatever decision I make. She essentially told me to do whatever makes me happy.

So, I ask this question (please consider the circumstances) to those who are upper classmen and alum—has the Stanford name tag been worth it to you?",1567823410,10,0

Am I really First-gen/Low Income?,"Incoming Frosh here. I'm in a dilemma right now. I'm first-gen/low-income on paper, and so I've been getting emails about all sorts of events planned for first-gen/low income students. However, I'm currently on a full scholarship with a very generous stipend. On top of that, my scholarship also allowed me to go to a private boarding school, and offers me very generous allowances for things like a laptop, phone, clothing annually. I'm just not sure that if I do attend those events and try join the community at Stanford, will people judge me for the privileges that I've had and be skeptical about me really being part of that community. Keep in my mind my parents never went to college and I've lived below the poverty line before I received my scholarship two years ago. So, should I attend those events and try to integrate into the community?

Tl;dr my parents didn't go to college, and my family and I lived below the poverty line until I received a scholarship which allowed me to go to a private boarding school and offered me generous stipends and allowances. Do I fit into the first-gen/low-income community?",1567800876,27,0

Blind Advice,"I’m hoping to receive some advice given minimal information.

I think I may have fell into a creative arrogant trap. I’m currently in Canada at a University that seemed to have been a good option for someone who is creative and intellectual. For anyone who knows Elon Musk and his story, I quite literally thought I was clever enough to go to a harder school than Musk did in Canada but still try to transfer to a school in the US. That was a bad plan. It was appealing, who wouldn’t want to transfer from one impossible school to another and have that as their history? I then realized that this University is trying so hard to have a good reputation that it cares less about what the students actually learn than having the hardest courses. Turns out, everyone is failing their courses and everything is curved all the time. Thus, it is quite impossible to transfer as it seems that averages are nearing 60 at this school. Overall, it is a massive trap and a hellhole for someone who is creative and wants to build things. I have no time to do anything because of the massive course load and being in one of the hardest programs. Not only that but the professors at the school can barely speak English. I’m not sure what to do being someone who was chasing the reputation of the school and hoping it would be easy to transfer to a US school so I could actually enjoy world renowned professors, creative students, and time to learn. The US is rather more creative than Canada and I think I have made a bad decision. As before, I could see the path to success, now all I see is me finishing this degree then being trapped in Canada and never starting a business in the US.

Using SCPD's Foundations in Computer Science certificate to get into a MSCS (non-CS background),"Hi there,

I was wondering whether anyone here has been successful in using SCPD courses (taken online) to meet the CS prerequisite that most MSCS programs have?

My own situation is that I live in the UK and have a BS and MS in Economics (from top universities here with 3.7-4.0 GPA equivalents I think). I want to apply to the US for MSCS programs next year (for Fall 2021 entry) and as most of them require some CS background I'm looking around for ways I can acquire the credits in the next 1-2 years. SCPD's certificate looks like one solid option. Another is Oregon State University's online post-bacc in CS, which confers a complete BS and is cheaper per credit hour but I'm thinking that the brand name recognition of Stanford might help - maybe the courses will be perceived as more rigorous.

Another thing I'd be after is getting letters of recommendation from professors - anyone know if this is possible if you take an active student role in a SCPD course?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated - thanks! :)",1574119312,1,0

I'd be willing to be just be a CS major just to avoid those classes, but the CS major itself has a lot more requirements I'd have to fulfill.

Internal MS in Stats,"This is probably a weirder one of the annoying ""chance me"" thread variety, but I'm wondering if anyone has any insight into how difficult it is to get accepted into the MS stats internally as a PhD student in a tangentially related field. Of course this is assuming what I presume to be satisfactory completion of the pre-reqs to applying (I'm guessing no grades below an A- within these), as well as equivalent or higher GRE scores than what their averages are, undergrad grades and training that would get me into a half decent stats MA program (but probably not Stanford's tbh), blah blah all that good stuff that indicates that one wouldn't spectacularly fail.  

I know some MA/MS programs are free to enter for anyone who can get the grades (like Econ's MA) but I know the application process is a lot more involved for statistics. I've seen someone say the coterm isn't too hard to get into assuming the above stuff is adequate, so I have a hunch that they'd act similarly for PhD students, but I'd love to know if anyone has some additional insight beyond my own guesswork.

How hard/math intensive is a Econ+stats double major?,"Hi all,

I am planning on applying to Stanford, UPenn, and UChicago next year and doing econ and stats as a double major, but I had a few questions. 

1) Is econ and stats in Liberal Arts and Sciences or is it in the business school? Are there even specific business undergrad majors? If there are, is taking a specific business major like finance or marketing just as good as econ and stats if I want to get an MBA and eventually a management role, or is it too limiting?

2) How hard is an econ and stats double major? I know that prestigious schools are really hard, and I wanted to know if stanford is the same or if it is relatively easy to the other prestigious schools.

3) Is econ and stats going to help me find a consulting internship out of college and eventually help me get an MBA?

4) How much calculus would be needed for this double degree? I stopped after Calc BC and I am only taking Comp Sci as my math in senior year because I don't want to do Calc 3.

5) Is grade deflation a thing and will it hurt me?

question - is it necessary for me to get accepted somewhere else with a better financial aid package to meaningfully negotiate for better aid? how effective is that given stanford knows they're the best (???how did i get in lol???) and pretty hard to turn down? i obviously don't want to contrive any family crises to request more aid, but would really really appreciate if they met the requirements we expressed in css. what are my options here? is sending a simple appeal letter reminding them of things like my grandparents' medical expenses sufficient, or do i absolutely have to get in somewhere with better aid to send in the letter? because i really really dont wanna apply anywhere else lol.

"I haven't been to campus yet, but I already feel so small and inadequate","I'm class of 2024. I was in shock when Stanford accepted me- I truly didn't even consider it as a possibility.

 I looked at the class of 2024 bios instagram page, and just felt so small...These people are crazy- they speak four languages, are national champions in debate, USACO coding champions, chess masters, and are top-notch athletes. And on top of that, most of them are good-looking.

There's nothing special about me- I've not a genius, I only speak one language, and I'm not particularly athletic. I feel like I'm the only 'mediocre' kid Stanford accepted and I have this horrible feeling that my acceptance was a mistake. 

To top it all off, lots of my 'friends' at my large, competitive public school have been talking shit about me behind my back. One person even 'congratulated' me on my acceptance by telling me 'good thing there's affirmative action' (I'm an URM). A couple of my friends are genuinely happy for me, but I can't bring myself to be happy for myself. I feel like I will be so small at Stanford, and that my acceptance really was a mistake, as my classmates said.",1577584901,1,0

How is public transport at Stanford?,"Hi, everyone!

I’m in the Stanford CO 2024 and I’ve never visited campus, my only idea of what the campus is like comes from gilded youtube videos and google maps. Maybe accepting my admittance without knowing the campus was a bad idea, but it’s Stanford and I grew up in California so I’m not expecting much different. 

However, I’m incredibly poor. Like, will need a work-study job as soon as I step foot onto campus poor. My parents have absolutely no money to give me for college, and so I won’t really have access to certain things (like a bike/skateboard to get around) for awhile unless I’m able to secure a scholarship (not banking on it but I’m hopeful?) 

So, my questions for you all are: for the period that I don’t have a bike/skateboard/whatever, is walking around campus difficult/doable? secondly, is public transportation an option? I’ve seen stuff about public transport on Stanford’s website, but I’m not sure how viable it is since whenever I see YouTube videos, people just Über to go to Walmart/Whole Foods or Palo Alto or whatever (their privilege or just the most convenient way? both?)

Taking CS229 through SCPD: application and prereq tips,"Hi all - I'm applying to take CS229 through SCPD in the Spring term as a non-degree seeking distance learning student. I was hoping to get some tips, grateful in advance for any help you can give :)

First on the application itself: I'm under the impression that being accepted to take SCPD courses as a non-degree student isn't really that competitive a process and so my statement of purpose doesn't really have to be edited to perfection. I have a BS and MS degree in Economics where we did a lot of calculus/linear algebra in minimising different loss functions so I'm hoping I tick the main boxes. Am I right, or is SCPD a lot more competitive to be accepted into than I think? It'd be good to know if so :)

Second on prerequisites: it's been a while since my MS degree and I'm looking to brush up on my math in the few months before the course starts. I recently went through basic calculus, and I gather the most important thing to do next is some linear algebra. I was considering working through either 'introduction to linear algebra' by Strang, or 'linear algebra done right' by Axler. I know they are two different levels of rigour/proof-based-ness, so I was wondering if anyone could say which one is more appropriate as a prerequisite for the CS229 course?

Or maybe I'm way off the mark and there's something better I should do as preparation :)

Tough freshman fall quarter,"Hi, 

I recently finished my fall quarter at Stanford and it really, really sucked. Not only did I have a hard time adjusting, but I got a B+/- on almost all my classes this quarter and felt subpar 100% of the time; I also struggled a lot with my mental health and ended up skipping lecture because I didn't feel like leaving my room. Not only do I feel absolutely pathetic about my academic performance this quarter, but I'm also reevaluating my abilities and I'm really scared that the following quarters are going to get worse. I'm scared that I'm not going to be able to land an internship because of my GPA (I want to major in CS and I fucked up my CS class along with other classes because oh well) and I just feel inferior compared to everyone else.

LATE stanford rea (with art portfolio) question.,"okay so I’m a prospective student who submitted a portfolio and application to Stanford REA (due the fifteenth) late.  I have never used common app and when I paid for the application fee, I clicked submit and left the rest alone. So...I forgot to confirm all of the legal things towards the end of the common app (I didn’t think twice and left it alone...but that’s only because I had to go to the hospital.) We had a major family accident and I’ve been in the ER since Tuesday afternoon. Things are not well atm. 


 Yesterday night I realized that Slideroom gave me a 24 hour grace period——so I proceeded to submit my entire application LATE (around 9pm yesterday night.)


Now I don’t know what to do.

Is Stanford going to read my application? Or throw me in the pool with RD applicants? I’m not sure if anyone knows:(

REA means a lot to me because I’d like to know if I was denied/accepted early. this is really upsetting to me and i take full responsibility for the late application. stanford is my dream school and i believe I ruined all of my chances for admission.

Advice on Avoiding Bike Flat Tires?,"For a whole year I never had a flat tire, until I realized I wasn't properly pumping up my tires and that this caused my rear tire to fail. I got the tire replaced, and two days later it got punctured by a thorn and deflated.

I noticed that in some locations, everyone's bike tires appear to be flat, as if so many parked bikes are just abandoned or there are thorns all over every parking area. I want to minimize the amount of money I spend on new tires. This may seem like a dumb question , but what am I doing wrong? Perhaps my first bike tires were more thorn-resistant than the new ones, and if so, any recommendations on what kind of tires to get?",1571158420,6,0

Masters Degree in Computer Science (MSCS) Application Question - Financial Aid question,"Hey everyone! I'm currently applying to Stanford's Masters in CS program. On the official Stanford webpage, they state: ""The Computer Science Department does not offer financial support for MS students"". However, on the same webpage, they also state that limited CA/RA resources (tuition + stipend funding) are sometimes available to Master's students once matriculated.

On the application website, it asks the following required question:

""Are you applying for financial aid such as fellowships or assistantships from Stanford University (e.g., Departmental funding)? - Yes/No""

I'm not sure which one to pick right now. The reason being that I think picking ""Yes"" will significantly hurt my chances in admissions, since Stanford clearly states not to expect funding for MS students. However, I'm planning on working hard if I get in and secure CA/RA funding. If I check ""No"" on the app, I'm worried that I will be barred from ever applying for CA/RA funding, since the department can point to my application and say ""look here, you clearly said you're not applying for financial aid"".

What do you think? Am I overthinking this? Will checking Yes have a detrimental impact on my application? Thanks in advance!

"Stanford's dining halls, ranked","I want to preface this post by saying that I know my opinions are **widely held** throughout the Stanford community, I just wanted to create a post that would help visitors and ProFros know what the best options are for food on campus!

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Arrillaga**: the food here is sooo good! The chicken is nice and juicy, the building is so large, and the staff are so friendly. The attribute that puts Arrillaga over the top is their garden, which grows all the food served in the dining hall. It is huge and you won't have any trouble finding a seat. 10/10
2. **FloMo**: I love the view in this dining hall and the fact that the name is an abbreviation is so cool! I haven't tried the food yet, but the ice cream is really good (doesn't compare to Arrillaga though). Also, say hi to John on the cooking staff while you're there. 10/10
3. **Lakeside**: I have some friends in Roble (best dorm!) and stopped by to check out the dining hall nearby. The dining room feels like a conference hall, the tables are pentagons and the chairs are nice and sturdy. I will say that the drink serving section allows people to walk up and steal, which is a terrible design choice. Still check it out! 9/10
4. **Ricker**: The food was stupendous but it's lower on this list because it's kind of far away from all my classes and it's inconvenient for my schedule. 6/10
5. **Wilbur:** It's literally a 2 minute walk from my dorm, the food is pretty great, and the staff is pretty friendly. However, the smoothies are not a regular occurrence and the soft-serve machine seems to be broken all the time. 5/10
6. **Casper**: Very close to Wilbur, and the quad is pretty nice. I will say one thing though, it's full of athletes, and as a 5'3 115 pound man, they make me feel inferior. Stay far away from this dining hall if you're an average sized human and want to feel that way at Stanford. 4/10
7. **Stern**: This dining hall deserves a special place in hell. Coming from a place with very authentic Mexican food and a large Mexican-American population (New Hampshire), the burrito bowl experience was terrible. They didn't speak to me in Spanish and it doesn't taste as good as the family-owned Taco Bell in my hometown. Eat here at your own risk. 2/10",1570505388,0,0

The Stanford band made me cringe today.,"I haven't been to a game since 2007. Today I went to the game against Arizona. Before the game started and during the half time, the band was on the field. Honestly, it was a weird experience. During their whole time on the field, they gave pseudo-moralistic, and ""I am very smart"" lectures to the audience. They gave a lecture on how bad the baby boomers were and how bad corporations are. I wasn't expecting that at a football game... by the band. It was one of the most gringy things I experienced in public. 

Is this normal for the band now?",1572139450,4,0

Stanford Debt Worth?,"Hi,

I am a prospective senior applicant for Stanford undergrad 2024(my dream school). I was wondering if Stanford full price is worth it as my parents did not qualify for much financial aid(income \~ 240k) through FAFSA and they have just bought a new house, which meant taking a pretty hefty loan while paying for our last home(trying to sell). If I attend Stanford, I hope to chase and squeeze every opportunity, internship, connections to VCs in Bay Area/amazing funding opportunities/networking connections, and immerse myself within the start-up culture and create 2-3 companies(have ideas already in mind), which is why it is my dream school.  My plan is to double major in bioengineering and MSE and I believe I have the caliber to achieve these things based on my unique track record in high school and work ethic(all by myself and through persistence: started profitable company in high school, won international competitions, was top 2% in competitive high school in Texas, did 5 internships etc.). My question is: Stanford is going to be around 250k-300k in loans which I believe I will have to mostly pay(along with some parent contribution) but based on my description, goals, and ambitious nature can it be a good idea to go if I get in. While there are other options/schools out there without the need for such a big loan,  I know that by going to Stanford I will be able to fast-track the ability to achieve my dreams and have the connections to the bay area/funding/ and world-class professors in front of me. Has anyone else been through the same situation(taking large loans) and attended Stanford?

Thanks",1571584546,0,0
