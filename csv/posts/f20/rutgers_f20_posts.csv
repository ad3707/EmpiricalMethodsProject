Organic Chemistry I Grade ?,"I'm so confused about where i stand in the course. We received the following notice from the first exam:

""The median (the point at which half score above and half below) was 55%.  This point can be considered to be a grade of C+.  Although the curve will not be set until the end of the semester, those seeking an A in this course, can consider themselves to have a definite A if they scored 80% or above.""

Exam 2 was the exact same average apparently.

I scored just above a median for all three exams, a 59%. Am I failing the course? I'm so confused and worried. I have a 4.0 in the STEM classes but this class is killing me. I wanted to pull off a B in this course. I feel like this semester the teaching has been horrible. Honestly, I think if it were taught better, I would be doing better. Anyway, does anyone have any knowledge of how the final grading works. If I scored around a C+/B- for each exam, can I assume my grade is this thus far? And how much can I count on the final pulling me up? Is it easier or harder?",1607289592,1,0

Chances of me getting accepted as a transfer student?,"about to complete two years and finish sophomore year of william paterson university.

My high school GPA was about 2.7, and i didn’t do too hot on the SAT with a score of 1000. 

My college GPA however is currently sitting at 3.45, with very few classes chosen as a pass fail option instead of letter grade during the covid times.

If you're planning on taking calc 135,If you plan on taking Calc 135 take it with Dr. G because otherwise you'll be doing double the work if you decide to go to your own class lectures and watch his videos (watching his videos will help you pass the exams). I honestly wish I had taken calc with Dr. G this semester because I would be able to just go to his lecture with no need to watch all his lecture videos and if I needed any more resources I would have more time seek those resources. Instead now I go to my class lectures on top of also watching his videos and still am kind of struggling. So if you can definitely take Calc with Dr. G he is the best option.,1607228324,1,0

I NEED ADVICE ABOUT RETAKING CALC A THIRD TIME,"So this is gonna be long, I have a lot of questions. I really need your help guys T.T

I'm a sophomore and an intended Genetics Major (I NEED this to declare Genetics as my major). I have come across a problem with one of my classes, calculus, and have some questions I'm hoping you can answer. I've essentially failed the class twice, and I'm considering taking it a third time. The questions below are those I have of the process:

1. If I take calculus a third time will that grade average in with the grade of the second time I took it? If so, what will be my grade if I get a C in calculus the third time?
2. If I take calculus at Newark a third time, do I need to do the credit transfer paperwork? Do I still need to get permission from the calc department?
3. If I withdraw from calculus will it count against the number of times I can take it? In other words, if I withdraw the third time will I still be able to take calculus for a fourth time?
4. Is there a limit to how many times I can retake calculus?
5. Is it possible to remove the F from my transcript?
6. If I pass/ no pass the second time I took calc and I take calc a third time and get an A, will it avg against me?
7. If I take calculus a third time, will it still count towards my major? I need this to declare my major and to graduate
8. Are there any other options for me? May I get grade forgiveness or something similar?",1607224584,1,0

I'm about to graduate and I didn't exactly have the best track record with the girls I got with or talked to, but I kept getting better and now I know what to do.

Now I know how to navigate relationships and I learned that a person's worth isn't really measured by how many people he can get away with being an ass to. (Some of ya'll need to learn that btdubs, looking at you Swiss. You know who you are.) 

I'm also glad that girls don't get bad vibes from me anymore. It's not like everyone is swiping right on me now, I'm not there yet.

Quick Question about Expository Writing,"So I made the mistake of deciding to take Rutgers Expository Writing in my HS even though I'm not sure whether I'm going to attend Rutgers or not. I asked my teacher a bunch of questions on Friday because she said she wouldn't respond over the weekend, but she didn't respond yesterday either and I'm freaking out a little.

So my question is: how does the page requirement for essays work? The instructions say 4 pages for the rough draft and 5 pages for the final. So if let's say I end up having 5 pages by the end of the rough draft, is that against the rules because I went over the requirement?

Sorry if this is actually a thing specific to my school but the instructions seemed to be from Rutgers itself",1604159420,1,0

Can anyone else relate? What can I do?,"So staying at home has been really affecting my mental health because my dad is extremely toxic. He has serious anger issues, a big ego, and feels as if he should have the most respect. My mom and brother both fear him and we feel as if we are helpless because without him, we are financially unstable. Everyone in my family just follows what he says because they fear him, but I’m very tired of this. I study hard in my room all day and don’t go out, but to him he thinks I’m just ignoring him. He expects everyone to come to him and talk to him, but there’s only so much fake conversion I can make when I hate him so much. I constantly feel this pressure that I am always doing something wrong because he constantly yells at me. Me and my brother hide in our rooms and don’t eat until he falls asleep. I rarely see friends, but when I do, I only go out for a few hours to grab coffee or something like every other week. I feel very trapped in this household because I am yelled at when I go out and when I am inside. I cannot go against his rules or go out because he would say that I am not contributing to this house financially. He also believes that since he is my father that I just automatically have to follow what he says. It’s his way or I can be kicked out. I live in a very rural area and don’t have a car so I can’t find work nearby to save up for a car. If I can’t find work nearby, how will I be able to leave this house?

DON'T VOTE IN PERSON IN NEW JERSEY,"It's come to my attention that some may not be aware of this - you CANNOT vote in person using voting machines in New Jersey!! If you go to the polls on election day, you will not be able to vote in person, and will instead be given a provisional ballot to fill out on the spot. These provisional ballots WILL NOT be counted until at least Nov 10th, because they must be cross-checked with all mailed in ballots to ensure no vote is counted twice. So please if you haven't already, fill out the official ballot that was automatically mailed to every registered voter and DROP IT OFF at a secure ballot box (if you send it in the mail, it will likely not be counted before election day). If you still want the ""election day experience"" you can drop off your ballot on election day, but it must be the official one you were mailed, but like pls just drop it off asap. [Click here](https://nj.gov/state/elections/vote-secure-drop-boxes.shtml) to find a secure ballot drop off box near you.

On the application, there's a section talking about what Schools you'd be interested in. In my case, there are two. The first option I put was the School of Arts and Sciences because I want to major in CS. I would also like to apply to the School of Communication and Information because I've found there are courses involving Video Game Production and Design. However, it won't let me select the School of Communication and Information as an option. I thought this might be because the ITI major has requirements that involve already completing courses in Rutgers, but is that the case for the whole school?

Gen chem 161 is so unfair this semester.,"It's so annoying how people are asking what unfair. about the Gen chem exams LIKE WHAT. I look at the past exams and i could easily get a 00 on every single one with no issue. Where being given 90 min late at night to take an ALL OPEN ENDED exam with no opportunity to show or get credit for our work. The problems are 100x harder than any we've seen in class before. I spent 2 weeks studying for hours every day, doing every textbook problem, every TI review session, going to tutoring, attending every lecture and recitation etc. I must've had over 200 problems done b the time the test came and i got a 24%. that so ridiculous. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im tired of people saying well Gen chem made me realize i shouldn't go pre med and you have to realize that things change. like thats not the issue. i love chemistry, i understand chemistry, but the exams are screwing everyone over and its completely unfair. its not even about elearning or the technical issues its about being given a fair exam.

Chem 161 Exam II Technical Issues?,"Did anyone else get completely screwed over by the technical issues on eLearning with this exam?  The exam was supposed to start at 9:25 and finish either 90 minutes later or at 11pm whichever came first.  However this was not the case as the exam was opened at 9:00 leaving me confused as to whether I should wait or just start it.  I decided to wait and at 9:25 I tried to join the test and was greeted with a waiting screen for over 10+ minutes until I could even look at my test.  Now already down time, I started the test and more technical issues ensued.  Everytime I typed an answer it would say saved in the bottom right, but when I submitted my exam, the answers were cut off at the decimals and half of the answer did not save.  For example 41.3 was cut off at 41. and the question was marked incorrect.  At 10:30 it then decided to promptly kick me out of my exam and force me to wait another 10+ minutes in order to get back in.  I have submitted a technical support ticket, but I'm not sure how the Chemistry Department is going to deal with this and it's just adding to the overwhelming amount of stress already.

How important is prestige anyway?,"Hi! I’ve kind of been stressing out a lot with school. My grades are amazing, and I’m not doing bad at all that way. Most of my stress comes from extracurriculars and leadership positions in them. The thing is, they’re mainly just popularity contests, so with some clubs, I have no chance of winning even if I like the club. I know extracurriculars are very important with college admissions, but I can only get a few leadership positions if I really try. So, I was just thinking, how much does it really matter where I go to college anyway? Initially I was aiming for the top colleges, but would it really matter if I relaxed a bit and went to Rutgers? I know Rutgers is great, but obviously it’s not as prestigious as other colleges. I’m just worried because my school is pretty competitive, and they usually send a good amount of kids to the ivies. I’m sorry if this seemed really snobby, I promise I didn’t mean it in any offensive way. I’m just really stressed out and I don’t know what to do :(

Well 20.5 x 4 semesters + 22 = 102, I am short 18 credits.

Right now I am doing Calc 2, but lets say if I took like Alg 1, PreCalc, Calc 1 at my local community college, brookdale since they would be easy and I could fly through it without any work, would that count as elective credits, even though I already did Calc 2, would rutgers accept them to knock off 9-10 of those 18 credits I fall short on.

Biotech Major is Great IMO,"A day ago I ranted about the way my orgo class was run, and I'm still angry about that, but I wanted to clear up other teachers names. 

A lot of teachers are trying, and I'm aware of it. Being a Biotech major over the past year and a half I've been at Rutgers, has shown me the instructors in this major are very cool. It may be because it's a a smaller major with no defined department of it's own but the professors are very laid back and willing to answer any questions. They will even go out of their way to help you get contacts for certain classes. 

I don't know how other departments are, but if you're still unsure of your major, I'd consider Biotech. It's a growing field so I wouldn't be too afraid job security wise but do your research if you're worried. This is mainly if you find the idea appealing, it's a lot of lab work, but there is a major thats for policy, being that many businesses are popping up for it and governments are unknowledgable of it. 

Once again, it may not be in your wheel house and it's not necessarily easy, but if you are in STEM and you feel a disconnect from professors, it's worth exploring.",1600894833,1,0

"Rutgers' satirical newspaper, the Medium, posts this article and removes it within two hours","I got this because I'm subscribed to their newsletter.  Pasted directly from the email they sent me:

&gt;[Dr. G, aka Midtek, Admits to “Sustaining” Himself On Fucking Over Students](https://rutgersthemedium.wordpress.com/2020/09/22/dr-g-aka-midtek-admits-to-sustaining-himself-on-fucking-over-students/)  
by [RutgersTheMedium](https://rutgersthemedium.wordpress.com/author/themediumbeards/)  
by Harry Nuttsaac  
Right   off the bat, I would like to clarify that this article is not  fictional  or satirical in any way, it is entirely true and still  fucking  hilarious. The Medium posted on Reddit to [r/rutgers](https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/)  early Tuesday  afternoon to request help with a buoyancy textbook  problem (check the A7  page to learn more) when, all of a sudden, in  swoops none other than  massive prick and professional douche canoe Dr.  Joseph Guadagni, aka Dr.  G, aka Midtek. For those who are unfamiliar  with him, last semester  (you know, during a global pandemic) he created  a Chegg account to give  students fake answers to an actual test of  his. While he claims he was  just catching kids who would've cheated  anyway, we believe this kinda  counts as luring students into cheating.  
On   our Reddit post (where we ask if God is responsible for buoyancy force   and we need an answer in 30 minutes), Dr. G wrote ""We don't do your   homework for you here. Especially not questions where you don't show us   your work and just declare 'HELP ME PLEASE DUE IN 30 MINUTES.' This is   also an exam question."" Despite how stupid this fucking response is, he   does apparently have an actual doctorate. Guess he never had any  classes  on satire.   
One  Redditor  decided to take the high road and calmly explain that this is  from The  Medium and that we are ""mocking students who do such things,""  (he'd be  wrong, we genuinely needed to know). We, however, decided to be  a  little cruder than that: ""Wow, Dr. G just fucking lives to be a prick   on Reddit, huh."" Any normal person would admit their mistake and try to   avoid talking about it more. Not Dr. G, no, this guy just wants to be   an asshole. Dr. G came back with ""Yes, my comment fucked several lives.   That's how I sustain myself. Put that in your next article."" I don't   know about you, but I'm pretty sure professors aren't allowed to enjoy   fucking over students, but I might be wrong. Honestly, I have no clue   how this comment doesn't get a professor fired, but we'll see. Oops, I   accidentally dropped this link to a petition to have him removed, clumsy   me: [https://www.change.org/p/robert-barchi-have-dr-joseph-guadagni-removed-or-censored?signed=true](https://www.change.org/p/robert-barchi-have-dr-joseph-guadagni-removed-or-censored?signed=true).

Why do some professors think it's okay to belittle and be unnecessarily rude to students?,"I had a situation with submitting an assignment on Canvas. On my end, the assignment said it was submitted yet when I checked my grade last week, it was a zero. I emailed my professor asking as to why I received a zero because it literally said my assignment was submitted. My professor responded to the email saying how I'm not an exception because of technical errors and that I should refer to the syllabus about this. Furthermore, the professor talked about how at the end of the course if the points make a difference between a grade then she'll give me the points back but until then I should work hard and on time to make up for those points. She also said that I should double check to make sure my assignment was submitted. I had a problem like this last year where I accidentally uploaded the wrong document so now I make sure I submit my assignments correctly every time and this assignment was no exception. I was literally in shock that this professor was not only indirectly insulting my work ethic but just how rude this professor was being when all I did was ask why I received a zero. I responded to the email with the confirmation email I was sent about my assignment being submitted and I added if she could check if this was a technical error that was not caused by me. I also said if they could check because this was an assignment I put time and effort into. The professor responded again in an insulting manner but not in a way I ever experienced before. To say the least, the email was SARCASTIC ASF. She mocked me by saying my assignment was excellent and how now she would have to look into the technical error but its not my problem. She was basically trying to be like why tf did this only happen now to you but it's literally not my fault. She also said how I provided a sufficient amount of evidence and then ended the email with a ""congratulations."" The professor ended up giving me my points back but I never received an apology for the initial rude email and was just belittled again for no reason. If I received the points back, that means it was a technical error on their part because when I clicked on the confirmation link, it said that my assignment is up on Canvas. I'm just super frustrated that I have to basically deal with it. It's literally not fair when I did NOTHING WRONG yet I am being spoken to like I'm some stupid child who doesn't know shit. Like if you don't like talking to people/students, why the heck did you become a professor? I'm also a little scared that the professor might grade my future assignments unfairly because she's made it more than clear that she does NOT like me which I dont really care about but I care id my grade might potentially be at stake.",1600834301,1,0

They eat, breathe, live, shit premed all day every day. Everything they do is for med school, for resume. I swear every premed student I have met is the same! Rude, obnoxious, thinking they're better than the rest, or just way too arrogant. Don't get me wrong if you want to be a doctor then by all means go head, I applaud you but is it really necessary to keep up this image every single time?

They're robots that don't care about who they fuck over or use during their journey to becoming a doctor.

How to dispute a grade from a professor that doesn't answer emails?,"I'm taking Operations Management, and my professor has not answered a single email I've sent him this semester. He didn't answer when I asked how to prepare for the exam, didn't answer my question during the exam to clarify what he was asking in one problem, and now isn't answering my request to go over the exam to find out what I got wrong. I didn't do nearly as well as I expected to,  but I know most of my answers are correct as two of them were problems we did in class and all the numerical problems I just checked over with a tutor. Even if I got all the non-numerical parts wrong - with no partial credit, it still wouldn't equate to what I got.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Online is difficult enough, its not fair to not clarify what youre looking for and then not clarify what I got wrong either. Does anyone know what I could do in this situation? If all my answers are correct and he refuses to give me an answer to why I did poorly, does anyone know who I can dispute my grade with? Thanks.",1603050833,1,0

In March, I made an effort to video call my friends as much as possible. Some of my friends created Discords so we could play Minecraft, Jackbox, Among Us, etc. It's been great having a way to connect, but sometimes I feel like it's not enough.

For the last 6 months, I faced some of the biggest motivation drops in my life, even though this is the most important time for me academically because I am applying to professional schools next year. I know I’m not alone in this, I know how bad it is between professors being unreasonable, home situations that make it unbearable to study, or just the feeling of being shut inside like never before. 

I just wanted to post this to say to everyone- hang in there, try to sleep early and wake up early, make yourself a routine. This is the only thing that has been keeping my motivation slightly higher for the last few weeks. Whatever you are going through because of this virus, I hope it will turn around soon, and that we will all learn to adjust the best way we can in case spring is online.

Why is Death &amp; Afterlife harder than Orgo 1? : A Mental Health Nosedive,"This class is draining my mental resources; I'm only taking 4 courses this semester and it's easily the hardest. I'd say I'm a pretty good writer and got an A in honors expos, but this class's busywork is ridiculous and grading criteria is flimsy. It was supposed to be an easy A, but I'm literally toiling. Every single type of assignment was made to be worth 10%, so it's even more difficult because there's no such thing as ""100 for completion"" in this class, everything is scrutinized and picked apart yet the only reason given is ""you just didn't do enough to warrant an A"".

Meanwhile, I only got an 82 on my first orgo exam but the studying is nowhere near as painful and I actually find myself surprisingly enjoying the class despite its difficulty. 

So basically trying to get all As for medical school is exhausting and I was wondering if anyone else is in the same boat

I don’t really vibe with the way either of my professors teach so I’m teaching myself basically everything. I’m just tired of knowing I have no idea what my exams are going to be like because they’re nothing like the homework. I love math but my classes really take the joy out of it for me and I feel like I have to study an insane amount on top of my job to get grades decent enough that I’ll be able to go to grad school for something I love. I was hoping if anyone could tell me if it gets better after 252 or if this is just what I have to look forward to the next 2 years. I’m doing slightly under average in both classes and I feel like if it wasn’t for online class it wouldn’t be this way. I am starting to feel too stupid for the career I want.

Federal loans are not even enough to make the remainder costs affordable, and private loans charge extra interest along with a great credit score. We’re low-income individuals for a reason, and is asking for an affordable education too much?

The Despicable Practices of the BN Bookstore,"I'm incredibly pissed so I'm going to put a rant here. Against both my and my professor's consent, everyone in our course was signed up for the bookstore's so called ""First Day"" services which charges each student $45 and gives them access to a digital textbook. I personally opted out of this service (I was charged without even having access for it!) and told my professor what was going on. He then asked students to email him to be put on a list to get opted out, which I did not do because my problem was already solved. HOWEVER, I was automatically opted back in and charged again WITHOUT MY CONSENT and I did not realize until the day of the deadline to opt out. By the way, I don't think anyone even has access to this textbook because of the terrible integration. I emailed and begged to be opted out again because of this horrible practice, and then I sent SIX MORE EMAILS and have gotten NO RESPONSE. Supposedly the only person in the whole world who can opt me out is on a week long vacation this week (convenient) and although she has a new email she is supposedly checking I have not heard back at all. And now the kicker is this stupid charge is putting a financial hold on my account so I may not even be able to register for classes. I am so incredibly pissed at the piss poor ""service"" of this BN bookstore and I am honestly disgusted that Rutgers does business with them.",1602017578,1,0

Did an anonymous mental health survey on university students and...,"I'm doing a research paper about mental health in University students, specifically on rates of depression and suicide. Having suffered from these myself, this paper hits close to home for me. 

After making a survey and getting over 25+ responses in the past hour or so, I can't help but feel upset about what I'm seeing. I expected the responses to be negative, but they're so overwhelming. Only around .08% of students reported not feeling symptoms of depression. 18% felt or do feel suicidal. Everyone feels alone, not one responder hasn't struggled with mental health.

I still think this is an 'unseen' issue. It hurts my heart to the core and I wish I could do something about it besides just writing an essay, yanno? There are the little things, yeah. Sometimes a smile, a little study help, or a pat on the shoulder to reassure your friend can go a long way. But I kinda just wish there was more for us, I guess.

Hi guys - back in July, I posted a survey about the coronavirus on various college subs. I got almost 500 responses and recently wrote an article summarizing the findings. There were so many excellent responses it was hard to pick which ones to highlight, but I tried my best to capture the trends I observed. Since a good chunk of the responses came from students in this sub, I thought I’d make an update post (all in all, I’d say about 25 universities had high levels of representation in the survey, so I’ll be making update posts in those particular subs).  

Thanks so much to the people in this sub who participated! This wouldn’t have been possible without the help of student redditors. If any of you have questions, feel free to PM me.

Started a new journey after graduating!,"So I graduated from Rutgers this past may with a psychology degree and I decided to apply it in the form of service! I created a YouTube channel  to help guide people in their 20s in the right direction by showing a refreshing perspective to navigating life. Although I'm just like any ordinary graduate at this point I feel I am at least equipped to guide people through the experiences that I have successfully conquered. I am also now pursuing a graduate degree in Clinical Counseling so making videos on common mental health topics has become a passion of mine.

As a Rutgers alumni, I hope I can help at least a handful of the current Rutgers students! If you are open to joining the community I'm cultivating, please do subscribe!

Rutgers to slash funding to SAS and the English department in particular. Not even using its emergency funds given to them by the state.,"So at the beginning of class today, my English professor (Who I will not name out of respect for him and so he doesn't get in trouble) informed us of some developments he just learned via an email he received from the Rutgers union. Basically, Rutgers is looking to cut funding to all humanities related departments. The Writing Center and the Writers at Rutgers program will both face a huge cut in funding. In addition to this, Rutgers will not be hiring any adjuncts for any English related departments for the foreseeable future. 

The fucked up part about this is Rutgers isn't even bleeding money. They still have the emergency money given to them by the NJ government. This is just an excuse to gut the English department because of how cheap Zoom University is compared to having actual classes. So if you're an incoming freshman or transfer interested in English or Creative Writing, go look for a university that actually treats you with a modicum of respect.",1601927700,1,0

I hate Math 135,"I took Calc in high school and I understood it completely. Everything we learn in lectures is stuff I already know and understand. 

I got a 96 on the RU Ready Test and I barely studied for that. I take this midterm and it is NOTHING compared to what we learned in class. 

I get that no Proctortrack means cheating can be worse but from what I am seeing its not. Proctortrack or not, everyone is leaving Group Me chats at the beginning of tests and rejoining after the submission time ends. 

It's college, I am not thinking about cheating or am gonna take the chance. But I hate that because of an application we have no control over, our tests are so ridiculously hard. It's already bad enough having freshman year online. I can barely keep track of anything and I don't even get how half of these websites we use work. There's no one to ask because making friends is so hard online and it's all just becoming so unfair. 

Everyone was so happy about Proctortrack being gone but now all of our grades are in trouble because these tests are nothing compared to what we learn in class. My professor didn't even teach us some of the concepts on the test. It's just not fair. I get that college means material isn't going to be spoon fed to us like high school, but I did every learning resource provided on all 135 websites and in the textbook. I spent all my weekend and all of Monday studying for this midterm and I treated the midterm just as I would if Proctortrack were there. I put my phone away and the only thing I used was my notes. But how does it matter, I am failing the tests either way. 

If the goal is to make the test hard enough so we can't cheat, there is no point of that. Most people weren't cheating anyways because it is college and no one I know wants to take that risk. Im just upset because this year is already bad enough being a freshman and not having any help because we are online. We basically have to figure out everything ourselves. 

I am being completely honest with what I am doing. I pay attention in every lecture, take notes. I watch all of Dr. G's YouTube Videos, I do the worksheets provided for each lesson on his website, and I do the practice exams. I also redo homework assignments and look at the textbook. I easily am able to do all of these and its not a problem for me. I am not really sure what else to do. I am doing so terribly when I am doing every resource offered in the class. I don't know what else to do and I am on track to end the class with a D right now. 

And some people might suggest that I drop to Calc 123, but I really don't get it. I already took College Calculus in high school. I know it's not going to be the same but I know that if my teacher even went over for 5 minutes the concepts on the midterm I would be able to understand it. I can't study for something if I don't know I need to be studying it. 

Is anyone in 135 having a similar experience right now? I don't want to drop either because I know I know this subject well.",1601909746,1,0

3 Ws in total since freshman yr and thinking bout getting another. Right now a junior. What is college really at this point?,"I had 3 Ws before I began the semester and two of them were last semester because covid took me out and i was taking 20.5 creds when the whole thing started. I thought I would be able to pull if back together. Most of my classes this semester I have been doing fine in but I have stopped caring. I domt care about my grades or my life or ANYTHING. Wtf are we here for? Everything is going to end and I have to sit and study all day. Im trying not to drown but i am barely stating afloat. Withdrawing one class may help me just breathe; sure im not doing completely ass in the class but I don't care about anything ai learn about. I sit through class completely apathetic and disgusted by my lack of care. Its a major class and I am supposed to be interested but i hate sitting through it.

Otherwise my other option is to not do any of the remaining work and earn a F or a D in order to retake the course and have it replace the grade. But that also does not leave me the option of not taking the course again and it affecting my GPA even worse. So this is not the most ideal option.",1606186758,1,0

I drank this at 3:20 noon, my doctor said before 4 no coffee. 

My body would not let me sleep last night.

It was literally endless limbo torture.

I was stuck in this perpetual mode of shivering, being too hot, itching, needing to fart every 20 seconds because of my high protein diet and needing to rest my eyes but NOT falling asleep. 

This happened last monday too.

This happens when I drink the following after 4:00 and now 3:00 as I discovered YESTERDAY.

Coffee.

Energy Drinks.

Bulking protein. 

FINE, so I stopped drinking that shit after 3:00 or 4:00 but sometimes my body is just like : ""You little shit, you want to sleep don't you? Well not on MY watch NIGGA."" and I just lie awake. 

I bought some Nyquil today because I today is one of my Modafinil cycle days and that shit gives me insomnia.

When I say weird and unfair I mean that the professor does not explain any of the assignments and doesn't lecture. The feedback they provide for grading is not on the rubric that they post afterwards. Additionally, they do not respond to emails at all.",1606173462,1,0
I wrote a book after graduating!,"I recently graduated from Rutgers in May 2020 and during the quarantine/lockdown period I have been working on a non-fiction book titled Anxiously Thriving! My book is about social anxiety disorder and how it impacts the lives of teenagers &amp; young adults and how they thrive despite it. There are insights from many therapists and counselors that I interviewed!

When I first started school at Rutgers, I would not speak up in class despite knowing the answer. I couldn’t even place an order at a restaurant or the dining halls. It was isolating to have social anxiety disorder and nobody to talk to. Since then, I have taught a one-credit class at Rutgers and also gave a TED-styled talk about mental health in front of hundreds of people at Mark Conference (hosted by Leadership &amp; Experiential Learning at Rutgers).  

I’m passionate about spreading mental health awareness, especially in South Asian communities. As a Rutgers alumna, I hope I can provide support to current Rutgers students who are going through the same struggles I went through. 

My book is now available for pre-order! It would mean the world to me if you could check out my pre-sale campaign and contribute or help spread the word by sharing the campaign. I will only be able to publish my book if I reach my campaign goal. Here’s the link for pre-order: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/anxiously-thriving-by-shubhechha-dhar#/

I’m not exactly sure what this post is other than a rant, but I’d really appreciate any success stories from people who bombed their freshman year. Or advice on how to motivate myself enough to get As in a virtual setting.

Nobody debates with him or anything, but there’s one kid in the chat who just agrees with him a lot and they share their dumb conspiracies for a little bit at the start of class.

Thanksgiving is right around the corner, and if you are lucky enough to spend the holiday with a full platter of turkey, stuffing, pumpkin pie, dim sum (if you're like my family), etc, I would definitely consider donating to food banks in New Jersey/wherever you are located if possible.

Need help for my resume for anyone that’s in comp sci or ITI,"Im trying to add projects for my resume but Im trying to figure out what can I potentially add to it and if I would have to explain in great detail for interviews. 

I was going to list a project I did over a year ago where I had two computers that both had virtual machines. The virtual machines had a server with an active directory and domain installed, also had a virtual computer that acted as a router and had a “host”. It was essentially able to ping from the first host from computer one to the host in computer two. All parts of it had configured network settings using the Virtual box’s NAT settings and IPv4 for each “computer”. 

In terms of explanations, that’s as detailed as I can get. Would this explanation be efficient enough for an interview because I honestly don’t remember in detail what happened.

Like lets say I got credit for Calc 1, 2, Physics, Expos, Chem, History, Environmental Science.  So they all together, they are around 25-30 credits and they fulfill my SAS cores and major requirements for Computer Science (BS).

Everyone here is so much more competitive and successful than each other.,"I am a normal person and an average student. I am a first-year undecided in the NB school of arts and science. I was rejected from the NB Business School while applying. The people I see that get internships and on-campus jobs through handshake are students who went to Rutgers whilst supported by impressive academic achievement. I see intelligent and hardworking people and while I believe I have a healthy self-esteem with little issues regarding depression/anxiety, I commonly feel out-of-place surrounded by highly functional people.

I was under the impression that Rutgers was a less than competitive institution judging by the acceptance rate, size of the student population, and the ""state-school"" reputation Rutgers has among NJ residents. 

Perhaps it is me, my assumptions, and my lack of due diligence that allowed me to learn this the hard way, but it becomes increasingly clear to me that the university population here are clearly of a higher caliber than I previously believed.

Should I convert one B to P?,"Hi,

I finally received the final grade of the last class, although it’s not on my transcript yet (it’s on Sakai). 

My grades are as follows:

* A (major)
* A (1 credit)
* B+ (minor/SAS)
* B (4 credits, minor/SAS)
* B (major elective)
* C+ (minor class/SAS)

I will definitely convert that C+ to P. Just having 1 P makes my cumulative GPA decrease by 0.01 points, and converting the B of the major elective to P increases my cumulative GPA by 0.01 points.

Should I prioritize my GPA increase or would it be better to have as less P’s as possible? (I’m not planning to go to grad school or further)",1609249290,1,0

It was December 2013 and I was hard at work on cramming my Comp Arch (or was it Systems?) final in C.

There were a handful of undergrad students in there, but one among us was a young man taking phone calls about graphics cards for a mining rig he was setting up. This sparked a discussion about cryptocurrency where he explained he was hard at work mining large quantities of something called a Dogecoin. 

We skeptically discussed how lucrative the endeavor might be and questioned the liquidity of the meme-based coin considering how worthless these coins were at the time. He insisted it was a winning play, and so we finished our lunches and got back to work.

Ever since then, each passing year, I have thought about this guy and wondered how it all turned out.

Are you out there, Dogecoin miner? Did it all pay off? I hope so - but I gotta know!",1609178825,1,0
