"Hey eveyeone, I have a few questions/comments about wanting to transfer.","I'm currently a freshman at Rutgers and honestly I don't like it so much. Even though online, I've been to Rutgers for different events, the orientation, competitions, and I never found myself to like it. On top of that, I'm not ""vibing"" with the professors and the staff and community, and from everything I'm reading, Northeastern seems a better option. Given that...
I probably will have anywhere from a 3.6 to a 4 gpa come end of the semester. If I'm fortunate enough, have one class, or two, as a pass, and out of those 2, there's a small and unfortunate chance I have to No credit one of them(Multivarible calculus) (the other one is just so the gpa looks better ). Other classes looking like all A, and maybe one B+
I was in a few clubs, but they all were directed mainly towards upper class men because of the opportunities they needed since it is harder now due to covid. I had an internship over the 2020 summer, doing some research for a small company trying to help and figure out how to work on poverty issues. And another one (kind of a mindless one tbh) that was about mental health. 
I had a 1450 SAT, High school GPA was about a 3.42, and weighed about a 4. 
What seems to be my chances of getting in. I love the Boston area given the few times I went, and would love to get in.

Anyone Know How College Copyright Works? Redbubble edition,"I noticed that there was no ""Protect the Pack"" merch in the northeastern bookstore and decided to make my own for fun. I uploaded it to redbubble so I could by a T-shirt of it and maybe sell it.

While I know my design was referring to northeastern and contained the words ""protect the pack"" (which is not trademarked and is actually a slogan for a few schools right now), it still feels a little weird that I got struck down immediately when there are actual copy and paste clones of northeastern merchandise being sold on the site right now. Anyone have any insight as to what this means, what I might be able to do, or any general thoughts on the matter? Thanks

Packing for Isolation Housing: What would you bring?,"For anyone here who did not attend public school in the United States as a 6-11 y/o child, here's some backstory:

Every year, in the weeks leading up to thanksgiving break, we did all sorts of fall-holiday themed activities. We learned how to draw turkeys by tracing our hands on construction paper, how to stick googly eyes on pumpkins (carving is dangerous), and how to systematically wipe out an entire race of people. My favorite part were the little feather hats. 

Anyways, I remember a particular activity which I think might be of some use to us today. One year, they gave each of us a pillowcase to take home, and we were tasked to fill it with all of the things that we would take with us as we voyaged across the atlantic to escape religious persecution. Most kids packed their favorite toys, a pair of pajamas, etc. It was cute. There was one kid who straight up just put a pillow in his pillow case. The whole point was that we were fucking clueless kids who had never experienced any meaningful hardship and that we would certainly starve and die before reaching our new homes in America. 

Why am I telling you this? Because we're all going to get covid eventually, and I think that it's a good idea to prepare by keeping a bag packed and ready to go with all of your isolation essentials. What would you bring with you to help you get through the worst two weeks of your life? 

You get to pick 10 items. I'll start:

1.) A handle of Graves XXX grain alcohol

2.) A second handle of Graves XXX grain alcohol

3.) Lots of Nyquil

4 through 10.) Yummy snacks",1601578888,1,0

Prospective Student Here!! Lots of Questions!!!,"Hi!

I really want to apply ED to Northeastern to improve my chances of getting in, and I also really like the school, but I have a few concerns... 

FINANCIAL: I'm low-income and I will need a hell of a lot of financial aid if accepted to Northeastern. I'm afraid I won't get enough aid though. How good is their financial aid? Also, is study abroad included in tuition? 

ACADEMIC: I also know that many students at Northeastern are able to use AP credits to get out of taking required courses. I don't have a lot of AP credit. Will I still be able to graduate in four years, do co-op, and maybe do study abroad despite my lack of AP credits? 

SOCIAL: I've seen so much stuff on this subreddit and in my own general research about how difficult it is to make friends at Northeastern. Can someone explain why it is that way? I don't think I get it. Are people just so busy that no one has time to hang out with anyone? Is the workload that difficult?

Will i even get a coop?,"CS major. Applying now, but I realized I‚Äôm pretty below average. I‚Äôve had to work so hard to even get to where I am currently. I‚Äôm not smart, getting a 3.3 GPA was way harder than it was for a fellow CS major friend to get a 3.8. Because of how much time I‚Äôve spent on HW just to be a B student, I really don‚Äôt have any personal projects aside from an unfinished game from HS. I‚Äôve worked a lot, but only fast food and retail type jobs. I volunteered with a prof for research outside my major (just an interest) but was dropped because of corona. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I‚Äôve never been smart, I didn‚Äôt think i‚Äôd get into this school. I‚Äôve been so proud of myself up until now. I have learned so much but i‚Äôve been told by TAs and professors alike that it takes way longer than it should to click. Now it feels like someone will look at my resume and just laugh. I‚Äôm not good on the spot either, i‚Äôm not a people person. I get so anxious around people especially in a setting like that, so I have to be worried about all aspects of any interview I might not even get. 

What do I do? I wouldn‚Äôt hire me. Am i destined to work at Panera my whole life :(",1601512380,1,0

* Since September 30th, we have DOUBLED the number of DMSB jobs
* The job development and co-op search process will not end until January/February
* Students should not be making the decision to delay at this point
* Students will be allowed to accept a co-op into early February without penalty for dropping classes
* Fall 2021 co-op: Postings start going up in January/Uncertainty will remain/No guarantees the fall will be better or different than SP21

Freshman Roommate Advice,"Yo,
I‚Äôm a freshman currently having some issues with my roommate that I‚Äôm not sure can really be solved. He‚Äôs a fine dude but we aren‚Äôt really friends and don‚Äôt talk past simple greetings. Basically I have a normal sleep schedule, go to bed 11-12 and wake up for 8am class. My roommate has a completely fucked sleep schedule, where he will pull all-nighters multiple days a week and then sleep at random intervals during the day. I‚Äôve been able to live around this for the most part, but some nights I just can‚Äôt sleep because his monitor lights up the whole room and I just feel kinda uncomfortable trying to sleep with somebody wide awake playing video games right next to me. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs been a single night where our sleep overlapped for more than 4 hours. Because of his weird sleep pattern and classes being online, he stays in the room all day every day during the week. There‚Äôs almost no time when I can just be in the room alone, and the small moments when I am makes we wish I had a room to myself. Other than that he also leaves several days worth of empty dining hall containers on his bed, which is pretty gross. I get zero of the positives of having a roommate and only negatives.

It‚Äôs frustrating because I feel like none of these issues are drastic enough to warrant a room change if I go to my RA, but there‚Äôs also nothing I could do to fundamentally change my roommate‚Äôs lifestyle. Has anybody here had experience with something like this? Has anybody gone through a room change that could walk through their process? Any other advice?

Best case scenario is that I get to move into a vacant room by myself for the rest of the semester and get a new good roommate in the spring. Worst case scenario would be living like this until May, which I would rather not do if possible.",1602676051,1,0

ADHD HUSKIES ASSEMBLE,"Let's share remote learning things that we're grateful for!

* Going to lecture, sitting through the entire thing, and absorbing nothing HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER!
* For all my homies in async courses: skipping lecture after lecture after lecture HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER! I think it's a magical experience to backread pages and pages of assigned reading/lecture notes whenever I have to start an assignment. 
* Never have DRC accommodations been less useful or less relevant
* Being trapped in my apartment all day makes it super easy to be gripped by feelings of ""What am I doing right now? What SHOULD I be doing? I should be doing something. I'm so lazy and useless."" 
* No irl hangouts? Remote learning allows us ADHD-having Huskies to socialize in our favorite way: by laying in bed on our phones scrolling mindlessly for hours!
* Starting a hobby/project and quickly dropping it HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER!
* I *love* when my senile professors give me my homework feedback in a mangled electronic format. This gives me the opportunity to perform arcane arts in order to understand what the fuck they're trying to tell me. Failing to resubmit homework for a better grade HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER! 
* Online quizzes... TIMED online quizzes?! Pinch me, I must be dreaming!\~
* If you thought it was hard to attend office hours before, it's even harder and more awkward now!
* Whenever my Zoom lecture has really bad connection issues and the professor is talking but every 5 words the audio glitches, and I can crack open that glorious gallery view and see thirty BLANK expressions looking back at me.

Very confused second year student,"Hi everyone,

I am looking for some honest answers here. I am an undergrad currently taking classes remotely from home. I have to make a decision soon about whether or not I should come back to campus for the spring. I am very confused and conflicted, so I would really appreciate your advice. Here is some background that may help:

* I have a safe, healthy, and emotionally supportive home situation, so this is not influencing my decision on whether I should leave home
* I am taking my introduction to coop class in the spring. Does anyone have any opinions on whether it is useful to be on campus for this?
* The classes I am planning on taking some upperish-level bioengineering classes (molecular bioengineering, dynamics and control, and cellular engineering) and DS 3000. Does anyone have any opinions on taking these classes remotely vs in-person? (Also, is this a bad combo of classes lol)
* I currently have guaranteed on-campus housing, but I don't really know anyone I could live with, and tbh I don't know how comfortable I feel about living with someone I don't really know, especially during this pandemic

I would really appreciate some helpful advice. Thanks all!",1602628384,1,0

COVID co-op search making any of my fellow huskies wanna cry?,"because i certainly wanna cry (and cried moments before writing this)

looking for my last co-op right now, WAY less positions posted than usual this year. last year i applied to around 80 co-ops, this year i've only applied to around 30. wages have also gone down, i've noticed that certain companies are paying less than they have previously. i received an offer a few weeks ago and rejected due to low pay, but i regret that more and more everyday

doesn't help that every fucking posting on nuworks would require take a 1.5 hr ride on the commuter rail to get there. had to reject ANOTHER offer because it was over 2 hours away by train and the recruiter could not guarantee that i'd be allowed to be primarily remote. 

i know that this is extreme, but what's even the point of HAVING a co-op program if the majority of the positions are ones that your students will not be able to work? looking at this random page on nuworks right now, the listings offered are (in order):

* in woburn (1+ hr commute from campus) 
* in virginia
* in boston :o
* in new york city
* miscategorized position unrelated to my major
* unspecified location (?) only pays by shitty monthly stipend
* in woburn again
* in boston :o
* looks like working at the 3d printing lab in snell is a listed co-op
* in denver
* four positions in boston that im \[NOT QUALIFIED\] for 
* in danvers (2+ hr commute from campus)

it's absolutely ridiculous. i went to northeastern exclusively for this co-op program and it's caused me nothing but pain

if you comment ""talk to your co-op advisor"" i will kill you",1602622481,1,0
M/F Off-Campus Lease Takeover 3br/1ba 400 Mass Ave. - $1260,"Hello! 

I'm taking a co-op in NYC next semester and am exiting my apartment lease. I'm looking for someone to sign onto the lease with my roommates (one M, one F) starting Nov 1, Dec 1, or Jan 1. I'm flexible. 

It's a 3-bed 1-bath on Mass Ave steps from the Mass. Ave Orange Line station &amp; \~6 min walk from Krentzman.

Has anyone ever changed their major's catalog year?,"Some majors have had their course requirements changed in the past couple of years and you can view the differences in the degree audit by selecting the catalog year. For example, the 2018 CS major requirements have CS4400 as a required class, but the 2021 CS major requirements do not. Could someone theoretically ""change their major"" by changing the catalog year for their major?

Northeastern needs to do better with providing support for struggling students...,"I've been seeing a lot of posts about mental health recently and I want to share my experience with mental health issues and trying to receive support from Northeastern. For support in any issue, Northeastern refers you to the we care office. If you wanted to call we care to see what support you could receive they are only open Monday - Friday.

Spring 2020 was a bad semester for me mentally. I have had severe depression for many years, and despite doing everything I was supposed to, I found myself in a poor mental state. My psychiatrist was testing different medication doses in hopes that I would find the right balance. I was struggling with adjusting to changes caused by the changing medication doses. I was consistently overwhelmed with work and I found it near impossible to get started on some assignments.

My home environment is bad for my mental health, so when they told us to leave because of the pandemic, I tried my best to avoid being sent home, calling we care and talking to anyone who would listen. It took a week to get an answer, only to be told that I should find off campus housing. When I got home my mental state deteriorated instantly and my antidepressant medication was changed. I was unable to finish 4 of my 6 classes. My UHCS psychiatrist suggested I talk to my academic advisor who told me to email we care for help with requesting incompletes. Ultimately, I was left with an email template so I could ask my professors for incompletes. I had to fill out a form with a signature from my (sometimes unresponsive) professors. No one from Northeastern was helping me actually get my incompletes. It baffles me that no one checked in on me despite completely disappearing from class after we got sent home. Would they have let me fail if I didn't reach out for help?

TLDR: I had to go out of my way to get help from Northeastern, and their help was only marginally helpful.",1602606631,1,0

Any other low-income students feel miserable and unsupported?,"Poor student here and hoo boy. Remote learning has really made me realize the wealth disparities between my classmates and I. Having to buy a new laptop for a lockdown browser (screw professors that use these. I'm shy about my living situation, share a room, and the load of a webcam on my computer is too much for my internet.) was a HUGE financial burden and I haven't seen anyone that understood, professors still making us buy tech and textbooks, having to pay extra for better Internet because I'm at home and my family consists of two teens that, guess what, also need the internet (their school has the basic courtesy to provide them with laptops though...and they're at public high schools, not ""elite private institutions""). 

Despite screaming it to the skies and applying for all grants available, I feel wholly unsupported by Northeastern and by professors who act sympathetic but, in reality, don't care about low income students enough to reconsider their idea of what's important in a class. And that's me here on a full-ride scholarship--cannot imagine how it is for someone paying tuition on top of financial insecurity. 

I guess I've always known that we can work our asses off to change our situations and are still considered not important enough to invest in but whatever : - ) Would love some solidarity or advice.",1602555724,1,0

I've been working *super* hard on all of my assignments and getting them done well ahead of their due dates. But I'm depressed. It's hard to even leave my dorm room (in which I don't have a roommate) to go to the bathroom. I feel so uncomfortable around my hall mates, because I barely know them, and it feels like I'm the only one among them who doesn't already have a ""group."" I've stopped going in-person to classes, because it's the exact same as going virtually, except I have to put actual clothes on. I don't know what to do. I've barely been eating. I've gone to the dining halls twice since September 6th. It might sound strange, but cooking and cleaning give me comfort sometimes, and all I want is a poached egg but the fucking kitchen is closed. 

All of my other friends in different universities are doing well. Why am I not? I always see groups of people outside of my dorm hanging out, and I even see groups of people who are acquaintances to me, and I just wonder how they got there. I wonder how to get there myself. I don't want to sound desperate and I don't want to intrude on their good time. So getting there seems impossible.

I don't know. I think I just want to go home. Yeah, if I go home I won't have the city of Boston to explore, but I'm not even exploring it anyways, because I'm too depressed and anxious to leave my room (when normally I'm not like this at all). At least at home, I have all of my comforts.

The corny aoun fanfic you've all been waiting for,"By all means, it is a normal September day at Northeastern. Cool breeze, sun shining, no clouds. A biker rings his bell at me as I am walking past IV toward Ruggles. I jump as he zips past me at high speed, a gust of air pushing my hair into my face. I look at the back of his head as he rides down Columbus Ave, frowning behind my #protectthepack mask. 

&amp;#x200B;

I make my way up the stairs. Packs of Freshmen roam through the train station, bright red lanyards moving in time with their eager pace. Reminiscing about High School drama, discussing classes, groaning about the prison that their first year of college has turned out to be. The fifth person with wide leg jeans and thick white sneakers passes by me, laughing with the congregation around her, yelling, ""If I can't party by next year, I'm gonna lose it."" 

&amp;#x200B;

The groceries in my hands are getting heavy. I briefly consider sitting for a bit before I continue to make my way to the west villages. I decide against it and keep moving through. The familiar sounds of the T greet me: the calm voice announcements for the orange line, the rhythm of the noisy escalator, the roar of the trains coming in. A pigeon that lost its sense of fear far too long ago steals a breadcrumb by my foot before scattering off.  

&amp;#x200B;

The sun is shining brightly when I leave the station. People are out and about on campus, walking, lounging, studying outdoors. Campus isn't the same, but I'm happy to be back. 

&amp;#x200B;

I make my way around Centennial, when my phone goes off in my pocket. It's my friend from high school, angrily texting me about the latest political scandal. I squint at my phone and try to type out a lazy response. I keep my pace, not paying attention to where I'm walking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I notice that I'm crossing the small road next to Ryder. I look up, not expecting a car to be there, like usual. Instead, my eyes make eye contact with a driver going full speed ahead. Worse, I recognize him. 

&amp;#x200B;

My adrenaline spikes. My arm falls, my grocery bag drops out of my hand. I lunge backwards as a shiny black car bumps into me while coming to a screeching halt. I stumble before being knocked off of my feet. I sit there for a bit in shock, while I hear the car door quickly open and close. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Are you okay?"", the driver starts questioning, ""did I hurt you?"" I am absentmindedly staring at his shiny, expensive loafers. I finally look up. It's President Aoun. 

&amp;#x200B;

The mural behind his head made it look like he had a blue and purple halo. I dumbly stare into his dark brown eyes. He furrows his eyebrows and stretches out his hand. After a moment of hesitation, I take it. He hauls me off the ground with little effort. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Are you okay?"", He asks again. I shake my head yes. ""Just a little shaken"", I answer quietly. He lets go of my hand. He nods his head and takes a travel size bottle of Purell out of his back pocket. He puts some on the hand he just offered me, but pauses for a second. He looks at me, like he is considering something. 

&amp;#x200B;

His eyes briefly glance to the groceries on the ground. He looks back at his car, and then looks at me. ""Uh, well. Would you like some?"" He gives me some hand sanitizer. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Thanks."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I start reaching for the dropped bag. He starts reaching for it, too, and his hand touches mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh-"", we both withdraw quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

""I was just going to-"" 

&amp;#x200B;

""I'll help you carry these,"" he states. ""Where do you live?""

&amp;#x200B;

He takes my groceries and we start walking toward the west villages. He walks six feet to the right. We say nothing on our way there, but I catch him glancing at me. 

&amp;#x200B;

We get to the door of the building. He gently hands me my groceries. He sighs, and looks at his feet.

&amp;#x200B;

""What?"" I ask him. 

&amp;#x200B;

""I need to tell you something before I go,"" he mentions softly. I stand there in confusion. He waits for a bit before he looks back up at me and makes strong eye contact. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Because you were texting at the time of the incident, I am not legally liable for any injuries that you may have sustained. My lawyer will be contacting you soon.""

Second Semester: Making friends (just sharing thoughts &amp; hope to hear other people's perspective),"To start, I was in NU-in Boston during the first semester (at the Westin Hotel). And sorry this was kind of disorganized but I needed to get this off and maybe hear some other perspectives.

&amp;#x200B;

It's about 2 weeks till I go back to Boston and start my second semester. My first semester was really rough. My classes were fine (ended with a really good GPA). However, my social life was almost non existent. I had a few friends from high school that I hung out with sometimes (which was nice) and tried to meet people but otherwise it was really hard to just do ""something"" with others. I also had friends back home from school &amp; church that I talked with all the time but that wasn't a replacement for (new) friends in person.

I kind of want a group of friends to just do ""life"" things (eating, studying, etc.). Just people to hang out with and live life with. Also all the other types of friends and people you interact with.

In high school, I was able to make friends just off being around them all the time (proximity) and we had the same classes (shared interest). Through that we just clicked and became friends. However I never hung out with them outside of school. Now in college + a pandemic, it is so hard for me to actually develop those friendships that I had.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really scared to just go up to people and initiate. I know its all in my head and that others are in the same place as well but I don't know. It seems like everyone around me is generally doing well. They are hanging out with others, spending nights together, going out to eat, doing activities together, etc. Whenever I try to talk to others, I seem to always get a cold response. I know that in terms of communication and just general conversation I am lacking in many ways (rip) but it still seems like I can't get anything going. Also I am so scared to get rejected. I kind of always think that people will just not want to talk to me.

Another big one is that it's really hard for me to build up the courage to take initiative and go do something. First of all, I don't really want ""planned"" activities (even though it is useful and necessary). I know that I need to start with these until I can just ask someone to go meet me here for lunch or to just ask to go study together. However, I feel that with a lot of people I just get cold responses or excuses. It's like I'm like a ""secondary or backup"" to other people.

I hope that maybe someone reading this feels that they aren't alone and maybe for all of us it can remind us that we are all in the same place. We all want to make friends and live a fulfilling life (and I define that with people). The most valuable thing for all of us is the people we are close with. 

I have a lot more to say but I just wanted to kind of ""therapeutic journal"" and maybe post it for others (maybe it will help maybe its a mistake who knows)",1609224172,1,0

Can we have more moderators added to this subreddit?,"The huge influx of shitposts over the last few days has really highlighted the need for additional moderation on this subreddit. A larger moderation team could be more active and help cull the troll posts on the subreddit, which IMO is active enough to warrant some more stringent posting guidelines. In addition, having more moderators would allow the moderation team to do a better job of pointing people, especially incoming and prospective freshman, in the right direction when they re-ask one of the common questions that has been answered here over and over. The megathreads work well for this sort of thing, but most of the posts that bypass those threads stay up anyway.

Finally, and this to me is the biggest issue, none of the current moderators attends Northeastern anymore. It feels a bit odd that the school subreddit has no active students on the mod team. We should have representation if not majority representation from the active student body, like most other college subreddits do.

TLDR: We need to add more moderators, and they should be a part of the active student body as all three of the current mods are alumni.",1609180324,1,0

The Westin 11,"On September 4th, 2020, Northeastern University announced that it had suspended (without tuition or rooming refunds) 11 students in the new N.U.in Boston program for gathering together in a room against the university‚Äôs COVID-19 policies. This group has become known by the student body as the Westin 11. N.U.in Boston students are housed in the Westin Hotel, with many unique an evolving rules given the pandemic - we were able to speak with some students in the program to give their perspectives on life in the Westin hotel and their thoughts about the dismissal of the Westin 11.

Mobile Robotics EECE5550 and Coding Learning Curve,"I'm a mechanical engineer taking Mobile Robotics as one of the grad courses for my BS/MS. I wanted to take it as a gateway to learning robotics since I'm interested, but so far it's been slightly intimidating since the majority of students in the class are electrical and computer engineers who presumably are extremely good at coding. I only have basic knowledge of python and some computer vision, and the only C++ I have done is literally in cornerstone (so next to nothing). Is the learning curve in this class steep or does the class assist you through it. My professor hasn't given any indication quite yet. Any advice is helpful.",1599865076,1,0

Quick vent/advice to freshman folks,"I‚Äôm a 5th year, as I quickly approach graduation it dawns upon me that there isn‚Äôt a single person at NU that I can call friend, it is for sure a lack in me and not anyone else. When I graduated high school the only thing I was truly looking forward to was making friends.

Year after year, failure after failure I stand before you frightened of the fact that this is as good as it gets for my social life. On the outside no one would think I‚Äôm this lonely person that has a hard time making friends, I‚Äôm always conversing with others, I‚Äôm always caring about others and helping them in their needs before mine. 

I don‚Äôt ‚Äúlook‚Äù Lonely to others but I am. It crushes me even more knowing how all of my siblings are able to make lots of friends so fast it feels like a fuck you to me. I‚Äôm not jealous of my siblings (okay maybe a little), but I really wish I was anyone, but me, do you realize the rarity of my situation? how bad am I socially to not make a single friend in 5 years? Shit fucking hurts. 

I‚Äôm very grateful to being born in a loving and wealthy family, I bet people with a couple of close friends would without hesitation Trade their lives for mine, maybe not for the loving family, but for the wealth. Little do they know that I would do the same and take their lives. I don‚Äôt mean to boast, but I‚Äôll stop the venting here because it‚Äôs getting hard to see with teary eyes. 

As for you incoming freshman and anyone else really, grow some fucking balls and start talking to people, initiate the plans and don‚Äôt ever fucking just sit there expecting people to just ask you out. Feel the pain of anxiety and awkwardness now and save Yourself a lifetime of misery.",1599794998,1,0

Trouble living in a dorm,"I'm a freshman here and I've admittedly been having a hard time living in dorms.

I'm also used to having my own room where I can have alone time, which is important to me. 

Of course, dorms are going to be loud and I can hear people talking all throughout the night regardless of it's a weekday or a weekend. I can hear the room above me walking around and partying all throughout the night and I can hear the rooms next to me through the walls. I'm having such a hard time sleeping (I don't get more than 4-5 hours a sleep a night, if I'm lucky) that I actually considered going home a few weeks ago.

What it's like in NUin Boston,"As you probably all know, 11 students were kicked out today because they were caught in a room together. I've been living here in the Westin since Sunday and I have seen some crazy stuff. 

A few nights ago, I saw on someones snap story a video of people wheeling a table out of the conference room and into the elevator so they could use the table for pong. That was the room where the gathering took place. Idiots. 

In the 600 person+ group chat that we have I've seen sooo many people commenting about how they think we are being treated like prisoners. My response to them is that they need to get over themselves. The hotel is honestly a really comfortable place to be and while it sucks that socializing is a lot harder, we have to remember we're supposed to be here for an education. 

One problem that I do agree with is the fact that we're not really given any space close to us where we can safely socialize. There is a common room that can hold up to 16 people but with 800 students here, it's really not enough. We're not even allowed to sit in the lobby alone reading a book without getting written up. On campus there seem to be places (like the tents) where people can somewhat responsibly gather and I understand the students frustration here. Being told that we can't sit 6 feet apart with masks on just because of hotel regulations is bothersome. It's probably for the best but in the emergency zoom call they held today students concerns were not addressed, it just frustrated most. There are empty conference rooms that are GIANT that could definitely be used just as quiet study space that would really help improve people's moods. 

The vibes I'm getting right now are that most people seem to think the restrictions are really stupid and while in room gatherings seem don't seem to be a major problem every morning you'll see a table of 4 students eating breakfast at the restaurant a block away.

I'm sure everyone at Northeastern rn has noticed people sitting in the grass outside IV wayyy less than 6 ft apart eating. I give it like one week until the administration starts taking pictures and suspends/kicks those people out. 

The events today definitely scared people, but I don't think they are going to stop people violating the rules. 

Also there is a 4 person capacity restriction in the elevators and I had to wait OVER HALF HOUR yesterday just to get a ride to dinner. We have been strictly prohibited from using the stairs and it doesn't make any sense. I really think just giving us a little more space to responsibly come together and letting us use the stairs would boost morale a lot.

I walked through BU today and noticed signs EVERYWHERE that said ""don't go viral"". That would help the cause here imo. 

Excuse the grammar I just really wanted to get everything out. Please feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer. Stay safe out there huskies.

P.S. I've seen plenty of people on this sub asking why anyone would want to do NUin Boston. For the record I didn't want to I just come from a messy household and this shit is wayyyy better than being at home for me.",1599266538,1,0

Petition to Change the School's Formal Acronym to ‚ÜóÔ∏éern,"# Introduction

The ""North East Arrow"" ‚Üó (which shall henceforth be referred to as U+2197), is Unicode character that has its origins in Unicode 1.1 from 1993, and was added as an emoji in Emoji 1.0 in 2015.

# Merits

Let us now ask the reader to examine some of the potential pros and cons of this proposed change.

### PROS

* U+2197 is universally supported across devices, just as easily as the small dash ""-"" is (U+2013). It does not suffer from much platform-dependent like many emojis do.
* Only having 1898 to remember is too easy. U+2197 will give the freshman another 4 digit number to memorize for trivia ice breakers!
* At 27 years old, U+2197 is older than most current students and many of the buildings on campus. It's practically a historical artifact, and ‚Üóern ought to treasure and preserve what few such pieces of history it has.
* The university is in dire need of a new acronym. ""NEU"" (bleh) promotes the horrendous misconception that the university's name has more words than it does, while ""NU"" (double bleh) is too generic and leads to confusion with other universities such as Nebraska and Northwestern. Even beyond those, a simple google search for ""nu college"" also turns up Neumann, National, Niagara, and Northwest Universities before ‚Üóern.
* Selecting one acronym ""to rule them all"" will harmonize the university between the various clans representing NEU, NU, and even NeU. How many more lives must be lost in this endless tribal conflict before U+2197 is recognized as a savior??!
* With no obvious pronunciation, U+2197 will leave opposing universities' small-brained sporting followers few options to twist our acronym into derogatory chants during games. Sucks to BU, indeed!
* U+2197's beautiful, upward-sloping direction will signal to the world the positive path that ‚Üóern is currently traveling!

###Cons

* None of note

# Conclusion

Upon examination of the cases both for and against this proposal, it seems that a clear winner has emerged. Let us come together as a community (virtually!) to support this initiative. Let's put the ""North East"" [sic] back in Northeastern!!!",1599195298,1,0

Should I drop Bioengineering and switch majors?,"Advice please. I‚Äôm a sophomore this fall and I‚Äôm having doubts about my major. So far I‚Äôve taken 2 BIOE courses: BMES and Quantitative Physiology. I did decently in them, but they are among my least liked classes. I found it hard to absorb concepts in them and felt apprehensive before lectures. I didn‚Äôt really enjoy the BMES lab because I felt anxious that I was going to screw something up.

I know that I won‚Äôt like every class that I have to take regardless of major, so I‚Äôm unsure about changing majors based off of 2 classes. Did anyone else dislike the first BIOE classes but go on to like the later classes? Or is this a sign that Bioengineering isn‚Äôt for me?

I‚Äôm currently registered for Bioelectricity and Biomechanics. I was planning on testing the waters with bioengineering still but I realized that now is a good time to switch majors before my second year starts (saves time and money). I‚Äôm interested in computer science, but it‚Äôs also practical for me to stay in engineering since I finished the general engineering courses. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs too soon to write off bioengineering, but it would be better to switch now rather than later. How did you know to switch majors?

Another to all the freshman feeling lonely,"This was supposed to be a burner account because I‚Äôm a senior and I was looking for brown people (I‚Äôm brown) to hang out with, and I‚Äôm going through something of my own type or ‚Äúloneliness‚Äù. 

When I came to college, things were different. There was no covid and I ‚Äúlucked out‚Äù by striking a conversation with a guy on the lobby of steast when I moved in. I didn‚Äôt know that this guy would be one of my best friends for the rest of college. I would since have my own group of people, but he became one of my best friends. 

I since have been part of a fraternity, eboard of a club, and have had great co-op experiences. On paper, it looks like my social life is great. 

But I have some minor anxiety (which I knew I had) and that has sort of grown bigger, I think it‚Äôs because of my upbringing in a semi-toxic environment and also from going through family things during the whole COVID back home situation.  It‚Äôs sometimes isolated me from people when they want to be around me, or wanting to be near people when it‚Äôs ‚Äúseemed like‚Äù no one cared of me. 

That has mutated into me longing to be part of people from my own ‚Äúbackground‚Äù. Most of my friends are from completely different backgrounds and I‚Äôve always been fine with that because I grew up in a pretty whitewashed environment  - they‚Äôve always had my back and I‚Äôve always had their‚Äôs. But after coming back I‚Äôve been hit with a feeling of loneliness I‚Äôve never had before and it‚Äôs hard to explain. 

So to all the freshman feeling loneliness, any kind of it, I am confident it‚Äôll get better. I would love to help myself but right now I‚Äôve been trying to focus on myself (and also meeting people from my ‚Äúback ground‚Äù), but again, I hope things get better and I‚Äôm confident it will. The situation right now makes things hard, but when you‚Äôre at a low there‚Äôs always a high. I can‚Äôt predict when and neither can you, but just wait for it. 

Also, if you can, take the opportunity to understand your psychology. I‚Äôm not a psych major or anything but understand yourself. What‚Äôs making you feel this way, what do you like to do alone, what do you not like to do alone, etc. Maybe write it down on a notebook or price of paper. I‚Äôve been doing that and it‚Äôs hard, but hope it gets better!

How to do CS projects,"Hi, can any CS majors give advice for doing projects?

I'm kinda lost. I went to a few online hackathons and they really aren't my thing. I'm a big sleeper, so me having to stay up late in the night so that I didn't feel guilty towards my teammates for slacking off was a horrible experience. Yes, I think I learned a lot at them, but also I don't think they were worth the stress, sleep deprivedness, and overall terrible state I was in during/afterwords.

But also, whenever I work on projects myself, I feel like I'm not doing enough. Everyone's making these socially impactful projects in hackathons and I'm here just making some dumb everyday app.

First, I wanna ask a stupid validation question to feel better about myself: Is it okay to not go to hackathons? Everyone always makes a big fuss about going to them, and all the smart people always go to them.

Second, is the way I'm approaching self-projects inefficient? By that, I mean, do you think I'm going anywhere by doing these lame small side stuff for the sake of just exploring the concepts I'm learning? Not to make any impact like those projects at hackathons are?

Co-op Drug Testing Vent Post,"Considering how the subreddit usually talks about this subject, I don't anticipate getting much empathy for this. 

I'm a 4th year engineering student currently seeking my third and final co-op. I have received two offers that I have had to decline due to drug testing requirements. Before you go to reply:

* I don't smoke weed. I legally purchase edibles at Brookline NETA. I had a sports-related knee injury in high school that I recovered from, but can sometimes flare up, particularly at night. If the pain is so bad that I'm having trouble sleeping, I take one gummy (5mg THC) and go immediately to bed. I do this 2-4 times per week depending on how much physical activity I've been doing. I am not pulling fat bong rips and getting blazed out of my mind at a basement party.
* Why don't I have a medical card? Like many students, I'm on the university health plan year-round. My parents don't have me on their health insurance anymore. I imagine the process of acquiring a medical card through Northeastern's mediocre insurance is long, complicated, and possibly expensive. I support myself, so this has not been feasible. (Though, after this semester, I'm probably going to get one as soon as I can.)
* I am not applying to positions that obviously drug test. None of these positions are in healthcare, defense, or require me to operate heavy machinery. There is absolutely no reason why my legal use of marijuana should interfere with my ability to sit at a computer using AutoCAD. 

I have heard Northeastern's whole spiel about their private university status being why marijuana is disallowed on campus. Sure, makes sense. I'm not arguing about that. But why isn't there any form of infrastructure in place for an employer's drug testing status to be TRANSPARENT on their job listings? Why do I have to waste my time AND the employer's time because this university is so awkward in its communication around co-op drug testing? 

I know we're all sick of co-op drug test posts, and there's surely more to come this fall, but has it ever occurred to you that if Northeastern just TALKED TO US OPENLY about this shit that we wouldn't have to turn to Reddit for answers to these questions?",1601053568,1,0
