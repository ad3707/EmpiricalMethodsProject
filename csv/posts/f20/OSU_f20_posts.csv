In grad school, the professor, in a leadership science classed asked...how are you going to continue your education after this? I don't know why but it affected me deeply. I need to constantly sharpen my saw.

Frustrated with out of state,"I know this is going to sound like a bit of a rant, but I feel like I need to say this

My family has been living in Ohio for the past 200 years and have been contributing to the local economy. Since the job market was bad, we had to move down to Florida for a few years. I understand that out of state tuition is supposed to go towards paying for a lot of the university‚Äôs expenses and some of the tuition bill is footed by Ohio tax payers, but literally 95% of my family has been living in Ohio and paying Ohio taxes for centuries. Both of my parents have lived in Ohio for 90% of their life and yet we have to pay twice as much? I am sorry if this comes off as entitled,  but not even receiving some sort of discount is ridiculous to me. I am essentially having to pay the same bill as someone from the middle of Alaska who has never even heard of Ohio before",1605193689,1,0

That‚Äôs a lot of time for covid to spread in a tiny, likely cramped airplane. 

Are any other out of state students nervous about catching covid while flying home like I am? Or am I just being overly paranoid and overly cautious?

PSA: A lot of professors don't care about your academic success or struggles right now,"I have this teacher, who I refuse to call a professor, for no other reason that the word 'Professor' holds a strong place in my lexicon. Nonetheless, this person exists. They ""teach"" my math class, but in all sense of the word, I don't feel that they have taught me anything yet. I'm gonna quote this person, and then I'll explain why my title makes sense. Paraphrasing...

""Pay attention to the last page of these notes, as these problems are the hardest. They will be the most similar to the ones on your exam next week, but your exam problems will be even harder than these ones"".

Excuse me?? Not only did you just admit that you'll be going rogue with the problems for this exam by just adding in problem formats we've probably never seen before, but you also just stated that for no discernable reason other than to fuck us over, you're making the problems on the exam harder than what you're teaching us? Why? 

Because as Dave Chappelle put it, ""cause fuck'em, that's why"".  A lot of the staff don't care anymore. The ones with the worst online ratings seem to exist the longest, classes are being outsourced to the internet, and god forbid you ask for a break because you're on the verge of a mental collapse it doesn't matter. And I'm not some new freshman who is just frustrated. I earned my first degree 5 years ago, way before the covid era hit. Albeit it was at a different school, but still. I have the experience to be able to accurately judge and call it how I see it. I'm not sure what I'm even doing anymore trying to suffer through school. 

Anyways, Heres to everyone who has already signed up for SP21. I guess I'll catch you on zoom then too.",1605139837,1,0
International Students of OSU:,"Hey all, I am writing this on behalf of a family friend who is getting ready to submit his application to Ohio State during the Early Admission window. I too am an international student but I did not know the answers to some of his queries so I figured this is as good of a place as any to find answers.

Just a little on his background, he is from India and is considering majoring in Economics. He is in his final year of high school in a school with an IB board. His projected grade (PG) is 39 out of 45. 

Now, to his question(s)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Does Ohio State offer any merit-based scholarships to international students? If yes, how does one go about getting one or applying for one? If not merit-based, are there any other kinds of scholarships/grants available to international students? (I did not apply for any so I am not sure.)
2. What are the criteria for getting direct admission into the honors program? Is it tougher to get admission into honors directly? If you apply for honors and don't get in, do you still have a chance of regular admission? Lastly, does being in the honors program increase the chance of merit-based scholarship/ are there any specifically for the honors program?

&amp;#x200B;

Scarlet and Gray," 

I stopped to get gas tonight after running to the grocery store in Louisville, Ky.  

I was keeping an eye on this sketchy looking dude who was walking around when a van on the other side of the pumps pulled up.  I briefly saw a woman get out with a male child in the back that may have been six years old.

I was pumping gas when I heard her say, ""The kids in this car want me to tell you ""O-H.""

I responded immediately with, ""I-O,"" because that is what you do.  The young boy noticed my Ohio State jacket.

She then says, ""You're not going to believe this, but their names are Scarlet and Gray.""

I was totally stunned because in all my years of being in Columbus, I had never heard of anyone naming their kids that.  I thought I misheard at first - ""Did you say Charlotte and Grey?""

""No,"" she corrected me, ""Scarlet and Gray.""

""Oh yeah, Scarlet is a girl's name,"" I thought to myself.

Those kids will definitely be future Buckeyes.",1605137133,1,0

I thought taking physics at cstate would be easier than at osu because physics is already not my strong suit but turns out it‚Äôs just as bad! I need to pass this class with a C in order to be officially admitted into my major but at this point things are looking grim. The only videos the professor has uploaded are from his lectures 8 years ago, the format is terrible and don‚Äôt correlate well with the textbook or any of the test materials.

I‚Äôm not sure what the point of this post is. I‚Äôm just frustrated and wish the professor would be some effort into creating new content or something. He doesn‚Äôt seem to care very much. 

Anyways, if y‚Äôall have any suggestions on physics, that would be nice. I read and annotate the textbook, but it‚Äôs not very helpful since I don‚Äôt understand the stuff in the first place, and since i don‚Äôt understand the book, the practice problems are just as foreign.

Looking for advice,"So I‚Äôm going to try to sun this up short and sweet.
I had a midterm last week. It was two parts each an hour long. I took the first part and turned it in. I took the second part and finished it and turned it in by it‚Äôs due time of 8pm. A week later (Friday) I get an email from my professor saying I had turned in part 2 of the midterm and spent 57 minutes reading the questions but all that was written on my exam through Carmen was my name. After this I emailed her back explaining that I had completed the test so I don‚Äôt understand how this is possible. I then join her office hours and she try‚Äôs to tell me to manage my time better and that if I have any technology issues to report them immediately (I couldn‚Äôt check my test after submitting the way it is setup on Carmen). I told her I managed my time fine and that I had not noticed any issues because I finished the test and turned it in with 3 minutes to spare. She then emails whoever manages Carmen and comes back and tells me that if I had submitted answers that Carmen automatically saves it and that I cannot retake the midterm as it would be unfair for other students. 

HOW IS THIS MY FAULT ??! 

I had no clue that there were any technology issues or of course I would have said something. So now I have a dilemma and I do not know what to do. There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going to sit here and take a fat ZERO on my midterm when I had finished it all because of some stupid technology error that I was not even aware of. I am a freshman.

I have lost track of what day of the week it is because it doesn‚Äôt matter, I have work due that night and have left the house less than 5 times in the past month. The only break I get is after I turn in my last final in december and have 3 weeks to actually sleep before my anxiety kicks up again and I repeat this fucked up semester. Ever since august i have had 24/7 anxiety so bad to the point where I cannot relax and have sex with my partner. 

I am tired of friends and family telling me to try and understand how osu is handling this and doing their best, when all they‚Äôve done was make it worse. my anxiety was not a problem ALL summer when covid was new. I do not understand nor care for the way i have seen osu handle its students and their mental health this semester and i am about to explode with anger because i am a constant ball of anxiety and rage and i just want to throw my laptop out the window because nobody seems to understand or care how any of us feel about being stuck in out dorms/houses staring at a screen with an increased workload while we teach ourselves and still work 20-40 hours a week to make things work. i do not have it the hardest out of any one here for sure, but i am still cracking under all of this pressure for something i never cared for in the first place.

Just crying on reddit,"Just a rant because I have no one to cry to. Not sure what I want out of this but here is what my week was like. 

School is messed up for me. I'm falling in all my classes one by one and I have ZERO motivation to do anything. Like I wasn't usually this kind of person. I  was the type who would beat myself up for getting a B or something. Like this week, I missed two quizzes because I overslept. I can't drop out because I'm almost at the finish line and also I'm here from another country so I cannot go back home without a degree in my hands, just isn't an option. 

In terms of jobs,  I had the chance to choose a position where I could just sit and do my homework.  But my social anxiety decided that nope I was going to do an exhausting job for the same pay and now I can't even do my homework after because I have a migraine. 
In terms of religion, I am just very sinful, have done a lot of bad things, don't pray consistently,  go to church...

In terms of family and friends, I feel like I just need them when I want and I am never there when they need me. Feel really bad about it too. And also my family excepts a lot from me, like they think I am a top student who works because she has school under control. While the main reason I work is because I don't want my parents to send me a penny. They try to but I have seen how they live and where I am is not comparable and I just can't let them send me money for whatsoever. In terms of friends,  I have just ONE friend in college and we're just the do homeworks together type and nothing more. I don't even know how people make friends. Like I had a circle of friends in high school but college is very different I guess. I can't even make friends with my roommates let alone other people. 

And you might suggest,  going to therapy.  Which I've done before and I just feel like I'm just going there because I'm lazy and don't want to do the stuff. I feel like I'm just making up these problems in my head. Like there are other people who have real psychological problems and I don't even know why I am going there. 
I can't live peacefully with myself. I am just tired. And no worries, I'm not suicidal and even if I were I wouldn't even have the courage to do it.",1602975435,1,0

I am going to be going to college next year (fall of 2021) and I was wondering if OSU offers a Herpetology major (Study of reptiles) or a major similar to that. The reason why I am asking this on Reddit is because I could not really find a conclusive answer anywhere else (like the website), and the people I talked to during my college visit did not give me a straight answer either. So does this major even exist at OSU or is there an academic track I could take to achieve something similar (like a build your own major sort of thing)?

Problems I have with OSU,"No assignment should take up more than 20% of your grade

Late assignments should be accepted with lower grades unless there are real reasons for them to not (I.E. a fear of sharing answers)

It is ridiculous that many courses still test knowledge based on exams, especially now that cheating is so easy. I get it for a math class, but in social science courses, the classes should have put more value in essays instead to test actual knowledge.

Online courses that don't depend of zoom and have pre-recorded lectures and pre-made course material should just let all their material be accessible from day one, with only a recommended outline for when you should complete assignments. (when graded assignments are all papers, the issue of cheating would be significantly decreased)

Using the prior solution would also allow students to either get ahead or take breaks when during times of stress.

This should also have pre-scheduled breaks in the course.

Office hours should NEVER be mandatory. Same for resuscitation. These should be there for students who are having a hard time, and allowing students who know the material to skip without consequence removes much of the fear of slowing down the class from many students who genuinely need the help.

Tutors should NEVER assume the student get the material suddenly. I always hated it when a tutor clearly wanted to leave because ""Obviously they get it now"", it makes you feel like an idiot and makes the people seeking help less likely to pursue further help.

Always assume a student is flat broke, never assume the student has anything. I'm tired of classes assuming that we have phones, PCs, webcams, microphones. If there aren't public options or options made available by the university, then a student shouldn't be left behind because they are too poor to succeed in your course.

Stop making it difficult to access online resources. Authentication honestly feels pointless and like an unnecessary step between me and my classes and materials. It makes to idea of losing my phone more terrifying, since losing my phone may leave me totally locked out of my courses. To make maters worse, you remove an authentication options. Really!

STOP MAKING ME CHANGE MY PASSWORD! Seriously, no one is trying to hack into my carmen page, I'm sick of having to remember what the hell my new password is every 5 months. My bank doesn't make me do this, none of my accounts make me do this, literally just you OSU.

Stop making unrelated courses pre-requisites for possibly popular courses. You don't need Calc 1 in order to learn intro to C++, I know it, all my friends who are professional coders know it, and you know it. I'm not saying allow me to take Calc 2 when I can't pass Calc 1. Some pre-recs are just stupid. 

I'm sure there are more issues and I'm sure many of my issues with OSU feel like nit picking to some of you, but after 6 years as an undergrad, these are a few of the major complaints I have after my years both here and at multiple other universities and campuses.",1602803428,1,0

Overwhelmed and Feeling Like a Failure.,"Hey guys...  


I'm feeling horrible right now, I'm about to pull another all-nighter to catch up and try to get on top of this seemingly insurmountable amount of homework. I feel lost in this college environment as a freshman. I thought that the world was finally going right for me, but I am lost, and I am losing all my motivation.   


I'm doing poorly in my classes bombing two of my quizzes for my pre-req CSE course to get into the major, not understanding how to do a project, and not having room in my schedule to go to office hours. Calculus is the same way, but instead, I understand the material, but I still score rather low for seemingly really odd reasons.   


I feel like crawling into a ball and wasting away at this point. This is becoming so much, and I need to keep a 3.0 to keep my scholarship, but I'm scared that my classes won't get curved. I can't afford college, and I need to graduate in 4 years, since that's how long my scholarship lasts.

Session 2 Classes,"I'm dropping a couple classes this week (due to various reasons) but need to add some session 2 courses to still be counted as a full-time student. I've already talked to my advisor about this and we went through a list of possible classes. She told me to look for some syllabi to see if I think I'll be fine with the course load.

Right now, I'm looking at adding Entmlgy 4607, Artssci 2120, and Anthro 2201. I was able to find a session 2 syllabus for the entomology class and it seems pretty chill so I'm not worried about it. My advisor said that artssci class is basically a ""how to google"" class but I'd still like to see a syllabus for it. I'm expecting the anthro class to be the hardest of the list but seems not too bad from what I've seen? I just can't find a syllabus for it as a session 2 class. I've tried the syllabus search tool and also google but can't find anything for those 2 classes.

TL;DR -  I need a syllabus for Artssci 2120 and Anthro 2201 for session 2 to gauge how much course my load would be.",1602042807,1,0

At a total loss,"I have literally no idea what to do now... to the point that I'm posting here in the hopes of getting something that isn't 'lol shit sux get fukt'

Long story short I was supposed to graduate SP20, there was an issue with a grade, by the time it was fixed it was apparently too late to retroactively apply graduated. So I have everything, I have nothing to do but wait until Autumn graduation to get the little text on my transcript that says 'degree conferred' on it.

There's a huge substitute shortage in my area, as well as many others I imagine, and that sounded like a great job until I got to the trying to get the license part. I asked and tried and their bureaucracy bs will accept nothing but an official transcript saying degree conferred. They literally want to wait 3 months for a little bit of text on a PDF to be added. I already did everything else for the job, including background checks which aren't cheap, my advisor straight up never responds to anything, and this whole situation has me so incredibly annoyed. Like, this is a position that's actually really important to get filled! There's schools that are canceling days because they don't have the subs to fill in! I have absolutely everything I need to help but a tiny bit of text, so I have to sit here doing fuck all for three months.

I don't even know what I'm asking for at this point. I doubt anyone has a magic fix for transcripts. I don't know. I'm lost. All I can do is get another shitty ass retail job to struggle to make ends meet while there's a shortage I'm fully capable of filling. It fucking sucks",1602024178,1,0

To start, my issues are not with the content of the exam. I thought it was very fair in terms of what we were asked to do. My issue is with the point values. 

First the point values. Why on earth did 40% of the midterm grade rest on 4 multiple choice questions? I accidentally used a sin instead of a cos and boom, immediate 90. Looking at past midterms, this seems to not be the case, with those having ~15% of the midterm grade left to multiple choice questions. Seems a bit unfair in my opinion. Especially considering we aren‚Äôt allowed to go back and look at a question after submitting, I really think it should be different.

Welcome to the wonderful world of: **Credit by Exam**

**What is Credit by Exam?**

Good question. After speaking with multiple departments at **The Ohio State University**TM who say they offer credit by exam, your guess is as good as theirs.

[Official OSU Credit by Exam Website](https://registrar.osu.edu/priorlearning/examination-credit.html)

Credit by Exam is a way to shorten your time to a degree and make college cheaper. If done properly, you can potentially **test out of about one to three semesters of college - For Free**, or for a small fee. There are multiple companies that offer tests, and each test has a different price. There is also a non-profit called [The Modern States](https://modernstates.org/about-us/who-we-are/) that will pay for Advanced Placement (AP) and College Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests. Because most people know about Advanced Placement testing, I won't be talking about that here. The tests I will talk about most are **College Level Examination Program (CLEP), EM Tests, and Departmental Exams.** I will also briefly mention DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSST), although these are fairly meaningless at OSU.

CLEP Tests

*Fun Fact: Of the 43 credit hours I completed my freshman year, 13 were CLEP credits.*

[CLEP's Website](https://clep.collegeboard.org/register)

[Ohio State's CLEP Policy. Notice that you can test out of MATH 1151](https://registrar.osu.edu/priorlearning/clep-tests.html)

**Pricing:**

$89 for the test, plus $30 for ***The Ohio State University*** ""Administrative Fee""

**Discounts:**

Military Affiliated Testers (Active, Guard, Reserve, AF/N/ROTC with CAC): **Free**

Ohio Military Reserve Testers: **No Administrative Fee**

Modern States Students: **Free CLEP test,** [Administrative Fee will be Reimbursed](https://modernstates.org/test-center-reimbursement/)

CLEP's are a multiple-choice test and were created by The College Board. That's right, same people who did your AP tests in high school. Unlike the AP test, CLEP's are easy. If you got a B in the high school course related to the CLEP test, you have a very good shot at passing. These tests are some of the easiest tests you can take in your college career.

If you get a bad math placement at OSU, I would highly recommend taking the CLEP. When speaking to the testing center (don't quote me on this, it has been a year), I believe they said only 5% of people who retake the OSU placement test get a higher math class, compared to around 40-50% with the CLEP.

**Each test is multiple choice**, with some ""fill in the number"" for math tests such as calculus. Depending on the test, question count can range from roughly **40 to 150 questions, with 90-120 minutes to complete**. In reality, it will probably take you much less time than that. Math is one of my worst subjects, so I used almost the full time for those tests (I also should've studied MUCH more) For other tests, I was in and out in 20 minutes with 3 credit hours tacked onto my college transcript.

To pay for the test, there are two separate bills, one to The College Board, and one to The Ohio State University. The College Board charges $89 to take the test, and Ohio State charges $30 because they need to ~~siphon off more money from broke college students~~ pay for the maintenance and upkeep of the testing center.

Your **raw test score is converted to a score ranging from 20-80** (Similar to the ACT, but not quite), **with a 50 being the equivalent to a C. Due to Ohio State policy, sometimes C's don't get degrees** (or in this case college credit). If you look at the [Scores and Credit Awarded](https://registrar.osu.edu/priorlearning/clep-tests.html), you will see that some tests (like calculus) require higher scores. A 64 is the equivalent to a B. I'm not a fan of being required to do better when I don't want to, but what I say doesn't matter. **DO NOT COMPLAIN TO THE TESTING CENTER ABOUT THIS.** They are simply the messenger. Each individual department sets their own requirements. If you want the credit for a math test, contact the math department. When they say no, then you can get upset. **The Scores and Credit Awarded page is outdated.** If you notice, many things say ""Ohio Transfer Module XXXXX"". Whenever I have taken one of these tests, I have been awarded actual credit for a course available at Ohio State. Also, some tests will yield more credit. For biology, they awarded me credit for BIO 1101, **plus the lab**. I'm not sure if this was an error on their end or what, but I'm not complaining or telling anyone official about it. I will gladly take a free lab credit. **I can tell you some of the classes you might get credit for, simply because I have taken the test and gotten credit for it. Do not be surprised if I don't know the answer.** Although I have probably spent over 48 hours in the testing center over the course of my freshman year, I don‚Äôt work there. Despite my relative lack of a social life, I still would rather be outside with friends than taking every test in the book to make an all-inclusive Reddit post.

**CLEP Power Move: Many courses at Ohio State have pre-requisites or requirements to be in a certain college/standing before you can enroll in them. I'm looking at you Fisher. CLEP Tests are a great means to bypass rules set in place by Ohio State. For instance, you can take BUSFIN 3500 and BUSML 3250 via CLEP, even if you are not admitted into Fisher.**

**Notes:**

**Failing a CLEP Test will not hurt your GPA or negatively affect you in any way, aside from losing an hour of your life and mildly lowering your self-esteem.**

**Doing poorly on a CLEP Test will not hurt your GPA**

**Passing a CLEP Test will not affect your GPA**

If I haven't made it clear already:

CLEP TESTS DO NOT AFFECT YOUR GPA

**Passing a CLEP Will:**

**Give you credit for the class**

**Allow you to enroll in any class that had the CLEPed course as a pre-requisite**

**Free up time in college so you can do other things**

**Give you the satisfaction only passing a CLEP Test can give**

If you fail a CLEP Test, you can always pay to retake it. You can also try your luck at the EM or Departmental version of the test, but these are usually much harder.

*Note: CLEP's* ***DO NOT*** *have to be taken at Ohio State.* [There are many locations across the country where you can test at.](https://clep.collegeboard.org/test-center-search) Additionally, for military affiliates, almost every military base (active, guard, and reserve) has a testing center.

EM Tests

*Fun Fact: There is nothing fun about the MATH EM Tests*

[Ohio State EM Test Page](https://registrar.osu.edu/priorlearning/em-tests.html)

**Pricing:**

$60

**Discounts:**

Military Affiliated Testers (Active, Guard, Reserve, AF/N/ROTC with CAC): **Free**

Ohio Military Reserves: **Free**

EM Tests are basically **The Ohio State University equivalent to CLEP Tests.** EM stands for Examination. **Regardless of the test you take, whether CLEP, EM, Departmental, or DSST, the ""Grade"" will show up as ""EM"". There is a ""Test Results"" Section on your Advising report that will specify which test you passed to get that EM credit.**

Because Ohio State creates their own EM tests, each test is likely to be ~~riddled with typos and extra difficult for no reason~~ unique and academically rigorous. If you study, you will probably be fine. If you took a similar course at another institution and it did not transfer in, I would recommend taking the EM test if a CLEP is not offered.

**Just like life, you only get one shot at an EM Test- don't mess it up.** Some EM Tests simply multiple-choice tests on Carmen. I actually helped the testing center fix some major security flaws with their system in regard to this. Others are pen (or pencil) and paper tests. I would only recommend taking the EM Test if there is not a CLEP Test offered and you really need the credit.

**Some tests provide formula sheets, such as physics and chemistry.** These can be requested ahead of time, and the testing center usually has extra copies on hand. If you want, walk in, ask for a sheet, and leave with it.

**Some tests require approval from the department/course instructor.** For instance, the chemistry department requires students to email the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry in order to take the test. When I asked them, they said each student needs at least one completed college chemistry lab before they will approve any test taker.

**Just like CLEP Tests, EM Tests have no effect on GPA. You simply get credit for completing the course.**

Departmental Exams

*Fun comments:*

*""I've been teaching ENR 2100 for 12 years now and you are the first person to make this request so its very rare.""- Professor Brian Lower*

*""What?""- Fisher College of Business*

*""What are you talking about test?"" -College of Education and Human Ecology*

*""It has been a few years since anyone has requested this so the test will need to be reviewed by the course coordinator""-Random Point of Contact for BUSMGT 2320*

*"".....""-Nearly every other department.*

[Ohio State Departmental Exams](https://registrar.osu.edu/priorlearning/departmental-exams.html)

**Pricing:**

**Discounts:**

Military Affiliated Testers (Active, Guard, Reserve, AF/N/ROTC with CAC): **Free**

Ohio Military Reserves: **Free**

Departmental Exams are very similar to EM Tests, except they require more (or maybe less) running and bus catching than EM Tests. **Each test is done at the college/department, rather than at the Ohio State Testing Center**. Many departments will have zero clue what you are talking about if you contact them in regard to this test. While I would say 75% of people I contacted responded with some type of answer, I also got departments who never called me back or called me back and made it clear they were pissed off about me calling them about it.

**Absolute Power Move: Each departmental exam is usually either a generic final for the course or is the same final the professor would normally give out. I would recommend taking the test, regardless of how well you think you will do on it. Even if you fail the Departmental Exam, you now know exactly what you need to study for the final before the course has even started.**

[Easter Egg Generator](https://classes.osu.edu/class-search/#/)

**The Ohio State Testing Center does not display all Departmental Exams on their site.** This isn't their fault, these departments don't communicate with them. These tests are very rarely taken, and most departments forget they even claimed to offer them. To find a test, search for a class on the website above. I've sent emails to various departments with a screenshot of the class and the description saying that it is available for EM credit and usually the department will honor that. It never hurts to contact a department and ask about these tests.

**Notes:**

**You only get one shot at Departmental Exams, there are no retakes.**

**Like with all other tests on this list. Departmental Exams do not affect GPA and there is no negatives to failing the test, aside from lowered self-esteem, wasted time, and potentially wasted money.**

DSST

*Fun Fact: Unless you are getting a degree in the military, these tests seem pointless.*

[DSST Site](https://www.getcollegecredit.com/exam_fact_sheets/)

[Ohio State DSST Policy](https://registrar.osu.edu/priorlearning/dsst-tests.html)

**Pricing:**

$85 for the test, plus $30 for ***The Ohio State University***  ""Administrative Fee""

**Discounts:**

Military Affiliated Testers (Active, Guard, Reserve, AF/N/ROTC with CAC): **Free**

Ohio Military Reserves: **No Administrative Fee**

I have yet to take a DSST. If I'm being honest, I probably never will. I'm only putting this on here because someone may want to take one, or need to take one to complete their CCAF (if you don't know what that is, you don't need to know).

**Notes:**

**Ohio State only awards credit for three DSST exams**

**Passing or failing will not affect GPA**

**If you fail, you can always pay to retake the test or test out in another way.**

If you are still reading this, you might just end up taking one of these tests. Thanks to [u/dashofsalt72](https://www.reddit.com/u/dashofsalt72/) making a comment on my last post, I've learned about a non-profit called The Modern States. Their goal is to make the first year of college free for everyone, and they are doing that in an amazing way. Here are the highlights:

**Free online classes**

**Free CLEP Vouchers**

**Administrative Fee Reimbursement at testing centers**

There must be a catch, right?

Kind of. You must be willing to put in some work and actually study for the test. The Modern States courses can take anywhere between a few hours and 40+ hours to complete depending on the class. You must also pass their own in-house exam before they will give you a CLEP Test voucher. **The in-house exam is to gauge your preparedness for the CLEP Test, it does not award any college credit.** I am currently taking the Calculus 1, Business Law, and Business Marketing classes on the Modern States site. So far, I can't see any downside to this program. It is not the most mobile friendly. They have an app, but it's rough around the edges. You get what you pay for I guess. I will never complain if someone else is willing to pay for my college.

TL;DR

Tests are cheap, sometimes even free. College is expensive. Taking these tests can help you graduate early, free up time during hectic semesters, and/or allow you to get a minor more easily. Not being required to take a stressful (or boring class) is a great feeling. There are also some power moves. Knowing what's on the final for a course, or bypassing Ohio State's ~~pointless and frustrating way they attempt to limit education~~ pre-requisite and college admissions policies is a wonderful thing.

The more people that utilize services such as CLEP, EM, and Departmental Exams, the better. One or two students taking a test here or there won't bring about any major changes. But if Ohio State suddenly sees that these tests are becoming ""a new norm"" in regards to ***The College Experience***, they may just begin increasing the number of courses that can be tested out of. Kent State University has a massive list of what I think is 100+ courses that students can test out of. I don't know what Ohio State's is, but I know it isn't that. I would love to see every ""easy A"" or general education course have an option to be tested out of.

**Don't look at these tests as potentially losing $60, look at them as potentially saving thousands.**

For more information, feel free to PM me or type your question down below. I have taken almost every CLEP test there is. I would be more than happy to help you with what I know. The sooner you take these tests, the more time and money you can save.

For more information, PM me. I have taken nearly every CLEP test there is, and I am starting to take EM Tests/Departmental Tests now. I'd be more than happy to help you with what I know. I have been able to test out of over a full semester of college, saving thousands of dollars. Had I done this sooner, I probably could have tested out of over two, maybe even three. The sooner you take these tests, the better. Just **be sure to study**.",1604088974,1,0

Thoughts on Commons on Kinnear?,"I'm looking into apartments for next year, and was wondering what people thought of Commons on Kinnear! All the posts I could find were mostly old or not relevant to what I'm interested in, so I thought I'd make a new one.

The main reason I'm looking into them is because their apartments are marked as wheelchair accessible. This is a must for me, so if anyone could speak to how accessible they really are, I'd appreciate it! I don't need handles in the shower or anything, but I do need to be able to get a wheelchair in and out. It doesn't necessarily need to go into the bathroom though. If there are some units that aren't wheelchair accessible, please let me know!

They also allow pets with a fee, but does anyone know how they handle fish tanks? They don't produce hair and there's no risk of them getting out, so in theory that would make the pet deposit less necessary. It's a pretty small tank that doesn't weigh much. I would love to know how this has been handled in the past.

Are they still doing that thing where they automatically charge you $300 for cleaning? I saw that's been a problem in past years. They don't have a security deposit which is cool, but they can't charge for normal wear and tear, so I would hope they stopped that. I'll probably still choose them if all else is okay, but I want to know I'm gonna need to contact SLS in advance.

Any general thoughts on the units is appreciated as well. The prices seem pretty reasonable and it's in a good location, so it seems a bit too good to be true.",1604010638,1,0

Stairothon kids have been shitting inside Morrill tower,"I was going down to the basement of Morrill tower last evening to cry in my safe space ( my RA took my substantial supply of horse tranquilizers). I had already began crying and I didn‚Äôt want the women‚Äôs water polo team making fun of me again (they already started the rumor that I have a micro penis) so I took the stairs. 

As I was walking down the stairs I noticed a bunch of sweaty men and women going up and down. They looked half fucking dead and nearly ran me over. Anyways as I got to the basement level after dodging several ‚Äústairathon‚Äù participants, I saw that the finishers were shitting on the ground. 

It was absolutely disgusting and went against everything my pastor has taught me. They were high fiving, and shitting everywhere. When I confronted them they very quickly put the fecal matter in their backpacks and tried to tell me it was chocolate fudge. As I brought up the smell they realized that they couldn‚Äôt bullshit me and ran out the door. 

The smell was abysmal, and they left raw chicken breast all over the place. If anyone sees any member of the ‚Äústairothon club‚Äù please let them know that u/asapRockyPenis wishes them a very unpleasant evening and hopes that they are ticketed for public defamation. If I still had my horse tranquilizers, I would not share them with any members of the stairathon club.",1604008669,1,0

MOLGEN 5607 vs 5623,"I‚Äôm studying environmental molecular sciences, working on planning my schedule for my last 2 semesters at OSU.  I have a molecular biology component of my degree, and either one of these classes will fill that requirement for me.  I want to choose the class that will be easier for me, and hopefully more applicable in my future.  Genetics and Genomics, 5623, is offered spring 21 taught by Amacher and Hollick.  Cell Biology, 5607, is offered fall 21 with Herman and Meier.  I have a decent amount of flexibility with my other classes, so I could really take either one of these.  Neither one has a syllabus available to view on the syllabus search, and searching this subreddit gave me practically no info.  Both my academic advisor and faculty advisor didn‚Äôt really have any opinions on these classes either. 

Can anyone attest to these courses in terms of workload, exams, professor quality, grading scheme, or anything else important?  I‚Äôve generally liked my MOLGEN and MICRBIO classes at OSU, I just wish the professors would do more to relate the topics outside of medicine.  Most of my microbiology experience outside of school is in soil and stream systems, but I‚Äôm definitely willing to look past that.  Really, any advice or recommendations would be appreciated.

Help-Any way to take a prerequisite concurrently(at the same time) with another class?,"I'm an international student, already in my 5th year bc I had medical issues that prevented me from being able to graduate on time. My visa only allows me to stay until end of SP21(next semester).  
 I have two requirements left to graduate. Psych 2220 and Psych 3321. but 2220 is a pre-req for 3321. I've already taken stats data analysis before so i'm confident that I can do well in 2220. My advisor suggested that I stay a whole another semester(au21) to take 3321 and that i should take 2220 in the spring semester. First of all, it isnt feasible to take one class per semester because I have to be full time as an international student, second I'm not even fucking allowed to stay past sp21 at OSU.   


My advisor also suggested that I switch to B.A. in psych to graduate next semester but I have worked my ass off trying to graduate with a B.S. in psychology because it is pertinent and directly related to my future career.   


I know there is a pre-req waiver form- if I got a professor on board to approve that for me- would my advisor still be able to stop me from taking 2220 and 3321 at the same time? I find it ridiculous that when I have the knowledge necessary to succeed in 2220-im not allowed to take it. I have already taken higher level psychology courses that use data analysis extensively. I have done very well in those courses and never struggled.   


  
Y'all- what do I do? I dont want to but im panicking. Also, when I reached out to my advisor this summer to talk about my graduation requirements, this never came up- the issue of taking 2220 never came up and we talked about my graduation requirements together to make sure I was not missing anything.",1603902686,1,0

Coronavirus: am I a shitty person for partying,"I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm gonna get downvoted to hell but here goes. Everyone seems to think that any socializing makes you a bad person.

Welp, one person showed symptoms on Monday so we all started isolating. We all got tested and the only negative already had it last month. So do my fellow buckeyes truly believe I‚Äôm a shitty person for what I‚Äôve done? I feel that I have done nothing wrong and some of y‚Äôall need to lighten up",1599892514,1,0
Please be careful,"Today around 8:30pm, I was walking back alone to my dorm from my union garage. While I was crossing a crosswalk, a black SUV was stopped right behind it because of the red light. The man in the SUV rolled down his window and called out for me. He said, ‚ÄúExcuse me!‚Äù and I turned around and he asked, ‚ÄúDo you know where the OSU campus is?‚Äù In my mind, I thought... that‚Äôs weird... he‚Äôs driving on OSU campus... literally right next to the union. I was already 2 steps from the sidewalk before I turned around and responded. I told him he was driving on OSU campus and I made sure I was loud and clear in case he couldn‚Äôt hear me from under my mask. After I responded, he said ‚ÄúCan you come closer and tell me?‚Äù Those were his exact words and that was a huge red flag so I just turned back around and continued walking, ignoring him as his continuously called out ‚ÄúExcuse me! Excuse me!‚Äù to try to get my attention. I quickly crossed and walked closely behind two girls in case he decided to follow me. Thank you to the two girls who didn‚Äôt make it awkward and just allowed me to stay close. You might‚Äôve potentially saved me. Please, please, please never ever go up to a stranger or their vehicle when they ask you to. If they have a genuine question and could not hear your response, they will tell you to repeat it or speak up. A genuine person would never ask you to step closer. Please stay safe.

If you are considering signing a lease for the 2020-2021 rental term, please watch this short video provided by Student Legal Services in partnership with The Office of Student Life's Off-Campus and Commuter Student Services and The Student Wellness Center.  

[https://go.osu.edu/smooth-move-video](https://go.osu.edu/smooth-move-video?fbclid=IwAR025Q4DZtxe2I2CU5OUOc_GCijxgMGAbO4FktwK733OVm7GqhBAkrawSNY) 

At this time, Student Legal Services is strongly encouraging students not to sign leases for 2020-2021 until at least Spring.  We have always felt that the leasing season begins too soon.  In this time of uncertainty, we are even more concerned about students signing leases at this time.  

Many questions you have regarding this post will be answered by the video.  However, please feel free to reach out to SLS directly after watching if you have questions. 

All this being said, we understand that students will be signing leases, and we want to help!  So, regardless of when you sign, please schedule an appointment with Student Legal Services ([studentlegal.osu.edu](http://studentlegal.osu.edu/?fbclid=IwAR025Q4DZtxe2I2CU5OUOc_GCijxgMGAbO4FktwK733OVm7GqhBAkrawSNY)) for a lease review.",1599781230,1,0

The 4th Floor of Busch stranded me on North Sentinel Island,"So about two to three weeks ago the 4th floor of Busch mysteriously vanished. No one able to get in our get out of the floor. Unfortunately, I was one of the students trapped in the floor, and I just found a way out for the first time. My only source of food was old saltine crackers along with water from the hallway. I tried contacting housing to help get us out but they said they were too busy dealing with COVID issues.

I honestly thought that I would never find my way out. But yesterday, I tried one last time to open the exit door and guess what, it opened! I was overcome with joy knowing that I could finally go outside and walk to the famous Morrill Traditions. But when I opened the door I walked onto a large sandy beach and saw a tropical forest directly in front of me. The 4th seemed to have transported itself out of the void and ended up stranded on some island. 

I opened up google maps to find my location, and when it told me where I was my heart dropped. I was stranded on North Sentinel Island. If you don‚Äôt know what this place is, North Sentinel Island is held by an ancient tribe that are known for being extremely violent towards trespassers. In 2006, the people killed two fishermen that crashed their boat here and in 2018 they killed a guy who  was trying to teach them Christianity.

I tried going back into the 4th floor but when I turned around the door was gone. I am currently hiding out in the rainforest feeding on berries and tree bark. I can tell the people here are looking for me and they are hungry. I don‚Äôt know if this post will even reach OSU reddit but if does someone please send a helicopter or a jet ski so I can get off this island.",1599755933,1,0

Issues w/ OCIO and Teams,"Context: Staff are being encouraged to use Microsoft Teams in this remote environment. With Buckeye Box and Skype for Business going away, it isn't like we have an option. 

Is anyone else annoyed with how much functionality OCIO locks down? I understand needing to be secure - but they disable so many functions, it renders it useless. How does enabling us to create a private channel in Teams create a security risk? Even the departmental IT people who understand the back-end security risks complain about how OCIO makes so many things useless.

If you take a training on Teams, it seems really cool until you get in the system and realize OCIO takes away a lot of the functionality.

A number of people on the University side are trying to add Med Center people to their Teams and can't. Microsoft Reps say they have access. OCIO says they can't help and to contact Med Center IT. Med Center IT says med center people should be able to be added as guest, and they don't have server access to Teams, so OCIO has to deal with it.

Has anyone been able to successfully add Med Center employees to a Team they created?",1600894522,1,0

Feeling unmotivated? Stuggling with online classes?,"So I'm going to preface this by saying this may not apply to all however:

When i am feeling unmotivated in watching lectures or doing things I have found that fixing how they appear can really make a difference.

Also when taking notes on onenote- if i am feeling burnt out with a class i switch the color im writing with to something else that is still legible but will refresh the experience of writing things down.

Finally INVEST IN BLUE LIGHT GLASSES. The eye strain is real since we are all basically on our computers all the time now. You may not notice it now but once you have them you wont want to work without them. Amazon has cute ones for like $8, it is worth it just to try.

Why I cringe when I read ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so demotivated‚Äù,"Unpopular opinion:
I‚Äôve been reading this subreddit and I just cringe hard when people say ‚Äú I‚Äôm feeling demotivated this semester‚Äù or ‚Äúzoom fatigue‚Äù etc... I understand that it‚Äôs harder to be a student especially if you‚Äôre back at home with your parents/siblings trying to talk to you mid zoom session or you don‚Äôt have a ideal space to physically tune into class. However I just don‚Äôt understand why motivation is the reason why this semester is so much harder. We pay so much money to this uni and at the end of the day all want a degree to have a stable long term income; College was never fun or motivating it‚Äôs literally a strategic investment to have a more stable life for the future and going to college is not only on opportunity to have the ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù but an opportunity not everyone can afford. If you‚Äôre feeling demotivated about school this year then you‚Äôre lucky to have that luxury to put it bluntly. If you really needed the degree you‚Äôre aiming for then being demotivated just is not an option. 
This pandemic if anything is showing how important having a degree/marketable skill is (the luxury of working home is not open to everyone). So for people to feel this way makes me confused. Obviously if your mental health is at stake defiantly seek help but if demotivation is literally your reason for not doing your assignments and putting off things to the last minute then honestly what are you doing in college?",1600803785,1,0
Covid Mental Heath,"Is anyone else really struggling to have a reason to wake up everyday? I haven't done anything fun besides play video games or seen any friends for over a month.

I seriously didn't even realize a whole month has past it feels like a blur when each day is exactly the same and there's nothing to look forward to. I started talking to CCS for depression but it really hasn't been very helpful it just feels like there's no end in sight to all this and I spend a lot of time being sad and lonely and not productive.

I could go to a bar but I would feel guilty about spreading covid and drinking alone doesn't sound particularly fun. It's tough to listen to parties across the street or see videos of people at bars and not feel really jealous and hopeless that I might not get to do those things in my last year at osu. Its also basically impossible to date anyone right now besides on tinder or bumble and I get very few matches even when I think im pretty attractive and worked hard on my profile.

Could I get in trouble for this?,"At the start of COVID I posted multiple textbook questions to chegg from various homeworks for a math class. This was a fairly unorganized section of class and I vitally needed help on the homework (the professor was incredibly rude to me during officer hours).

In the syllabus there was nothing regarding academic misconduct or homework policy. The only time in which we had to sign something for academic misconduct was before exams (which I never cheated on). 

I obviously regret these actions and haven't done anything similar since. That said, if for some reason they do become noticed could I get in trouble? Additionally, would multiple homework assignments in one class give me multiple strikes? Would I get a single strike for homework in one class or do I just get expelled for multiple dumb things I did in freshmen year?

I'm considering just dropping out since if I can just get expelled at any moment no matter what I do, then no point in trying to stay or be better right? Not sure what I'd do if I did though.",1608288066,0,0

Spots available in Math 2010S Intersections of Mathematics and Society: Hidden Figures for SP'21,"This week the course volunteers met with instructors to get ready for the next iteration of Math 2010S Intersections of Mathematics and Society: Hidden Figures. The volunteers all have a wide variety of backgrounds (math bio, immunology, economics, finance, engineering, data analytics, social networks, and education) and are excited to interact with students!

The goal of the course is critically examine relationship between math, technological advancement, and society, and also to answer the important question, what career options do I have with quantitative skills? 

If you're fascinated by history, excited about connecting with professional leaders, and interesting in learning about some really neat mathematics that was central during the Space Race enroll in Math 2010S today! There are no exams, only pre-calc is required, and the instructors have experience in teaching online (prior to COVID).",1608244691,3,0

Looking to move? My lovely apartment's available (1 bedroom; $680/mo) - Need to get out of lease and will pay half of your first month's rent!,"**Basically...**

I need to move as a result of the pandemic (SO lives in another state and my teaching at OSU is online for the foreseeable future). The lovely landlord offered to let me out of my lease if I find a replacement tenant. My apartment is a 1 bedroom in the historic [Hotel St Clair](https://www.hotelstclairapts.com/).

**Rent &amp; lease info**

Rent would be $680.00. Utilities are a flat monthly rate of $50.00 for water, high speed internet, and waste. Electric is separate with AEP and averages $22/mo.

You would sign a 1 year lease with the leasing office. The application fee is $50 for a credit/background check. The minimum credit score is 620, but a lower scores can be accepted with a co-signer.

**Neighborhood**

The building is in the King-Lincoln District. It's a short walk from downtown, CCAD, and OTE. It is a great little community. It is a 15 minute bike ride to campus up 4th St. (Fox in the Snow is exactly halfway, for much needed breakfast stops).

**Discount**

I understand that people are reluctant to move right now. To motivate you: **I'm offering to pay half of your first month's rent if you apply and sign a lease for Jan. 1st!** This is a $340 discount.

I also have some furniture, including a relatively new queen size bed/mattress, I can offer for a *deep* discount. (I do not want to haul this across state lines).

Please let me know if you're interested. I can share some photos or we can also schedule a masked/socially distanced showing in person. Thanks!",1608237715,1,0

Do you have to have an appointment to get a voluntary saliva test done at North Jesse Owens?,"My family (nor my husband‚Äôs family) are having large thanksgiving gatherings this year to be responsive &amp; prevent potential spread. Rather, we are having a simple dinner with just my parents tomorrow (Wednesday) night, as well as a lunch with just his parents Thanksgiving day so that we can responsibly spend time with family still. I want to get tested beforehand for reassurance, but all of the appointment slots are taken up until next Monday (the 30th). Can I go get tested there without an appointment? Or do I have to have an appointment? Sometimes I get lucky &amp; slots will open in the mornings from cancellations, if I *have* to have an appointment, but obviously everybody leaving campus is in need of a test so there‚Äôs few openings.

So I just got assigned a HUGE project right before thanksgiving,"I rarely come here to complain, but I just need to let out some steam.  I was having an okayish day, relatively caught up on assignments but still a ways to go on everything.  I take a break this evening, and I notice a carmen notification pop up from a core CSE class i'm in for graduation this spring.  I open the assignment and I shit you not this professor just dropped a mother fucking LARGE project on the class, two days before thanksgiving break starts.

Un-fucking-believable, so much so that ever since I've just been literally seething re-reading this over and over again.  Furthermore, I'm willing to be my life's fucking fortune this guy will be stuffing his freaking face over Thanksgiving while I legitimately slave away at this shit, ON TOP OF all the other things I still have to start, let alone studying for, you know, finals.

I just declined the student health insurance and hit ‚ÄúAccept‚Äù on the award. However, I‚Äôm not sure how that works in terms of paying tuition etc. and I‚Äôm still waiting on that to process, because I can‚Äôt pay the tuition yet until the statement of account updates to the correct amount. I have direct deposit set up as well for the surplus that the award should be giving, will they just transfer that too once all is said and done?

And that‚Äôs the last time I use the osu bookstore...,"Let me preface this by saying that I‚Äôve used the bookstore for textbooks in the past and it‚Äôs been overpriced but otherwise super convenient and good. But for some reason they completely messed up every single step of my order this semester. First of all, I was not given or charged my correct order in august and they replaced used rentals with new rentals and requested rentals with purchases. They said that they didn‚Äôt actually have my requested order in stock so they just replaced things and charged me more without giving me a changed receipt. Whatever, I assumed it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. I returned my rental textbooks in early November when I no longer needed them, but I guess the employee did not input them correctly and he also said he would send me an electronic receipt which apparently the bookstore does not do??? I don‚Äôt know what ghost employee I handed my books. So I got an email saying that I had to pay for the books I had already returned. After telling them the exact date, time, location, outfit I was wearing, and telling them to check security tapes, they marked my rentals as returned. But I still has another issue. In august they apparently gave me a rental textbook without a sticker on it, no receipt that said it was a rental, told me in august I just purchased it new, and now it was overdue. After multiple days on the phone, the VERY helpful employees sorted my problems out and I shipped my rental textbook back. They already had taken the money out of my bank account and it could be days until I get it back for the books that I gave back. The bookstore managed to mess up every single step of my order and it was incredibly infuriating. Thankfully, the employees were super helpful at getting it solved, even though it took a while. But yeah, I don‚Äôt think I want to risk going through all that again. I just thought I‚Äôd share in case anyone had similar problems this semester/in the past with the bookstore.",1609256953,1,0

Get me out of my lease by signing a 1 year lease for my lovely apartment and I'll pay half your first month's rent!,"**Basically...**

I need to move as a result of the pandemic (SO lives in another state and my teaching at OSU is online for the foreseeable future). The lovely landlord offered to let me out of my lease if I find a replacement tenant. My apartment is a 1 bedroom in the historic [Hotel St Clair](https://www.hotelstclairapts.com/).

**Rent &amp; lease info**

Rent would be $680.00. Utilities are a flat monthly rate of $50.00 for water, high speed internet, and waste. Electric is separate with AEP and averages \~$22/mo.

You would sign a 1 year lease with the leasing office. The application fee is $50 for a credit/background check. The minimum credit score is 620, but a lower scores can be accepted with a co-signer.

**Neighborhood**

The building is in the King-Lincoln District. It's a short walk from downtown, CCAD, and OTE. It is a great little community. It is a 15 minute bike ride to campus up 4th St. (Fox in the Snow is exactly halfway, for much needed breakfast stops).

**Discount**

I understand that people are reluctant to move right now. To motivate you: **I'm offering to pay half of your first month's rent if you apply and sign a lease for Feb. 1st!** This is a $340 discount.

I also have some furniture, including a relatively new queen size bed/mattress, I can offer for a *deep* discount. (I do not want to haul this across state lines).

ivy-equivalent vs OSU?,"I was lucky enough to get into a top 10 school early (nonbinding).

Rationally I know that most of the successful adults in my life have gotten where they are through hard work and not through a name, but the environment + school I go to pushes the idea that top schools= success.

 I even just mentioned going here and my friends asked me if I was insane for turning down such an amazing opportunity, and that I would hate it at osu because the majority of our school ends up there.

Information systems application?,"I am going to apply for the business program and on there i am putting information systems as my first choice.

UPDATE: I FOUND GLOVER,"Holy shit I can't believe this is happening. So there i was last night, at my nightly poop alone (I don't want to spread my Covid bacteria over the bathroom stall as I have a tendency to obliterate my rectum as well as the toilet seat itself with Taco Bell's sweet sweet $5 cravings boxüòçüòç) it was around 1:23 AM in the morning and I was a bit constipated when all of a sudden Glover came down, looked from underneath the stall at my massive weiner and said, ""hey, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey"" he then left the bathroom and I thought to myself ""Holy fuck this is so true, I gotta chill an enjoy the ride"" so I then proceeded to enjoy my constipation and live in the moment, enjoying all the sights and sounds and internal feelings of severe constipation.

This morning, when I woke up after that gorgeous poop, I decided to give myself a little treat (I got up out of bed, yay me!!!!üòÅüòÅ) And bought a cocktail mix of 15 mg SARMS, 500mg Tren, 150mg test, 50 mg proviron, and 50 mg of dbol.

Is it possible to become an honor student as a CC transfer?,"Hello, 

I'll be starting classes at Columbus State Community College in the Summer of 2021 with the intent to transfer to Ohio State for Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. I'm 25 years old with a GED, I was just very unmotivated in high school, but it's dramatically changed. I really want to make the most out of my college experience (in a productive way, rather than a party life kind of way). 

Anyways, would it be possible to become an honor student after transferring? My idea of an honor student is someone who did exceptionally well in high school, was on top of everything, pretty much the complete opposite of what I was, lol. 

There are some places I'm interested in applying for internships that have special programs for specifically for honor students. I'm not completely sure what the process is to become an honors student, but if it's based on grades, I'm not trying to sound cocky, but I believe I can get really good grades while I'm at CC, I'm going to do my best and aim for a 4.0,  so if going this path would open more doors for me, I would greatly appreciate any information or advice!

Looking for Experiences with Retroactive Withdrawal,"So I'm graduating in May, and around 2018 I was doing very badly with my mental health, and I failed a ton of classes, and it ruined my GPA. Doing much better now, and I had some encouragement from one of my professors who mentioned he did RW when he was in undergrad and its basically why he ended up getting his PhD. I never even gave it a shot so I figured I would but I'm not even sure where to start, there is very little centralized information about this. I'm also not sure if I could even still do this two years down the road. The paperwork I have about it is old, my therapist I was seeing at the time doesn't work at OSU anymore, and I haven't seen my psychiatrist here in almost a year and a half. 

All that being said I had a successful SAP appeal regarding all of this to reinstate my financial aid, which was a pain in the ass but I think I at least have a case if I could be approved by SFS. I will contact my advisor about dealing with all of this but I was wondering if I could get some information here first. Has anyone successfully done this for mental health reasons or the like? How long did time pass before you did the RW? How many semesters did you do it for? Feel free to DM me if you don't feel comfortable posting on the thread.",1607133673,3,0
This new compassion for mental illness needs to continue past the pandemic,"People were struggling before and will be struggling after. This pandemic has shown a lot of things.

Extension that couldn't be given can be given. 40% of the class shouldn't fail to make a statement and gloating about that makes you a shitty teacher.

Don't get me wrong. Weed out classes and stressing the students to teach them how to handle that is needed. But the lies of school and the industry about the inflexibility of the real has been unequivocally been proven bullshit.

I feel like it should talk more about APA to make people more comfortable with it since I imagine most high schools only teach MLA. I could be wrong though",1607130760,22,0

Psych 2367.01,"Whatever you do don‚Äôt take this class with Kenneth Slagell, i had the worst experience this semester. Every writing assignment had extremely vague prompts and he continued to grade harshly on things that weren‚Äôt in the rubric. Then for the final presentation there was absolutely no rubric or guidelines to follow. Every assignment is just a guessing game. Also all the writing assignments are multiple parts and he doesn‚Äôt give the grades back for the first parts until after the submission for the final draft of that writing assignment, so don‚Äôt expect to be able to fix his critiques before your final draft.",1607124273,2,0
Group screwed me over. No one will help me.,"I am in my second to last semester (came from a community college to finish my last two years here) I am retaking psych 2300 this semester, as I didn't get the C- requirement the first time. There was a group project due, however I was unaware until october that I was even in a group. So I came into our GroupMe late but I started out by apologizing and saying whatever they needed from me to help, I'll do it. All semester I kept asking what they needed me to do but they never delegated me anything to help. The due date comes and they turn it in without me. I am now going to fail the class and have no chance of graduating. I reached out to the professor and he said that since I didn't attend lecture (not required by syllabus and all class materials were available outside of synchronous sessions, not to mention my mental health has plummeted worse than I could ever imagine this semester) that he wouldn't help me. I reached out to student advocacy and my advisor, all telling me that his word is final and there isn't anything they will do. I sent screen shots of proof that I was actively trying to get them to help me get up to speed with them and never getting anywhere but still no help came.

I am lost, hurt, and confused. I acknowledge I should have been more ""active"" in the class but that still wouldn't have changed the fact my group hanged me out to dry. My parents are footing the bill for my schooling and they are not very understanding people and will put all the blame on me so I have a feeling this will be the end of my education unless a miracle occurs. Any advice anyone has would be greatly appreciated and thank you in advanced.",1607123450,6,0

-working out/swimming

-cooking/baking

-movies/Netflix/criminal minds

Director of HR - Susan Basso Out,"I know there has been a bit of talk on here about the Director of HR (aka the lady who tried cutting employee tuition benefits during a pandemic) ""stepping down."" When a new President comes they are going to put their people in place, and it is pretty obvious people are asked to leave in these cases so the President can put in who they want. Nothing out of the ordinary.

I've been around awhile, and it usually happens like how the Provost's happened. Notice is given and they leave at the end of a semester or academic year. Gives people time to plan or find something else. I found it super bizarre that Susan's ousting was immediate. President Johnson's email said Susan would be ""Taking time to reflect on her 25 year career and determine where her efforts can best be utilized."" Seems like a low key slam. Also, Susan's out of office email message saying she no longer works at OSU is written in third person. 

Does anyone know what really happened? I also find it really interesting that she made this huge change a mere weeks before the WorkDay go live. Career Roadmap  was Susan's baby, and that hasn't even happened yet either. I'm really surprised that in the middle of such huge HR transitions, the person driving it was ousted. 

I wasn't a fan - the tuition benefit cut was tone deaf and insulting. I went to some forums Susan spoke at and she loved giving non-answers, and acted blindsided when she was asked about staff concerns. Seemed out of touch. I'm just curious if maybe President Johnson realized this, and took action to get her out ASAP. I can't imagine the plan from Day 1 was for it to go down like this. Who has the details?",1607116452,0,0

OSU should totally have an Interpretations of US history through Film course.,"I don't know if it would be an art credit, history credit, or something else, but essentially the class would be an elective fill for most people taking it and the course load would be to watch a film made in various time periods and interpreting what was going on in US history during that time. 

So take for example the movie The Blob, which was made in 1958. A horror movie with an inhuman monster as the antagonist. The class would watch this film, then give interpretations as to why the film was so successful at the time and what elements of the public zeitgeist made it into the film. The class would compare it to other films of the same genera of the time. Finally, they would go through a few readings and class discussion of the things that were happening during that time and what could have inspired or modified public perception of film at that time.

I think another good question this class could ask its students is whether the Films motivated public perception, Public perception motivated the film, or both. (I.E. The blob being motivated by the views of Nazi-ism in Germany and the Germans at the time doing inhuman things, Monroe area films informing the public of their views on communism and reinforcing that view point, or a film like starwars being inspired by the space race and pushing the imagination of individuals as to what technology could accomplish)

The Final should be for students to watch a modern film (to be approved by the professor) and interpret that film to see what it says about the current generation's views. 

I think this would be a fun elective fill class for many students, be relevant in enhancing critical thinking skills and show students an aspect to film that they may not have noticed. The films should probably be well known films of the time and be chosen off of the most financially successful films.

The class should also be an easy A class. I've taken too many ""Fun classes"" that took themselves too seriously and have been bogged down by a professor who cared too much about challenging students. If the students can apply the knowledge given to them in class and turn in the papers with some applied knowledge, then it should essentially be an incredibly simple class that makes you WANT to go to it and look forward to it.",1607087849,1,0

Since a lot of classes were in person this semester, they actually used these spaces to stay socially distant and study/hang out after class.
