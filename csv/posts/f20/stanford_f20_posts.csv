Drop CS 229,"Im a student in CS 229.

I have a very very weak math background (Math courses taken at a much less rigorous school). I can usually grasp things quickly, but this seems like an impossible task. I literally know about 10% of the math even being mentioned in the course. For anybody else who was in my shoe, were you able to get through the course? It seems like there is only so much I can do before I run out of time in the day. Is CS 221 more suited for a less math heavy background? Or what other courses?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.",1600986821,1,0
Office Hours,"I'm a freshman right now, and before school started I was thinking about how it would be great to go to office hours, but I quickly realized that in practice I actually learn way better just by sitting alone and going through the course material, looking stuff up if I have questions. That means I pretty much have not gone to any office hours (but I have talked with people on discord who are in my classes). I've always kind of been a self-learner in STEM subjects and I should have known that my habits would carry over to college. I don't think not going to office hours is harming me in any way in terms of learning, but it means I don't really interact with professors at all. Is this something that I should work on changing immediately?",1600981050,1,0

Getting rejected from everything,"Frosh here. Everything that I've applied for since coming to Stanford (ESF, introsems, two different club programs) I've gotten rejected or waitlisted from.

Andrew Ng bootcamp / Stanford ML Group research assistant experience?,"I mean, the AI+Climate Change or AI+Healthcare bootcamp, as a part of Stanford ML Group (Prof. Andrew Ng)

I'm wondering if anyone has done either and can give any reviews? I somehow cracked the interviews and got the chance to join the current intake. I'm a first year MS CS student, did my bachelors in Asia.

I checked the profiles of past participants and seems like the majority are working as ML Engineers at larger companies and startups. That's the direction I want to go towards. But I wonder, did they get connections thru the bootcamp to help them get these jobs, or they just applied online to those jobs like everybody else? So, did doing the bootcamp actually give any value for their job search?

From what I read on this sub from posts made a few years ago, the program seems lackluster (despite all the big ""hype"" around Andrew Ng) and involves a lot of grunt work (like cleaning data, etc), and high time commitment. But I guess it's ok if I can meet others and build connections. I'm in my first year, and haven't really met any other students so far..",1600698766,1,0

Failed Placement Exam,"I know there probably isn’t anyone who cares, but I did very poorly on my Spanish Placement Exam and am considering not taking a language at all this year. I am enrolled in Spanish 1, but after a few days I figured I was too ahead of my class to be fit there.

I do have a background with Spanish. I worked with a lot of agricultural workers in lemon and avocado fields. I’m super good at listening and reading for comprehension, and less so for details and literary devices. The only thing is I have a horrible stutter when I speak Spanish. I used to have a bad stutter as a kid, although I never received help for it, it went away. When I try to actually speak Spanish, I can’t even get a sentence out. It gets stuck in my throat.

The most I can do is answer my professor when I’m called on, and help my classmates when they’re stuck. But I can’t have a reciprocal conversation.

The online test felt okay. I thought I did as well as I could have. But my performance in the Oral Interview was so bad that my interviewer just switched to English for the last parts of the interview. 

They said I was too stressed, anxious, and needed more practice and that I would stay in Spanish 1. My only issue was with speaking so I asked if I could be moved to Spanish 1A, so I could be with people who were more proficient with the language so I could try to catch up. But they said that it’d probably be better if I just stayed where I was.

I’m feeling very bummed out and want to drop Spanish altogether. And when I say that I mean I haven’t been able to stop crying for about three hours.",1600477270,1,0

Honor Code question,"Hi, I'm a new grad student, and I have a question about the honor code. 

In this class I'm taking, I thought I had a pretty good understanding of the first lecture. I noticed someone was struggling with it, and he posted a request asking for a tutor, and I was sort of expecting that because I could tell he want getting it during OHs. I want to help, and I definitely do not want him to pay me, I just want to explain the lecture in my own words to him hoping he'll get it. During undergrad I did that a lot with some of my classmates and I like to think I'm pretty good at breaking things down (if I understand them). 

But the thing is, if you understand the lecture, the first assignment becomes pretty easy. Really easy. My fear is that in a way, it could be seen as unpermitted aid? And that's a violation of the honor code. I really feel bad not being able to help when I know I can but I don't want to get in any trouble, especially since I just started here. 

I also can't guarantee that I'll understand all future material in the course the way I understand the first lecture, so I don't want to come helping now only to disappear later on. And I'm also worried about being persuaded to just ""attempt"" the assignment while I'm teaching him if he still doesn't get it. So I guess this is more of a soft skills question too.

Would you advise me to just mind my business and hope another TA helps/he finds a paid tutor who can help him? Or do you think I should say something? And what steps do you think I should take to ensure I don't put myself in trouble?",1600293775,1,0

But undergrad dept and grad dept are separate and don't talk, so nobody is taking a look at my whole transcript to see if I meet every single requirement.

Had a chat with AAD but they don't really know any specifics outside of general information

Is there any resource (maybe on Axess?) that can tell me if I'm ok to graduate with my 2 degrees or not?

I already scoured every possible resource and I'm 99.99% sure I will graduate. But I'm just slightly worried something will go wrong when I apply to graduate (I can't apply rn because I'm waiting on some paperwork to be completed).",1600226531,1,0

CME 193 Worth It? And some other questions from a frosh.,"Frosh here taking CS 106B, PWR, a language class. I'm also signed up for 3 one unit classes, but might swap some. I have a few questions: is CME 193 (Intro to Scientific Python) worth it to take, or should I just study it on my own? Would taking this many one unit classes be fine, or is it too much for first quarter? 

Also, I know this is a WHILE away, but how does grad school view a ton of one unit classes on the transcript? Do they see it as someone trying to take easy classes and discount the student, or do they simply ignore those classes? I know S/NC is pretty heavily debated (especially this year) so I am curious about this, because I want to get introduced to lots of classes but wouldn't mind learning the material on my own if it would harm me in the future. Thanks!",1600212816,1,0
Best hard skills classes for social sciences,"Hi! As a social sciences person, what classes would you recommend to learn more hard skills? I have taken STATS 101 and CS 106A.

Opportunity for Stanford Students to help high school students," Hi everyone!  I am the CEO and founder of The  Neuroscience Fellowship.  This is an organization dedicated to teaching  neuroscience to younger students. We bring university level students  experienced in neuroscience to teach high school students interested in  the field. 

We are currently expanding to also include a student panel,  where students from universities across Canada and the US can answer  questions from high school students. The panel will be about university  life, how to study, post graduate life,  job opportunities etc.  It would be great if you are a neuroscience student, but we are more then happy to take on university students who are studying something else. 

Right now my team and I are looking for  panelists. If you are interested in sharing your experience with high  school students please fill out this form. This is a one time commitment, it  should not be too time demanding.  The panel will be this Saturday from 5-6:30 Pm EST.  If you are interested, please fill out this form.

Changing PWR2 to different quarter/year (on flex quarter),"Alright this is really late into the game and all, but I'm planning on taking a flex quarter for this fall and currently trying to drop my classes down to &lt;= 5 units. I'm planning on taking an introsem (3 units) and maybe fill the other 2 free units for my flex quarter. **The issue is that I'm enrolled for PWR2 this upcoming quarter and didn't realize I couldn't just drop the class on Axess directly... I have to email the PWR department to begin petitioning**. I'm worried that they won't see my email until Monday at the earlier when classes start so I won't have any other option but to either take a full course load or drop my introsem and enroll in PWR2. If I enroll in a full course load, though, I won't be able to drop down to flex later on (I could still take a full leave of absence but wouldn't get all of my tuition back).

This is totally my fault for pushing it off this late, but if anyone knows of a better option that'd be amazing.

Advice for Incoming Frosh,"Some advice for incoming frosh: 

Coursework: Don't drown yourself in classes. Every year, many frosh end up overcommitting academically in fall quarter, despite advice from upperclassmen and academic advisors. Most people will tell you that the best part about Stanford is the people, and it's true. It's difficult to make the most of the Stanford community when you're bogged down with homework and deadlines. Take the time to meet as many people as possible, even if it's virtually!

Introsems: Take them! A great way to interact with professors and your peers in a more intimate setting. [introsems.stanford.edu](https://introsems.stanford.edu)

Academic Progress: You're not in a race with your peers. Don't stress if you feel that others are ahead of you in a course sequence, have coded since high-school or have written 10,000-word research papers. Everyone completes their degree at a different pace, so take your time and take advantage of Stanford's many tutoring and advising resources. Do yourself a favor and go through Stanford at your own pace – more on this below. 

Classes: As many of you will know from high school, it can be easy to get by in some classes without really engaging with the material or learning much from the course. This is also the case for some courses at Stanford. Stanford has world-renowned professors and incredible courses, so make the most of them. The more you put into your classes, the more you'll get out. If you're taking lots of heavy classes in one quarter, you'll quickly find that it can be difficult to stay fully engaged with each course. 

Fast Courses: A faster way to browse through courses than Carta: [https://fastcourses.org](https://fastcourses.org)

Extracurriculars/Student Organizations: Student organizations are a great way to meet people with similar interests and are a cornerstone of many students' undergrad experience. Attend the virtual activities fair and learn more about Stanford's many student organizations. Like classes, don't overcommit yourself and take time to explore organizations that interest you. Feel free to drop a club commitment if it's too much and also know that some student organizations welcome students joining at any time of the year.

Language Requirement: Review the language requirement and think about when you want to start your language course sequence. You can fulfil the requirement anytime during your undergrad career, but some students prefer completing the language course sequence early on. [https://language.stanford.edu/academics/language-requirement](https://language.stanford.edu/academics/language-requirement)

Majors/Minors: Four years is more than enough time to be successful in your major and maybe even pick up a minor or two along the way. Note that if you're considering a double major, you'll have a little  less flexibility with your course selection and more planning is needed earlier on. Having said that, most Stanford undergraduates end up with one major. As mentioned above, if you need to space out difficult major classes over a couple of quarters rather than doing 2-3 core courses in one quarter, give yourself that space. Again, it's not a race. 

Four Year Plans: I won't say too much about these other than they can be useful for some students as a reference point but are likely to change as new courses are offered each year. If you're curious about your progress towards a certain major, read the undergraduate handbook for your major department and speak with your academic advisor. 

WAYS Requirements: If you have extra space in your schedule, consider taking a class that fulfils a certain WAYS requirement. Don't worry too much about this during frosh year, but it can be useful to know what the requirements are and where they'll roughly fit into your undergrad career. [https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/ways/about-ways](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/ways/about-ways)

Final Note: Take courses you enjoy, do things you love, and be true to yourself. You got into Stanford for a reason, and remember that reason is different from everyone else's. Some weeks will be harder than others, some quarters might not go to plan, but keep at it with an open mind and a willingness to work hard, and you'll thrive here at Stanford.

Change of plans and regrets,"Half vent, half hoping that someone else on the subreddit that can relate to me could comment? 

Ever since I was young I was very interested in science, particularly physics and I've always intended on pursuing it in the future. My parents were happy about it because they see STEM has being the ""safe"" way for a job, especially my dad who is a scientist. But for the past 5 years or so I've been starting to have different thoughts as I experienced new things. I'm much more excited and intrigued about political science and history now. In my last 2 years of high school I was thinking that I'm not that interested or good at math, and now after almost being done with my first quarter at Stanford this thought is very much solidified. I really don't like my math and CS class right now (purely for the subject, the professors are great)- only my political science classes right now are giving me any happiness.

I guess I'm a bit nervous about switching from pursuing STEM to humanities, partially because I'm worried about career prospects and I'm worried about my parents disapproving. And also it feels weird to finally admit that I care about humanities more because whenever I had that thought I always tried to convince myself that I wanted to do STEM.

And I'm also feeling a bit regretful because now I've kind of fucked my GPA because I think I'm only going to be able to manage to get a B/B+ in my calculus/CS class. I know those classes are not very relevant to polisci so maybe it doesn't matter that much, but I guess I'm more concerned about just how my overall GPA looks on paper.

Schoodule,"Hey Cardinals!

I've been working on a small project, Schoodule, to help with my workflow for classes and coursework. 

It's a desktop website that serves as a scheduling tool specifically made for students.

This tool provides one location to view all bits of information regarding any course or event that you decide to schedule. You can store and find any:

* Links
* Emails
* Professors/TAs
* Office Hours
* Discussion/Labs
* Important Exam Dates

Each course/event also comes with an included to-do list for those who like to stay extra organized!

I've been using this tool for the last couple of weeks and I've found it very useful-- especially since classes are all online anyway. So, I decided to launch a small beta version for anyone who might be interested in Schoodule.

You can access it at myschoodule.com!Also, if you have any feedback or ideas for improvement, feel free to send it through the feedback section of the website! :)

My question is, is what are my options going forward for the quarter/year. I really wanted to gap but my parents wouldn’t let me. Is this still a possibility? Can i drop out and enroll in next years class without having these courses on my transcript? If I take a LOA, what does that entail with my transcript?

What is approximate Stanford MS EE acceptance rate?,"Hope this doesn't violate the rules since my questions are about Stanford overall and I'm not asking about admission in detail here.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the acceptance rate for EE master's? Quick google search brings up 4.4% for ""Stanford acceptance rate"" but I suppose this is for undergrads. Do you have any information or thoughts as to what it's like when it comes to MS? Or at least do you think it's higher or lower comparing to undergraduate programs?

How likely it is for chances to decrease for those who ask for financial assistantship? This issue is hardly commented on officially but I've heard that student that don't ask for assistantship have more chances to get in. Do you know anything about it?

"Make a difference during COVID-19! (CSUF survey study, Chance to win Amazon gift certificate)","Hi everyone! If you could take our survey, it would be greatly appreciated. Let us know what's on your mind. :) Thank you in advance!! Description below:

The Coronavirus: Student Experiences (CSE) Study, an online survey study, is seeking college/university students in the U.S. to report how they are coping during the COVID-19 pandemic.

You can find out more about the study here: [http://fullerton.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_emaleTw8WK9KX8V](http://fullerton.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_emaleTw8WK9KX8V)

You are eligible for the study if you are: (a) At least 18 years old; (b) attending a college or university in the United States; and (c) available and willing to complete both baseline and follow-up surveys.

The study will ask you to complete: 

* 1 Baseline survey (approximately 30-45 minutes), followed by
* 3 Follow-up surveys (approximately 15 minutes), which take place every two weeks.  

These surveys will ask you about such topics as your stressors and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, mood and anxiety symptoms, health, and academics.  The study closes on December 11, 2020.

Overall, your total expected time commitment is about 1.5 hours.

**Compensation**

The following compensation applies to participants that are *not* part of the CSU Fullerton Psychology Department Research Pool:   


* For completing the baseline survey and all three follow-up surveys by December 11, 2020:
   * If you are the one of the first 25 participants to complete the requisite surveys, you will earn a $20 Amazon gift certificate;
   * If you are not one of the first 25 participants to complete the survey, you will be entered into a drawing for a $30 Amazon gift certificate.  **(Odds of winning: maximum 1 in 3)**
* *Note:* 
   * **You must start the study no later than October 30, 2020** in order to be able to complete all four surveys in time.
   * As explained in the informed consent form, survey entries that are flagged as reflecting unusually poor effort will not count towards compensation.",1602898804,1,0

CS (HCI) vs. PD,"Soph here. After finishing most of the CS core (enough for a minor) and doing a Software Eng internship at a mid-tier company, I'm finally admitting to myself I could not care less about coding. Can't imagine forcing myself to do this long term. 

I've always liked an interdisciplinary mix of technical/grounded and creative/artistic, and am thinking of going into design. I have a bit of experience from high school, but it's limited. Product designer or UI/UX designer looks like a career that'd fit my interests really well, if it's something I can get good at

I could continue with CS HCI track (HCI's relevant to UI/UX and since I finished most of the code heavy classes, wouldn't be too bad?)

or switch to Product Design (I'm not as interested in the required meche stuff, would be bad at it too. But PD seems to have more projects/teach actual harder design skills than HCI. If anyone has details about how meche/engineering heavy PD is, that'd be helpful). 

or PD major + CS coterm in HCI. or double major since PD has no minor, though that doesn't sound fun. But I do kind of want to keep CS, in case design doesn't work out, so I have SWE as a safety net. 

Symsys is not an option, I'm not interested in the required phil/cogsci classes. 

Overall, confused. If anyone has knowledge, esp about the PD major and design careers, pls enlighten",1602144003,1,0

Thanks for reading this. I am in the application process for the Stanford LEAD online business program.

I live in Canada. The program is fully online.

 I'm facing a few funding issues. 

1- my employer will not pay/help to pay for it
2- Stanford does not provide any financial assistance for that program
3- since this is a part-time program, I do not qualify for any federal/provincial financial assistance in Canada
4- this program is not tax deductible in Canada (Even with a donation receipt)
5- I cannot use my RRSP without being penalized (30% tax) since this is part time. 
6- we're expecting our second child in December so taking $19K out of the emergency fund os not a suitable option.


Do you know if there would be any other option I haven't thought of to get the funding?

Are we supposed to pay tax on financial aid scholarship?,"According to [topic No. 421](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc421), qualified education expenses explicitly do not include incidentals like room and board, and therefore are taxable. This would mean that the $16,000+ (full fin aid package) on our award letters set aside for room and board, would be added to our annual gross income and we would need to pay a couple thousand in taxes on. Whether you work or not, this would make you non-exempt and means you must file taxes (or your parents if you're dependent still). This doesn't include all the other non-qualified scholarships you might receive, which should also be taxed and added to gross income. I don't think education credits can cover this amount of tax. 

**Does anyone pay taxes on their financial aid scholarship? Do we need to?**

Stanford submits a [1098-T](https://sfs.stanford.edu/taxes/resources) to the IRS that even says a large part of financial scholarship was not used for qualified expenses. I'm not an accountant so this is just my understanding (correct me if I am wrong) and Stanford cannot offer any tax advice.

"EE VS CS Major Decision, Would Love Any Input","I am in my second year of college and it's my last semester to change tracks before I fall behind on graduation.  I am not sure whether to continue with electrical engineering or switch to computer science.  Also, if it matters- I may consider a Masters (too early to say for sure). I think double major may be too much work and don't really like computer architecture to pursue CE (plus I heard it it spreading yourself thin and makes you less knowledgeable about either field). I also don't know if a minor will have enough info for a job.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I think my favorite parts of EE so far are the things to do with coding, like working with arduinos and what not. I took two CS classes thus far and I liked them but I am not sure how it would translate to a career. I don't find myself too interested in the EE stuff but I am not sure if it's because I am only learning the general stuff like digital logic and RLCs right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also working on some side software projects as part of school orgs which I enjoy. I would also try hardware but it’s limited due to the pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I think I am more interested in CS but don't care \*too\* much about what I do (I think) but I do want job security or secure future essentially.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to list some pros and cons that I have for each side and I would really appreciate any advice at all related to any of the following points

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

CS (Pros)

&amp;#x200B;

\* Higher salary and more potential to make money (or startup)

\* More diverse in terms of career field (healthcare, tax, every industry needs it)

\* Job outlook seems to be good by sources online

\* Field is very much growing like in areas of AI and Machine Learning (which are somewhat interesting to me)

&amp;#x200B;

CS (Cons)

&amp;#x200B;

\* Can be outsourced more easily (considering the work done can be done so from anywhere),

I would also love some more light on this

\* I would never be secure, I would always have to stay on my toes learning new technologies. I would get less competitive as I grow older when compared to younger candidates. Sure I love learning now, but eventually I feel I would want to relax a little due to being closer to the top of the game (\*\*it's one of my biggest concerns relating to job market\*\*)

\* It's an easier degree and a lot of people have it. It's easier to do CS with an EE degree than EE stuff with a CS degree

\* You also don't really need a degree (so I have heard)

&amp;#x200B;

EE (Pros)

&amp;#x200B;

\* Less likely to be outsourced due to the nature of the field

\* It's a harder degree so less people have it

\* Can do CS stuff but not vice versa

\* Seniority is not a disadvantage as it may be in CS. Seniority is actually beneficial and desired

&amp;#x200B;

EE (Cons)

&amp;#x200B;

\* I don't feel like I am very interested (but this might be due to only covering general topics so far)- although I do like the integration of hardware and coding

\* Unemployment is higher in EE and the job outlook is not as great as CS

\* The salary on average/median also seems to be lower

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Affording Stanford - Community College?,"Hey,

Frosh here. My parents just told me that they aren't sure we can afford Stanford for the rest of the year. We don't currently receive any financial aid, but their income dropped 30k (now sitting around 70k/year, but we own our house so that is why we don't get FA).

Their preference, however, would be for me to take a LoA for the rest of frosh year and take community college courses so that I can come in with sophomore standing (thus reducing how much they have to pay). Is this even possible?

Otherwise, are there any other options? Could I apply for FA this late?

Freshman On Campus and Lonely,"Hi everyone,

I'm a freshman that got on campus housing due to personal circumstances. Since coming here, I've found it to be a really isolating experience. Probably doesn't help that I'm shy to begin with and have a tough time initiating social interactions absent some kind of shared experience. The classes are really hard (Chem and Math in particular) and I feel like there's almost no social life to speak of. I haven't really been able to meet anyone. Since we can't really hang out and classes are all virtual, there's no real organic situation that would lead to friendship and I can't say that I've made any real friends here in the month that I've been here. My roommate is great but also just studies a lot in their room too. I've been rejected from pretty much all of the clubs and orgs that I applied to. The food isn't great and there are no activities at all. It almost feels like a prison of sorts and it's hard not to spend all day in your room doing homework, listening to zoom lectures, and meeting no one. Basically, I just feel lonely, lame, dumb, overworked, friendless, and sad. I was so looking forward to Stanford and obviously no one expected this. And though I know it's irrational, I now often wonder if this is how it's just going to be for us and truly feel like an imposter on top.

Kinda scared I might get rescinded,"Hey guys,
      I wanted ask if anyone has gone through the same situation or know a person who did. So I matched to Stanford on December 1st, great right? About two weeks earlier I had to drop one of my three dual enrollment classes. 

Main reason(s)  that I dropped the class were two months into the course there were no assignments/papers/quizzes and class was asynchronous while revolving around a comment section for discussions. The class was barely participating and the multiple discussion threads. It was a class that was not do well online and asynchronous. I also needed to drop it by the November 18th (later moved to December 1st) deadline before needing the professors approval to drop the class. 

My grades in my other two dual enrollment classes are good and my three advanced classes at my high school are doing good too. I’m just afraid that because I didn’t get the approval for dropping the class I may be in trouble. This is increasingly worrisome knowing that if I get rescinded other college application would’ve already passed me by. 

I feel like I unintentionally did the “it’s better to ask for forgiveness than for permission” (which I don’t believe most of the time. Hopefully this is not seen and applied to my character because I’ve never had to drop a class before (let alone rearrange my schedule) and my grades have been so consistent",1608264751,1,0

JAPANLNG 1 Recorded Video Access,"Hello all,

According to him, the Stanford Language Center does not allow students to audit the course nor do they allow students that are not enrolled to obtain access to the recorded lectures.

Where is Stanford?,"This might seem like a weird question but I'm just a little confused by location names and all, being an international student. I'll be coming to campus in a week for the first time. I'll probably need to take an Uber but I need help breaking this down. Here's what I know:

If I Google ""where is Stanford"" I get Stanford's address, which is in ""Stanford, California"".

I can't remember where but I saw that Stanford is in San Francisco? I think I Googled ""xxx near Stanford"" and all the addresses were from San Francisco. So I guess maybe Stanford is just * near * San Francisco? 

In the orientation schedule (pre-pandemic), we were supposed to go on a trip around the ""Bay Area"". Is that where Stanford is?

I see the location ""Paolo Alto"" coming up in a lot of Stanford related emails I get.

Official emails also seem to mention ""Santa Clara County"" Corona virus restrictions affecting Stanford. Is Stanford in Santa Clara County?

When I wanted to buy my ticket, the two closest Airports to Stanford were the San Jose and San Francisco airports. An apparently the San Jose Airport is closer. But I chose the San Francisco Airport because that was the only one I remember being mentioned during the virtual orientation a few months ago.

My country isn't that big by landmass so we really just have Country &gt;&gt; States &gt;&gt; Local Governments (Local Council Development Areas for places to small to have their own LG)

Financial aid for 5th year,"I’m technically a junior right now but I am still deciding whether to take classes on winter or not. I recently decided to change majors (EE to CS) because I realized I didn’t really like EE, but I am also very not on track to finish my CS major on time.

I think that if I was taking high unit quarters (like 18+) every quarter I could probably graduate on time. Due to my disabilities, I don’t think I will be able to do that. At this point, I think that even if I went back to EE I would also not be able to finish on time.

How do I approach this with the financial aid office? Should I contact them now and tell them that I think I need extra time even though I’m a junior? I’m just afraid they’ll tell me to try to power through everything, but almost all of my last quarters have landed me on a hospital with multiple W’s in my transcript. I just want that to not happen, but I don’t know if they’ll accept it as a reason.

At the same time, I know some friend who were able to get an extra year when they requested it on their senior year, but I’m just afraid that if I leave it for senior year they’ll tell me that it’s too late and make me take loans. I’m on a full ride scholarship, so I’m just overall really scared.

Double Major in CS and English,"Hi, I’m a recently admitted freshman and I am currently intending to double major in CS and English. During the application process, I thought I would be allowed to do so at Stanford, but today I came across something on their website which made me think otherwise: 

“ student may formally declare more than one major within a single bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., or B.A.S.) program.”

 Since English would be a BA. and CS would be a BS. would i be able to double major as I had hoped? Would that just become a BAS and then we’d be allowed to pursue both? Or how does that work? Would it not be allowed? 

I spoke to a current freshman and she said we would be able to, but since what she said conflicts with the website I wanted to confirm once again. 

I know that my major choice is going to alter once I get to campus/ online school but I’d really like to know that I *can* double major in English and CS. Otherwise maybe I should apply to other schools too where I would be able to do that. As RD deadlines are in Jan

[Class of 2025] Urged by my family to apply to Harvard even when I'm so ready to commit to Stanford,"I wish Stanford had an ED option so I would not have spent so much time to convince my family and counselor that I don't want to apply to any more RD schools :(

People said I'm ""meant for Harvard""

People said my common app essay ""will make a great Harvard sample essay""

People also advised me to apply REA to Harvard and go for Stanford in RD round

All these happened while Stanford had been my dream school since grade 10 (MIT and Tsinghua prior to that)

Now I have the Stanford offer and my family still think I should apply to Harvard

""Don't you want to just see if you can get in?"" (Nope. Stanford has a lower admit rate and you can just assume I can get into Harvard if I can get into Stanford)

""You might change your mind and end up liking Harvard more."" (Seriously, the only reason I can think of for attending Harvard is that it's near MIT)

""Maybe they will give you a full-ride scholarship."" (It's need-based so I doubt they will offer much more than Stanford did)

""Even if you attend Stanford you can boast that you declined Harvard."" (Why will I want to boast about that??)

""Everyone in this rural Chinese village knows Harvard is the best school in the world yet few of them, if any, knows Stanford."" (Ok I will try my best to tell them that Stanford is superior)

Forgot how to speak English,"This is a really odd problem.

At Stanford, back when it was in-person, I was constantly speaking English, from smalltalk in lecture, to random late night philosophical discussions, to commiserating in office hours.

Since I'm at home in virtual school, I basically lost the ability to speak English. BTW, English is my most ""advanced"" language, and I live in the US. The issue is that I speak a different language at home on a day-to-day basis.

Sure, all the media I consume is in English and I text friends in English, but I rarely ever get the chance to speak it. Throughout the quarter, I only spoke English during group project meetings, and occasional group Zoom calls with friends. Which isn't too substantial, to be honest.

The last time I was constantly speaking English was back in September, during my summer job. Recently, I was in a 1-on-1 conversation with a friend (not a group setting, so I actually have to talk), and I realized my English skills have really atrophied since September. I know what I want to say, but the correct words just don't come to my mind. Has anybody experienced this? Any tips on how to cope?

My current method is to intentionally spend time everyday talking to myself about random topics in English, so I can improve bit by bit. But I am also looking for other ways. I guess the obvious answer would be ""why don't you just video call somebody?"". I do, but I guess 1 hour per week isn't sufficient.",1607645711,1,0

How to search through publications by Stanford faculty only?,"Hello, 

So for some context first. I want to start back up a project I started in high school and, now that I am at Stanford, I would love to contact some Stanford faculty about a few things. Specifically, since the project is ML related, I need to contact people about obtaining data and I have no clue where to start looking. I figured that a good way to do this to search for papers who have worked on similar work. Basically, what I need is a google scholar but shows papers only authored by people affliated with Stanford.

How is everyone getting employed?,"Incoming rant - sorry if it's off-topic (if so please delete). Just need to vent.

&amp;#x200B;

Sophomore here majoring in CS and looking for tech internships. I've seen a couple of people in my year receive internship offers from big tech companies but I have no idea how they're doing it. I've applied to literally every company and startup I can think of (and I've been referred to a couple places), I've done well in the coding challenges, I've had interviews, but I still can't get past the first round for any company. Like with Facebook, I got 100% in their coding challenge, I did well in my first round interview I think (got through both questions in 30-ish minutes and asked a bunch of questions at the end) but I still didn't get through to the next round. Maybe its because I don't have a lot of industry experience on my resume but I've done a lot of research with the cs department over the last year and I have a 4.02 gpa so i thought that would at least count for something.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it better to hold off and declare later once I've found a professor I would feel comfortable asking to be my advisor? I'm in no rush to declare either, just figured that with the break I have time to fill out the form and start the process now. Any thoughts/advice would be greatly appreciated.

I am freshman and have been applying to a few internships. Most actually do not ask for GPA, but some do. However, sometimes they do not ask for a transcript. Thus, if you have a CR on their, but obv your GPA is not affected by that, then aren't you at a distinct advantage then if they had to view your transcript since your initial GPA that they see is higher than if there was a letter grade there? That begs the question, would it be advantageous to pass fail a class rather than take it for a letter for the purposes of applying to an internship?

PreFrosh looking for advice on CS/Math classes and the AI track,"Hi all! I was recently admitted to Stanford REA as part of the Class of 2025.

For background, I already took Math51 and CS106B through the Stanford HSSC (high school summer college) for P/NP. Below are my planned classes below for my first 3 quarters (not including IntroSems, Ways, etc.). My general thought process was to avoid more than 2 CS classes in a quarter since they tend to be quite rigorous. My goal would be to get to the AI courses (CS 220 through 240) as fast as possible while knocking out the CS prereqs.

Can you become fluent in a language at Stanford?,"I'm taking a gap year before frosh year, and am deciding what language I should prepare to study at Stanford: Chinese or Korean.

Last Summer before I knew I was gapping, I took the Mandarin Placement Test (after 1yr of no Mandarin classes in HS, so I was rusty then and now) and tested out of 2qtrs. If I study between now and Summer I could definitely test out of 2, maybe 3, quarters again. This way I could do 0-1qtrs of language and be done with that requirement. 

For Korean, I could maybe test out of 1qtr, that's it (did Korean school as a kid). However I am very interested in becoming fluent-ish in Korean, and would be willing to dedicate a large portion of my units to becoming fluent. But I am afraid of dedicating that amount of units/time to Korean if I won't actually become fluent.

**So my question is: Is it really possible to become Full Professional level proficient in a language (Korean) at Stanford in undergrad?**",1608850670,1,0

Updating financial aid for living situation winter quarter (airbnb),"Hi! 

I was wondering if anyone had any experience getting financial aid to pay for an airbnb they were staying in. I saw that it just says to upload your rental agreement with your name. 

I guess I'm a bit confused that there don't seem to be any more guidelines besides that, such as a rent maximum they would cover (or is that just based on how much financial aid you receive?). I.e. if there was no maximum, would people not just pick a super nice airbnb in hopes of financial aid covering it? 

Also, does anyone know if living in two separate locations would impact this (was originally planning on moving back home/somewhere rent-free for the end of the quarter if financial aid didn't pull through). 

I lived at home last quarter so I'm not really sure how all of this works, thanks so much!",1607478695,1,0

Stanford to Proceed with Allowing Frosh and Sophomores Back,"Quote from email: 

 In sum: We are proceeding with our plans to allow Stanford frosh and sophomores to live on campus in the winter quarter, but based on public health conditions, we are adopting a phased undergraduate arrival process and an enhanced COVID-19 testing protocol for their arrival. The change means that we will welcome most frosh and sophomores back to campus two weeks later than we originally planned. 

&amp;#x200B;

So it seems that frosh and sophomores are indeed coming back, but at end of 2 weeks? So this means that instead of a 10 week in person quarter, we'd only be back for 2 months. (And then probably to be rotated off for Juniors/Seniors?)",1607372770,1,0

If I take Physics 120 instead, I can take it during the spring, along with a Think course, CS 107, possibly mandarin, and whatever else looks interesting. Then, I could have my flex quarter in the summer, taking the math class and hopefully doing physics research.

I've taken AP Physics C in high school, both mechanics and E&amp;M, and have had exposure to some introductory quantum mechanics. I don't know vector calculus or differential equations super well, but I've learned a bit and feel that I can self-study the topics over break and during the course.

My physics professor doesn't recommend doing this, since you should have learned the math before going into this, as well as the PDE course pre/coreq (which I don't plan on taking because unit count, currently planning to take 18). She also says that the 60 series gives a strong foundation, but I feel that my foundation is already pretty solid physics-wise at least, and I feel up for the challenge of skipping ahead. Also, I can always drop 120 and go back to the 60 series if I can't handle it.

Does this sound like a bad idea, or is it possible?",1607330126,1,0

Tips for Succeeding in PWR 1,"Hi all,

I'm an incoming freshman taking PWR 1 in the fall and I'm EXTREMELY nervous about it. I feel that I am, in no way, prepared for college level writing, since my high school english classes were, frankly, a joke. Additionally, I do not consider myself to be a good writer by any means. I know that for my math, science, spanish classes, etc, if I put in the time to study, I WILL succeed. This is not something I can guarantee with writing, especially due to my lackluster abilities, no matter how much time I put in. To make it even worse, it's online this year, and I have TERRIBLE experiences with online learning.

Does anyone have any tips on succeeding in these classes? I know people say to not worry about grades, but I am hoping to eventually go to graduate school, which is part of the reason why I am so stressed out about this class.

"Taking cs107 after cs145, cs108 and CS246?","I’m debating whether to take CS145+ Cs229 or Cs107+CS145 this fall. I plan to take CS 108 and CS246 in the winter. CS145 CS108 and Cs246 all have CS107 as prerequisite. The reason I want to take 229 first is because I’m doing a volunteer work in a start up and they plan to build a recommendation system soon in Oct-Nov. Even though CS246 would introduce recommendation system, I’m worried it will be too late if I want to help in the start up. I think 229 can be useful there. However, taking 107 and 229 together can be too overwhelming for me according to the average time students spend on Carta. Would CS107 be crucial for all the other classes I mentioned to succeed?

CS Math Requirement,"Hello guys!

I'm an incoming international Frosh and I plan to major in CS. During high school, I was enrolled in my country's own board so I don't really have AP credits. When I checked the CS course requirements in explore degrees, it's stated there that I need to either take Math 19, 20, and 21 or waive that requirement with AP credits.

Now, I've taken my placement test and it recommends me to take Math 51 but I'm at least planning to take Math 21 to fill in a few knowledge gaps as well. However, do I really need to take Math 19 and 20 as well? Cause that kinda feels basic and a lot of other STEM majors that I'm interested in as well require the 51 sequence only, so in that sense, CS seems to be a black sheep in the engineering department. Later, if I change my major, the Math 19 sequence wouldn't really count to the new major's math requirement. I'm just worried if I missed something and if I'm reading the CS requirement right since I'm new to all of this.
