To all Econ/Bus Econ Majors (and sociology!),"Hi,

New transfer here admitted under pre-business economics. I admit that I only applied under that major because it was “closest” to what I was studying at community college (business) and knew that it was mainly an econ degree with accounting classes but really just wanted to get into and come to UCLA. Now that I’m here, I’m faced with following up and taking these courses but haven’t traditionally been a fan of econ or accounting and was thrilled to get my calculus prerequisites out of the way. Of course now, basically everything I didn’t like about the classes I’ve taken is assembled into the degree I’m pursuing. I don’t want to give up on the major but I already know that if I stick with it, I’m likely to at least switch to econ. But I’ve been really thinking about sociology as a backup plan as well. I’m currently in econ 11 reviewing calculus and while I don’t totally get everything now (I took calc about 1.5-2 years ago) I think I could remember if I REALLY applied myself, though I don’t have any particular motivation to do so because I simply don’t enjoy math. My question is this: do you think it’s a recipe for disaster to stay in this major? I could push myself to get through this class I guess, but do all future econ/bus econ courses basically resemble econ 11 principles (I’d assume so since it’s a prereq)? Really, I was interested in studying business but I feel lost in this major. I also don’t know much about what people “do” with a sociology degree/what it directly correlates to as far as job prospects but would be open to maybe pursuing it as a last ditch since I’ve taken two soc courses before and really enjoyed them.

Surviving a Daily Bruin attack or encounter: A handy guide for all incoming transfers!,"###Dear Transfers,

It’s normal to be frightened when you encounter a Daily Bruin staffer. The reality is that most encounters with the Daily Bruin rarely lead to aggressive behavior, and attacks are even rarer. Remember, most Daily Bruin staff prefer to avoid contact with transfers, and any Daily Bruin editor you see on campus is probably just as frightened as you are!

Remain as composed as possible and follow these simple guidelines whenever you are in Kerckhoff. Soon you too will have more composure when sighting the DB because you will know what to do.

##Avoid, avoid, avoid

The best way to prevent an unpleasant Daily Bruin encounter is to avoid them all together. The Daily Bruin usually avoids transfers, and most transfers don’t even know when they’ve come close to a Daily Bruin editor.

To ensure a surprise or unpleasant encounter with a Daily Bruin member doesn’t occur, avoid moving through Kerckhoff silently and alone. Travel in groups (the larger the better) and make lots of noise by talking or singing. Put your iphone away and pay attention to your surroundings.

##When it happens

Remain calm and ready your Daily Bruin repellent (typically a copy of *Journalism Ethics: A Philosophical Approach By Christopher Meyers Oxford University Press, 2010*). Stay together if you are in a group; you will appear larger and more intimidating if you stick together.

Try to figure out whether the Daily Bruin member is an editor or a low level staffer. As you will see below, editors and writing staff tend to behave differently in a given situation, so it helps to know which species you’re dealing with. 

If possible, try to determine whether there are interns present or whether the staffer is defending an animal carcass or other food source. Editors with interns or columnists defending food sources may appear to act aggressively as they defend their interns and/or food.

Now that you know what you’re dealing with ….

##The Daily Bruin at a distance

If you see a Daily Bruin person in the distance, respect its need for personal space. Do not approach it, even to get a photo, and give it as much room as possible. Consider turning around and leaving the way you came. If you must continue, take a detour and give them a wide berth. The Daily Bruin can cover large distances in a relatively short period of time, so if you are vibing near janss steps, be sure to store your food well out of reach of any columnists in the area.

##Close encounters 

If you encounter a columnist anywhere on campus, especially Bruinwalk, stop what you are doing and evaluate the situation. Identify yourself by speaking in a calm, appeasing tone. Back away slowly, preferably in the direction you came. Walk, don’t run, and keep your eye on the beat writer so you can see how they react. In most cases, the journalist will flee.

If you are in your Boelter or other place Daily Bruin staff shouldn’t be, and you are sure they are only an intern, consider trying to move it out of the area. Ensure the intern has a clear and safe escape route with no people or obstacles in its way. Stand tall and look it directly in the eye. Yell at the Daily Bruin intern and firmly tell it to leave: “Get out of here, shill!” Keep copy of *Journalism Ethics: A Philosophical Approach By Christopher Meyers Oxford University Press, 2010* ready (with the shrink wrap removed) in case the Daily Bruin approaches too closely. 

##Dealing with a ‘defensive’ encounter

Sometimes a DB that feels threatened will ‘act’ aggressively to defend against a perceived threat. This is often the case with an editor with their interns, a beat writer defending a food source, or a surprise encounter with media staff. The closer you are to the Daily Bruin when it becomes aware of you, the more likely it is to react defensively: it may pop its jaws or swat the ground with its front paw while blowing and snorting, and/or it may lunge or “bluff charge” toward you in an attempt to get you to leave.

In this situation, the Daily Bruin doesn’t want to fight any more than you do. It is simply trying to communicate that you are too close. Try to appear non-threatening by remaining still and calm. Ready your pepper spray by removing the safety lock. Speak in an appeasing voice and back away, increasing your distance from the them. Leave the area immediately.

Defensive responses that result in physical contact almost always involve the Daily Bruin being surprised at close range, on a carcass or protecting their young. The very few defensive attacks by the Daily Bruin have been Editors protecting interns (but these are very rare).

If you encounter a staffer on a carcass, get as far away from the staffer's cache as possible; leaving the area quickly and quietly preferably in the same direction you came in. If the journalist is about to make contact, use your pepper spray. Do not play dead and do not act aggressively. Get as far away from the food cache as possible.

If Daily Bruin that is behaving defensively is intent on making contact, your first line of defense is always your I 💙UCLA Transfers t-shirt. That should be enough to discourage it and send it in the other direction. 

It’s the escalation of fear that leads to bad decisions. There have been a number of transfer attacks that I’ve read about that could have been avoided if the situation hadn’t been misread. 

##Repelling an aggressive or non-defensive Daily Bruin

Occasionally, the Daily Bruin will approach you in a non-defensive manner. It may just be curious. Perhaps it’s a young Daily Bruin intern that is simply testing its dominance. Or they are used to hanging around peopled areas in order to access food. Very rarely, it may see you as potential prey.

In any event, talk to the Daily Bruin in a firm voice. Get out of its way if you can, which may be all it wants. If the Daily Bruin follows you and its attention is clearly directed at you, then stand your ground and prepare to use your deterrent. A n editor that is initially curious or testing you may become predatory if you do not stand up to it.

Act aggressively. Look it straight in the eyes and let it know you will fight if attacked. Shout! Make yourself look as big as possible. Stamp your feet and take a step or two toward them. Threaten the Daily Bruin with whatever is handy (stick, pole, a banana peel). The more the Daily Bruin persists, the more aggressive your response should be.

If the Daily Bruin attacks, use your deterrent and fight for your life. Kick, punch or hit the the Daily Bruin with whatever weapon is available. Concentrate your attack on the face, eyes and nose.",1602022973,1,0

Discussion Section Rant,"So my \*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* class has a 50 minute discussion, but because of the remote learning changes, instead of 20 or so people with the professor/TA, there are 85. Sounds not too bad, right? I mean if the call is hectic I can still go to office hours. NOPE, he combined his Office Hours and Discussion sections, so now these meetings are the ONLY TIMES we can get face to face time with our professor, sharing it with 85 people.

It's going exactly how you'd expect. A bunch of students, none of us have any clue what's going on in the homework we have, and we only have 50 minutes to get guidance from our professor. And what happens. TEACHERS PETS slow down the explanations to a snail's pace. They won't shut their traps and just let him explain, and instead they see the need to get brownie points with our professor by continuously talking as he's solving the examples. And the questions aren't even useful, half the time they're asking about something he JUST went over, causing him to backtrack for 10 minutes. That, or its a minor question that people in the chat have already answered, but since they're so superior to the other 80 of us, they feel the need to get a professional explanation. There are 3 of them, and one especially bad one who has kept us on question one for half an hour. The easiest question, which has already been answered by the professor 2 times now, which has already been answered and explained by people in the chat. The teacher's pets' are now interrupting not only the professor but each other too, in order to hectically get their questions through and get face time. Meanwhile, there are the rest of us sitting here, wanting to die, praying they'll shut up so we can ask questions about the parts that are actually confusing, but knowing we'll never get there.",1602009654,1,0

In desperate need of some academic advice,"&amp;#x200B;

So, here's my predicament:

When I first started college, I had no idea what I was interested in, but I knew I wanted to become an investment banker or a corporate lawyer. (My parents did not have the best financial situation, and my literal worst fear in life is poverty.) So, naturally, I chose economics. I like economics, but don't love it, and I did well enough in the coursework to comfortably get into the major (I should mention I transferred and am a junior, but I successfully completed all the pre-reqs over the summer!)

The problem is, I recently took multivariable calc and linear algebra because I was having fun in calculus, and thought I should try this math thing out: I was really into it. I've looked into what higher level math is like (at least I've learned a bit about real analysis ), I've talked with my math professors about upper division math, and it really appeals to me. So, now I'm facing a conundrum: I want to study math, but I feel stuck in Econ.

So far I've calculated my options:

What I want to do:

Stay an extra year at UCLA, and try and double major: I like this option because, I actually do enjoy economics, but more because of the mathematical aspect of it. The main problem with this is that I would be becoming dangerously close to the unit max, (I've calculated I would graduate with 208.5 units. I've calculated this with the new requirements for both math and econ majors.)  I might run into trouble if I can't get a class and can't take fillers to meet financial aid requirements.

Option 2: try to convince the school to let me switch to a math major: I also like this option, because it's not as stressful, and I can still take Econ classes as electives. However, I'm not sure if I can get approval for this since I'm already an Econ major.

Option 3: switch to: Math/Econ. This is probably the most realistic option, and I feel confident this will be approved if  I decide to try it. It is my least favorite option however, because the coursework doesn't really go deeply into any one field.

I also still want to work in finance, but I'm not really attached to investment banking.

Anyone's input on what I should do would be really helpful. I'm feeling kind of lost because I feel like I'll hate myself for not giving math a shot, but it also just feels like I'm being unrealistic about the logistics, it's kind of too late to go back now, and I should just finish what I started.

Access Codes are Absurd,"I know i won't be able to do anything about it, but I just want to rant. I thought I was going to be able to avoid having to pay for textbooks since I found them all as pdfs, but for Math 31AL, and probably the rest of this math series (so long as we're remote I suppose) I am required to pay for Sapling Plus. And for what??? To just submit homework. Finding the pdf of the book was pointless because I still have to pay for it bc there is no way to get Sapling Plus separate (regardless of it being an ebook or physical book). Either $100+ with 4 term access and physical book from UCLA store or $60 with 1 term sapling plus access and ebook.

Survivor UCLA: Zoom Edition,"Hello everyone! This quarter, Survivor UCLA is happy to host its first season of Survivor. If you are unaware of what Survivor is, the game will be based on one of America’s most popular reality TV game shows in which 16-20 participants vote each other out one by one until one individual is left standing, taking the title of “Sole Survivor”.This is a great way to meet new people and build friendships under a fun and competitive setting. Due to current circumstances, our first season will be held through Zoom and we are looking for any interested UCLA students to take part in this unique experience. Please fill out the form below by 10/11 if you would like to complete and try to claim the first victory of UCLA’s rendition of Survivor.

Curious international student trying to get educated about the Prop 16 thing,"Hi everyone, I am an international students so I might not be the most familiar with US politics.

I am just wondering what is the reason behind the idea to make college acceptance based on race and why should it be against Asian Americans.

From my understanding, AA was created to compensate for racism, especially effect of slavery, as well as the effect of social class difference on education resources. Therefore, I feel that 

1. AA should be based on income, not race. Rich black people obviously have more access to better education resources than a poor Asian kid.
2. Asian Americans didn't enslave anyone. In fact, they were the victims of institutional racism too (Chinese Exclusion Act and internment camps during WW2). Why should they be sacrificed for the legacy of racism? If we look at colleges where AA is implemented, Asian Americans need to score hundred of points higher than other races (yes including whites) to get into the same college if all other conditions are the same. That is terrible and seems like actual racism to me.

Can anyone explain why AA instead is race based and heavily aims at hurting Asian Americans?",1603074698,1,0

A Chinese-American Student's Opinion on Prop 16,"I was motivated by [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/jd2dbx/why_does_usac_not_care_about_asian_students/) post to provide my perspective as an Chinese-American from an uberliberal part of the country on Prop 16. I'll try not going to the level of ad homineming the OP from the above post, but judging by their post history they seem to have a hate-boner for any sort of organized student activity as if they were part of robotics in high school.

What bothered me particularly about that post was the OP presuming the position of an organization against an entire continent's people; not only against Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese, Laotians, and/or Indians. As we learned in elementary school, Asia is the largest continent in the world. It just so happens that China is the largest country in that continent and historically had been the regional hegemon, which is why many Asian countries have elements of ancient Chinese culture. The post reminded me a lot about [this article](https://www.uclalawreview.org/misuse-asian-americans-affirmative-action-debate/) I found by the UCLA Law Review while doing research on the topic to form my own opinion. But I digress.

For a long time, I would actually agree with what seems to be the majority opinion of the sub towards Prop 16–that it's a bandaid fix that doesn't deal with the root of systemic inequality. It doesn't make sense to fight inequality with more inequality. And taking the axiom that all laws should reduce inequality to heart, the most superficial analysis of the effects of race-based affirmative action will still show that it perpetuates inequality, since that's how it's designed.

I still realized what the program was trying to solve and found the method with which it attempted to solve that problem compelling. I thought about instead of implementing race-based affirmative action, we should implement class-based or income-based affirmative action. Since most poverty-stricken communities are demographically BIPOC (if you think this is racist, you need a good look at the real state of economic inequality and what you're ultimately trying to solve with reducing social inequality), it would make sense to provide opportunity for those who are ambitious enough to socially and economically uplift themselves. I wondered why we weren't talking about income-based affirmative action and were so stuck on race-based affirmative action. That is, until I found a [debate column from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/04/27/should-affirmative-action-be-based-on-income) from 2014 on the subject. In particular, [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/us/turning-to-new-means-of-promoting-diversity.html?hp&amp;_r=0) had a quote that was especially compelling:

&gt; Since 1994, [Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University,] said, higher education has become increasingly two tiered, with 85 percent of white students going to the top 500 four-year colleges, and 75 percent of black and Latino students going to open-admissions schools. **“In the end, you can’t avoid dealing with race,” he said.**

So since the ignorance of race that income-based affirmative action necessitates doesn't address this profound issue, it's apparent why it's mostly faded in importance in the current political discussion.

Most arguments against race-based affirmative action come from a purported concern for the Asian-American community. I agree it's problematic to lump together all countries in Asia into one monolithic group for the purposes of race-based admission. I also agree it's problematic to lump together all countries into one monolithic group for the purposes of arguing against race-based admission. There a particular quote from the UCLA Law Review article above that's interesting:

&gt; The conservatives who oppose affirmative action have not, generally speaking, taken an interest in other issues affecting the well-being of Asian Americans, including voting redistricting, racial profiling, employment equality, fair housing, poverty, and mental health services.

But I'll assume that both sides are arguing in good faith with no hidden agenda in mind, since that will simplify discussion.

Over shelter-in-place, I started reading a lot. One of the books I read was *Why Liberalism Failed* by Patrick J. Deneen, a professor from the University of Notre Dame. A particularly compelling chapter from that book that touches on this issue is ""The New Aristocracy."" We who have the opportunity to partake in the fruits of higher education have become the new aristocracy akin to the dukes and nobles of feudal Europe. Although we claim that the admissions process itself is already fair enough and adding a race-based criteria would do much to upset the fairness of that process, in reality this ignores many aspects of getting a resume to partake in the process in the first place. Whereas most upper-middle class high school students take a job as supplementary income for themselves, many BIPOC high school students take a job as a necessity to add onto their family's income. While upper-middle class high school students have time to do homework, study, take part in ASB, robotics, play an instrument, tutor, build houses in Africa, start a business, etc., many BIPOC high school students have to use their time to care for siblings, work, and/or do familial tasks that their parents just don't have time to do, since they're already trying their best and taking all their time working. (As an aside, one can argue that their parents may not be trying their best. But then is it fair to punish their child with a lack opportunity of higher education to break that cycle, if their child is ambitious enough to partake in higher education?) In a book on Justice in *Nicomachean Ethics*, Aristotle delineates a type of Justice that is based on proportion, apart from hard, empirical right and wrong. If the state of society and the economy is fundamentally weighted against the BIPOC community (which it is; saying so otherwise is incredibly tone-deaf), then it would be just for society to yield opportunity back in proportion to re-balance. People who argue against race-based affirmative action with the opinion that the process is already fair enough ignore the factors external to the process itself that make it unfair.

As for my Asian-American community (which again, I emphasize is problematic to address as a monolith but it's extremely convenient. As a compromise, I'll define the Asian-American community as people from East-Asian countries, which are in general more prosperous economically), there's a compelling hypothesis: race-based affirmative action will result in well-qualified Asians being replaced with under-qualified BIPOC people. To those who hold that hypothesis, I raise you this: If those Asians are truly well qualified, then they will have multiple universities to choose from. If they're truly well qualified, they'll be able to get into private universities of equal or higher caliber than UCLA, and so it doesn't matter that they didn't get into UCLA since they have a university to go to. On the other hand, if someone in the BIPOC community gets rejected from a UC or a CSU, their only option to enter the realm of higher education is community college. They can't socially or economically uplift themselves in the same way that they could if they got into a UC or CSU. Don't get me wrong; community college is an excellent choice to continue one's education and gain experience. However, we all have to acknowledge that there's a reason why certain institutions have higher standing. I don't know enough to make a judgement on what those factors are, but I imagine that they include a mix of academics, campus culture, and opportunity.

When discussing this proposition with a friend, he brought up an excellent point: that it's about equity rather than equality. If you're a conservative, you believe that those who work hard will get rewarded in kind. After all, that's the entire premise of the American Dream. However, the American Dream has its foundations upon another assumption: that everyone starts on equal footing. If everyone starts on equal footing, then those who work hard will be ahead of those who don't work hard. But we have to recognize that for Asians, the amount of racism we experience is incomparable to the racism people in the BIPOC community experience. Yes, there's the whole stereotype that all Asians are bad drivers, or we're weird for eating pig intestine or blood or cow liver, or that we're all good at math, or that we all play the piano, or that we're all degenerates for watching anime, or more recently, that we're the reason why COVID is in America. But has that resulted in a cop pulling you over for no reason? How many reports are there of Asians being shot in their own neighborhood, just for walking with a hood on? How prevalent is gang violence in Asian communities? How many Asian families have to function without a father because he was incarcerated for a false drug offense but by virtue of mandatory sentencing, he had to leave his family?

I'm not here to tell you to vote yes on Prop 16. I don't know enough about much it will screw up the current balance of higher education, especially with wanton classifications of some economically-unprivileged Asians with more economically-privileged Asians, or if it will indeed provide profound fixes to systemic inequality in the long run. If the worry is that people will think someone from the BIPOC community only got a degree from a prestigious university because of affirmative action, trust me: they'll find a different reason to think they aren't as good as their resume say they are. But at the very least, they'll have an education and will be able to be a better member of a civil society.",1602995989,1,0
Affirmative Action for USAC,"I was looking at USAC and couldn't help but notice that its racial makeup did not match that of the UCLA undergraduate body that it serves. The [2018-2019 demographic figures](https://www.admission.ucla.edu/campusprofile.htm) show that black students make up 3% of the student body but hold 20% of the seats on USAC. Hispanic students make up 22% of the population but hold 27% of the seats. Asian and white students make up 28% and 27% respectively yet only have 20% representation.

Goddamn guys,"Im a second year and I always feel like an absolute failure. How am I supposed to get positions in clubs, jobs, internships and research if they want to see good resumes but I can’t have a good resume without already having had experience with good positions (which I couldn’t have gotten without a freaking good resume). It’s literally an impossible paradox. 

It’s just so frustrating. I’m an alumni scholar for heavens sake, I feel like an imposter for getting such a good scholarship to go here and now I can’t even get into clubs that I want to be in (including being rejected from an ASC coordinator position).

 Ive been part of some groups at ucla so far but nothing that I feel has been very meaningful or given me good experience. Ive tried to apply to more clubs and things but I just got a rejection email today from a club that rejected me last year too and it’s so disheartening. I see all my friends getting positions and wonder what I’m doing wrong. And having fucking depression makes everything hit harder and drains me of al my motivation.

My Argument Against Prop 16 and A Potential Alternative,"I've seen a lot of discussion about this and after being called a ""white cis male"" when I am in fact not white at all, I'd like to take my argument to a larger audience and see how it is received.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I think it's a bandaid on a far more serious problem. I did robotics back in high school and whenever something broke, we would always ask ourselves - what's the root cause and how do we address it? Because as much as we'd like to, we can't just ziptie and duct tape everything forever. I don't think prop 16 would effectively address the far deeper systemic issues in our country right now. Race is not always an accurate measure of one's hardships.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, I have concerns with how it defines ethnic groups. Individuals from Vietnam, Taiwan, and Mainland China would all be lumped together under ""Asian"". These countries all have vastly different socioeconomic environments and it's simply not fair to assume that they are all the same by defining people from those countries in the same group.  

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, I would like a system that takes into account concrete metrics, like hometown crime rate, average income, access to healthcare, etc. These are far more precise ways to consider how one's environment has affected their access to opportunity. Additionally, we would need to begin supporting programs that create equity for underprivileged communities, especially in the K-12 range.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why I would support something like measure J instead of prop 16.  It is something that would address the many disadvantages minorities face from our institutions failing them. Access to education, healthcare, and other programs are what is really going to solve this in the long run. Relying on race alone to gauge an individual's entire upbringing is honestly just not a proper way to go about this. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, we have the same goals, just different ideas on how to get there. Thank you for ~~coming to my TED talk~~  listening to me and I look forward to reading your responses.",1602911703,1,0

Job Prospects Rant,"I think it's obvious to everyone right now that it isn't easy to find a job in the current climate. But my frustrations with the job/internship search process have built up over years. I'm tired of applying to a million internships only for 5 to reply (and surprise surprise none of them pan out in the end). The same goes for jobs, even fairly menial ones. I'm a pretty frugal person, and could probably live off minimum wage if I needed to, but I can't even get a minimum wage job lmao (this was true even before covid). The only jobs/internships I've ever been able to snag were tutoring gigs, and, I kid you not, each of them ended within a month. With one of them the manager just disappeared off the face of the planet, and I was fired from the other gig (I didn't do anything wrong, but my boss was in a tough spot financially and my skills weren't enough to justify my pay. Tbh if I were him, I would have done the same thing). 

I feel like continuing school vs. choosing to drop out is a lose-lose either way for me. If I continue school, I'm sinking money, time, and effort for a degree that may not even make a difference. In addition, school is extremely painful to me right now with the online format and the increasing demand from some teachers. And if I drop out, I'm obviously fucked. Maybe I've just been a privileged little shit for my entire life, but at this point I can't bring myself to put 100% into academics because I fail to see how a degree could help me in any way. I'm aware of all the data that says college is a worthwhile investment, but I increasingly feel like an outlier.",1602910991,1,0

What is the point of making exams closed book if you’re just gonna make them harder anyways?,"In some classes they say the exam will be closed book/honor system, then proceed to write it as if they knew people were going to cheat. You can tell because the exam comes out much harder than any previous semester/practice exam for the class. Sometimes they’ll even straight up say they are making it harder to account for the online format.

What the hell is the point of that? If you’re an honest student who doesn’t cheat, you just get fucked. They might as well just make the exam harder and make it open book for everyone.

Same logic also applies to classes that maintained the same level of difficulty/closed book honor system but decided to get rid of the grading curve. You’re just making it harder for the honest students.",1602885789,1,0

Anything I need to do with UCLA post-graduation?,"Hello,

I just graduated UCLA in the spring of 2020, and have already received my diploma in the mail.

I didn't take any classes in the summer, and as far I know, I'm not enrolled in UCLA anymore. Do I need to do anything administratively in regards to UCLA anymore, or am I safe to ignore these emails?

Readmission after being dismissed,"I was dismissed from UCLA at the end of my sophomore year for academic reasons due to mental health issues. My cumulative GPA from my freshman year and the first quarter of my sophomore year was a 3.8 (and fall quarter sophomore year I got a 4.0). I was raped in the beginning of my winter quarter but I never reported it and didn’t tell anyone except my current boyfriend. I already had some preexisting untreated mental health issues but this just sent me into a downward spiral. I ended up getting a B-, D, and F that quarter. I thought I could pull it together for spring quarter but I only got worse and ended up failing all of my classes and was dismissed. At that point I didn’t really care because I didn’t even want to live anymore but now more than a year has passed, I’m recovering, and I want to get my degree. I did some research on the Bruin Readmission Program and I’m planning to take some CC classes to show that I can handle a college curriculum. However, I was wondering if anyone knows if it would be possible to complete my degree online once (if) I’m readmitted. This might sound stupid but just the thought of being back on the UCLA campus puts me in such a dark place. The two years I spent there were honestly the worst of my life and caused a whole host of mental health issues that I truly don’t think I’ll ever recover from so I have no desire to return to campus. I would just apply to another school but I doubt anywhere good would take me after seeing my transcripts. If anyone has any insight or advice I’d be truly grateful to hear it!",1599889464,1,0

Apply SSE or L/S?,"Hello everyone, I'm an in-state high school senior who is excited to apply to UCLA and, hopefully, get in over Cal.

I'm very conflicted as to whether I should apply SSE or L/S. I know I want to have a career in science, engineering or technology, potentially in areas such as renewable energy, satellites, electronics, planetary science, or software development, as these really interest me a lot.

I could apply L/S (planning to indicate math/atmospheric science as desired major) and study, for example, applied math, where I'd get a good foundation to transition to whatever specific area interests me later on. There'd also be the advantage that for that degree, I've already completed nearly all the lower division courses through community college and AP classes. However, I'm scared that if out of undergrad I wanted to get a job or enter grad school in a field like tech, aerospace, or electronics, I would not have the hands-on experience or courses that people may be looking for, particularly in engineering.

On the other hand, if I applied SSE (haven't decided which major I'd indicate on my application if I did that), I could get an engineering degree and take a lot of practical and hands-on classes to potentially even work as an engineer out of college. However, here I'd have the fear of pigeonholing myself, for example if I chose, say, computer engineering but decided later on that I want to work in mechanical. Almost as importantly though, since SSE is more difficult to get into, I'm not sure if this is a risk worth taking.

My qualifications at the moment are pretty good (SAT 1590, near-perfect GPA, on track to earn an associate's degree in mathematics before completing high school, built a website from scratch to teach people about a subject I'm passionate about, working with a cartography club at a brand-name university on web development for various projects, Congressional App Challenge winner, peer-reviewed CS prof's book on web development, worked as a lab intern at a geochemistry and photogrammetry lab, etc) though I don't want to take the risk of applying SSE over L/S unless (1) it's even worth it and (2) my probability of getting into UCLA in itself doesn't go down too much.

Also, a related question, how hard is it to transfer from L/S to SSE or vice versa if at some point during college I want to pursue a different course of study?",1599851064,1,0

Addressing Factual Correctness and Conservative Bias in this subreddit,"Can we stop posting (and upvoting) information that is clearly leaning conservative and doesn't encapsulate the full story? Conservative viewpoints are very important to the student body, but not when it is presented in a disingenuous manner that doesn't acknowledge all the facts. This is a particularly sensitive electoral period and we saw in 2016 that misinformation online does, and did, play a large role in the election. 

Here are two examples, which we can see from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/search?q=nsfw:no&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;syntax=cloudsearch&amp;sort=comments&amp;t=year) are in the top thirty posts and top five most commented links this year.

Fox News is not the most credible of sources. Also, the whole argument is strawman'ed to be a call of resignation because a professor said ""Wuhan Virus."" To anyone who followed this topic, this is clearly not the case and does not address Eli's insensitive history of communication to the student body (which is literally the job of a chair lol). Also this title is just wrong, nobody ever asked for Eli to not be a professor, just not our primary liaison between the department.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/ipz1i3/usc\_professor\_suspended\_for\_speaking\_chinese/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/ipz1i3/usc_professor_suspended_for_speaking_chinese/)

The Professor in question was not suspended, and the leading title is inaccurate. The Higher Ed title itself acknowledges this, “Patton wasn’t 'suspended from teaching. He is taking a pause while another professor teaches that one course, but he continues to teach his others.'” He was taken off as the instructor for this course due to the controversy and not ""suspended."" Please understand that I **do not** support that action, as its literally a word in mandarin and not a 'slur', but there is a huge difference between being suspended and being removed from teaching a single course which has engendered international controversy and is a focal point.

Question about GPA. Thanks in advance,"Hey so I’m a junior and I was just wondering how the UCs will view my GPA, specifically UCLA.

After doing the calculations (and verifying them online), my *uncapped* weighted GPA will rise by 0.12 but my *capped* weighted GPA will fall by 0.11. I heard that the capped GPA is only to consider if a student is even eligible to apply, and that the uncapped GPA is what the admissions officers will view in your application. Is this true? I’m really hoping so. Because if not, I’m kind of concerned how taking community college classes ended up lowering my viewable GPA lol!

Becoming a bone marrow donor is a relatively painless process that can save the life of a cancer patient,"Blood cancer is a difficult diagnosis for anyone affected by it, but becoming a donor is extremely easy! All you have to do is go online, fill out a short health questionnaire, and a swab kit will be sent to you. The entire process takes less than 15 minutes altogether. If you are in the US you can swab here: [***Gift of Life***](https://www.giftoflife.org/dc/LakshmiM)

Giving Bone Marrow isn’t like what you see on Grey’s Anatomy. There are a lot of myths about bone marrow donation. 80% of donors are asked to give peripheral blood stem cells, which is very similar to that of a platelet donation or blood drawing process. The remaining 20% give bone marrow cells which are taken straight from the donor’s hip, but this is done under sedation and is relatively painless except for some soreness/achiness that may last for a little while. This procedure is mostly asked for younger patients/children.

Why you should care:

\-Every 3 minutes a child or adult is diagnosed with blood cancer. It can affect anyone, from children, to healthy adults, to grandparents. A bone marrow or stem cell transplant is the only hope for survival for many of those diagnosed, and can be a CURE for some.

\-Over 70% of those in need do not have a match within their family and need to find a donor on the registry.

\-Recipients that are part of a minority group have the hardest time finding a donor on the registry. Only 25% of black or multi-racial patients will have a donor on the registry, 40% of Asian-American, and 45% of Hispanic/Latinx. Their best chance is finding someone with a similar ethnic background. We need more diversity on these registries!

\-There is a 1 in 200 chance that you will need a bone marrow or stem cell transplant in your life time.

\-Stem Cell/Bone Marrow Transplants can be used to treat/cure many blood cancers as well as immune and blood disorders.

\-There is a 1 in 200 chance you will be called as a potential match and 1 in 5 potential matches will be asked to become a donor.

Of course I don't mean a club for chimney sweeps. A coomer usually refers to a person that busts many times a day, whether it be by fornication or self-induced pleasuring. Modern coomers are usually porn addicts or OnlyFans simps.

Back to the point. I was surprised that no one thought of creating a coomer club here. UCLA has hundreds of clubs and I saw dozens of clubs that don't allow masturbation or orgies at their club meetings. Maybe UCLA needs to balance that a bit with having a coomer club. It'd be cool and fun.

Should I first pass CS 111?,"There are 2 other classes that I want to take that will most likely fill after first pass (a GE and a CS elective). Is it risky to save CS 111 for 2nd pass, since it is such an important course (in terms of pre-reqs for other courses)? On the Daily Bruin article ([https://stack.dailybruin.com/2020/02/05/class-fill-ups/#:\~:text=Roughly%2044%25%20of%20classes%20filled,full%20during%20the%20first%20pass](https://stack.dailybruin.com/2020/02/05/class-fill-ups/#:~:text=Roughly%2044%25%20of%20classes%20filled,full%20during%20the%20first%20pass).) it filled up really quickly (i.e. right as first pass started for sophomores), but there were only 160 spots on that chart, whereas when I look at old class data, it looks like they eventually expanded to class to 300 spots. I think worst case I can just submit an ECR?

Another reason why I'm hesitant on using first pass on CS 111 is that I took CS 97 (instead of CS 35L), so I have a feeling it won't even let me enroll (on DAR, it says 35L isn't even in progress).

Would anyone be interested in a quant finance/algo trading club where you can learn quant skills and also pursue higher level research? I'd like to create this and need some team members.,"As most of you know there are a couple of finance clubs on campus, but their shortcoming is that they don't use technical analysis or quant skills and are instead focused on traditional investing techniques.  This is no problem, but what is a problem is that we have no club at ucla that is focused on allowing people to learn quant skills and make/evaluate/test trading algorithms, which is what most people going into this field would actually be doing.

Furthermore, quantitative finance is distinct enough from just data science that it really deserves its own learning pathway that builds off data science foundations, but requires you to understand higher level mathematical and financial intricacies that any good quant can use to make stonks.

What inspired me to pursue this is that as most people know quant trading is hot, but the barrier of entry is pretty high.  I learned some of it over the summer, but now the only really great platform to learn this stuff is dead (rip Quantopian), leaving not many good resources for learning.

I think that ucla's cs/data science/math/stats community would really benefit from a group where they can learn the basics of making algorithmic trading models through a learning based workshop and also a more advanced research team that can work on creating more intricate models.

If any of this sounds good or think there are any other things that could be included, make a comment or send me a pm.  

Right now I'm thinking of getting a team together before the quarter ends so that we can spend winter developing a curriculum for hopefully a spring launch with a learning workshop.

*If you know literally anything about quant trading or have solid data science skills send me a pm or leave a comment because I'll need probably 5-6 team members to plan and get the club running*.  Technically these would be board positions but we'd be doing lots of dev work by getting a codebase organized for a beginner algo trading workshop.  Work would be done in python, so python and data science skills are highly encouraged for board.

I might end up posting an application for these positions on various facebook groups just because I don't know how much of the target audience will see this post, but I'd prefer not too.",1605111028,1,0

"I really, really feel bad for class of 2021 Transfer","recent alum here (class of 2020 transfer) and my heart really goes out to my fellow transfer students who are graduating this upcoming year. My class thought we had it bad when we had our last quarter on campus taken from us, but at least we got to experience 5/6 of the two years we had here on campus. I'm not trying to sound pessimistic at all but it really looks like class of 2021 transfer may end up graduating w/ only 2 quarters of their time spent on campus.

 One of my friends in particular who is in this graduating class as a transfer student is a non-traditional who spent time in the military. I was really happy for him when he got in and I was hoping he'd get to experience some of the ""college life"" he never got to really experience while serving the country for those years. I really feel bad for him since he barely got to spend his time on campus, and most of his ""UCLA experience"" may be thru Zoom when it's all said and done (really hoping spring will at least allow some of you to go back on-campus). 

idk what the point of this post is exactly, but I just wanted to get this off my chest cuz my heart really goes out to you all who are in this predicament. You really never know what life may hit you w/, so I guess the silver-lining lesson here is to make the best of what you have while you still have it, and to hope for the best while preparing for the worst. Maybe some of you will end up going to grad school here or at another wonderful campus and you'll get to experience some of what you missed out here then.",1607218421,1,0

Poli Sci Majors— Anyway to get a decently high paying job?,"I absolutely love my major, but even before I started my freshman year at UCLA I’ve had a perpetual fear that my poli sci degree would be a dead end, or just lead me to an incredibly low paying job. I’m friends with a lot of Econ guys that are going to be able to get very high paying (albeit boring and stressful) jobs right out of college, so obviously this has added to my anxiety. 

I’m mildly interested in law school, but I’m not sure going to law school to have job security is the right mindset. I’ve also considered tacking on a minor, but I’m not sure which second major/minor would yield me the best results ( or if that’s the right mindset to have).

I guess an ideal situation would be a combination of internships and UCLA’s clout is enough to get me a decent job out of college, but I’m not sure that’s the case.

I’m currently a second year and I’d love to hear from some poli sci upperclassman or recent grads as to how they marketed themselves/ how their job prospects looked out of college.

should i take PSYCH 100B as p/np? (need advice asap),"hi guys, im conflicted on whether i should take psych 100b as p/np. i need at least a B+ to get into psychology, but at the same time, it could bring my gpa down too (id have a 2.85 as my prep gpa if i do p/np).

this quarter, the final grade is 50% your lecture grade and 50% your lab grade. i received a 33/40 on my midterm, which was the mean. i got 10/15 on my quizzes, mean is unknown. the final is on monday.

for lab, i received an 84 on my group proposal, mean was 82 (10% of lab grade). i dont know my exact participation but it is above the mean (10% lab grade). write-up grades have not come out yet but i predict i scored around the mean or lower and my group got 100% for the materials (both combined is worth 40% of lab grade). for the study proposal, i scored a 74 and the mean was 78 (15% of grade). there's still a discussion short answer writing assignment that's worth 20%)

im not sure how the lecture curve works but they said it will only help us. for the lab curve, the mean is a B-

i'm going to study my butt off for this final and hopefully get an A or high B. i only have 2 more hours to change to p/np and i wanted to hear some advice on whether an A or B is possible with the grades i already have right now. or even around how possible it would be to get a B or higher if i do well (like A- range) on my final.

Math dept to offer new course: Numerical Analysis (151AH/151BH). Lowkey some pretty good stuff.,"Email from dept: 

The Math Department is happy to tell you about a new course sequence which is of interest to all our majors, and perhaps other students as well.  In response to student requests and in an effort to improve our offerings, a new sequence in Numerical Analysis is being offered, starting Winter 2021 (enrollment will open in a week or two).

Numerical Analysis is the mathematics underlying approximate computational solutions to problems.  It is a rich and diverse subject and in the standard 151A and 151B many important computational methods are covered. However, in 151A and 151B the emphasis is on implementation, not on understanding the accuracy of approximations or the convergence of algorithms.  These topics are also suitable for a first course sequence in numerical analysis but it is best to add 131A as a prerequisite. Since many students take 151A after taking 131A, and since quite a few students have requested a course in which such topics are addressed, the new sequence makes sense. In addition, the new course will emphasize examples in areas of current interest such as imaging and data science. The syllabus of 151AH is online at [https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/courses/](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/courses/) and the syllabus of 151BH will be posted early in Winter quarter. 151AH and 151BH are designed by Prof. Luminita Vese and Prof. Daniel McKenzie. They will be taught in Winter and Spring 2021 by Daniel McKenzie who is an excellent teacher.

The course has been created as an “honors course” but this is just a label and we used it because we wanted to create honors courses especially for the applied math track. You do not need to plan to enter the Honors program for your major to take it. In fact, the term “honors” here is used to represent the fact that the course sequence is an “upgrade” of 151AB. However, with respect to our Honors programs, 151AH and 151BH can be substituted for any of the honors courses except 115AH required by the current Honors programs for any of the majors except Mathematics. For example, the Applied Mathematics honors program currently requires 115AH, 131AH, 131BH and 132H. So you could take 115AH, 151AH, and 151BH and 132H.",1607125249,7,0

If you took matsci104, I’d be interested to know how was the grading. 

Im with Pozuelo, and it is not clear if the class is going to be curved. Without a curve, I’m looking to get a B- (i have a good gpa, and it would honestly destroy it). 

P/NP is very attractive because i want to maintain a good GPA. I’d love to know your thoughts wether or not I should pursue that, considering the following:

- as an engineer, am I allowed to P/NP this class ? Who should I ask to be sure I can?

- i’ve already P/NP physics1C, so this would be my 2nd P/NP class. Is there an “acceptable” limit in regards to how UCLA sees it, and especially how graduate schools see it?

- is there a chance there will be a curve? I think the class average is a B.

A Quick Thank You,"Something weird happened to me the other day. I was going through the monotony of UZLA, doing work and studying for class. I was studying for a midterm I had today when I just started jacking off. I’ve never jacked off over a test (maybe after lol) but I went from mildly annoyed with the material to just straight up stroking it. It was weird and I remember thinking “oh this is new.” Long story short it made me appreciate the professors and TAs that have been putting extra time to ensure that I can cum this quarter. Those who send emails about how I specifically am fapping this quarter, where I can improve my stroke technique, etc (Dr Jack Mehoff comes to mind) even though they have hundreds of students. The TAs who have been answering my emails at absurd times like 5am. And the educators/mentors who have set aside class time and office hours to talk about edging and how to use your non-dominant hand. With everything that’s happening and midterms coming up it’s really clear who is stepping up to ensure our success and who is just counting the days till the end of the school year.

A Quick Thank You,"Something weird happened to me the other day. I was going through the monotony of UZLA, doing work and studying for class. I was studying for a midterm I had today when I just started bawling. I’ve never cried over a test (maybe after lol) but I went from mildly annoyed with the material to just straight up crying. It was weird and I remember thinking “oh this is new.” Long story short it made me appreciate the professors and TAs that have been putting extra time and care into school this quarter. Those who send emails about how I specifically am doing in the class, where I can improve, etc (Dr Pfluegl comes to mind) even though they have hundreds of students. The TAs who have been answering my emails at absurd times like 5am. And the educators/mentors who have set aside class time and office hours to talk about current events and stressors and how to push through them. With everything that’s happening and midterms coming up it’s really clear who is stepping up to ensure our success and who is just counting the days till the end of the school year. So thank you, you’re appreciated. And to everyone else I wish you much luck this school year!

Does UCLA recognize OOS universities for credit?,"Hi! I’m a current first year student and I have a slight problem. I was wondering if anyone can give me advice, it would be greatly appreciated! 

I plan on graduating with a Chinese double major. In order to do so, I need to take Intermediate Chinese (Chinese 5A) by my sophomore year. I took Chinese 1A last quarter, but got put on the waitlist for 2A. I was told that it’s rare for kids to get off of the 2A waitlist. But, they only offer 2A in the winter. The thing is, I really don’t want to take this class in person when school reopens because it’s an extremely difficult course. I only got an A because we were online. I can’t enroll in regular Chinese 2 because I already was placed on the advanced track. I can’t take the immersion courses over summer either because it’s only the regular track. The UC Cross Enrollment doesn’t offer Chinese either, so I can’t take it at other classes. The department also doesn’t give out PTEs. 

If I do not get off the waitlist, I’m basically screwed. I was wondering if I could just take up to intermediate Chinese at my own state school and receive credit, but I’m not sure how strict UCLA is. If not, could I possibly petition it? 

Sorry if I was confusing. Any advice helps. I plan on emailing the registrar’s office and the head of the Chinese department, but I’m not even sure who that is.

"Why are we ok with TAs/Profs not grading assignments, or waiting until the last second to curve?","As if taking online classes at a public university, with roughly 200 people per class, isn’t hard enough, I basically went through this quarter blind in terms of what grade I had in all three of my classes. I took all three of my finals with no idea of where my grade stood in the class because the TA’s had only graded roughly a third of the assignments in each class. When I consulted my professors to ask what my grade was (in two of the courses it was relatively low based on what had been graded, so I was concerned), they all told me that I shouldn’t worry because they curve everything at the end of the quarter anyway...

How are you supposed to make decisions about how you allocate studying time, advocate for your grades, or take classes P/NP if you have no idea what your grade is? And even if you did, it’s curved at the professors discretion (which could be anything) at the very last second? 

Long story short, I ended up P/NP a class I got an A in, and in a LG class I’m taking it now looks like I might get a low B...  So not only did I just voluntarily lower my GPA, but now grad schools look at my transcript and think that the class I passed must’ve been a low C or something. All of that could’ve been avoided if professors/ TAs were just transparent and timely with their grading and curving policies, because it’s really hard to try and maintain a good GPA when you’re in the dark about your grades all the time— which seems to happen wayyy too much here (In all four quarters I’ve been here, I think I’ve only had one class where assignments were graded within a week)",1608319447,32,0

UCSHIP birth control? HELP!,"hey y'all,

so i went to planned parenthood a few days ago to get the implant (nexplanon) but they told me they couldn't give it to me because I have a private insurance as well as my medi-cal, so the private insurance has to do it. I completely forgot to waive UCSHIP for the fall quarter, and I forgot I had it when I went to PP., so after I left I called the number they gave me for Anthem Blue Cross. I asked them to please remove this private insurance (still didn't remember UCSHIP, dumb I know), and they told me it would take 10 days and to call back to see if it was removed or not.

So I have two questions:

1. How long is coverage? I already waived it for winter quarter, but when is fall coverage over?! 
2. Can I get nexplanon through UCSHIP for free?? I get my BC from PP for free, so would it be the same with UCSHIP or will I be charged a co-pay or fee???
3. Was it bad to call Anthem Blue Cross and ask them to remove the insurance? Will I be charged a fee? (if no one knows, no problem, i should've asked them directly).

I qualify for free BC with planned parenthood and I'd like to take advantage of that, but UCSHIP is in the way. Any help on these questions would be greatly appreciated, as I would like to get this implant ASAP!! TYSM TO ANYONE WHO READ EVERYTHING!",1608266531,6,0

Now I am thinking of recovering without having anything to worry about and take a quarter off. I don't know exactly how to proceed with this. Will i declare non-attendance? Will I simply not pay my tuition? How will this affect my incomplete class from this quarter? Will I be able to take the final exam the quarter I return?

Prestige melts,"Isn’t it weird that we worked our whole lives to get here and study at UCLA yet the moment we graduate, all of it just melts away besides the degree itself? Maybe I’m just being a pessimist, but without UCLA being in person all of the real wow of attendance is dead. Because most of what we pay for to attend this school is networking and connections, as a transfer, there honestly hasn’t been an uptick in academic strain, my own learning, or quality of UCLA education compared to my community college like I expected there to be. Really, when we pay for UCLA we’re paying for bragging rights and connections. Thoughts?",1609381438,1,0

Congrats to r/ucla for being awarded the title of best university subreddit ! (half shitpost),"As I was applying to college this year, I visited a lot of universities subreddits. Even if there are some memes you find everywhere, I was hit by all the little specificities. So, as I only have a few days left to complete my applications, I was thinking, why not spoil the little time I have left  by ranking universities subreddits? 

1. UCLA ( r/ucla): LA kids are roasting anything that breaths: Berkeley, USCC, UCSD, their own university... It is one of the most active university subreddits, with a wide range of quality content.  

2. University of Michigan's ( r/uofm) subreddit is one of the most creative college subreddits. There is a reason why QS ranks them first in memological science.  

3. Cornell ( r/Cornell) has a nice and chill subreddit, with the absolute best campus pictures. 
4. UC Berkeley ( r/berkeley) has a state of the art subreddit, with more serious content than anywhere else. It is definitely not feel good, since 50% of content is about failing or being depressive. Come on bears, less whining, more memeing.
5. Notre Dame ( r/notredame): ND students are the absolute bests at roasting their own college. Cool pics too.

&amp;#x200B;

Honorable mentions: 

Johns Hopkins's (r/jhu) subreddit, despite being small is genuinely funny, even for an outsider

The University of Central Florida  ( r/ucf)  has one of the biggest university subreddits, with a wide range of quality content

Almost all of the University of California's subreddits (particularly r/UCSD) are active and fun. If calling UC Berkeley UCB does not make you laugh, you can skip

The University of Waterloo, Canada's pride ( r/uwaterloo) has one of the biggest university subreddits and was one of the few universities to reach r/all 

Dishonorable mention:

The University of Chicago's ( r/uchicago ) subreddit members spend their time making jokes on the fact their university is not fun. Neither are they.

Harvard ( r/Harvard ) is disappointing.  It is a middle sized subreddit, where 30% of the members have nothing to do with Harvard, 30% are pretending to be Harvard students while the others are sucking each other's dick in a circle (they call ""announcing someone you are a Harvard student ""dropping the H bomb). A shame, since there is quality content as well.",1609366310,1,0

Anyone know if CS31 can be used in place of PIC10A for major requirements?,"On grounds of content, I would assume it would because of the increased rigor. On grounds of reality, it probably depends on my major. So it would probably be better for me to ask my department but I just wanted to know if anyone has any experience with this. As for the why, I'm thinking about possibly switching to CS and I'd save a quater by doing CS31 instead of PIC10A. I'm enrolled in PIC10A and hopped on the waitlist for CS31 late out of curiosity. My other classes are an L&amp;S GE and MATH31B. Same-day finals for MATH31B and CS31, though.

feeling lost about post-grad plans,"I'm so lost about what I want to do post-grad. I came in as a Sociology major because I knew that I wanted to go into a profession where I can help people and make an impact on their lives, whether it be through initiatives that effect large-scale change or by making a change on more of an interpersonal basis, but honestly, that's as far as I've gotten when it comes to narrowing things down. I took part in an internship this past quarter where I was able to get some experiencing observing court sessions and do some legal research by reading through press releases, but I can't tell whether this is something that I want to do as a career. I was an English tutor before I transferred to UCLA and at my current job, I'm an after-school teacher but I don't think this is what I want to do either. I'm trying my best to get experience in as many fields as possible in an effort to find something that I'm really passionate about, but I feel like I haven't found that yet and I feel like I'm running out of time, especially being a third-year (first-year transfer student). Almost my entire family is in medicine and I've had a little bit of experience volunteering at a clinic, and it's something that I think I found to be fulfilling, so I've looked up some paths that might combine social science / Sociology with medicine. I also took part in a designation over the summer where I learned a little about UX design, but I don't really know any other fields that combine social science with tech. I feel so torn and uncertain about my timeline here at UCLA. Should I have started studying for the GRE already so that I can take it over the summer? Do I even need the GRE? I've been looking into internships to apply for over the summer but I don't know where to start because I feel like I should definitely be dedicating my time to an internship that will supplement what career I go into, but I'm so unsure. I feel like most of the extracurriculars that I've taken part in so far have been primarily exploratory, but I'm feeling the mounting pressure, especially as the time ticks down and I still can't make up my mind. I've looked into potentially requesting a mentor on UCLA ONE, but in order to even begin that process, I feel like I need more of a solid footing in what type of career I want to pursue. I'm also open to conducting informational interviews, but I'm not sure who to ask. I feel like everyone here already knows what they want to do with their lives. If you made it to the end of this post, thanks so much for reading. I know I probably sound so naive and all over the place, but any advice or insight would be much appreciated.",1609358132,1,0

Prospective Undergraduate Student Application Questions,"I am currently a high school junior interested in applying to UCLA in 2022. With COVID taking away many opportunities this year, I need advice on how my high school resumé compares and honest feedback. I wanted to run these by current students and see if I’m on the right track to possibly attending UCLA, since it’s competitive. 

Academically, I have a 3.96 unweighted GPA (4.0 weighted), two dual enrollment classes under my belt, and a 25 on my first ACT test. I will continue to test for improvement, since I’ve got another year. I know for certain that I’ll be in AP art next year. AP English might be possible too.

Artistically, I am the Vice President of my school’s art club. I have high hopes that I’ll be president next year. I have placed in multiple local art competitions, and am currently engaging with my town’s art district. I have sold multiple artworks professionally and been the featured artist at a charity event. I have exhibited my work in multiple places, including a nearby art museum. 

Community-wise, I’ve painted windows for local businesses twice with two different youth art organizations.

In terms of letters of recommendation, I have relationships with artists and designers in the local art scene, some business owners. I’m new at my current school, but getting along well with teachers, especially in art.

Since UCLA is difficult to get into, what can I do to improve my application, aside from my ACT score? The pandemic has made community service very difficult to partake in, since my state has high rates of the virus.

Pre-HBS major questions,"Hi, I’m currently a pre-psychobio freshman and I want to switch to pre-HBS. I think I read on the department site that you have to take Soc Gen 5 before you can officially request to be a pre-HBS major if you’re switching pre-majors. If I try to enroll in Soc Gen 5 or other pre-HBS courses, do I have to be declared pre-HBS to enroll??

For instance, if I want to enroll in Soc Gen 5 &amp; other pre-req courses for HBS in the summer, will there be any restrictions for first pass? (Idk how enrollment for summer sessions works like I don’t even know if there’s a first/second pass thing for summer enrollment so if anyone can clarify lol)

Also, how competitive is the HBS major? I know I still have a lot of time until the end of my sophomore year but I’m worried about not having enough time to do extracurriculars bc of everything being online.

Lastly, if anyone is a current HBS major, how do you like it? What tips do you have for pre-HBS majors?

Working on a strategy to help out local businesses,"Hi everyone!! I and a few other UCLA students and alumni have been working at a non-profit organization that is working to promote small local businesses in LA!  We are currently researching ways to help improve shopping traffic to these businesses. So we created a short survey to be able to get an idea of people's shopping patterns and hopefully find a strategy to help some of the local businesses in LA to improve traffic to their shops. During this pandemic, we have seen and heard about so many closures of local shops in LA, and in dire times like this, we wanted to find out a way to help support these businesses.

The survey is 100% anonymous and should last 1-4 minutes give or take. We would appreciate any feedback you may have, and you can message me with any questions.

I’ve also been paying in-state tuition for the past 2 years or so but I’m not sure how much that matters for UCs residency guidelines.

I’d also like mention that I will be turning 23 in a couple months (if that matters in terms of financial independence).

Questions from a UK student looking to apply.,"I'm from the UK and it's my dream to attend UCLA. I am very aware that applying would not not be an easy process and would dramatically increase my workload, given I would need to prepare for and take the SAT in my own time and simultaneously complete the UK university application process. 

Before I commit to the applying, I would love to know the answer to some of the questions that have been playing on my mind!

1. Is UCLA in a safe area? How safe would you say it is?
2. This may seem like a ridiculous question but the main thing which really holds me back is the risk of a shooting on campus. I know statistically the chances are low but I have grown up associating America with school shootings due to the volume of shootings which happen each year. How prepared is UCLA for a school shooting? Do you feel safe on campus and like you would know what to do if a shooting was to happen?
3. Are undergraduates encourage to try new sports? My sport, netball, isn't available at UCLA (as far as I am aware) so I wouldn't be able to play a sport at UCLA without learning a new one. Is it common for students to try out sports they've never done before? And is it unusual for students to represent the school playing a sport they'd never played prior to UCLA?
4. Is it easy to make friends at UCLA? 
5. What are the best things about UCLA? What would you say to someone who is on the fence about applying?",1601839661,1,0

We are the editors and staffers behind the Daily Bruin’s [Registration Issue: Uncharted Waters](https://features.dailybruin.com/2020/registration-issue/). Released last week, this publication explored news and student stories about a fall quarter full of changes ahead for all Bruins. We know that this quarter isn’t what anyone expected, from remote classes to changes in housing contracts. Today, we hope to answer some of your questions about recent changes to UCLA’s operations, related to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. 

We’re now **live** until 4 p.m., so ask us your questions and voice your concerns about what this fall quarter will look like regarding the following topics:

* COVID-19 testing
* UCLA Housing
* Reopening plans
* UCLA Athletics and its upcoming season
* Federal policies affecting international students
* Mental health and general resources
* Updated Title IX rules
* Remote classes and technology
* Student life and campus organizations
* Public health guidelines in Westwood and on campus

*Disclaimer*: With so many recent policy changes around UCLA’s fall operations, we know there may be tons of questions about the ongoing quarter. However, it can be hard for us to answer questions outside this scope or regarding personal housing, financial aid or major statuses. Questions on specific and personal scenarios should be redirected to corresponding organizations responsible for the topic – including academic advisors, UCLA Financial Aid and Scholarships or UCLA Housing.

Hi Bruins! We’ve received many of your concerns about the Daily Bruin’s history with transfer students on campus on our live AMA.,"We hope today's [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/j48o4a/we_are_the_editors_and_reporters_behind_the_daily/) can highlight more questions about our sections, application process and work today. We’re happy to answer any and all questions regarding our newsroom reforms and inclusivity policies on this dedicated post as well. The Daily Bruin aims to serve the UCLA community. As such, it is doubly and shamefully a failure when our actions harm that very same community. Our past coverage has failed the transfer community because many of its students do not see themselves reflected in our work, or worse, see false and negative stereotypes where truth should be.

The most clear example of this failure is our editorial board's nonendorsement of Carl Illustrisimo from the spring 2020 Undergraduate Students Association Council election. The text is currently unavailable (we're having a months-long technical issue with several of our external sites, not just the USAC 2020 flatpage) and has been removed from the body of the text, but preserved in an [editor's note](https://dailybruin.com/the-daily-bruin-community-guide#corrections). On the whole, the original published endorsement inexcusably demeaned Illustrisimo's experiences as inferior to his four-year student opponent's and called his work more fit for ""a picket line"" than student office. 

I offer my sincere and unequivocal apology for our words.

I know I speak for many staffers when I say we were horrified and ashamed upon seeing this for the first time, including several who serve on this year's editorial board. I also know that our feelings are insignificant compared to those of the people we hurt. 

It is my deep regret that there is nothing we can do to take that initial harm away. Instead, I offer my commitment that the new 2020-21 editor team will continually work to improve our coverage and to interrogate our blindspots and biases going into this academic year. The rest of this post is dedicated to outlining the plan behind that work.

**Hiring**

Our first and most recent Diversity Report from 2019-20 doesn't include any data about transfer versus four-year student status. We're making that change for the 2020-21 report, so we should know more about that data in the coming months and release it then.

What has most clearly been an oversight on our part is that we have not historically asked for transfer status when compiling our annual internal diversity report. In the next few months, however, we will have a better understanding of those internal demographics when it comes to transfer students, as we will be expanding our diversity report to include the question of transfer status. 

In our hiring process, we do not consider transfer status as a pro or con in hiring because we generally don't know who is or isn't a transfer student at the interview stage. Transfer status is only listed in the resume section of our applications, so it's hard to keep track of who's who when it gets to the interview stage. This is possibly a shortcoming of our hiring processes, and one we can address once we have data to understand where our problems lie (too few applicants, disproportionately high rejections, neither, both, etc.).

In the meantime, our outreach director is making an extra effort this year to publicize our internships with the Transfer Student Center and Facebook groups, as well as beginning to form partnerships with journalism programs at local community colleges directly to increase familiarity among incoming transfers with The Bruin leading up to their arrivals at UCLA.

I recognize from these comments that we have a long way to go in making the Bruin feel truly accessible to all students, but that is my goal. If you want to send me an email at editor@dailybruin.com, I'm very open to suggestions.

**Training**

The Daily Bruin editorial staff underwent several new trainings this summer to further inform our outlook going into this year. I know trainings are imperfect and too often one-and-done, but we're hoping they were a good first step to set the tone for the year.

We held professional Diversity, Equity and Inclusion training Sept. 19. We held transfer awareness training conducted by the Transfer Student Center on Sept. 21. We expanded our normal sensitivity training to include discussion specifically about our failures with Carl Illustrisimo's student government nonendorsement. 

**Coverage**

We released our first-ever community survey over the summer (another will be coming out in the fall) to solicit input about our coverage and especially what it's missing. Several people noted that we fail to adequately represent transfer issues and stories. 

As a general note for clarity, most of our coverage refers to transfer students as third- or fourth-year students without labeling them as transfer students. We only apply additional labels beyond our standard name/year/major when it is relevant to the content of the story, per Associated Press style. If you see a third-year student's reaction to a concert or sports game, for example, that person's transfer or nontransfer status is not implied in our reporting one way or another. We currently do not track demographic data about our sources for logistical and privacy reasons.

Our two main strategies to address this issue are hiring (see above) and community outreach. No one person can see UCLA in its entirety, and that's especially a challenge for us this year with remote learning. Instead, we are working to build stronger relationships with different campus entities in the hopes that they will feel comfortable bringing their work and events to our attention. The new outreach director position was created in the hope of forging those connections. We also published the Daily Bruin Community Guide to improve our transparency, which we hope in turn can make those early steps toward a working relationship a little smoother.

**Leadership**

Though I don't have any precise data to reference yet, our leadership team glaringly lacks transfer students. This is a tricky issue so, again, I'm open to any ideas if you've addressed the problem with a different student organization and want to send the results our way.

We hire for editorships every spring quarter. Students often reach the increasing levels of editorship (assistant editor then top editor or upper management) in sequential order. If a transfer who plans to graduate in two years immediately joins the Daily Bruin during our fall or winter hiring cycles, they will only get one chance at editorship in the spring. There are no rules barring transfer students from applying to top editor or upper management jobs during this cycle, but the timeline still makes it difficult for transfer students to reach and be represented at the highest levels of the Daily Bruin hierarchy.

**So where does that leave us?**

I am a strong believer in concrete baby steps. The Daily Bruin's history and internal structures are more than 100 years old. It'll likely take more than three quarters to rebuild the transfer community’s trust in our paper – but we’re committed to laying the foundation for a more inclusive newsroom for the years to come. While we only serve one-year terms, I know the 2020-21 editors to be exceptionally talented and thoughtful. With that calculus and this plan in mind, I know we can make those initial steps to bring our service into balance with what the campus deserves. 

If you have feedback on how we can do better, we really do want to hear from you. Contact information is available on our [Community Guide](https://dailybruin.com/the-daily-bruin-community-guide#contact), or you're more than welcome to reach out to me directly at [editor@dailybruin.com](mailto:editor@dailybruin.com).

Transfer students on this sub are hilarious,"Seriously, you guys are sooo pressed about allegedly being discriminated against. Lmao, cmon give me a break. Nobody at the daily bruin has it out for you. The fact that you guys are pretending to be some sad group of victims is really pathetic. 

I'm not in the daily bruin or affiliated with them in anyway, but I wanted to speak on this because this narrative has gotten out of hand. The daily bruin hires people who are qualified and will add something to the paper for years to come. Obviously traditional students fit this bill because they'll be there for 4 years instead of just 2. There's no conspiracy here. It's just simple math.

And regarding how the DB treated carl and deven during elections. They didn't do anything wrong. Those candidates did in fact lack experience, it's just a simple fact of being a transfer student. You're only at UCLA 2 years instead of 4. So when other candidates who actually had involvements on campus decide to run, you can't blame the DB for bringing up an obvious fact.

So let's just drop this whole crazy idea that the daily bruin hates transfers. it's simply not true. i would argue that the opposite is the case - transfers hate the daily bruin. And I'm not even sure why.",1601751944,1,0

Advice for a freshman getting slaughtered,"Hi everyone,

I just started my freshman year at UCLA, and it honestly sucks. I've had no time for myself over the past few days, and am just getting straight up swamped. My classes are Econ 1, PSCTRY 79, Religion 11, and the Food Cluster. There's so much reading to do every day, and I have no idea what I should know, since we don't have quizzes and assignments that gauge progress. One of my classes, Religion 11, literally assigns 100 pages of reading every 2 days, and PSYCTRY 79 gives recorded lectures and basically an equal amount of reading. Econ 1 is also doing a number on me since I'm reading one chapter every 2 days along with associated activities. Meanwhile, my cluster is also happening but I've got no idea what's going on. Is this normal? It would be great to get some advice. Now back to more reading.

Thank you!
