Summer Internships on the Quarter System,"I'm coming to Davis for a graduate degree and hope to find a summer internship in my field next summer.

Class Materials NOT Included in Equitable Access,"I decided to just stay opted in for the first quarter even though it‚Äôs expensive, just so I didn‚Äôt have to figure anything out.

Is this schedule overkill for an incoming freshman?,"I'm going to be starting as a freshman this fall and was wondering if this schedule would be overkill for my first quarter.

**JPN 001 016 (Elementary Japanese)** (5 units) (waitlisted)  
\- or might drop for **CLA 30F 002 (Word Roots)** (3 units)  
**MAT 016A 003 (Short Calculus)** (3 units)  
**PLS 021 A08 (Computers in Technology)** (3 units)  
**WLD 041C 005 (Preparatory Chem-SCC110C)** (3 units)  
**FRS 002 023 (FYS)** (2 units)  
**LTS 002 001 (Major Exploration)** (1 unit)

I've seen others post their schedules on the official Facebook page and they usually had like 3-5 classes, which is apparently the recommended number of classes to take that also add up to around 15 units as recommended. I, on the other hand, have planned for six classes. If I somehow get off the waitlist for JPN 001, I will have 17 units total. If CLA 30F, 15 units total. 

I convinced myself it would probably be fine since LTS 002 is the major-exploring seminar, which I probably won't really have to do work for, and FRS 002 023 is the NaNoWriMo novel-writing seminar, which should be pretty fun. I had Japanese for three years in high school but got the go-ahead to take JPN 001. I took AP Calc AB in senior year and passed the exam this year with a 3. So I thought this schedule was manageable, but after seeing others' schedules, I'm not so sure anymore. My advisor also emailed me first recently to ask me to schedule an appointment to discuss my fall schedule.

I love to see Aggie apparel in public places,"Just a late night thought. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but it‚Äôs the only time I ever feel a rush of school pride anymore, the feeling of accomplishment from recognizing good ol‚Äô Gunrock, or a Davis logo somewhere off of campus in an unexpected place. It brings me back to all of life‚Äôs obstacles that I overcame, just to get accepted to a UC in the first place. I reflect on all of the achievements, the challenges I overcame while trying to figure out a new chapter of life, and the lasting friendships and memories made along the way. Some good, some bad, but it‚Äôs life. You spend your entire academic career preparing for the next chapter, so when it‚Äôs all said and done, I feel that anyone, everyone that managed to get through their educational goals deserves to feel proud of themselves, for pushing through the marathon. 

Seeing a fellow Aggie, or someone with clothing from Davis, casually out in the world while they‚Äôre going about their own lives, just feels good. On a license plate holder, or during your way through the aisles on a Saturday shopping trip to Costco, or even when you‚Äôre out on an evening stroll or in a city thousands of miles away from campus.. it just feels nice. For me, I guess it‚Äôs the fact that I like to sonder/indulge in the fact that random people from different walks of life probably share the same feelings of nostalgia we all do when we yearn for our college years.

To me, it‚Äôs funny that I see more Aggie apparel now than I thought I ever would. For years, it felt like students growing up in CA were conditioned to poke fun and scrutinize a handful of UC‚Äôs, only to place other campuses on a pedestal, Davis being one of them. As someone whose dream school was always Davis, who is now outside CA, this feeling of immense pride is fleeting yet sooo appreciated. I don‚Äôt think many other cities in California are quite like Davis, especially college towns. I hate that times are so weird for the students on and off campus, and I have nothing but respect for anyone still committed to the big picture right now. 

Whether your a freshman pissed off that your first year experiences have been taken from you, or the senior drudging through their final year, irritated by the fact that their last moments will be the complete opposite of what was originally expected all along.. To the TA‚Äôs and staff too, folks that are truly eager and passionate about the work and community they represent, doing their best to manage an awkward system of Zoom conferences and lectures.. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only alumni that feels so bad for this crappy situation college students/employees are facing in the midst of COVID. If any current student or freshman cares to even read this random ass post from an alumni, just remember that you are working towards something that‚Äôs so fulfilling when it is all said and done. If life ever returns to normal, I hope every Aggie remembers to cherish the moment. Focus on good health, attaining your goals, and setting up the foundation to become a new and better version of you, the one you‚Äôve always aspired to be. Even though it‚Äôs not too long ago, I look back, and realize how formidable a few years will be to my entire outlook on life. üê¥",1601977542,1,0

$1 parking near campus on ParkStash app,"So I just found out TAPS is enforcing parking passes this quarter. For those of us who don't want to pay $50/month to make a quick stop at the library or work in a lab, I was an intern this summer at an app company called ParkStash where students can rent parking spaces from local businesses for $1 per hour. Space is limited as of now, but you can book in advance for days that you know you'll be on campus (highly recommend!) which should make it easier. We have spaces available on A street by iTea and behind Trader Joe's, so they're pretty accessible to most areas of campus, and are available by the hour on weekends as well. ParkStash is available on iOS and Google Play for free!! Hope this helps!

FYS Drop?,"Hey, first-year here. I wanted to enroll in the ""Habits to Improve Our Mental Well-being"" First-Year Seminar, but accidentally enrolled in a different seminar and was dumb enough to not realize it until the first day. The current seminar I'm enrolled in (which will be unnamed out of respect to the professor) honestly doesn't catch my interest at all. The problem is, the ""Habits to Improve Our Mental Well-being"" seminar has a waitlist of 10 students/6 students (depending on the time slot). Also, if I drop the current seminar I'm enrolled in, I'll be down to 12 units. Should I drop my current seminar, or should I tough it out 'till the end?",1601749295,1,0
Being Dropped During Rushing,"Hey yall, I was rushing this year and found out that a lot of sororities dropped me (only got 3 who wanted me back to meet me) and it's only the second day.

Any tips on holding a job while taking four classes [STEM],"My major is electrical engineering and I have grown depressed. I've been planning on obtaining a job and I was wondering if you guys had any thoughts on how I should go about doing this while taking four uppderdiv classes. In my case, I am taking two upper div, as well as ECS 36B, and another GE right now.

I often find myself twiddling my thumbs during the day. I find that I have no motivation. The idea is that if I force myself to work say 15 hours a week, I will be forced to spend the rest of my time productively. Nowadays, I wake up at 10:30 every day, listen to recordings of my lecture late, drudge by, feel depressed and like dropping out, and so on. My suspicion is that having a job would give me a sense of purpose.

Anyways, my question is: how do you guys go about working while taking four classes as a stem major?",1601698575,1,0

Mark my words. It‚Äôs statistically impossible that IN PERSON instruction will be back by Fall 2021!,"Let‚Äôs get things straight, this year is going to be completely online. The only thing that will allow students to go back to in person instruction is a vaccine. Why? If there‚Äôs not a vaccine, hosting hundreds of people in a close room has been scientifically proven to increase the chances of contracting the virus. With this being said, a vaccine is not coming any time soon, at least a safe one. ‚ÄúHow Vaccines Are Made And Tested? The creation of a vaccine involves scientists and medical experts from around the world, and it usually requires 10 to 15 years of research before the vaccine is made available to the general public.‚Äù From CDC.GOV; Now that we know it takes 10-15 years to‚ÄùSAFELY‚Äù release a vaccine, 2022 doesn‚Äôt seem quite promising.

Advice?,"This is going to be a mess but I‚Äôve thinking about logistics for my time at college and I‚Äôm trying to figure out what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôm a freshman. When I talked to my major advisor she said I could possibly graduate in 3 years (I‚Äôm pretty sure I have IGETC). Now I‚Äôm just wondering should I stack up on units and try and graduate as fast as I can (so far I‚Äôm handling my work well but that‚Äôs also because I have a lot of background in these subjects, I‚Äôm sure the next quarters will be harder) or should I used up the 4 years. I‚Äôm an environmental science major and the only other subjects I‚Äôm interested in are library sciences (which is masters program At UCD from my understanding) and baking (which I don‚Äôt think they have any classes for lmao). I don‚Äôt see the point in getting a minor and there‚Äôs not really any double majors I‚Äôm interested in (maybe I could do botany or something? I like gardening lmao). It also just seems like a waste of effort because you really just need a degree in the field for most careers from my understanding. I am really interested in library sciences (I‚Äôve been a library page for over a year now) but there‚Äôs barely any schools that have a bachelors program for that. I also don‚Äôt know if I want to get a masters degree. Before I was thinking no I just want to get out as soon as possible to save money, but a masters degree tends to lead to a higher salary. Maybe I could even get a masters in library sciences I‚Äôm not sure what background you need for that though. Basically I have those 4 years of cal grant/ fafsa and I feel like it‚Äôs a waste not to use it. Does anyone know if I can use that towards a masters degree. Honestly I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm doing. I guess all that was unnecessary but I‚Äôm wanting to get a ‚Äú4 year plan‚Äù but I‚Äôm still not sure what I‚Äôm doing and I‚Äôm not sure if I should try and make it into a 3 year plan or??? Is there someone at UCD that I could talk about this crisis I‚Äôm having? Like an advisor or something?",1603086938,1,0
Advice for Grad School,"Heyo!

Should I apply for grad school now or take a gap year? Current situation:

* Senior transfer student
* Biological Sciences. Really interested in genetics/genomics (particularly human/medical related) and really want to try and get research in that field to see if that's still where my passions are!
* GPA 3.3
* Working a job
* No research experience, applying now
* Unsure of who to ask for letters of rec
* Not sure if I should take a gap year to get experience (ex. junior specialist position) and make connections, or go for it and apply now

I spoke to a grad school counselor, and she suggested either applying now or taking a gap year and working in a position like a junior specialist/internship. If anyone has gone through a similar situation, I'd love to hear from you and what the outcome was! :)",1603084211,1,0

meaning of 20-day drop,"Hi,

I have a class that has a 20-day drop.

Does this mean if I drop the class before 10/27/2020 I won't get any mark on my record (i.e. just like I never registered for the class) or there are consequences for doing so? The reason why I'm asking is that 20 days seems a lot, and dropping this late to good to be true.

Also class started on 10/01, so 20-day drop seems like 10/20/2020 instead of 27, does this means weekends don't count?",1603078956,1,0

Regarding Admissions to the Teaching Credential/MA program for Next year,"Well, it looks like that the decision has been changed and that admission will continue for the program for next year. For those out of the loop, there was small hooplah admissions being possibly suspended for the program for an indeterminate amount of time while it underwent an overhaul. However, after pushback from various groups, it seems that the decision will be struck down. To be clear, it seems that there will still be a change to the program to better align it with its new goal, but it seems that this will now be a more gradual process. Here's a link to a pdf of the letter: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UxyotptWjkAOHU3ZES7JM1yEE5vK1Tdt/view?usp=sharing)",1602870712,1,0

A reminder on posting with URL shorteners: They likely will get caught in the Spam filter.,"I've noticed an up-tick in folks submitting links in comments and posts using URL sorteners like TinyURL and such.  While often benign, these shorteners can be used maliciously and as such Reddit usually defaults them to Spam.

Also generally speaking, I'm not brave enough to click on that short URL to see if it goes to the article you said it does or if it goes to your honepot Virus box instead.  I'm likely to just leave it in the Spam folder.

TLDR: Not against the rules to use URL shorteners, but its not recommended.",1600846853,1,0

Cancellation Warning? Any advice?,"I had requested 4-5 transcripts via Parchment since accepting my SIR. Some were received, while some were never received.

Things looked good at this point, with both my high school and college transcripts showing received dates. 

Suddenly today, I receive a cancellation warning and notice that my college transcript is set back to ""not received"". Of course, I went ahead and just ordered a new transcript via Parchment, but I am worried it will not be processed in time as classes are right around the corner.

Career suggestions?,"Hey all,

I was just wondering if anyone here could give me some advice as to what career I might be best at. 

I've always enjoyed the arts and creative things (writing essays, music, art, etc) but  I'm wary of pursuing music and art as a career because of the high risk and low payoff. I enjoy the social sciences and humanities, but I don't think I'll be very happy with any of the jobs I can get with those degrees. With that in mind, I'm trying to think of careers that might utilize my creative side while providing financial stability. 

I'm not seriously considering engineering or architecture, but it seems so rewarding to have a portfolio of things you've created that you can look back on and be proud of. I wish I could do that with art or music, but those are both very risky career moves and I feel it's best to have a backup plan. I want to do something creative, I just don't know what it would be.

How do I kiss ass this quarter? [satire],"Now running into midterms I'm experiencing a problem I haven't yet considered. When classes were in person I would spend my time going to every office hour, hang around every podium after class, etc, until each of my professors knew me by name, age, and hidden talent. I would start by asking them about their lives, an innocent ""how did you get to where you are"". A week or two in they would start to open up, eventually sharing their favorite stories about their childhood. By week 4 I was putting hearts on the bottom of my first midterms, TA's were certainly confused but it's the thought that counts. The dynamic would roll on, getting more and more intense! By week 4 they knew I didn't have a clue when it came to academics, but they cared about the kid who could lick their elbow. When the second set of midterms came I would get a completely different exam than the other students. One that simply asked me to write the alpha-delta-omega-bet from  **Œ±** \- Œ© . It was beautiful. Somehow it was the next step that carried all the genius. You see, as my grades would likely be in the B- range (due to them taking it easy on me), I would tell each professor those famous three words our fathers didn't tell us enough as kids. The reactions were priceless. Anything from ""Oh you poor thing"" to ""You need therapy"" to ""Oh Tony I would but school policy says..."". Every time it would go in one of two directions, always with the same result. Direction one, at the minimum they would bump me up half to a full letter grade post-final (mind you it was already that B- from earlier üòâ ). Direction two, lets just say my GPA is looking strong and I should clear out my contact history...

And you see, that's the problem! With this pandemic I can only do so much. It hit me today when I couldn't put a heart at the bottom of my first midterm... I spent so much time seducing I never spent any learning how to study, I'm completely lost. I need your help guys, comment down below what strategies you'd recommend for how to kiss ass during this pandemic. Much obliged

I'm scared, and I don't know who to open up to or even how to open up to someone. I want to confide into someone, but I just get scared. I can't find the exact reasoning, but I think it revolves around protecting the cheery/easygoing image of myself that other people have of me, and that I don't know if the stuff I'm saying are actual problems or just excuses. These thoughts are reminiscent of the time when I wrote my personal insight questions. I just kept breaking down when I tried to come up with shit. I feel incompetent.

Anyone else severely underwhelmed by classes this quarter?,"I've seen a lot of posts about being OVERwhelmed but I can't relate to any of them. I'm a first year transfer (junior status), psych major with insect ecology minor. I'm only taking 13 units due to a) needing to drop a class early on, and b) finding that quite a few classes I need aren't being offered online right now. 

Don't get me wrong, it's nice to not be constantly stressed by coursework, but watching my roommates scramble to get their work done (while taking roughly the same number of units as me) while I have nothing to do makes me feel pretty dreadful. It's been so suspiciously easy that I'm constantly fearing I'll be unprepared for ""real"" classes once they resume. 

I'd like to get a job, but with Covid I'm trying not to put myself in risky positions unless it's absolutely necessary. I spend a ton of time just doing the bare minimum and taking depression naps. It's pretty much as pathetic as it sounds.

Jumping from MAT 21B to 16C,"Current freshman here. I'm currently trying to schedule my classes for Winter Quarter and I had something I wanted a second opinion on.

I'm currently enrolled in MAT 21B and, while it took me a while to get, I don't feel it's as bad as I thought it would be. That being said, I've heard a lot of horror stories regarding 21C and am having second doubts about taking it next quarter. The 21 series isn't mandatory for my major, with the requirements there being either 16, 17, or 21.

This brings me to my question (which should be obvious from the title): What would it be like going from 21B to 16C? I don't want to be pulling my hair out at everything, yet I also don't want to feel like I'm wasting my time with a class. Would 17C also be a viable option?

Struggles of online school at UC Davis,"Hello,

Id to first off by saying I am not a bad student. I graduated hs with above a 4.0. I literally was a straight a student with the exception of a few b's. Ever since everything switched online, I have been doing so bad and I feel terrible. And before you say anything, I literally study for everything, attend every lecture, AND take notes for everything. I STILL MANAGED TO FAIL EVERY QUIZ AND TEST. I got a 54% on a test and was happy, so i hope that puts it into perspective a little. I just dont know what is going on, but i just wanted to know if others feel the same about school as i do. As context, i am a first year bio sci major who will happily be switching to [HDE](https://HDE.It) in the spring or fall of next year. It may be that my major is just too hard for me to handle, but i just am not doing so good in my first ever quarter in college. It sucks because i thought id have so much fun in college, even with it being online, but in reality all i have been doing is struggling to find the motivation to do anything. If any of you have advice or any resources to help pls do!!!!!!!",1605074765,1,0

Major advice?,"I‚Äôve been feeling kind of conflicted about what steps I ought to take next for my academic career. I‚Äôm currently doing sociology and psychology, but I‚Äôve been thinking about switching to a music major with an emphasis on composition. I would love the chance to study music for the next three years and create original compositions, but I‚Äôm worried about adding this as a major because of the uncertain financial outcome. I think I‚Äôd be really happy studying music, but if I do that, I need to make sure my other major will set me up for a career I enjoy.  


The thing is, I‚Äôm not sure what to do about my current majors. I really like studying psychology and I find neuroscience inherently fascinating, but I feel like the analytical and communication skills you get with a sociology major as well as the broader sociological perspective it provides are ultimately going to be more useful when I start my career (as well as for my own personal development).   


I‚Äôve been taking the Holland Code test (RIASEC) lately, and it‚Äôs giving me a really high score for artistic and a somewhat lower score for investigative, with low scores for everything else if that‚Äôs any help. I feel like the most rewarding careers are ones where I get to work on a creative project by myself, but I‚Äôm not sure what that would be.   


Also, I‚Äôve been looking at career outcomes for psychology majors and it doesn‚Äôt seem like any of the psychology careers fit my personality or interests very well. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd enjoy doing therapy or counseling, and I don‚Äôt have enough experience to determine whether research would be a good fit. I‚Äôd like to avoid teaching if possible. I‚Äôm not sure about the outcomes for sociology either, but it seems like the communication skills you get by doing sociology could be applied more broadly.   


Does anyone have any advice or feedback? Should I drop the psychology major and just do sociology and music? I‚Äôll definitely work on getting internships and work experience to strengthen my resume in either case.",1605067417,1,0

Favorite and Hated NPB Electives?,"I'm a 4th year NPB major, and I still have to take 3 more of the upper division electives. I'm curious what everyone's favorite and least favorite electives have been, as I'm still not 100% about any of them! 

I'll start. I took NPB 107 in winter of 2020 with Trimmer. I was taking it at the same time as NPB 110A, and the two classes are very similar in some ways, making my studying a lot easier. The class covers a wide range of topics, including (but not limited to) GPCRs, how the senses work at a cell level, and how drugs are made and the process they go through to be approved by the FDA. The slides were quite dense, so it's important to attend class to see what exactly he emphasizes. He also has learning goals at the end of each lecture that really help you focus on what you need to study. 2 Midterms, 1 Final (not comprehensive!!), and 6 pop quizzes throughout the quarter to ensure people were attending class. Had recommended readings, but nothing showed up on the test without being taught in lecture. Good professor, took questions and quietly had a great sense of humor. Highly recommend the class if you need an elective to take in Winter quarter (when there generally aren't a lot to choose from).",1605052023,1,0

How doable is this 20-unit quarter?,"Hi all,

I'm a Cognitive Science major. I'm only 4 major courses away from graduating (planned for Spring,) but I'm considering declaring a psychology minor. In order to get the minor and graduate on time my Winter quarter would have to be 20 units and look like this:

(4) PHI 102

(4) UWP 101

(4) PSC 168

(4) PSC 101

(4) ANT 132

How doable is this? Is a philosophy minor even worth it if you're already majoring in Cog Sci? I know PSC 101 is very difficult, I'm already pretty knowledgeable when it comes to abnormal psych, and I'm pretty decent at writing.

I'd also have to make my Spring schedule look like this:

(4) PHI 112

(4) PHI 104

(4) CGS 107

(4) CMN 150V

Is it worth doing a 20-unit quarter and is this doable? Is a psych minor worth it for a Cog Sci major?",1605044368,1,0
Schoodule,"Hey Aggies!

I've been working on a small project, Schoodule, to help with my workflow for classes and coursework. 

It's a desktop website that serves as a scheduling tool specifically made for students.

This tool provides one location to view all bits of information regarding any course or event that you decide to schedule. You can store and find any:

* Links
* Emails
* Professors/TAs
* Office Hours
* Discussion/Labs
* Important Exam Dates

Each course/event also comes with an included to-do list for those who like to stay extra organized!

I've been using this tool for the last couple of weeks and I've found it very useful-- especially since classes are all online anyway. So, I decided to launch a small beta version for anyone who might be interested in Schoodule.

You can access it at myschoodule.com!Also, if you have any feedback or ideas for improvement, feel free to send it through the feedback section of the website! :)

Perseverance (and how to have it with a 6 figure salary),"These emails from Gary May have been really helping me throughout quarantine. Each month I anticipate his email with the utmost import. It helps me understand why my loan money wasn't dispersed until the last week of October. Reading poems in pdf, having the syllabus memorized, and be sure to turn your camera on for zoom lecture so your classmates can see that you are learning just as easily as them. Go buy food, think about dropping out (again), don't talk about authorial intent, you don't know what humans were going through then, you wouldn't want to be a critic would you ? 

This quarter killed grad school for me and I'm ok with that. Middle class is just poor people in debt anyway. Here's a poem I wrote the other day: 

  9 Months

Not everly, but averly 

Repeating  

Of course 

A female name

As pitiful 

As obscure 

As a neon sign 

Fighting for air time 

An anime I watched 

(it was from the 90s) 

Miss spelled

‚Äúintranet ‚Äú (sic)

Since february 

It‚Äôs felt like two years 

Maybe 5 

For not seeing people

Turned everyone else

Does Enderle use the textbook explicitly, or does he use another resource that we can take notes on. Gulacar doesn't use the textbook, but instead uses OLI, which is a more simplified version of the textbook and has practice problems along with the reading.

I could always transfer, though I‚Äôm doubting that would happen. It‚Äôs hard to focus on school when I‚Äôm not even sure what I want to do in the future. 

At this point I feel like I‚Äôm just paying for the school‚Äôs name, zoom university is the same at every college. 

Advice pleaseeee",1605023922,1,0
For the people who are struggling,"Hey everyone! I know that the pandemic has taken a huge toll on everyone‚Äôs health, and the workload of all the classes can be overwhelming/stressful, but I just wanted to say that it‚Äôs OK if you‚Äôre struggling, whether it be academically, mentally, or physically. I know it‚Äôs difficult to keep up with the pace of the quarter system with all these pestering deadlines and the constant dread of failing classes, but its ENTIRELY NORMAL. College is meant to be hard. You‚Äôre going to feel dumb some times. But don‚Äôt worry! LOL FRICKIN HELL I couldn‚Äôt even tie my shoelaces until I was 10 years old and I managed to become a CS major here!!!  I digress. Realize that if you keep working hard now, it will probably pay off in the end. Just keep on trying your best and realize that there is no easy route in life to become successful, but if you put in the effort, you‚Äôll get to where you want to be. Don‚Äôt worry if your grades aren‚Äôt perfect or that amazing. You‚Äôll feel miserable. But you‚Äôll make up for it with your EXPERIENCE. I know it‚Äôs hard to stay motivated but also make sure to TAKE BREAKS! Burnout is super common in college!! Go for a walk. Tryout some new hobbies. Make sure you balance your schedule!! Good luck to you all there‚Äôs only a couple weeks left in this quarter!",1605004133,1,0

BIS103 + BIS104 in the same quarter doable?,"I'm an EEB major with 10 units left to graduate. All I need is BIS103, BIS104 and a 4 unit upper div GE to graduate.

I heard BIS103 and BIS104 are harder than BIS102. I personally find BIS102 as difficult as the ochem 008 series. Is BIS103 and 104 gonna be hell to do in the same quarter? I'm worried.

Has anyone had experience with taking ECS 132 with Norman Matloff? I have seen some terrible reviews on rate my professor, but I am not sure if it is true. Is he bad because of teaching over the online format?

I am fairly strong in Math, but have little statistics or R background

I am considering taking ECS 150 w Porquet/ECS 170 w Davidson, and ECS 165A  with Hamedani. It turns out Frid said teaching 122B is actually a typo on the schedule.

Question about psychology major electives,"Hello!

I am currently looking up courses to take next quarter. As a psych major, there are approved electives we are allowed to take to fulfill our additional 16-18 elective credits. With that said, I  am confused about the language used in the official psychology major requirement document. My question is, are we allowed to just take additional psychology courses, whether they are in the Core groups or not, as electives? I made an appointment with an advisor, but not in time for my pass one, which is why I am making this post. Please let me know if you know for sure what courses are allowed for elective units.

Very Promising vaccine announced,"If you were not aware, a very promising vaccine that has a success rate of 90% (astonishingly high, the goal was 50%) has just been announced to have passed its second phase with 44,000 participants and 0 negative side affects. They plan to have 50 million doses produced by the end of the year, assuming nothing goes wrong in the third phase which ends by the end of November. Link below 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/09/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-effective/CT

With this shockingly fantastic news, it seems things are taking a turn for the better. If drug production is scaled up after FDA approval, there is a very good chance that things will return to normal before spring quarter.

I personally still expect winter quarter to be online and spring will probably have optional in person classes because it would be unreasonable to switch back to mandatory in person classes since a lot of people did not sign leases for this year.

Overall I‚Äôm very excited by this news, modern science is truly amazing to be able to create a vaccine with such a high effectiveness in only 1-2 years. What are other people‚Äôs thoughts on this news?",1604962480,1,0

Usually Microbiology majors take the chem 2 and bis 2 series their first year, but I took chem 2 and mat17 this quarter, so I think I will have to continue those two and take the bis series with ochem next year. Here are my questions:

* Is it better to take the brief ochem series or the regular one? What's the difference and which professors are ideal?
* Would it be a bad idea to take the bis series, ochem series, and physics series all at the same time for sophomore year? (The sample 4 year plan for Microbio puts physics in junior year instead)

How badly does disciplinary probation affect you?,"Hi everyone! Like many others, I was falsely accused of cheating earlier this year, spent months with mental stress, had the hearing, found guilty because the professor‚Äôs word was enough, and my appeal just came back saying I‚Äôm still guilty.

Question,"So I returned home yesterday for Thanksgiving break. My beloved dog (whom I‚Äôve had since middle school) has had some health problems recently. Anyways, I had only been home for 3 hours when out of the blue, my family and I were forced to take him to the vet, where they told us that sudden fluid buildup in his lungs put him in critical condition and it would be best for us to put him down. I chose to stay with my dog until the second he passed away at 11pm last night, and seeing him in such a condition and seeing him go limp in my arms after being given the final dose has devastated me.

My question(s) is (are) that I have a biology test tomorrow. I was planning on spending all of today studying, but due to what has happened I‚Äôve instead spent the majority of today crying and watching YouTube videos to distract myself. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in the right mental state to take a test tomorrow and I don‚Äôt feel prepared in the slightest to take it. If I were to email my professor, do you think they would allow me to get a 1 day extension? Or is this not a good enough excuse and would it just be better to suck it up and take the test? Honestly, one day is probably all I need to process everything, but I feel like this may be perceived by my professor as just a cheap excuse to get out of taking a test because I didn‚Äôt study or something.

Massive waitlist for bottleneck course,"Can this really be how it's supposed to work?

There are 51 people on the waitlist for ECS 150 right now, and the course is not offered in the spring. If I managed to get in somehow, I could take ECS 140A in the spring, then probably graduate in 1-2 more quarters while taking my choice of upper-division electives like ECS 160. If not, I would possibly have to delay graduating, and would probably have no time to take anything past 140A unless I delayed graduation even more.

I'm just wondering if anyone else has been in a situation like this, and if this is actually how it works. Shouldn't they see what a bottleneck the course is and find a way to let everyone in?",1606092114,1,0

Highlights below:

\- UC Davis Health frontline workers were among the first to receive the COVID vaccine.  
\- Continue to wear masks, social distance, wash hands &amp; get tested often as vaccines become available to everyone.  
\- Avoid non-essential travel.  
\- Students must get tested within 7 days before &amp; after any travel for winter break &amp; self-quarantine for a min. of 10 days, even if tested negative.

How to study ?_?,"How do you guys study for midterms/finals? 

I'm a computer engineering student, and I really passionate about my major, but my grades in PHY9B and MAT22A, have been... severely lacking, to say the least. And it's mainly due to sub-par test grades, the biggest chunks of overall grades. 

Mainly, I've been cramming on the day of tests (in the early AMs), or maybe starting the night before, if I wanna be nice to myself. With that, it makes sense that my scores have consistently been a good chunk below the mean :/   
Like, cramming used to work out for me, but it's really starting to be something that isn't gonna cut it anymore...

For physics, a ""study sesh"" is just me going over the sample questions the professor uploads. I try and solve it myself, but I usually take 5ever for just one problem, like I can usually do it, I'm just slow af. I don't ever get though all the sample q's, maybe only the first few ones, cause by then, I gotta go take the actual test. I haven't done any group-study things cause of my sporadic scheduling and cause I just a really shy person overall. Also, the final is gonna be a department final, so I really don't know how to be prep for that.

For math, I got about it the same way as physics. But for the final, I'm pretty sure the professor is writing it up, so I have a better understanding of how its gonna looks like.

I know I've got a real bad time management problem (working on it and accepting any tips on that too), but is there anything else I should be doing to study/ be a better student? I haven't really touched the libretext (outside of the labs), and really I just don't read textbooks (or books) in general (should I?). I always do homework and assignments, albeit last minute, cause they're honestly free points.   
Also, idk if I'm going about note-taking wrong, since I just copy down everything Professors write down cause I don't really know how to put stuff into my own words :|

Sorry if this whole thing is kinda weird and random, but the procrastinating-life is really starting to take its toll and I just wanna get my shit together and feel proud about myself again.  I know that different people have different brains and study styles/preferences, and so I'm open to hearing about different approaches I can try out. I'm gonna take 9C and 22B next quarter and so hopefully that can be a fresh start, but for now, I've got finals on my plate.

TLDR: What are things I can do to study for STEM (primarily physics and math) midterms and finals? and what are tips to improve on time management?",1607208146,1,0

Gaslighting is gross. Especially when the source comes from the person you‚Äôre dating.,"gaslighting: when someone(s) says or does something to make you question your point of view in an attempt to silence or manipulate you. 

Examples: ‚Äúyou‚Äôre exaggerating‚Äù ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what happened‚Äù ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what this is‚Äù ‚Äîanything that makes you question yourself. Which my ex did a LOT and guess what? I was TODAY YEARS OLD WHEN I LEARNED OF WHAT GASLIGHTING IS AND ITS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. 

I experienced self doubt in ways that were characterized as never trusting myself or my own intuition when I was with him because he always questioned what i said and then would always make me think that what I was saying was a lie. Again, I dated a closet schizophrenic that didn‚Äôt know he was schizophrenic until he was later diagnosed long after we broke up. But gaslighting is a manipulation tactic. If anyone makes you question your POV in such a way that it makes you doubt yourself, this is gaslighting. 

Challenging someone else‚Äôs point of view is not the same. Challenging someone‚Äôs point of view never attacks your intuition or your character or gives you self doubt after that conversation ever happened. It is ok to challenge ideas but *not* the person on how you disagree.

My only concern is that some of the ratings made it seem as though her tests are extremely difficult. I am not sure if this is due to her teaching ability, or because they were genuinely that hard.

What are your experiences with her? Do you believe that I can get an A if I have a good understanding of the course material?",1607063273,1,0

Mentorship offer from a Davis Alumni...,"Hey all! This is super random but I am a UC Davis alumni from way back in the day (graduated back in 2012). Long story short, during my time at UC Davis, I partied a ridiculous amount, barely made it to class, made dumb choices, struggled with loneliness, anxiety, &amp; depression, among a variety of other things. I remember feeling super lost with what I wanted to do in life, and didn't really have anyone I felt I could really turn to for advice on the shambles that was my life. A lot of that had to do with the immense shame/guilt I felt during that time.

All I can say is its been 8 years since graduating, and I've gotten to a place where I am genuinely content and at peace with my life. I dug myself out of a pretty big ditch that I had created, and after some time and effort, I'm happy to say that I am now thriving. I worked for a bit after graduating, got my masters, and now I'm currently working on my doctorate. I'm here to hopefully give you all some encouragement; that no matter how shitty life seems, no matter how many classes you've failed, and no matter how lost you may feel, that a healthy future IS possible for you. 

As a way to pay it forward, I'd love to help out and mentor two students who are finding themselves in similar situations, and are hoping for a mentor of sorts. I am not a licensed therapist, but I've been through it. I don't have all the answers, but I am empathetic, encouraging, and genuine. And Davis was my home for 4 years! I lived in Tercero during my first year, I lived in South Davis for 2 years, and I lived in the Colleges next to the Arc. My fave restaurants were Burgers &amp; Brew and Pluto's haha.

I think more than anything, at the time I wished there was a ""big sis"" type person who I could be 100% real with, who wouldn't judge me, and who had no connection to my social circle (lol) for fear that what I was struggling with would not stay confidential. But most of all, I hoped for someone who would take the time to think deeply about my situation and offer their advice.

I don't really know what I'm proposing exactly, except my life experiences, advice, and ongoing mentorship for a few who are interested. With that said, I'd probably be most helpful to students who are interested in a career in psychology, as that is what I'm getting my doctorate in. FYI you don't have to have majored in psychology in undergrad to go to grad school for it ;). I'm open to helping you navigate the grad school application process if you're interested in pursuing that path (I took the GREs), and I'd love to schedule v-chats to get to know you and hopefully help you find your way! 

I am very much into mindfulness, compassion, and kindness (to yourself and others). I'm not into toxic negativity, hopelessness, or an overall pessimistic view on life. I'm hoping to mentor someone who wants to make something of themselves, but has gotten lost along the way. With that said, due to my extensive workload, I want to be really intentional about my time/energy in regard to this mentorship offer, so I'll have to be selective with how I do this (just a heads up). 

If there is anyone out there who this message is resonating with, message me with a little bit about yourself and what you're looking for from a mentor. I would love to connect and see if I could be of service. And this is my first time doing this so please excuse my clumsiness in getting this mentorship situation set up!",1609200246,1,0
