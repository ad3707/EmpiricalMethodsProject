Is it normal for TAs to write assignments and exams?,"I guess I never questioned it until now (this will be my last year at Columbia lol), but looking back there were definitely some iffy moments and I just wanted to rant.

One of the classes I took was entirely managed by a team of TAs, with the professor only offering occassional office hours. The TAs even wrote the midterm and final exams that put everyone's grade into a bimodal distribution (everyone either did really well or really bad), which was pretty controversial back then. Sure, I think many professors let TAs come up with homework assignments, but is it common for TAs to also write up midterm/final exams? Personally, I think even the busiest professor should write their own exams. How has your experience been?",1601964944,1,0

Invisible Course Drop: Good or Bad Idea?,"Soooo... I feel like I'm in a bit of a predicament right now. I'm contemplating dropping my Bio course, because I'm currently behind due to technological issues and lack of adequate time to study.

Columbia SPS MS in Enterprise Risk Management? Questions and Concerns,"Hi All,

I came across this  program, it seemed very relevant to my career goals and the part-time    online program with the option to do full-time semesters in NYC fits  perfectly with my schedule. The cost (80K USD) is substantial but I do  have the finances for it.  I have a very relaxed work schedule (24 hrs a    week on full salary), so the time commitment isn't an issue. Plan on  staying and working in Canada when I'm done, and staying in my field.

Could any ERM students, grads, or employers comment on the following:

1. Exit outcomes (salary, positions, etc)
2. Reputation in NYC, US, and North America
3. How good is the content?
4. Is it suitable for someone who isnt going into financial/insurance/credit risk management?

1. my asian parents are convinced i won't be able to find a job with this major lol. would anyone happen to know exactly what kinds of opportunities are available for cc art history majors throughout college (e.g. internships), and what careers they go on to pursue after graduation? for context, i'm not from the US so i'm not sure if i could get employed in the US, given the economic recession caused by covid :-( 
2. is any prior experience in an art subject needed to qualify or stand a chance for admission? because although i love learning about art i'm really bad at actually creating anything lol so i've never taken art as an actual subject before. 

alternatively, i also like the history curriculum albeit to a smaller extent, and it does seem to provide a broader set of career prospects from what i've seen on each department's website. i also have a recommendation letter from my History teacher and have written a 3500-word thesis on East German art for my GCSE Advanced Level History subject. so i'm really conflicted about which department/major would provide better career prospects and a higher chance of admission for me.

Advice/ help,"I‚Äôve recently joined a new club at Columbia. Never done this club before and was shocked I got in( kind of an international student but not quite). This club is a bit out of my comfort zone as I focused on other things before college and learned that I needed to join a club that would develop skills I lacked. Every time I‚Äôve showed up to the club, I feel that something always goes wrong. There is lots of background noise around me and given that everything is online, it‚Äôs hard to escape the noise and really focus in. Given that I‚Äôm a novice, I feel behind the curve. The people seem really nice, but I feel they people on the board may be talking about me. First, for the meetings/ practices for this club, I‚Äôve been really slow at learning and not doing so well at the practice material. I really messed up throughout all of the last practice. I notice that when other new members make some mistake they are corrected, but I seem to be given pass. 

I have a feeling they‚Äôve discussed this among each other because when I say certain things, I notice the passive aggressive and slight condescending response I‚Äôm given. It‚Äôs almost as though they feel I‚Äôm incapable of doing certain things, but would rather discuss among each other. They seem really nice though. Every time I try to partake in this activity, it‚Äôs hard to because of the noise( can‚Äôt control what my family is doing) and I can tell they are kinda judging me for me. I messed up again really badly during the most recent practice we had and it‚Äôs been really embarrassing. I always been to be crying/ embarrassed after each practice we‚Äôve had so far. I still want to stay in this activity as I feel it‚Äôd be important to build the skill I need. I‚Äôm confused and would like some help on how to better navigate this situation so I can come better prepared and not feel so helpless and ashamed after each practice.

Thank you in advance.",1603080536,1,0

ApartmentNet League of Legends Ping/Packet Loss,"Has anyone on ApartmentNet (or Columbia network for that matter) been experiencing high ping spikes/packet loss when playing League of Legends on the weekends (sometimes weekday evenings as well)?

Some questions about columbia,"Unfortunately I wasn't able to visit the campus because of covid so I have a couple questions before I commit to ED.

1. How would you describe the campus? Based off the video tours online, the main area seems somewhat small and I didn't see many green areas. Would you say this is accurate?

2. Another thing I noticed on the video tours is that there seems to be an equal number, if not more random people walking around campus who don't go to columbia than actual columbia students. Is this the case? If so, does this bother you?

3. How often do people go off campus? I would guess very often because theres so much cool stuff in the area. If you wanted to primarily stay on campus would that feel normal? In other words, does the campus itself feel somewhat closed off from the rest of NYC?

Let's talk about Proctorio...,"Proctorio is a Chrome Extension that was written in JavaScript, HTML, and C++.

The logic for their system can be found in the `assets/` directory, and I will note key files below: 

`proctorio.pexe` - Compiled C++ code that can be executed on the web; curious that they chose to use the deprecated [Portable Native Client](https://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/pnacl/introduction-to-portable-native-client) format as opposed to WebAssembly. Contains [opencv](https://opencv.org/) code for detecting faces, eye movements etc. during your exam, is housed in an `&lt;embed&gt;`, and interacts with the main Chrome Extension via an archaic `postMessage` system. Not very interesting.

`Js2Q.js` - This file handles the main logic of Proctorio. Here we see a lot of sad attempts at anti-cheat; for example, if you try to go to `chrome://extensions` and view the background.html process, or try to open the console during an exam, it takes you to this hilarious website (https://lti.proctor.io/hacker) and uninstalls itself. This is of course easily evaded by deleting the check and loading the unpacked chrome extension yourself.

They also appear to have this weird hard coded list of banned IPs, and a shoddily done check to see if you are rerouting requests (again, trivially evaded).

Another interesting point: they literally have a HARDCODED check to see if you've installed [the Chrome Extension Source Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-extension-source-v/jifpbeccnghkjeaalbbjmodiffmgedin) on your computer -- LOL. Apparently they are oblivious to the fact that anyone can view a Chrome Extension's source by just going into the Application Support folder. 

If you're looking for some comic relief, this file is a good time, but on to the more serious stuff.

`YGT4.js` - This was honestly the file that did it for me -- **this service is a joke.**

All of their checks are client side. And it's sad. Every frame the server gets a message from the client that looks something like this: `[mouse_moved, keys_pressed, did_scroll, did_paste, did_copy]` etc. Trivial to override this for anyone who's worked with Chrome Extensions before.

Some other information is sent. For example, they always talk about how they can detect multiple faces... well, it's literally an `if (this.facedata.length &gt; 1) sendMessageToServer(""Multiple Faces"")` on line 4000 of this file -- also trivial to change. 

Finally there is a `realTimeSuspicion` array that's sent every once in a while. If the values are zero, you are not suspicious. Guess how easy it would be to just run realTimeSuspicion.fill(0) to reset it right before it's sent? 

---

All of this to say, Proctorio is not secure. These are just my findings in about 5 hours, and I am sure someone with more time could dig deeper. It blows my mind that schools are paying $200,000+ for a ""secure"" service that can't even be bothered to do calculations server side or -- at the VERY least -- obfuscate their code.",1602781383,1,0

Fall 2020 Academic Survey,"This is likely to be somewhat controversial, but I just want to put it out there that if anything is stopping you from describing all the problems with virtual learning in detail on the survey, there's no need to censor yourself in that way. It won't be seen as a gesture of ingratitude, even though it might feel like it, and there surely won't be any repercussions for speaking your mind. The survey is really interested in what the experience is actually like-- they'll appreciate honest feedback. 

I also want to make a case for a return to campus, though I'm sure you're familiar with many of these same ideas. Since I'm lazy and don't want to write a new paragraph on it, here's what I wrote in the last survey question about how Columbia can balance public health and ""academic rigor."" 

""From both an academic and public health standpoint, Columbia has an obligation to use it's substantial economic and medical resources to facilitate a swift return to campus for as many students as possible. New York is one of the least Covid-19 afflicted areas in the country; returning students from more dangerous areas and then testing them regularly in a secure environment would be far safer for both them and their families. By following a stringent plan for a safe reopening, many colleges around the country-- including many in the Ivy League-- have already successfully taken that step for their students and communities. Columbia should follow their example. We can handle a strict quarantine, and the Morningside Heights community will be better off for not having untested students crowding into apartments all around them. It's a simple act, but one that will have far-reaching consequences for Columbia, it's students, and beyond.""

I think Columbia's arguments for the switch to full remote were deeply flawed at their inception and have become even more so in the intervening months. Students can handle a 14-day quarantine. That much is obvious. The Morningside Heights community is arguably more endangered by the presence of untested, unregulated students crowding into nearby apartments. And when has Columbia ever had the best interests of the community in mind in the past? That doesn't hold water. The best argument is probably that it endangers the safety of students and the broader public, but even that has been heavily (and in my mind, rightly) disputed; see the Cornell administration's op-ed about why they decided to return to campus. Their points apply equally well to Columbia. Perhaps before, Columbia had an excuse in that they didn't really know if their proposed quarantine procedures would work. But schools all around the country have shown that in tandem with a strong testing, tracing, and quarantine program, reopening is totally possible. Not easy, but possible-- and in my mind, worth it. 

tldr: This survey might not impact the decision very much, but why administer it if it doesn't matter? The arguments for a return to campus on both an academic and public health front are very strong.

I'm interested in track 3 at the moment, but how does that compare to track 7? Are you just taking an advanced version of one of the 6 ""regular"" tracks or is it a combination of all of them together?  


Thanks and have a wonderful day.",1602649811,1,0
CS or Comp Eng?,"Good day!

Can anyone share their opinions on CS vs CompEng? I know there is a pretty big overlap in terms of the CS courses taken and I know that CompEng also has a mix of EE, but I am mostly looking to hear about people's opinions on what major they recommend and if they were ever deciding between the two, what swayed them in one direction or the other?   


I definitely hold a stronger interest in the CS side of things, especially in algorithms and AI, but I am also very interested in learning about EE in undergrad and have a big interest in robotics, which I feel EE would help me understand better. As of now, I am planning to go on to grad school (probably either for strict CS or a mix of CS/EE -- so basically CE), rather than straight into industry. 

Lastly, in terms of CS courses, what courses would a Comp Eng major not have taken at the end of the 4 years compared to a pure cs major? The CS track that I would be most interested in is the Intelligent Systems track.

P.S. Sorry for all the questions, but I am just really trying to understand what to choose.

Thanks in advance everyone and stay safe!",1602648666,1,0

Location Tracking in the ReopenCU App,"I'm a bit of a privacy nut when it comes to the technology I use and I recently noticed some behavior from within the settings of the ReopenCU app that I have never seen before and that I believe (although probably non-malicious) could warrant a terms of service violation on the AppStore.

I'm using an iPhone, and from within the main iPhone Settings, scrolling down to apps, and selecting the ReopenCU app, you can see ReopenCU's location settings. There are two options for location data: ""Ask"" and ""Never."" You can select ""Never"" but upon leaving settings (even with ReopenCU closed in the background), it immediately reverts to ""Ask."" So the option to select ""Never"" for location data in the ReopenCU settings is essentially a false option and reverts to ""Ask"" regardless of what you do.

How worth it is it to ask a professor to regrade a TAs work?,"Have people generally had success with asking for work to be regraded? I'm in one of Michael Miller's classes and I really disagree with how the TA graded one question. It wouldn't be that bad but that question alone would take off 1.5% of my final grade and I think it's pretty unwarranted. I really want to get an A in the class and this assignment alone means I can only miss 9 more points total in the class to have an A (15 more for an A-).

I'm just very nervous because on the syllabus it says this:

If a student asks me to review the grading of a teaching assistant, I will evaluate the work as a whole independently of the original mark, which means that your score could move higher or lower on any element of the assignment.

So I feel like I'll get marked down even lower for questioning it.",1602536044,1,0

Due to this, I was wondering if I should still apply if I feel uncertain about the Core, and if anyone came to Columbia College unsure about the Core and had any thoughts about it.

I heard the major was officially brought back this spring semester, so there‚Äôs not much info related to the program. 
 
If someone could answer these questions, I‚Äôd really appreciate it! 

- How are the professors? Does the fact that there appears to be no professors that are strictly based in ling (all from different departments) affect the quality of education? 
- Is it difficult to double major w/ ling? (For example, with computer science or psychology) 
- Also, on a more general level, are double majors advisable? Or are minors or concentrations or whatever acceptable/viewed similarly with a negligible difference? 
- How large is the department/how many ling students are there? What‚Äôs the community like? 
- Are there opportunities to research with professors? 
- Would I be better off looking for ling programs at different colleges because of how new it is at Columbia? Would that detract from Columbia‚Äôs already inherent prestige/how that major would be viewed by employers?
- Are classes fun? Would you say it‚Äôs a heavy workload compared to other majors?

And lastly, and this is more general, but do colleges really not consider intended major when selecting students? I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôd matter more for more unpopular majors like linguistics. Or is linguistics a popular major nowadays? I‚Äôm not quite sure.

We at Hubbub then deliver the items directly to you and pick-up whenever you're done with them!

This flexible model of ownership is ultimately designed to make the process of moving/storing your belongings less wasteful, faster, and less of hassle.

Hey! This semester I‚Äôm TAing for an intro STEM course, and I need some tips on how to do this online. Typically during lecture, I would be sitting in the back listening and making sure students aren‚Äôt on their phones, etc. This year, however, the professor is going to be using breakout rooms a lot on Zoom and have students work with each other to solve some problems. Every time, I have to circulate around each room and see if anyone needs help. The problem is that the breakout sessions can last a bit too long (~25 minutes), and with only 5 groups and no one having any questions, it quickly gets really awkward for both me and the students, and I end up sitting and staring at the screen in silence for a couple minutes before moving on to the next group.

Feeling Stressed and Lost? Join Our Free Two Day Self Growth Seminar!,"Hey everyone, 

I am a senior at the University of Connecticut and over the past few months my team and I along with the sociology department at UConn have been working hard to develop a workshop to help college students attain more meaningful and purposeful lives. Given the stress of COVID-19 and the lack of mental health resources available at many schools across the nation, I invite each of you to join our two day seminar and meet college students from across the nation as you develop the skills needed to live a more meaningful life. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Posted below are more details about the seminar:¬†

How can one attain a meaningful life without knowing what it is that they value?¬†

In this webinar, we will demonstrate that many people live their lives without the framework necessary to achieve true purpose. We will help you identify a set of ‚Äúcore values,‚Äù and demonstrate how to live your life according to your self-identified value structure so as to realize a meaningful life.

This webinar will take place over two, 45 minute zoom meetings. You must attend the first meeting in order to join the second. In between meetings you will be given one, ten minute reflective assignment to support your growth and learning.

Meeting 1: Thursday, Sept. 24th from 5:00pm to 5:45pm

Meeting 2: Saturday, Sept. 26th from 5:00pm to 5:45pm

* Track descriptions:

1. A ""non-programming"" track that will focus on using databases through various tools and directly using the database manipulation and definition languages. This track will have frequent homework assignments, an in-class midterm (not take home) and in-class final (not take home).
2. An applied track that will focus on programming tasks that provide deeper understanding and practical application development using databases. This track will have a take home midterm and take home final. Homework will be a small number of programming projects.",1599492693,1,0

"SPS Community Needs Your Help, Yourself Too.","Dear Columbia Community,

I am a SPS student. Many of you probably know me as the fervent SPS defender. I love my school and I am very proud of it. I know some posts that I made were very controversial to say the least and probably offended many people. My aggressive comments and posts were in large part a frustrated response to the pervasive hate against master's students, and SPS students in general in this community. I know most of you probably don't think this way and have respect to everyone that even made it here at Columbia. I let my anger to the few get the best of me. I overreacted and pissed off lots of people. I want to apologize for that. 

In the meantime though, I hope for your understanding, and your help. SPS is a new thriving school at Columbia that is striving to establish itself among the other famous Columbia brands. The school, the administration, and the students are all trying hard to show the Columbia level of excellence. I think you all can relate to the anger and frustration if you could just picture that something you and your community have put in so much time, effort, and love into gets trashed by others. I actually think attacking SPS online wasn't that big of deal. People are entitled to their own opinions. But the last straw was when some troll added a controversy section to SPS's wiki page. This triggered me because now I know there will be real life consequences to students who go to the school and will be looking for jobs. Even for those of you who hate SPS and consider us as a revenue source, please consider this: if SPS is a cash cow like you say, what would happen to Columbia financially if people stop going to SPS for its bad rep. Columbia will drop in rankings and you will all be impacted. It's honestly going to be a lose-lose situation for everybody.

So, I am really hoping someone could help me delete the controversy section off. Please, if not for SPS, for yourself.

Course recommendation from a recent alum,"Hey everyone! Hope youre safe and well. I wanted to plug a course for those of you who are currently BC/CU students (just graduated BC 2020) 

Deets: Intro to Vocal Repertoire with Jean-Paul Bjorl√Øn. Tuesday 415pm and Friday 1210pm. full semester course,

‚ÄúMUSI-BC3139‚Äú

Intro to Vocal Rep is a somatics and yoga based voice class... definitely one of the most fun and impactful courses I took during my time at Barnard. Despite the name its a great class to take if you already have some vocal experience, and/or if you‚Äôve already studied an art. You‚Äôll work on expanding your expressive range and trying new pieces of all styles in a relaxed setting. We meditated a lot, experimented with things like climbing on furniture to access our breath, and often discussed compassion, practicing, and capitalism and the arts. Jean-Paul is brilliant and easy going, and I‚Äôve studied classical voice with him for three years! (I was new to singing upon taking this class for the first time as a dancer)¬†

However, I can't shake the feeling that I'm selling myself short. All things considered, I feel like the only benefit of being a doctor is being able to call yourself a doctor and possibly making more money long term, but nurses and PAs get to enjoy their 20s, have better work/life balance, less stress, less debt, and more choice when it comes to picking a specialty. Is there anyone else who feels the same way?",1604066310,1,0
Im an ED Applicant who just made a major mistake in my essay I submitted. What can I do?,"I'm really sorry for flooding your feeds with another admissions post.

I submitted my application yesterday for CC majoring in economics.

I worded it like"" Additionally, I hope to join the GSAPP Incubator......\[2 lines explaining why\]. Is there anything I can do?

Columbia Summer Immersion Program,"Hello!

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this on. I don't know where else to put it. 

I am currently a freshman in high school and am looking to attending this program during the summer of 2021 for creative writing. What should I know before applying? Has anyone attended this program before? What are your opinions on it?

My brother applied for this and got accepted when he was a freshman (he is now a junior). However, he chose not to go because it cost too much (iirc, it was $2500, not including residential). Is there a way to get financial aid? Is this program worth that much?

Also, I want to go residential, but since my birthday is in September, I won't be 15 by when the program starts. It requires you to be 15 by then. Will they let me stay over there despite being 14? I am going to be a sophomore the following year, the same as most of the 15 year olds, so will they let me? I'm only off by a couple of months.

University COVID Update: Travel and Safety,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community,

 

We write with a number of significant updates about the month just ahead of us, a time that spans the rite of Election Day, a University holiday, and the tradition of Thanksgiving, each a distinctive source of concern.

 

These breaks from the routines of academic life ordinarily are times marked by travel and opportunities to gather with family and friends. Of course, we are in a time like no other. Unfortunately, we continue to witness rising COVID-19 case rates across the country. Here in New York, Governor Cuomo has issued mandatory quarantine orders of 14 days for persons traveling to New York from up to 41 states as well as international locations. He also has taken note of rising case rates in New Jersey and Connecticut, two states that have not been placed on the mandatory quarantine list solely because their borders with New York are permeable, with multiple entry points. This week, Mayor de Blasio asked New York City residents not to travel for Thanksgiving in order to minimize the risk of spreading the virus further within the city.

 

Thus, we strongly urge you to limit travel. Undergraduates currently living in Columbia‚Äôs dormitories must take particular care. Should you decide to leave campus during Election Day weekend or the Thanksgiving holiday, there will be limited opportunities to quarantine on campus. In the next several days, your school will be communicating with you regarding a travel registration process to determine if quarantine housing will be available to you upon your return. Should this service be granted, you will be required to quarantine for two weeks and resume your scheduled testing upon your return. Please stay safe. No matter your location, we urge you to gather outside where possible, and adhere to physical distancing, face covering, and other safety protocols. We also recommend that if you leave campus for Thanksgiving, you get tested before you depart from Columbia, especially if you will be participating in any indoor gatherings or sharing living quarters with persons at risk for complications from COVID-19.

 

In addition to the continuation of Columbia‚Äôs testing program‚Äîencompassing gateway, sampling, and undergraduate surveillance testing, as well as the voluntary testing pilot program for graduate students, staff, and faculty announced a month ago‚Äîwe encourage you to take note of an app recently launched by New York State that generates an alert if you have been in close contact with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19. This app is voluntary and anonymous.

 

As the University continues to plan for the spring, we are deeply grateful for the robust responses sent by students to surveys already circulated, and we thank other students in advance for replying to instruments that were just mailed by your schools this week. These surveys have revealed rich information about this term and aspirations for the next. The responses provided will inform the series of judgments presently being considered about the composition of the campus and the modes of instruction that will characterize the spring term. Over the coming weeks, a series of announcements will be made, just as soon as circumstances allow. Thanks for your patience as the deans, members of our faculties, senior administrators, and public health experts work together to craft a safe and vital campus.

 

Sending best wishes,

My Intended major is comp sci. The reason I ask this question is because Columbia asks that if u wish to submit to bring creative talents to either through a major or EC‚Äôs, then do so.

MSM Barnard and Juilliard/Columbia,"Hi all! 

I don't know if this is the right place to ask this, but I haven't found a Barnard sub and just figured it would be under Columbia. 

I was recently talking to a teacher from Juilliard who really liked me and is giving me free times to meet with him before my audition. However, he told me not to go for Columbia/Juilliard because he feels I should choose only one. I'm still going to apply to Juilliard and Columbia separately though, and on the off chance I get into Juilliard  (the off chance I get into CU too LOL) I would take classes at Columbia. But, those classes will only show on my transcript as electives for the gen ed requirements so I wasn't really a fan.

As I love New York and another teacher at MSM, I am also looking there. But, I'm a little confused on the MSM/Barnard program. I would not be applying straight into it, but when you go to MSM do the Barnard classes show on the transcript as they're from Barnard? Could you get a degree from Barnard? The website doesn't say anything about it and I just want to know. If anyone goes to MSM or goes to the Barnard/MSM program could I DM you? Or just answer my questions here.

My home break in California may be a grueling 6-hour flight from the city but my thirst for tubes has never been stronger! I‚Äôm looking for a group of gifted groms to get away from the stress culture and smack the lip with us!

First of all, while I won‚Äôt say nobody speaks like that, the majority of surfers actually speak normally. However, what that impassioned speech should have done is inspired you to join the Columbia University Surf Club! 

While it is not a club yet, we are working diligently to get recognition from the Athletic Department. The most important thing at this stage is demonstrated interest. If 20 students do this, even if they do not end up joining, those of us who need surfing in our lives will be back to sending barrels in no time.

I need help uncovering a fake adventurer,"Hello everyone, my name is Nick. Three weeks ago, Couple of my friends and I exposed a fake Youtube adventurer from Croatia who travels around Colombia, more precisely the surroundings of Bogota, and presents it as an absolute adventure deep in the heart of the Jungle where no man has gone before. 

For example, in his YT Vlog, he portrayed himself as if he had traveled to the heart of the jungle where no man has gone before, and he lied that he accidentally found a hidden waterfall and said that name of that place is ""Que Breda la Honda"" or something like that. Eventually I found out he was in San Rafael Park 30km from Bogota. 

In another YT video, he presented himself as if he had walked alone through the heart of the rainforest to Peru for three months, and that he survived by catching fish and eating various fruits. Eventually a man contacted me who gave me the location of his ‚Äúadventure‚Äù and in the end it turned out he was going there as a tourist. He was near the town of Leticia and paid for a tourist tour in Zacambu Rainforest Lodge. I proved that he was in a tourist camp because this contact of mine gave me photographs and videos of the same landscapes and animals from the camp that he presented as if he had photographed them in the heart of the jungle. Also I found the places he visited on google maps. For example in one segment this fake adventurer says he came across a lake as he made his way through the jungle for days. Then I find the same place he showed up as a lake on google maps, and it‚Äôs not really a lake, as he said, but a river. And that scene he filmed is located right in that tourist camp.

&amp;#x200B;

None of these lies would be a problem if he did not ask for donations in the form of money and equipment, and if he did not write his false adventures in books that people buy in the hope of helping him. In Croatia, they even pay him to travel, and in that way he actually steals money. Many people have donated expensive equipment all the way  from cameras to drones, because they think he is an honest and fair man, how he falsely presents himself. Also on his channel you can see he turned off comments and likes as people started asking to justify the lies.

&amp;#x200B;

So i need your help to take a look at some of his YT videos and tell me if you can find the place he visited. Because in only 10% of cases he actually say the right place he visited. It is best if you watch old videos, the first clips he posted on Youtube. 

This is his YT channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5lZ43BS7FZHRtaWTeDoKgA/videos?view=0&amp;sort=da&amp;flow=grid](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5lZ43BS7FZHRtaWTeDoKgA/videos?view=0&amp;sort=da&amp;flow=grid)

I know the videos are in Croatian but you will understand what it is about. 

Thank you all very much and if you find anything I will put your name and thanks in the video. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

"Just Curious, Why would anyone want to go to law school","It just really confuses me why people from MBB/IB target schools like Columbia would want to go to law school, especially like a school like Columbia Law which is 100% corporate oriented for a career in corporate law.

You are basically doing the same thing with MBB/IB with the same amount of work and stress except with 300K in debt, tons of boring paperwork, 3 years in your 20s wasted, and much less pay. 

A career in corporate law by going to law school always seems to me a second chance for people with a corporate dream who didn't go to a target undergrad, didn't get good internships, and have no work experience for an MBA or math/coding skills for a quant program. It's a total backup career. 

I understand people who go to law school for politics, clerkships, Public Interest, government and all that but Corporate Law??? It just makes absolutely O sense to do it when you have the opportunity for MBB/IB as a Columbia undergrad. Why do people do this??? Don't tell me there are actually real humans who like the paperwork and the hours and stress at big law firms, especially when they have the option to do much more fun stuff with higher pay at an IB/MBB.",1603236901,1,0

Columbia/Barnard Myths and View,"After scouring various Internet forums, and receiving mixed results (Barnard webs supported Barnard, CC supported CC), I wanted to come to the source to debunk some things for myself about CC and Barnard. 

I‚Äôm a current hs senior (female) applying to college, visited both Barnard and Columbia last summer. Loved them both, and I want to apply ED to one of them, however I admittedly liked CC‚Äôs feel more.

While I‚Äôd love Columbia, my stats are closer to Barnard‚Äôs (4.6/4.3 GPA, 16 AP classes all 5s except physics c mech, 1470 SAT, diverse ECs,) I was hoping for more perspective on all aspects to see what school I should apply to, ED.

MAJOR
Aspiring Econ/Financial Econ, is it true that employers prefer a CC degree? 

VIEW
Is there a lot of tension between CC and Barnard? (CC students seen as better, CC Prof opinion of Barnard kids)

ACADEMICS
Is the Core a lot harder than Foundations? 
Are the degrees of different difficulties?

SOCIAL
Are CC sororities difficult to pledge for a Barnard girl? 
Columbia social groups harder for Barnard students in general? 
Are parties exclusive to CC, or can Barnard girls get in?
Can a Barnard girl find easy association with boys, at Columbia (ease of access, compared to NYU kind of far away)?

AMENITIES
We saw some amenities, but the tours were altered due to the time we had come in June, what school has better dorms/food?

Don‚Äôt just go along with the tuition strike (we deserve something smarter than this),"The tuition strike, which at first seems like an honest and needed attempt to help struggling students and to accommodate the inevitably lower quality of education, quickly divulges into a full on endorsement of an activist worldview which paints Columbia as a racist and problematic institution. Furthermore, it is written in a hostile, aggressive, and disrespectful tone towards a university many of us love. 

The non-tuition issues it brings up may certainly deserve to be addressed, but tying them to tuition in concerns in the fine print is done in bad faith. 

Don‚Äôt just go along with it because you are afraid to be seen as/feel bigoted if you don‚Äôt. Columbia‚Äôs history and current practices around race and the community are important topics, but ones which can surely be addressed separately and with nuance that goes beyond simple political slogans ie ‚Äúdefund public safety‚Äù.

Dear members of the School of Engineering and Applied Science community:
 
I write to share with you that I have asked Dean Mary C. Boyce to serve as our next Provost and she has, happily for us, enthusiastically accepted.  The following message will be sent to the larger Columbia community shortly.  You, especially, will understand the many qualities that make Dean Boyce ideal for this position, including her deep commitment to SEAS and to Columbia.  The School of Engineering and Applied Science is a very special place, a testament to its faculty, staff, and students, and with many important and productive partnerships across the University.  It has been enriched by Mary‚Äôs deanship and the University will now benefit from her strong leadership in this new role.  I will share plans for a dean search in the new year.  In the meantime, please join me in congratulating Dean Boyce.

Sincerely,

Lee C. Bollinger

Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

I write today, with great happiness, to announce my appointment of Mary C. Boyce, presently Dean of The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, as the next Provost of the University. We are, indeed, fortunate to have someone with Dean Boyce‚Äôs combination of administrative capacity, academic accomplishment, and deep knowledge of Columbia to assume this role, which is always critical to the University‚Äôs future but is especially so at this remarkable moment. Mary will officially take over as Provost on July 1, 2021. Ira Katznelson, who has been both gracious and enormously effective as Interim Provost, during a time of challenges both unforeseeable and monumental, has generously agreed to continue on until July.

Mary‚Äôs service as Dean these past seven years has been exemplary. The School has thrived, buoyed by her celebration of intellectual creativity in all its forms, by her thoughtful expansion of the School‚Äôs academic programming, and by the recruitment of top scholars from around the world to the Engineering faculty. Propelled by a firm belief in the value of interdisciplinary work, Mary has led in establishing connections among Columbia Engineering and other parts of the University. Due to her determined efforts, we now have more faculty working together in areas such as Data Science, Nano Science, Sensing and Imaging, Sustainability, and Engineering in Medicine. Dean Boyce has brought Columbia Engineering‚Äôs expertise to the world, perhaps most notably by organizing Columbia faculty to help resolve an engineering bottleneck that was threatening the reconstruction of the L train subway tunnel with cost and time overruns. And Mary has made a special effort to advance the cross-disciplinary and creative opportunities available to undergraduate and graduate students through new spaces, new design and research programming, and new curricular and co-curricular offerings.

Mary has also been influential in her contributions to the University at large. She has been an important advisor on virtually every one of the many new initiatives we have set forth over the past several years. And her distinguished service on important search committees for key University appointments has broadened her knowledge of the institution and provided wise counsel when it was needed.

Dean Boyce is Columbia‚Äôs Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor of Engineering. When she arrived at Columbia in 2013 to lead the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Mary had been on the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for 25 years, a period during which her research in the area of materials and mechanics led to innovative hybrid material design and earned broad respect across the field. Dean Boyce is a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the National Academy of Engineering. She earned her BS degree in Engineering Science and Mechanics from Virginia Tech, and her MS and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering from MIT.

In short, Mary is an accomplished scholar, an effective leader, and a consummate University citizen. I am delighted she has agreed to serve as Provost and look forward to working even more closely with her in the years to come. I will write soon about a search for Mary‚Äôs successor and interim leadership at The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. But now, we celebrate our good luck in having Mary‚Äôs many talents dedicated to the advancement of Columbia.

Sincerely,

Lee C. Bollinger


Email from Dean Boyce:

Dear Columbia Engineering Students,

Today, President Bollinger issued an official announcement of my appointment as the new Provost of the University, effective July 1, 2021. I am honored, humbled, and excited to be taking on this new role within Columbia.

It has been such an honor to serve as your dean. You know my passion for engineering and my passion for propelling students during such an important and pivotal time in your lives. Our student body is at the core of the greatness of Columbia Engineering and of Columbia University. Your enthusiasm, talent, and creativity have been an inspiration and a spur to do all I can to strengthen Columbia Engineering and further raise its level of impact. As you have heard me say many times, engineering is in a renaissance and now considered to be a foundational degree that empowers our students to succeed in whatever field they choose. Our vision to be Columbia Engineers for Humanity continues and I intend to play a role in helping to advance this vision from my new vantage point as Provost at Columbia.

As we near the end of one term and prepare for another, I want to thank you again for your resilience and spirit. You demonstrate time and again that despite our remoteness, we are part of one Columbia community.

President Bollinger‚Äôs announcement follows below.

Gratefully,

Mary C. Boyce

The fact is though that this isn't true, and there are a lot of other people who've also been through what we're currently facing, and have made it out the other side stronger. Something that helped me a lot (I've been through pretty severe depression and anxiety in the past) was the help I got from my friends at the time, even if they didn't really know exactly what to do or how to help.

We're building something to make it easier to help the people you care about in similar situations - all while being fully free!

For user testing, this will be a \~45 minute call with out Head of Product, [Chris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-robeck/), who will ask all sorts of random questions about mental health and interactions between friends, and we will compensate $10 for the call. We also have some longer term involvement options that we can touch base on at the end of the call.

If you're interested in helping out in testing, please please fill out this google form [https://forms.gle/YUWzgMkfGhtpPDjM8](https://forms.gle/YUWzgMkfGhtpPDjM8) and we'll get back to you very shortly with more information and details.

So if you have study time - lunch - study time, you can't book 1hr - lunch - 1hr. You just book the first hour and admin says fuck you to any other studying you might be interested in.

HELPPP!!!,"Hi everyone!

I applied to Columbia early decision this year because it was my dream school. Yesterday, I found out I got in! My family and I were so happy and excited, knowing that all my work had paid off.

Then, earlier this morning, I got an email from Columbia about our financial aid package. The school declared that I was not eligible for financial aid, meaning I had to pay around $80,000 my freshman year. I was so confused because my family is middle to upper middle class, meaning that we should get some form of financial aid. I was also ineligible for subsidized AND non subsidized loans from the government. This makes no sense! But I checked my FAFSA papers over and over and there is no mistake! I turned in all of the necessary paperwork to Columbia before the deadline. The Columbia price calculator and what FAFSA said I should be able to afford were from $10,000 to $25,000. 

I'm just so confused and scared now! I thought the hardest part was past me and that I could go to my dream school, but now I don't know what will happen! I already signed up for a virtual meeting, sent them an email, and appealed the decision, but the anticipation is killing me already. 

Do y'all think that this was a mistake by the financial aid office or with something I didn't turn in? Is this normal? Do you think I will be able to overturn the decision with an appeal? I just need help to understand what is going on.

Thank you!",1608173129,0,0

Considering dropping my CS major. Any advice on how to push through or whether I should just change to something else?,"Im taking Blaer's Data Structures class right now and I'm honestly really struggling. I did well in 1004 and I really enjoyed the class with 0 CS background, I know and enjoy front end web dev, and in general do really well in math courses. 

Blaer is obviously a great professor, but even though I ask questions on piazza, go to OH, and rewatch lectures,  and I even bought a udemy course on DS. I always cant seem to catch up and get my hw ripped apart by TAs. Some part of me thinks its online school that's killed my work drive, but some part of me just thinks I'm not wired to study CS after seeing people say 3134 is an easy course and get literal 100% on the homework and midterm.

I think I'll be able to pass the class, but I just cant help but think if I'm struggling this much in the 2nd CS class, how am I going to make it through AP and CS Theory and the other classes? I'm not trying to be a software engineer who codes all day (I'm into UI/UX, interaction, and 3d graphics) but obviously I cant even take courses in those areas if I cant even do well in 3134. I reaallyyyy dont want to call it quits, but a part of me just wants to give up. I went into Columbia wanting to study something I didnt know, but that hasnt worked out to well for me as you can see.

I'm a sophomore right now, so I guess I have time. To those that came into Columbia without any CS knowledge and majored in CS, do you have any advice on pushing through? Sorry for the long post.",1608156809,2,0

Advice for Moving to NYC for Spring Semester,"Hi,

This is probably not your typical post as I'm a grad student and this seems like an undergrad-focused subreddit, but I don't really know where else to post. 

With that out of the way, I'll be moving in soon since I will need to get familiar with the city at some point (never lived in a city nearly as large as NYC before) and some of my classmates have been able to do (socially distanced) in-person study sessions. 

I have a campus housing selection, and I'll be flying in (probably LaGuardia?) by myself. However, I will need to stay in a hotel for a few days prior, and since I'm not familiar with the area around campus, I'm not sure where to stay or how to best get there from the airport. 

For instance, is Uber/Lyft even still operating right now, and if so, would they take me all the way from the airport to a hotel in Manhattan (just saying it seems far-fetched to me as an outsider)?

1 Course Away from Completing a Concentration - Would you pursue it?,"I've discovered that I'm 1 course short of completing a concentration in Philosophy.  This is including the courses I'd be taking in Philosophy during the Spring semester.  I'd just need to take 1 more during Summer Session A.  

I'm a bit torn.  I was intending on completing my two final core requirements in the summer, and also taking an extra course related to my major (Comparative Literature), which is not necessary for me to graduate.  I worry that, looking at my transcript,  it skews heavily towards the theoretical, and I've managed to neglect my interest in literature somewhat.  Generally, my concern is how a graduate school program might perceive this.  I feel like your transcript is immaterial in other circumstances and the degree you attained is more important.

So, I'm seeking opinions.  What would you do?",1609276566,1,0

On Persistence,"In college, I spent 6 months trying to land a summer internship. 

After getting rejected from over a hundred companies, I almost gave up. Then, I landed a role at an a16z-backed startup.   

The best part is when I first reached out, a recruiter rejected me stating that there weren't any open internship roles. That wasn't a reason to stop trying! 

I cold messaged the VP of sales, got him on the phone, and convinced him to create a role for me.  Here's how:  

1. I spent 20 minutes of the time listening &amp; asking questions to understand his needs: - ""what are you quarterly goals?"" - ""what challenges are you facing trying to hit those goals?"",  - ""what's something that needs to get done that never does?"" 

2. After each reply, I dug into his answers to understand exactly what he meant and try to identify root causes of problems.  

3. I spent the next 9 minutes sharing why I would be the right person to solve those problems.  

4. I spent the last minute asking if we could set up more time (ideally you get the person to agree to another call and find time on their calendar while on the phone).  

5. I emailed a follow up right after shared a few specific things I could do to solve his problems. (If you're curious, screenshot of the follow up is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6740401576944394240/).

Tuition Stike Response Clarifications,"I support the tuition strike and would like to see my fellow students catch a break, but I also want to say how the email sent in response to Bollinger is not entirely accurate. The two primary arguments posed in the email are that the university has ""$974 million in cash on hand"" and ""over $7.267 billion"" in completely unrestricted net assets from donors.

First of all, the balance sheet category of ""Cash and cash equivalents"" does not mean ""cash on hand"". The $974 million is in cash and cash equivalents which simply means that the money is in short-term securities that can be liquidated into cash within 1 year. Although this category doesn't break down exactly what sort of securities they're invested in or how they're treating them, it hasn't even been a year since the pandemic really started. Yes, they could have liquidated most of it but I just want to be aware of the fact that the phrase, ""cash on hand"", is incorrect. 

Second, the $7.267 billion in unrestricted net assets from donors has about 50% of it already committed to the endowment by the board. I'm not sure when the board votes on this issue and they may have been able to stop some of it from going into the endowment with the pandemic in mind, but it might have also been too late for that. If that's the case, there is about $3.7bn left completely unrestricted. This is still a lot of money that could easily cover a 10% decrease in tuition. I just wanted to point out the specifics within this amount of money because I think the argument that all $7.267 billion of the assets are unrestricted is false. 

TL;DR I am in support of this tuition reduction. I just wanted to clarify some things from the most recent email.",1609048775,1,0

Going for MBB? Here's how to deal with rejections,"Hey lions - I recruited for MBB (McKinsey, Bain, and BCG) in my senior year. Ended up with an offer from McKinsey.

If you're giving up after the first no, that's far too early. 

I got rejected during Bain's resume screening last year so I emailed the recruiter to pitch myself for the role.

Here's how:

1. I found the recruiter's email on Bain's website.

2. I emailed her the following message:

\~

Hi \[recruiter name\],

I did not hear back yesterday but wanted to personally reach out anyway to express my interest in the San Francisco office. I believe I'd be a good fit because my extensive background in either technology or strategy roles. Most recently, I was a product strategy intern at Atrium, where I identified the biggest pains in the client experience, contributing to 80% of churn, and worked cross-functionally with teams to brainstorm strategic opportunities to tackle these pains.

If any vacancies open up on the 20th, I would love to be considered for a first round.

Thank you so much for your consideration,

Kareem

It worked. She advanced me to the interview stage. [Proof](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6736754043122663424/) (photo with recruiter's response):

Bain didn't end up working out, but I used a similar technique with McKinsey and eventually landed a full-time offer.

Petition to include GS in the tuition free summer program.,"Good afternoon everyone,

As you may or may not know, the university is offering free summer courses to undergraduate students who were enrolled in the fall and spring semesters. This program does NOT include students in the School of General Studies. This decision is a slap in the face to all of the GS students enrolled here, and should be reversed. I am asking you to sign this petition encouraging president Bollinger to include the GS students in this program.  Thank you.

First year Arabic Oral Interview 25% of final grade,"Hello everyone,

I hope everyone is safe and surviving this pandemic with their sanity at least somewhat intact.

I, once again, have kind of a half baked question (it comes out of my internal panic).  Has anyone here experienced a language class oral exam/interview? Specifically first year Arabic? Can anyone explain to me what to expect? I really have a problem with my anxiety and speaking/understanding Arabic when I am put on the spot. I am so much better reading it and, to an extent, writing it. But I like, literally panic and hear nothing/understand nothing. Even my professor said I was freaking out the last time she asked me questions in Arabic. So... I just need to get myself comfortable. Anyone have any advice?

Columbia Class of 2018 lack of direction,"There's a lot I can say.  I was suicidal and almost committed the act in May 2018.

I'm not conventionally attractive (trying to be as politically correct as I can). I cried once during NSOP--I accidentally sat in hummus during an LGBT meet and greet.  I accidentally sat in the hummus of a guy that eventually committed suicide.  RIP JOSH VILLA.  I wasn't going to message anyone I met after that ordeal including some cute upperclassmen.

I had really high expectations of myself.  Of course that didn't affect much and I don't know if I should continue that.  It's done. I knew that my college experience was over years ago.  My Time at Columbia was nothing but pain.  The fact that Donald Trump became president was just the cherry on top in the list of misery that I knew I would expect to experience at this school.

&amp;#x200B;

My four years at Columbia made me realize that I was not compatible with friends.  I had ""friends"" during my time here.  However, they were only okay with me at my best. When I suppressed my thoughts and feeling and just became the person that they wanted me to be.  No baggage.  No mental health issues. The truth is no one cares at Columbia.  If you are struggling, that's your problem. No one cares about your problems and no one wants anything to do with you if there's something wrong with you . I hope people around me agree with that, but I understand if everyone disagrees with me.  My opinion was never popular but despite the unpopularity, it was always true.",1605967326,1,0

GS and summer tuition,"So this is probably a dumb question/rant, but since I‚Äôm procrastinating anyways I figured I might as well ask. 

Since CC and SEAS students can take summer classes tuition free, is there any chance that we can find a way to compel the university to enact the same policy for GS students? I‚Äôve been a GS student for two years now, and honestly for the most part it has been as advertised. I feel like I‚Äôm a part of the Columbia community (or at least used to, when we were on campus), I‚Äôve taken the same classes as every other undergrad at Columbia, and I‚Äôve made friends across all three schools. 

All of this is great and honestly makes me forget that we are ‚Äúnon-traditional‚Äù and all that, but then Columbia always has to go and find a way to stick the knife in. In this case, it‚Äôs with this whole tuition thing. I mean I get that the funding for GS is more limited when compared to CC/SEAS, but I find it incredibly difficult to believe that a university with an $11.26 BILLION endowment can find absolutely no way to make tuition free for GS for at least part of the summer. If that‚Äôs not possible, then at least some kind of reduction, say 50% off or something, would still be better than the ‚Äúfuck you, give us your money‚Äù that we‚Äôre currently getting. 

If anyone can change my mind on this, or if I‚Äôm missing the reason that we have to pay while other undergrads don‚Äôt, please feel free to fill me in. Because right now it feels unfair and honestly pretty disheartening.",1605907156,1,0

&gt;Students will be able to elect the pass/d/fail option for one class this semester without restriction ‚Äî¬†i.e., the course chosen for this grading option can fulfill a requirement for the Core Curriculum; a requirement for a major, concentration, or special concentration; or an elective.  
&gt;  
&gt;The deadline for declaring the pass/d/fail option for a course will be extended to the last day of classes for the term (December 14).  
&gt;  
&gt;Students who completed an immersive course in the ‚ÄúFall A‚Äù term can choose to retroactively apply the pass/d/fail option to that course as their one pass/d/fail course for Fall 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;The deadline to withdraw from a course will also be extended to the last day of classes for the term (December 14).  
&gt;  
&gt;The usual policy for lifting a ‚ÄúP‚Äù to uncover a grade will continue. Students will be able to see their assigned grade for the course in question in SSOL and decide by the end of the second week of the Spring 2021 semester (by January 22) whether to uncover the grade or let the ‚ÄúP‚Äù remain on the transcript permanently.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;It is important to note that there are situations in which it may not be desirable or beneficial for students to use the pass/d/fail option for particular courses of study. The notation of a ‚ÄúP‚Äù on a transcript can be read differently by different audiences (within a department or program, within a school, by admissions programs of graduate and professional programs, by employers), and it is important for students to consider future plans when considering a decision that will affect their educational records. **Students are therefore strongly encouraged to speak with their academic advisers and their Directors of Undergraduate Studies before making the decision to use the pass/d/fail option, particularly for a class within a major or concentration or for a class that is required or may be important for graduate study.**",1605736373,6,0
Driving South,"Hi all, I am GS student headed home. With all classes off campus, I can't afford to keep living in the city.

I'm leaving Friday.

I'm looking for a safe, pandemic-minded columbia student who needs a ride. I'll drive the entire way, and im happy to take you anywhere you need to go on the east coast and as far south as Georgia. I just need someone to split gas money and manage the Playlist. 

Getting a covid test from the student center is an absolute requirement, and cant be older than today (Wednesday). I've had a strict quarantine and I am happy to show you my negative results.

Shoot me a DM if you need a lift.

So my only option is to take CS theory but I am worried that it might be a little challenging since I'm not doing super well in Discrete. Is Discrete relevant with CST's material, if at all?

SEAS P/D/F Email,"Since people have been asking for the full policy, here is the email sent to SEAS undergraduate students.

Dear Undergraduate SEAS Students,

This past week the Engineering Student Council presented a proposal to the SEAS Faculty Committee on Instruction regarding possible academic accommodations for the fall 2020 semester. In acknowledgment of the difficulties faced by students this semester due to the coronavirus pandemic, the SEAS Committee on Instruction has instituted the following policy changes for the fall 2020 semester:


-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Moving forward, SEAS undergraduate students will be allowed to take one (1) ongoing course P/D/F this semester, with no restrictions on the type of course (core, non-tech elective, or major requirement).¬† The course will count toward its respective requirement.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†SEAS undergraduate students will have until the last day of class (December 14, 2020) to choose this P/D/F option.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†SEAS undergraduate students will have until the end of the second week of spring semester (January 22, 2021) to choose whether or not to uncover the grade in this class.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†This option to P/D/F a course this semester is in addition to the existing option to P/F a non-technical course (the latter needing to be &gt;=3000 level per the existing SEAS policy).


It is hoped that these accommodations will provide you flexibility for dealing with the added stressors of this unusual semester.¬† Students may exercise this option through the P/D/F Grading option in SSOL.¬† As a reminder, the drop deadline remains November 19, 2020.


However, it is critically important that you understand the potential implications of choosing the P/D/F option on future plans that may require a transcript, including internships, jobs, or post-graduation education. Additionally, given the sequential nature of the SEAS curricula, electing to P/D/F a course could have impacts on student-success in future classes.
¬†

Students are strongly encouraged to speak with your advising deans in the Center for Student Advising before exercising this option.¬†


We appreciate the collaboration with ESC on such matters of importance and impact to our undergraduate student population.

¬†

Sincerely,¬†¬†


¬†Barclay Morrison

He really went out of his way...,"This is a rant:

So I‚Äôm a first-year student who‚Äôs in Alabama this semester. This obviously isn‚Äôt ideal to begin with, but then this GS student who is at least a few years older than my own father in a big lecture class I‚Äôm in thought it was appropriate to look my name up in the directory, find my uni, and ask me to fucking date him over email. Said I was pretty, ‚Äúloves‚Äù my ‚Äúlittle outfits‚Äù, wanted to ‚Äúget to know‚Äù me on a more personal level, and had the audacity to ask for my cell phone number. Dude, I‚Äôm here trying to learn about supplyside economics. And I‚Äôm gay as hell. What makes you think I‚Äôm here for you? I feel disgusted and unsafe in my own home.

I just want to say: if I want to look nice, it‚Äôs not so some deadbeat who can‚Äôt get women his own age can ogle me and comment on my appearance. If I want to ask a question in class, it‚Äôs not to entertain said deadbeat with my ‚Äúvivacity‚Äù (what kind of thesaurus.com bs is that word anyway?).

I Screwed Up So Bad,"I just really need to blow off some steam, but I seriously messed up. After not getting into Columbia after my senior year of high school I strengthened my resolve to work harder and transfer the following year as a freshman at Carnegie Mellon. I was going to work my ass off and get perfect grades, strengthen my extracurriculars, and seriously show growth in my newly revised essays and personal statement and it just... fell apart today. 

I messed up so bad on my midterm for this class and there's no way I'm getting an A this semester and that's literally the end to my dreams of ever getting to go to Columbia. There's seriously no point anymore. Yeah, GPA isn't the end all be all, but the fact of the matter is: it's still super important and I doubt there's anything I can do to make up for it because I'm pretty sure everyone else who transfers to Columbia has at LEAST a perfect GPA their first year on TOP of strong ECs and essays. Like extracurriculars and essays are important as well, but for transfer students, GPA matters even more than for regular high school seniors.  

I'm not really looking for words of encouragement or anything. I just haven't been able to talk to anyone about this. I know this seems like such a stupid thing to be so upset over and I suppose it is, but it still hurts so much because Columbia is my dream school.

"Was close to getting Visa, and now I don't have funding for Uni.","An international student here. This is a rant and a call for help.

I worked real hard to be able to even think of applying for Masters. From where I am, USD currency conversion is huge. So I was able to only save upto 10% of SEAS CS fee after working for 2 years, rest I am dependant on loans. Got a loan sanction letter for Fall 20, due to travel restrictions I deferred to Spring 21. Got my I-20, and all other documents, and applied for Visa. Then I get calls that all banks are revoking loans (they are willing to only offer from Fall 21). Few say that they aren't willing to offer for NY state, few say that markets are risky. So all in all, there is no source of funding. 

Now, if you are reading this, I would be really glad to know if there is any way Columbia professors can fund an MS student for SEAS CS, or if there is any funding available for international applicants. Reactivation is the last option for me, but I would be grateful if there is any way I can start in Spring. Thank you for reading!",1600520970,1,0
9/18 Prezbo email. 136 words -&gt; 136 words. Some things shouldn‚Äôt be shortened.,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

I join everyone in mourning the loss of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was also one of our most cherished alumnae and faculty colleagues.  To be a reformer within an established tradition‚Äîand to make the tradition truer to its own principles and premises‚Äîis exceedingly difficult and rare in human affairs.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg was such a person.  She challenged and changed the legal system, especially with regard to matters of gender equality, deploying the finest of legal skills, and in doing so validated the law while making it immeasurably better.  Throughout her life and career she exhibited the essence of courage and the belief that reason and ideas can, indeed, improve the world.  We grieve this loss, especially at this moment. 

Sincerely,

Lee C. Bollinger",1600482740,1,0
Gap year request mid-semester,"I am a first-year currently taking online classes in SEAS. However, things changed completely last night.

For context, all males in South Korea are required to do military service for a year and a half. Usually, we are able to choose the time when we want to serve in military, but the government very rarely selects the time for us.

This is the case I‚Äôm in. I suddenly got a notification about being assigned to military service beginning this November, and I have no choice but to go as far as I know.

In this case, who should I contact? Do they let students take gap-year(2yr for me) during semester?",1600478610,1,0

Just Really Proud to be a Columbian,"Just feeling extremely proud to be a member of this great institution. Not entirely unrelated to the U.S. News Rankings of course, but the fact that we clenched the 3rd place 3 years in a row and outmuscled Yale and MIT out of the building is utterly awe-inspiring. Over time narrowly focused schools like Yale MIT won't stand a chance against a true UNIVERSITY like Columbia. The gap is only going to get larger and larger. 

I saw posts of weak minded people attempting to undermine the accomplishments of their own Alma Mater by putting Columbia behind HYP and comparing it to schools like UPenn, Brown, Dartmouth and even Cornell. I find that intolerable and extremely demoralizing. And above all it's just not objective. 

Located in NYC,  the center of the universe where all greatest things convene, Columbia wields incomparable power at her home court where students from other schools fight tooth and nail just try to break in. We got Obama, Teddy, FDR, Buffet, 10 supreme court justices (including 3 chief justices which is the most out of all schools). We award the pulitzer price. We got Top 5 undergrad/law/business/med schools, the best revolutionary professional school and Top 10 PhD programs in countless fields. We invented the brain-computer interface, the MASER, and nuclear magnetic resonance. We proved Earth's Plate Tectonic Theory. The completion of fruit fly experiments done here became the origin of modern genetics.

The reason why Columbia isn't yet catching up on prestige with schools like HYP is precisely because of these weak minded people who pretend to seem even handed or modest who go around and tell your friends and family Columbia is worse than HYP and equivalent to Penn and fucking Cornell. Columbia is the only ivy that has a complete repertoire of schools/programs/majors that serve the comprehensive functions of a university: top undergrad, top law/med/business, top humanities, social sciences, engineering, and revolutionary industry oriented schools. In contrast, Harvard is shit at engineering. Yale is utter garbage at everything that's not law. Princeton doesn't have any professional law schools which is essentially a college. Penn's got Wharton which overshadows its own brand and is generally believed to be an independent business school in NYC. I'm just not going to comment on Dartmouth Brown and Cornell. The fact of the matter is: NOT a single ivy can exert influence in a similarly comprehensive fashion like Columbia. The only school that can present a close match rests on the west coast. One can even argue that Columbia is the one of the only two real universities the true sense of the word.

Fellow Columbians, please be proud. **Walk tall, carrying a big stick** like our alum Theodore Roosevelt.",1600381173,1,0

Can I get away with not paying for health insurance?,"Hi y'all, I got a health insurance waiver approved a month ago at the beginning of August wayyy before the last billing update happened but it still says I have to pay for Columbia health insurance. I tried contacting the health office but they said they won't be answering any billing questions until after September 18th (which is when the payment is due) and that the changes from the health insurance won't be updated until after then. Should I just not pay it for now or would I be able to get money credits if I pay the health insurance now?",1599281249,1,0

Question about Waitlists,"I am an incoming freshman in CC this year who just registered for classes. I have my eye on Computing in Context and got on the waitlist (not instructor-managed) at a pretty high spot but I'm not 100% certain I can get in. I have another class that I would want to take if Computing in Context is full but would drop if I can get into Computing. This other class is almost full so I would want to register for it ASAP. Either way, I would max out at 18 scheduled credits and I can't register for any more. 

My question is this: Since I am maxed out on credits and SSOL won't register me for more than 18 credits, if I register for the other course, will it mess up my waitlist position of getting into Computing in Context? I am afraid that if I can get off the waitlist, SSOL won't register me because I am already registered for the max amount of credits and will just move on to enrolling the next person.",1599266046,1,0

Do people typically get rejected on reactivated applications?,"Was planning to join Columbia University for grad (MS) this year, but then... a global pandemic happened and I decided not to.

Columbia doesn't allow you to defer, but instead allows to ""reactivate"" your application. Was curious about whether it's usual for people to get rejected on reactivated applications.

i've been on this waitlist for months (with a position of #3), and now I have to replan my entire schedule because these incompetent hoes want to pick and choose who to allow in an online class.

you had 25959784 months to reject people off of the waitlist, but now you decide to do so with 6 days left before classes start while other waitlists have like 5,000 people on them.

Calc III vs Calc I Freshman,"Hello,

Incoming freshman here. I know this is belated considering registration is tomorrow but I'm still trying to settle the details of my schedule. I took AB/BC in high school and am eligible to take Calc III, but have seen conflicting reviews for first semester.  How is the workload and transition for taking it as a freshman in the fall? I am considering majoring in Econ so I do not necessarily need to take Calc III right away but it is worth a lot of credits. Would it be unwise to wait until spring? I also cannot enroll in the class with Inbar Klang because of scheduling constraints.

Much appreciated",1599143072,1,0
