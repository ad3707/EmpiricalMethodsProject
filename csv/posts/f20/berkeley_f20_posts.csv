I got the chance to interview a Berkeley grad on Uber's Data Science team :),"Hey guys -

Had the opportunity to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team. Thought I'd share some of it here, in case you find it helpful :)

**What do you do &amp; where do you work?**

My name is Divyansh Agarwal and I am a data scientist at Uber in San Francisco. I’m working on the Shared Rides business, and work on building products that grow the business. Some of my work also involves optimizing the efficiency of Uber’s ride sharing marketplace by improving graph optimization algorithms for rider-driver matching, and evaluating their performance via experimentation and simulations.

**When did you first become interested in Data Science?**

So, I had an interest in machine learning and predictive analytics before going into university. I wrote about it in my college essays as well.

But I was also interested in software engineering and fields like security. What really made me truly interested in data science was taking [Data 8](http://data8.org/) at UC Berkeley. I really liked the fact that you could use statistics to extract insights from data and provide value - and although I had always been aware of this, I only realized then how powerful statistics could be and how computing facilitates all of this.

After that, I started doing a bunch of projects, some internships, and got involved in research.

**When applying for jobs, was it hard to choose between going for a software engineering role as opposed to a data science role?**

Not really - I was always set on data science once I got into it. I used software engineering more as a backup, because given my CS background it would have been easy to get a software job if I just prepped hard for their interviews.

It’s actually harder to get a data science job out of undergrad. This is because there’s a general bias towards people with graduate degrees and people with a lot of experience. So you need to have either of both - either you need to have a lot of work experience, or you need to have a PHD.

So that’s why I built experience through doing projects, research, internships, etc.

For Data Science, there’s no real standardized process when it comes to interviewing - it varies a lot from company to company (this is in contrast to software engineering where using websites like LeetCode can get you ready for almost all jobs).

So I had to spend a lot of time prepping for each specific company I interviewed with - at every stage of the process - and this ended up taking a lot of time.

**When applying to Uber, did you have projects in mind you wanted to work on? How much did you know about the company?**

After my sophomore year of college, I was invited for this intern open house at Uber. That’s when I met some of the team across rides, security, and eats. I spoke to this guy on the marketplace team and another guy on the maps team, I was really interested in those teams.

What’s really cool about the marketplace team specifically is that it’s at the intersection of computer science, economics, optimization, statistics, and there’s a lot of hard &amp; interesting problems that can be solved from an algorithmic perspective.

So after this event I attended, I knew that I wanted to be on the marketplace team at Uber. So during my senior year recruiting, I reached out to someone on the marketplace team, and they were interested in me, so that’s how I started interviewing at Uber.

**What is your team responsible for and why is this work critical to Uber’s business?**

I’m on the Shared Rides team (which is a part of Marketplace Dynamics). The core of building new shared rides products and features come from [matching improvements](https://marketplace.uber.com/matching) or UI and experience improvements. So either tweaking these algorithms, designing &amp; analyzing experiments, understanding how users are responding to new product features - these are all very important and central to Uber’s business.

What are some challenges (both technical and non-technical) your team faces?

The biggest challenge for our team (and I think this is true for any consumer internet product) is building something that people actually like that meets your business objectives. Because everytime you change something with the product, one metric might become worse and the other might become better.

It’s also really hard to figure out what users really want and what they really like. This involves a lot of UX research, as well as experimentation. This stuff is really challenging. Here’s another example:

So, there’s an optimization &amp; efficiency side of Shared Rides - there’s always a tension between the two. If I make something more optimal, it might hurt the experience. If I make the experience better, we have to give some leeway on the optimization side of things. So that’s this underlying technical tension that’s always there.

On the product side, as I had already mentioned, it just comes down to building something users really want. So we have designers and UX researchers who are embedded within shared rides, as well as marketing folks, and I have to work cross functionally with these guys to problem solve on a daily basis.

**You interned at Quora before Uber - can you tell me differences between both companies and how that affected your work?**

So Quora was a very small company - there were only 230 people or so when I was working there (two years ago). There were fewer layers of management, it was easier to know people across the company - for example I even got the chance to speak with the CEO on a couple of occasions. There was also less bureaucracy I guess.

At Uber, since it’s a bigger company, sometimes if you want to build something you might need to get buy-in from another team, there’s more bureaucracy, there’s more layers between you and executive management.

Like at Quora, I knew the Head of Data Science very well, but at Uber I can’t imagine doing that currently (given I’ve just begun my career).

At a bigger company like Uber though, you’re working on projects that have bigger scope, bigger impact on the world, and you work with a lot more people. I’m also more specialized within my role here at Uber - at Quora I could have had more flexibility in terms of what I wanted to work on. At Uber, I’m on a very specific team, in a very specific role, working on a very specific part of the product. This has significant advantages: We’re working on specialized problems that are really challenging, and I’m surrounded by people who have been thinking deeply about these problems for a while are are super passionate about these problems. There’s some incredible learning to be had there.

Finally, in a smaller company it’s also a lot easier to hang out with your teammates - Quora for instance had organized clubs (poker, badminton etc) across the board that made it really easy to meet people in different teams. At Uber, that’s much harder to do, but you meet an equivalent amount of people within your own team, since teams are much larger at Uber.

**What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Data Scientist (either a career changer or a college student)?**

Data science roles are defined very differently based on the team, company, size, role you’re working on. For instance, even Uber Data Science can vary greatly across teams - for example, I work on the Shared Rides / Matching team, which is mostly Operations Research, which is a field about optimization. And I didn’t even study Operations Research in college. The important thing to understand is that different teams have different scopes. For instance, the pricing team does a lot of machine learning. Some other teams are trying to understand user experience. So having a strong base is really important, because at companies like Uber, there’s many directions you could go in.

In the Data Science industry overall, there’s broadly three tracks:

1. Algorithms (building models, doing ML)
2. Inference (understanding causality)
3. Analytics (building dashboards, writing SQL, reporting metrics, analyzing simple A/Bs)

Most of the Data Science jobs involve Analytics or Inference.

At Quora, they were mostly on the inference side of things. They were trying to understand product opportunities, trends in user behavior, and see if new product features were impactful.

On Uber, on my team at least, I’m more focused on building algorithms.

So in terms of advice: you need to focus on what you’re actually interested in (within the domains listed above). Of course, there’s going to be work that’s a mix of both, but knowing which topics interest you will help you map out and identify which companies you want to work for.

Everything is going to be very team and company specific, so don’t look at titles, but actually look at what the role is, talk to people on the team, and do your research.

Stats theory is also important, but on the job you’re not really going to be actively using theory too much. What really matters is understanding and gaining intuition. For example, I didn’t study a lot of Operations Research in college, but I took a bunch of Machine Learning and Algorithms classes in college which helped me build intuition for how Operations Research works, since the field is about optimization - which is what Machine Learning and Algorithms are about.

The purpose of theory is to build intuition and understand things.

&amp;#x200B;

This past week appears to have been the break-pointing for many people. 

Not just the undergrads, but for the Graduates students like myself, the professors, postdocs, the instructors, and for those who have already graduated from Berkeley.

One my study buddies from Cal recently got laid off, another coworker I know is working at multiple small-time jobs in order to make a living, another Cal grad I know is having a hard time staying healthy while he is living at SF right now.

I saw a lot of people I know withdraw from their work and started to crawl back into their beds and not get back out for days. I've been doing this bad habit as well and end up bingewatching a lot of shows just to get the sense of escapism. It is ok to take breaks and its ok to wanting to get away from all the chaos, but disappearing for far too long will only cause the feeling of isolation to become more painful and severe. Don't get me wrong, I know its hard right now.

I've worked at Cal long enough to see depressing situations bring out the worst in people in almost every parts of the campus (and online); whether its acting **snobbish**, suspicious, calculative, doubtful, **elitist**, aggressive, or **egocentric**. 

What worse is that I have seen parts of people enjoy and laugh when horrible and unfortunate things that have consistently happened this year. That ""joy"" most likely be mistaken for fear, discomfort or stress. 

I won't lie, not all of us are experiencing the pain equally; not all of us have the same set of choices right now in front of us. Many of us are fortunate enough to have the support we need right now; but for others, things are much harder. Some of us have families who recently lost their job, close friends who got sick, not able to study at home, lost loved ones, unable to find a job, ... etc. 

Because of these differences, and the fact that we are all far away from each other, it makes it easy to forget we are all experiencing pain during the same time. 

But we can't let these differences divide us. What is important right now is for all of us to stick together and help each other get through this common pain we all are experiencing; whether it is this semester, the spring semester, throughout this entire pandemic, or throughout our entire lives here on this Earth. 

Now, having said all this, there are still bound to be more obstacles and challenges on our way. Many people are worrying over the P/NP situation, the election results, final exams and papers, grants, flu season, ... etc. The point is there is always going to be trouble ahead of us moving forward. There is never going to be a final solution to resolve all our current or future problems like we see in the 22min episodes we binge watch for escapism. What is important is that continue to accept where we are at and try our best to adapt to the situation.

You have to understand that it is during these tough situations that defines your character. 

It is not about what you gain, appear, fulfill, produce, or obtain. These will never last.

It's about the set of choices given to you and the decisions you make during the worst of times when you are struggling.

And its ok if you don't feel ready and don't know what to do during those times. As mentioned in one of those famous 22min episodes: ""When we reach our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change.""

So take this time to consider what you are willing to do for a Change. Take this opportunity to heal and get back on track; spend more time trying to reach out to other people and be open for something different. But don't let the expectations and series of unfortunate events bring out the worst in you; adapt. 

Don't be afraid of failure, go out there and fail again. Its ok if things didn't happen the way you wanted them to. What matters is that you tried your best and that is what builds character; that is what lasts.

So Let's try harder to bring the best in each other. Let's be grateful that this community if filled with talented people where you can have someone look up to everyday as an inspiration for becoming a better and stronger person.

So the next time you the words, **Go Bears,** tell yourself **You Got This**.

Cut the Crap: Why I Think Admin are Hesitating About Optional PNP,"This is long, but I need to express my thoughts.

The school has been claiming that PNP generates additional stress for those who plan to go to grad school. 

I believe that this is a **slanted** point of view. According to the [First Destination Survey](https://career.berkeley.edu/survey/survey), only 19% of graduating seniors immediately go to grad school. 

* Of this 19%, most grad programs are going to be flexible because many notable schools, such as Stanford, Wharton, Georgetown, USC, Johns Hopkins, etc. are allowing for PNP. 
* The most vocal controversy so far has been from premeds, which is definitely important but represents only a fraction of the student population. 

Ultimately, giving students the **option** to PNP is optimal because it gives people flexibility and recognizes the unique circumstances of all students, including premeds.

However, at the end of the day, I think that the **true reason** that the school is hesitant on PNP is because they need letter grades to restrict major declarations. The Dean of L&amp;S sums this up quite well:

&gt;The problem with P grades helping to get into a major or minor is that those programs are capped \_because\_ there are a limited number of seats. For Spring, we made special ""take lots more people"" adjustments, but that can't be done forever. It doesn't really help to get into the major if you can't get a seat in the key courses.

Obviously, they can't just go out and say ""Screw all the people dealing with COVID/fires/smoke/etc. We need letter grades to make easy decisions about major declaration."" I understand that GPA feels objective and is easy for the admin, but, during these times, you cannot stick to GPAs.

In that same comment, he continues: 

&gt;There are a lot of students in Spring who's record is P, P, P, A. Patterns like that raised the average term GPA by about 0.4. But really, optional P/NP for \_everybody\_ was separating out the students with adverse COVID impact, who were just hanging on, from those without who had a chance to improve their GPA. Of the 60% of students who set one or more classes back to letter grades, 88% improved their GPAs (in an average Spring, 57% of students raise their GPA).

From a student's perspective, are any of us actually angry about this? Sure, I am a bit upset that some students are taking advantage of the system, but let's not get distracted from the main reason that we have been advocating for optional PNP: **to help disadvantaged students**. 

He further elaborates by saying:

&gt;Meanwhile, 40% of students who were left things as all P, perhaps because of COVID/financial/family/visa complications, didn't get that boost.

Okay, but the alternative to a P would have been a B or C, which would have been objectively worse. Why are the admins so worried about people gaming the system to the point that they are not doing anything to help us? 

To answer the admin's fears about people gaming the system in Fall 2020, **I will assure you that it certainly will not happen at the scale of Spring 2020**. Here's why:

1. In the spring, professors boosted GPAs by being lenient, removing curves, making finals optional or dramatically simplifying them, offering extra credit, etc. For the most part, all of this has evaporated because we're back to normal! Now we get extra homework to *make sure we are keeping up with the readings*, videos to watch on top of lectures, quizzes and tests on weekends, and so much more just to make sure that we don't fall behind. 
2. Another point to recognize is that in the spring more people were willing to take letter grades because we only had one month of school left. Many of us, up to that point, were doing well, which made choosing letter grades more enticing. 
3. Also, support systems were in place. Our parents were receiving stimulus checks, unemployment, etc. 

Considering all three of these points, **40% of students still chose all PNP**, which underscores the significance that 1 month of COVID had on the student body. 

For fall 2020, we have to deal with COVID and:

* forest fires  burning down homes and spreading toxic fumes throughout California, 
* added financial stress, 
* carrying our parents' burdens,
* and dealing with mental health problems as we stare at our computers for 15 hours a day and are cooped up in a house with 6 other people.

And, guess who it affects disproportionately the most: the 27% of pell grant students at Berkeley. In other words: **1 in 4 students**, which arguably is higher because of the financial impact of covid. 

Yet, all of their messages make it seem like only a minority of students are struggling and that optional PNP would only disproportionately help people game the system. For example,  the dean's response to a student who literally had no A/C in southern California, suffered frequent power outages, lived in a food desert, and was burdened with financial and family stress was:

&gt;but perhaps there's a better way to help than the blunt instrument of P/NP for everybody for every reason.

Do you think that only a handful of us are affected? Are our *reasons* not valid? 

Additionally, I was astonished when I read that the Academic Senate chair noted her opposition for optional PNP by [writing](https://www.dailycal.org/2020/10/14/uc-berkeley-student-launches-petition-calling-for-pass-no-pass-grading-option-for-all-classes-fall-2020/):

&gt;college-specific advisers can grant exceptions for students who have “compelling reasons for an exception.”

Well, I guess we all need to line up and meet with our advisors and let them decide whether we have a *compelling reason.* Make sure that you have the documentation to prove it and don't forget to make your story extra dramatic or else your advisor might choose to give another student accommodation over you!

I am tired and sick of seeing people having to publicly share their experiences with admin and even having to expose ourselves to them through email to prove to them that we are indeed struggling. I am sure that they already know it from the pulse surveys and the influx of requests for technology accommodations that still have not been met. But, students must be exaggerating because everything is normal, right?

Has anyone's parents raised objections to anyone P/NP-ing their classes?,"I have a poor relationship with my parents and in the spring, I chose to P/NP all of my classes.

However, this semester I'm taking Econ 131 and Econ 140 and scored below the mean for both exams. My performance doesn't put me at risk of failing and I think I'm around a low B in 131 and a B/B+ in 140. I'll probably use P/NP for both classes but me scoring below the mean makes me worry that I'm not fit to be an econ major. 

I definitely do not want to go to graduate school for economics. I just want a job. And while I'm glad P/NP is there I just feel upset about scoring below the mean for both.",1605145284,1,0

Schoodule,"Hey Bears!

I've been working on a small project, Schoodule, to help with my workflow for classes and coursework. 

It's a desktop website that serves as a scheduling tool specifically made for students.

This tool provides one location to view all bits of information regarding any course or event that you decide to schedule. You can store and find any:

* Links
* Emails
* Professors/TAs
* Office Hours
* Discussion/Labs
* Important Exam Dates

Each course/event also comes with an included to-do list for those who like to stay extra organized!

I've been using this tool for the last couple of weeks and I've found it very useful-- especially since classes are all online anyway. So, I decided to launch a small beta version for anyone who might be interested in Schoodule.

You can access it at myschoodule.com!Also, if you have any feedback or ideas for improvement, feel free to send it through the feedback section of the website! :)

a question about a possibly non-major schedule and enrollment penalty,"I'm a mechanical engineering freshman with quite a bit of different interests, and I decided to take Engin 7, Data 8, EECS 16A, and CS 61B\* next semester (seeing as how I have quite a bit of AP credit in physics as well as maths, and how I'd taken most courses recommend for a freshman in the undergrad guide, I thought I could explore possible simultaneous/double majors early on). 

I wanted to hear what my ESS advisor thought about this schedule, and she told me that I ""may be subject to an enrollment delay penalty"" because what I had was a ""non-ME schedule"". When I asked for clarifications, she only told me that I could petition the college for a ""non-engineering schedule"" and hasn't yet got back to my newer email asking what makes an ""ME schedule"" and under which circumstances I would be given a 'penalty'. I understand she's extremely busy, but it's been a little while and with my Phase 2 enrollment time getting close, I'm quite anxious to understand what she's talking about. 

I  recognize my current schedule is not very ME-heavy (Engin 7 isn't exactly ME-specific either), but is there a certain number of ""ME"" courses I need to take each semester? What exactly qualifies as an ME course, then (and what if I'd already taken some of the 'ME' courses recommended in say, the undergraduate guide)? Who should I reach out to see if I can still take all four of these courses without being penalized?

Need advice 61a...,"I was prepared for midterm 2 and felt confident with the material but encountered a technical problem. When the exam began, I tried to print it out. I tested my printer before the exam to ensure it was working properly, but after trying three times to print the exam, I could literally not get it to print. It was just printing the corner of the exam on every page. At this point, I honestly started to freak out because I had wasted minutes and I also did not have the physical copy. 

This might seem like such a stupid situation, but literally all of the practicing I had done involved me annotating the exams and working it out on paper. It is possible that I am just a dumbass incapable of doing actual coding. For some reason I literally cannot solve these problems effectively by looking at my screen, then looking at a sheet of paper. It’s just not how I practiced and it totally threw me off and screwed up my entire exam. I felt naked without the test printed out and I just freaked out and felt a ton of anxiety and it screwed my score. This semester has already been so challenging in so many ways and mentally I just was really shook by this for the entirety of my exam. In my mind this just felt like the final straw for this semester. 
I’m so disappointed cause I literally was prepared. I debated informing the course staff after the exam, but I just honestly felt like a stupid person because I thought about how they might read my response and think “well if you were really prepared it wouldn’t matter if the exam was successfully printed or not.”
I literally struggled scrolling up and down the exam to see the problem, see the choices, fill in the blanks. 

I know some people will read this and totally not understand where I am coming from and think “if you were actually prepared it would not matter.” I don’t want to fight or argue but I know what actually happened and whether or not I was prepared. But yeah, I know I’m stupid for this. 

Basically after my screwed midterm score, I am confident that I can get a B+, might be able to get an A-, but not entirely confident. 

My question is should I drop the course. I feel terrible I really want higher than a B+. Also should I inform the course staff?

"Depressed About Classes, Recruiting and Life in General","Hi everyone, so I don’t mean to add another depressive post here but I guess I’ve been struggling for a while with stuff.

* Apathy/annoyance towards classes - as an econ major and intended DS minor, I’m taking econometrics, public economics and an ethics class, and personally, I believe Econ 140/econometrics has not been very accommodating with stuff with how they handled the midterm submission fiasco and homework being graded on accuracy despite subpar teaching of R and all that. 
* I thought I was interested in public economics but I guess I’m not...and with regards to the ethics class, I am actually better at writing/humanities than STEM...but...I hate academic writing and that’s caused me to feel a lot of annoyance towards that class.
* Stressing about midterm scores - taken 2 midterms and no scores are back for either 
* Feeling hopeful about the P/NP debacle and then realizing there’s so much misinformation about it...like whether or not there was even a vote for it, whether it was in favor, the fact that there was supposed to be an update on Friday and then there turned out not to be one, etc.
* I know that as a student, I should stop worrying about P/NP and just assume it will not happen until they say it will, but it’d relieve some of the pressure I’m feeling
* Above all, as a junior, I think recruiting (mostly for consulting, marketing, sort of for PM) is one of my largest stressors, even more so than academics, as I want to go into industry after college - I’ve gotten interviews but have never made it past the final rounds for any, and while I know people (mostly) only post their successes on LinkedIn, I feel pressured when I see that people have gotten internships with great companies and that I haven’t.
* I know that you don’t necessarily need an internship for a good full-time job (especially since I have seen friends with FAANG and IB internships not get return offers because of COVID) but I know it helps, and that’s where the pressure is coming from in addition to just seeing other people be more successful than I am currently doing in recruiting. 
* Another reason why I feel annoyed about my classes is because I don’t see how economics classes will help me succeed in my interviews or future job...

Additionally, I have tried therapy (been to 3 different therapists before and had long-term relationships with each). 

I think some of it helped but I’ve been in therapy long enough to know that it’s not going to magically fix your life - it’s just talking to a professional about your stress for an hour and them helping you to brainstorm ways to fix your problems in your life. So because I have already been to therapy, I already know stuff that I can use to fix my life and am not sure how more therapy would exactly help as I think the issue is just I may not be trying hard enough to fix it myself. 

At times, I’ve called the CAPS urgent services, and it was okay-ish...I know they tried their best since demand is high, and they did come up with ways for me to manage my anxiety, but it was admittedly not super helpful. 

Any advice, commiseration, or empathy would be appreciated.",1604134548,1,0

How Difficult Is It to Get a 53/75 on the CS61A final exam?,"Hi,

So CS61A MT2 scores just came back and I need at least a 53/75 on the final exam to get a B+.

"Math 143, 128 or 172?","Hi! I'm considering taking either Math 143, 128 or 172 alongside 104 and EECS 126 next semester. I took 110 over the summer, loved it, and i'm currently in 113 which i've found even more interesting. I'm very drawn to topology (my interest in pure math came from studying manifolds in the context of unsupervised embedding) so I think 143 may be up my alley. I also really enjoyed the combinatorics section of CS 70. Counting in particular was one of my favorite areas of the course, and combinatorial proofs were a blast. Lastly, i do research that is tangential to numerical computing so i think 128A could prove useful here, however i've heard the course is less elegant than some of the other upperdiv math offerings. Just wondering if any fellow math friends could share some insight to those courses, or any others they found particularly interesting :)",1604103164,1,0

Why do schools have P/NP? Isn't it vestigial?,"It's comfortable to know that you have more room in a class, but why else? Not all classes are equally important for you so failing a breadth shouldn't negatively affect you as much as failing a technical?

But isn't this irrelevant in the future? Because in the future it'll be even easier to automatically compress all your grades(+ other data?), and won't judgers be at least as generous as the current P/NP options so that they may not misadmit someone who used P/NP?

In that case, if you feel comfortable seeing your letter grade instead of a ""P""/""NP"" (and your parents will not hurt you), why should you ever use P/NP?

The future feels a long time away to me, but maybe to our bureaucracies it's only a sigh?",1604097998,1,0

"depressed, indecisive &amp; mentally unwell","covid depression &amp; seasonal depression are ganging up on me this semester. not to mention that this semester took a massive toll on me mentally. i just transferred into Cal from CC into an entirely online system. i never took an online class before in CC (i only ever did in person) so like many of my fellow bears it’s incredibly difficult to keep up with the never ending deadlines, lectures and recruiting for internships while trying to remain mentally stable. 

i do have a question for the people reading this, what are you all doing for spring semester? are you moving out to berkeley and living in the dorms/off campus housing? are you taking the semester off? 

i’m incredibly indecisive whether i should move out to berkeley or stay at home. being at home isn’t awful but it’s definitely difficult especially since i have adhd and being in my room for 10+ hours a day has driven me mad.

Lonely mini-rant,"Made 2 close friends freshman year, hung out with them all the time. I had other acquaintances through clubs/social events I attended, but none that close (other than friends from back home).

Recently, though, I've been feeling more and more left out. I think it started like this: we all moved back to Cal, but for financial reasons the two of them rented a house with 3 other people, and I rented one room in an apartment with an acquaintance. 

Ever since then, they've been doing stuff together (going to the beach, hanging out, upcoming Halloween kickback etcetc) with their housemates. At first it was like okay, it's because they and their housemates are all in the same quarantine bubble, but at the same time they've both been hooking up with random people off Tinder. Basically every week I've asked if they want to hang out, aside from 2 times, they've always said they can't, even though I literally see on their TikTok or stories that they're hanging out with their housemates and other friends.

I don't think they're necessarily bad friends, but I'm not going to keep trying to be friends with people who only hang out with me when there's no one else to hang out with. I thought hanging out together for the entirety of freshman year meant that we're actual friends, but I guess not. Still, it hurts. I have a ride-or-die squad from back home and plenty of acquaintances to hit up, but here at Cal, I really thought I'd found two more really good friends, but COVID has proven me wrong.

Now I find myself wishing that CS70 had longer problem sets, because the euphoria of finally solving a problem makes me a little less sad, and even the frustration of not understanding distracts me from how fucking lonely I am - if not for me being good at CS70 giving me a sense of validation, I probably would just evolve into a full-fledged alcoholic/nic fiend/stoner.

Anyway, my plans for this week, as they are on any week, are to grind at all my academics/ECs, and get crossed alone in my room on late Saturday night while curating impeccable playlists.",1604017889,1,0

PSA for new students on understanding exam grades,"I realized recently that a lot of new students don't know how to estimate their placement in a course based on their midterm grades. When you first get to Berkeley, taking an exam and getting a 50% can feel crushing, even if it is a good score for the exam. During normal semesters, this knowledge gets passively learned by everyone, but it's a lot easier to be isolated this semester.

Overall, there are 4 steps for (roughly) estimating your grade based on a midterm grade. I will demonstrate this with the example of my F17 EECS 126 Midterm 1 test score.

1. Look up the historic course grade distribution on [Berkeleytime](https://www.berkeleytime.com/grades/). In my case, a historic grade distribution looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/MKCatpD).

2. Find your midterm z-score. Most courses will [send the exam mean and standard deviation](https://imgur.com/a/jIMdel2) when the scores are released. The z-score is (your score - mean) / standard deviation. On this exam, out of 120 possible points, the mean was 64.81, the standard deviation was 20.87, and I got a score of 80. This gives me a z-score of 0.72.

3. Use an online z-score converter to convert your z-score to a percentile. In my case, I used [this one](https://measuringu.com/pcalcz/), which gave me a percentile of 76.42. This means that on this midterm, I performed better than about 76% of the class.

4. Go back to the tab which has the grade distribution on Berkeleytime, and hover over the different grades (bars) on the graph until you see a range on the right which contains your percentile. In my case, it looked like [this](https://imgur.com/a/lsDhGwQ). This bar is the grade I would expect to get in the course. In this case, even though I got a raw score of 66% on the exam, I would be on track for an A in the class based on this exam.

This is certainly a rough estimate, and is less accurate for exams with really high averages. If you took multiple exams, you can average their z-scores and estimate in the same manner. 

I hope that this helps people to understand their exam grades better, and to feel a bit better about low exam scores.",1603992499,1,0
Faith in people restored,"Last night I lost my bunch of keys between parking my car near College Ave &amp; Channing Way and going to get food at Crossroads. I'd already been having somewhat of a rough week with the usual stress of being a Berkeley student and studying for midterms, and the last thing I needed was losing my car and dorm keys. It wasn't after getting food and going up to my dorm room did I realize my keys were lost. I spent the next 15mins searching everywhere for my keys, went back to my car and also went back to Crossroads and no one had seen it, so at this point I was starting to get worried. I decided to trace my steps one more time back to my car. I got to my car and found a group of 5 girls gathered near where my car was, then I came closer they were starting to leave the area, and then I heard the car beep. I immediately shouted ""That's my car!"" I showed the girls my ID and pictures of my car to prove it was mine, and they gave me my keys. Turns out they found the keys somewhere on the floor near Crossroads and were (presumably) walking around trying to find the car that it belonged to. They had also called the police and reported the keys lost. I'm just grateful they were good people who found my keys. With how sketchy Berkeley can be sometimes, it could've easily been someone else that found the keys and my car, and the story might've ended a bit differently.",1603992069,1,0

So I was looking so an easy Biological Sciences breadth and found INTEGBI c32. It's avg grade is pretty good, but I was unable to enroll because of my late phase 1 enrollment period start date. However, the class is also offered as LS C30Z by the same professor. Can I assume that the latter (LS C30Z) will have the same grade distribution as INTEGBI c32? I can't find LS C30Z on Berkeleytime.

But I also won’t withdraw because I at least wanna get the units for my breadth course. So congrats to the academic chairs, I hope this contributes to your kink of seeing students suffer!! 

PS- bragging about being the #1 public university but not wanting to accommodate students with P/NP during a pandemic isn’t a good look— considering other well known schools have allowed something similar to P/NP for the semester. But of course, the academic chairs want to boost their ego and say berkeley students survived without P/NP because their pride doesn’t allow them to believe in mental health and/or they don’t want to lose that #1 title

"Spent a year at Berkeley, not sure if it is for me. Transfer?Any advice appreciated.","Hi, I'm currently a sophomore intending to study business or economics, depending on how my Haas application turns out. Perhaps the past year has been an off-year for me emotionally, but I have been very unhappy with Berkeley for the last year (Fall 2019 - present). 

I met great people at Berkeley, ranging from just different level of nice to different level of smart. However, I hate how competitive it is here, and I hate how everyone is fighting for the same resources all the time. Of course, I understand that Berkeley is a top public school, and it is doing everything it can to support the students. But I'm not sure if I'm exactly a ""gunner"" who can go out and get what I want like some very ambitious and talented students are able to here.  

I would like to think I am doing pretty well academically (3.95+), but no matter how well I do in classes, I'm unable to translate academic success to my personal happiness. I have very closely knitted friends from high school who goes to a variety of different schools, ranging from party schools to other top ranked universities. Long story short, I think my friends were able to adjust to their respective universities a lot better than I did. I am starting to consider transferring to a private school as an option, but I'm not sure if I will be able to afford it. I am currently receiving a lot of aid from Berkeley (very thankful for that), and I can't afford to attend private schools that do not give out a lot of aid. I know Ivies/Stanford gives a lot of aid, but I know my chances are very slim to make it to those schools. 

Should I just suck it up and bite my teeth down for the next 3 years, or should I try to transfer to a private school that gives a lot of financial aid? Very lost and if there are other students that either transferred out of Berkeley or just decided to make the best of their situations, I would be very happy to hear your advice.

A very lost student.",1599829409,1,0

Intended CS major... hate math... what to do?,"I'm a freshman, so I only have a few weeks of class under my belt but currently Math 1B is kicking my ass. It's known as a weeder course and it appears to be succeeding at weeding me out. I spend an insane amount of time on it. I'm taking 14 units, including CS 61A, but 1B gobbles up the majority of my time.

In high school junior year, I took AP calc AB, which allowed me to skip Math 1A. In high school, my teacher was really awesome, and while I didn't necessarily like the math itself, I learned it, enjoyed the class, and got a 5 on the AP exam. 

Now, I feel like I'm just too slow to handle 1B. By the time I can confidently do one concept, three more insane things have been taught. Currently, I'm able to turn in my homework and projects by starting it as soon as possible, and sinking a massive amount of time and effort into it. But I shudder to think of how I'll do on the timed exams (it takes me up to an hour if not more for **each** homework problem.) I've just joined a study group, so maybe that will help. I've also gone to office hours and am looking into doing the SLC tutoring. The problem with that is it entails spending even more time on the class that already controls my life. 

I know it's a low-level course and other people are struggling through harder courses... many would say 1B is easy material. But those people are smarter than me. I don't know what I'm doing with this post. Maybe I'm venting, maybe I'm asking for suggestions. I just feel like spending this much time on one class is not sustainable or correct.

[Guide] NotCarolChrist's 3 Quick Tips to Dating at Cal - Episode 2,"Episode 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ipu3qn/guide\_notcarolchrists\_3\_quick\_tips\_to\_dating\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ipu3qn/guide_notcarolchrists_3_quick_tips_to_dating_at/)

So you're back, and you want more advice. Now the first 3 tips should've been enough, but let's be honest, you're probably some lame normie with actual social skills and so by following those 3 tips you've somehow screwed up your chances (and has nothing to do with me). Thus, I offer you 3 more tips to fix your relationship (which you don't have, yet).

**Tip #1:** **If you're in MET, spam it.**

Clearly you need to mention it every 0.5 seconds that you're MET like it's a basic human need like breathing or something. After all, they clearly didn't hear and/or understand it the first 400 times you said. After all, they aren't in MET, amirite? (Nice MET majors are lame).

**Tip #2: DICKPIC**

**Dorms In** **Clark Kerr** are the best **Place** to find **Ice Cream** in.

So if you live in Clark Kerr, bring your date there. If you want to start a relationship with a person living in dorms, find someone from Clark Kerr. Has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that Clark Kerr is close to frat houses and is allegedly filled with bigger rooms and hotter people.

**Tip #3: CalBearMatch**

I have no idea if I will even get any of the answers correct on my quiz next week and I am terrified for the first midterm. Is math at Cal generally really difficult and intimidating or am I just dumb? Everyone else seems like they totally understand what’s going on, but I’m over here lost in what are supposed to be review chapters. I’m a new transfer student, so I have zero experience taking math classes at UC Berkeley, and things at my community college worked really differently. Idk if I’m struggling because I have to get used to Cal or because I’m not good enough at math or if it’s because everything is weird and online or something else. Do I need to find a new major?

Wondering if anyone can share any experiences they've had with Zipcar.

Math 123 vs Math 170?,"Hope y'all are staying safe!! I'm a junior preparing for grad school in Econ and it's important to prove myself on ODE (beyond the scope of math 1b/54).

Here are the course descriptions:

123:  existence and uniqueness of solutions, linear systems, regular singular points. Other topics selected from analytic systems, autonomous systems, Sturm-Liouville Theory.

170: Linear programming and a selection of topics from among the following: matrix games, integer programming, semidefinite programming, nonlinear programming, convex analysis and geometry, polyhedral geometry, the calculus of variations, and control theory.",1599716518,1,0

Inactive group chats,"I’m not going to lie, in terms of making connections and comrades from my classes these first 2 weeks have been rough. I’m in several smaller chats but all of them are inactive.

Loopchat is cool but way to big to make meaningful connections imo.

So that’s the backstory to the point I’m trying to make.

I’d like to make iMessage group chats for my classes, for the kids like me who don’t really have anyone to turn to for class information, and are stuck alone during this time of quarantine :).  Obviously I don’t want them to be too big but I’m always down to talk to anyone. If you have friends who you talk to and already have a group for these classes I’d like to ask that you don’t request to join this; this is mainly for kids like me who really have nowhere else to turn to and are lost socially.
 
The classes I’ll make chats for are: 

Econ 2

NUSTX 10

[Guide] NotCarolChrist's 3 Quick Tips to Dating at Cal.,"Hi, it is your self-proclaimed dating expert NotCarolChrist here to provide you with some tips to dating.

Now, here are the obvious ones:

1. Dress well
2. Be sociable
3. Initiate Conversation

Whoever has told you these things is lying to you. Go up to them and slap/punch them in their faces.

You see, the true secret that they have been hiding from you is that by trying to do these things, you've been doing everything wrong. Here are the **REAL** tips.

**Tip #1: Use your meal plan.**

They say muscles and organs remember better than the brain. What better way to monumentalize your first date than with food poisoning?

**Tip #2: Preach about Denero.**

You may have a crush on someone, but we all know your true love and devotion is to Denero. You must  make that very clear, to the point where you might think it's creepy how obssessed you are in hindsight, but trust me, -380% of the time it works 100% of the time.

**Tip #3: Netflix and Chill.**

All young people enjoy casual activities. Therefore, what better activity is there to watch Netflix with your significant other on the down low? Of course, there is only 1 show you can watch during this time: **Bambi**. You know what they say: **the only thing this movie kills better than that deer is the mood.**

**Bonus Tip: Start Talking about the Rice Purity Test**

Nothing charms a person more than interrogating them with a blatant disrespect for their privacy and boundaries on their personal experiences!",1599702810,1,0

What's it like to be at Berkeley now?,"Honest question from an alumni (lived in Berkeley from 2013 to 2017).   


My favorite parts of living in Berkeley was hanging out with classmates and friends, walking around town and hiking up the Berkeley hills, parties and kickbacks all around town, going to different restaurants and shops, catching concerts and art shows around the Bay Area, taking BART to different places just to chill, and yeah even going to class sometimes.   


In the absence of all that due to the pandemic, and now the wildfires, I can't imagine what I would even do in Berkeley. I'm hoping to hear from some current students: what's it like to be you right now? What does your day look like? What do you do for fun/to stay sane? Do you feel robbed of a college experience? Maybe I'm wrong, and there's still plenty to do around town?

How does the waitlist work for ESPM 50AC?,"I have been trying to get into this class (\~700 students) for weeks now. There were times where a section would open up and I would change to that section but it would never enroll me before filling up again. As far as I can tell this class does not have reserved seats right now.

Earlier today I checked discussions again ([https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-fall-espm-50ac-001-lec-001](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-fall-espm-50ac-001-lec-001)\_) and some discussions are overenrolled while others have open seats but still people on the waitlist. I had asked the head GSI before if they were going to increase enrollment but he said they would not, so I'm confused why some sections are overenrolled now.

I need this class to graduate this semester and I am scared I won't get in. I feel like it's too late to try to enroll in another class (historical breadth) right now because it's three weeks in and I would have to make up so much work.

Even for CS and a bunch of other majors, despite being stem majors, we aren't allowed to choose. At UCSC for instance, you can choose to the the BA or BS route for computer science. 

Is there a way we can petition this? TBH idk how to even talk to faculty or something about this, but a professor in the immunology department discussed in the webinar how he's tried for the last 20 so years to get students this choice. Again, I understand the whole breadth req and being a liberal arts college, but mcb (for instance) takes the exact same science classes. IDK.  I'm concerned about being turned away from jobs having a BA in biology? The professor mentioned this has literally happened to students before. 

Sorry this is so long but what are your thoughts on this? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: we should be able to choose whether we go BS OR BA route for L&amp;S.",1600920634,1,0

I got a letter from the Center for Support and Intervention and now Im a little worried,"Apparently someone reported me as a student of concern but I cant figure out who or how. I dont know a lot of people at berkeley since im staying at home and it is my first year here. Im using a throwaway account so that I can be anonymous from my friends.

Unless someone was able to trace my reddit account to me irl, I dont really know any other way I could've been reported. Im wondering if a professor/GSI reported me but I highly doubt it because I dont have any physical indicators of harm and I make sure that I act ""normal"" during lectures and discussions. Maybe by posting here two days ago, my friend who goes on the berkeley subreddit occasionally may have read my post history and deduced that it was me.

I'm a little worried that now the university will know that I had attempted and will see me as a liability or something. Im just hoping that if it was a friend who reported me, their reasoning would be that Im acting differently and reserved or something and not based on my posts about suicide.",1600828705,1,0

If you need it,"Hello everyone, I'm probably a stranger to most of you, both on reddit and in person, however I wanted to give some advice for anyone who may need it. 

If you're like me, a transfer student, it may seem like an uphill battle, but there's plenty of resources. The Career Center has plenty of folks who are here to make sure you succeed. 

If you're like me, and constantly put off socializing, if you can avoid it, go out there and enjoy the world however you can. My first week living in Berkeley brought me new experiences and people, it's worth it, I promise. 

It may seem daunting since you only have 2 years and they might be online, but trust me, enjoy what you can when you can. If campus opens up (be safe about it firstly) go to games, go for a stroll or anything you enjoy. I regret not going to games and not doing more.

Don't be discouraged when you struggle, that's a part of life. Very few have their way paved for them or have access to resources and connections that literally get them to where they want to be with minimal pressure. I was pretty darn close to just giving up completely last year and I pulled off decent grades. 

If you're like me who ignores his own mental health for the sake of grades, please seek help. Don't wait until it's too late like me. Your own sanity is worth more than a degree, and there's usually alternate routes to reach your goals, Cal isn't the only way. 

If you're scared to seek counseling because it's not really spoken of in your community, it's okay, your mental health is worth more than opinions. The machismo where I'm from would see me break down before admitting counseling probably would have helped. And after a couple sessions, I can say it does help. You're no less of a person, you're not weak, you are brave for seeking help.

If you carry anger in your heart for the world, it's not worth it. The world will move on with or without us. Make sure to live your life to what makes you feel happiest. It sucks when you build your life around one premise and when it's taken away and now your sense of purpose feels gone, and you're left confused. 

Hug any loved ones you may have, family, friends or even pets. They'd most likely want you alive and smiling even at the cost of taking time for yourself. Hug them tight because they might go crazy to get a phone call or seeing you carried away in an ambulance surrounded by cops.

Don't be like me, who now looking at his 4th year is on the verge of quitting because I waited too long for help that I broke down the night before the first day and now I'm so far behind there's no hope. Please don't be like me, each one of you is here for a good reason. I loved my time here. And I just want to make sure I can help even one person know they're okay.",1600818510,1,0

The Best Places to Have Sex on Campus,"  Now that we’re several weeks into the semester, I’m sure that some of you horny little freshies are eager to fornicate with the opposite gender (or the same gender, we don’t judge here). Alas, the presence of COVID means that shagging is only acceptable outside and sufficiently socially distant from other pesky humans. Fortunately for you, I’ve compiled this handy guide to having socially distanced sex on campus to ensure you still practice your rhythmic pelvic thrusting in a safe fashion. Plus, sex in the woods can be a lot of fun; the chads in CNR have been practicing it for decades now (there’s even a class about it!). 

\*Note: For the EECS majors, you can easily replace “partner” with “inflatable sex doll,” everything else should be the same. 

**6. Founders Rock**

We begin with Founders Rock, located at the corner of Hearst and Piedmont. Yeah, it’s a little in the open, but what’s life without a little risk? There are plenty of rocks for you and your partner to grasp and try out different positions, and even a bench to make the action a little more spicy. 

Recommended positions: [Reverse doggy](https://sexpositions.club/positions/256.html), [Brazilian capoeira](https://sexpositions.club/positions/395.htm)

**5. Faculty Club**

Have you ever had a crush on a really hot professor that you spent hours fantasizing about? Well, simply replace your partners face with that hot prof’s, skip on over to the faculty club located by 4.0 hill, submerge yourself into one of the many hidey-holes behind bushes near the building or creek, and wriggle around in your hottest fantasy. Here’s a trick if your partner doesn’t perform: moan your professor’s name a couple of times, and when you’re done your partner won’t bother you with their poor performance again! 

Recommended positions: [Avalanche](https://sexpositions.club/positions/80.html), [Lace](https://sexpositions.club/positions/231.html), [Guillotine](https://sexpositions.club/positions/347.html)

**4. RSF**

This one is only for COVID times! Normally, RSF is packed with bumpkins attempting to flex on their peers, however at the moment it is entirely empty. If you manage to sneak yourself in (maybe yeet yourself after a naughty COVID test?), there plenty of empty little cubbies and hidey holes to flop yourselves on. You can even use some of the gym equipment to enhance the experience! 

Recommended positions: [Pokemon on the ball](https://sexpositions.club/positions/303.html), [Dirty sanchez on the ball](https://sexpositions.club/positions/395.html), [X-factor](https://sexpositions.club/positions/289.html)

**3. Eucalyptus Grove**

All of us have lit a romantic candle to make our room smell like something other than sweat, tears, and several leftover bowls of ramen. Fortunately, the Eucalyptus grove already provides a dank musk that’ll make any normal human feel extra horny. Find a little bush to hide behind near the creek, or take a bold step in your relationship and romp around in the center of the grove. The leaves provide some nice padding too!

Recommended positions: [Fulcrum](https://sexpositions.club/positions/334.html), [Fallen warrior](https://sexpositions.club/positions/326.html) 

**2. Memorial Stadium**

Feeling athletic and adventurous? Sneak into memorial stadium (trust me, there are multiple ways to easily get in) and enjoy your playground. Stairs? Plenty. Benches? Thousands. An enormous grassy field to safely practice social distancing with the other couples? Check. Plus, you’ll forever be able to brag about how you bagged some points for the home team. 

Recommended positions: [Ball](https://sexpositions.club/positions/149.html), [Valedictorian](https://sexpositions.club/positions/417.html), [Birthday party](https://sexpositions.club/positions/284.html)

**1. Any classroom**

Ah yes, classroom sex. The iconic kink of any nerd who has spent a little too much time browsing the hub. This one is particularly difficult to pull off at the moment, since all the buildings are shut, but once you get inside you’ll have plenty of time and space to practice all of your sensual activities. You also keep track of your score with friends: the more seats in the classroom or lecture hall, the more points you get. 

Recommended positions: [Sea horse on a chair](https://sexpositions.club/positions/428.html), [Playboy on a chair](https://sexpositions.club/positions/390.html)

**Bonus 1: Evans elevator**

This is a favorite for all the individuals who like their sessions short and sweet (and can’t last longer than 30 seconds; perfect for my frat bros). Hop in clean, hop out stanky. 

Recommended position: [Jamaican cocktail](https://sexpositions.club/positions/312.html)

**Bonus 2: The glade**

If you’re a bold individual looking for an easy way to get expelled from school (and maybe arrested) with no strings attached, this one is for you. Plop yourself in the middle of the glade with a partner and start having fun. If you’re fearless, you’ll do it on the seals.

Anonymous app for college students,"Hey all! Former USC Alumnus of 2018 here (anonymous account). After dealing with anxiety my entire life where it became severe while at USC, I decided to do something that I wish I had when I was desperately struggling in college.

I'm building a community-based app that gives college students a safe, anonymous place to share personal things in a supportive and open environment with others at your school. It will be social and will be focused on sharing the difficult things in life that can be so hard to share due to the social pressures of college.

I really hope to make a positive impact and help as many people as possible for those struggling silently and alone. I'm currently developing it and would love any and all feedback.

failing to declare cs,"I went into Berkeley super excited and really confident about CS. it always came naturally and easily to me. Cs61A I was loving—I was completely the projects, homeworks, and labs with no stress or sweat whatsoever. Come midterm one and I land myself in the hospital for a few weeks and can’t take the midterm that I had studied for extensively and was beyond confident about. Then covid. Then I couldn’t take midterm 2 because I was traveling. I gave up. It felt like the world was against me. Come the final I pulled a B+ (did extremely well on the midterm one content, pretty well midterm 2, and flunked everything past that. I was only a couple points from an A- but Denero wouldn’t bump me up). I told myself, well it’s ok, I’ll just do well in 61b and 70. I got an A in 61b over summer, and felt really good about only needing a B- into 70. Come 70 I don’t fucking understand anything. I drop another class almost a month in because it’s killing me, and end up having to spend a ton of time on a new class I added. As a result, I tank the midterm (-1.2 SD below the mean). No problem, I just study hard for the final, right? I grind all RRR week, I’m getting mean on the past exams with extra time and I feel genuinely confident going into the exam. Then, I get there, and it’s way more difficult than the practices were for me. I can’t do anything, I panic, start crying, and give up and underperform. I know I did horribly. Definitely sub 30% (I left all but 2 long answers blank, and looking at my short answer answers the majority of them are wrong. I can’t even look at it because I just start crying again).
I know I won’t get a B- now and I won’t be able to declare. Looking at the data science major requirements as I’m writing this and I’m just breaking down. I don’t have interest in these classes, I just want to do CS. I haven’t had an internship, UGSI, or research position so appealing is off the table. I am feeling genuinely hopeless and I just can’t get the thoughts of killing myself out of my head (I won’t do it, but it’s just plaguing my thoughts, I don’t really know how to describe it). I feel like I worked so hard for so many years towards this and just tripped and face planted at the finish line. ~~Once grades are in if I get a C+, C, or C- I’m thinking of emailing rao and asking him to drop me to a D+ so I can retake for an A-. Is this a good idea? I don’t have high hopes but shooting my shot is better than doing nothing, right?~~ (Edit: haha this was impossible queue another mental breakdown) Does anyone have any advice? 

Tldr; failed 70 and can’t declare. Don’t want to do data science and I’m just at peak depression.",1608344714,21,1
Is it bad I'm acting in a risk-averse way with P/NP?,"So for Fall 2020 and Spring 2020, I pretty much P-NP'ed everything I knew I could not get an A in (got a B+ on the Econ 100B midterm and Olney said that was the highest grade you could get, provided you got 50+ on the other exams), had a high final exam weight (65% for one class), or did not do well on for midterms.

I currently do not have any grad school plans, other than medical or nursing school or *maybe* an MBA if I continue in business and I think the MBA would help me career-wise. I just want to focus on what's coming right after undergrad (a job hopefully) as opposed to some grad or professional school I may or may not attend later in the future.  I definitely don't plan on going to grad school right out of college, and I've accepted that the P's could hurt me for med or nursing school (I have 1 P in Chem 3B during Spring 2020, and the rest of the P's are in Econ/non-science classes).

So basically, I plan on P/NP-ing everything I'm going to get a B+ or lower in, and I was wondering if that's bad. A-minuses and up, I'm good with keeping. 

I'm a very risk averse person and so like if I didn't do well on a midterm or have a B in the class overall, I just think ""Well there's no guarantee the final will go any better, even if I studied my ass off, so why risk the possibility of getting a C or B-minus?""

Is it bad I'm acting in such a risk-averse way? I know this isn't what P/NP was intended for, but :/

I've definitely thought about how it could look bad to have 5 P/NP classes across 2 semesters. And if so, for Spring 2021 should I not P/NP anything I'll get a B in? 

I think the only classes I wouldn't P/NP would be classes where I had solid A's on the midterms/everything up to that point so that even if I bombed the final I'd probably get a B or B- at worst.",1608342913,6,0

.,"After I clearly communicated and documented my major depression diagnosis to my professor and asked for an incomplete, the professor told me that is not a reason. Medication after medication given by a psychiatrist seeing me, and even with therapy I am barely getting any better. I wish that my life ends. I tried to do that. I already feel dead. I cry with and without reason every day. I envision a future in a small dark gloomy room. I cannot do anything even if I push myself. When I was a kid and people were talking about depression, I thought it meant feeling pessimistic. Now that I know what it feels like, it is unimaginably worse than feeling pessimistic. Dear instructors, you can be very smart, productive people with high IQ and bunch of awards, but if, when a student reach outs to you about a mental disorder they are seriously struggling with and they even show you mental health professional documents to prove it, and if you think that it is not a reason to give an incomplete, you should be ashamed of yourselves.",1608341180,13,0
How to deal with anxiety about grades?,"I took 3 classes this semester and took the grade in one of them (I already know what the grade is). 

I don't know the grades for the other two of them, however, and took the unknown grades ones P/NP. 

Normally, I, and most others, I'd imagine, would think a C- isn't the best grade, but I'm actually anxious about not getting the P or getting at least a C- for both of them. 

I had around a low B in both before the final but I'm worried that I bombed both for some reason. 

One of them requires a weighted average of 70% to pass (though exams are curved up linearly, like a 60 becomes an 80 or so). It seems like about 25 people failed that class in Fall 2019, though, which means that about 13.2% failed. 

and the other is curved and it seems the 3rd percentile and below failed historically. 

When I took the finals I felt like I knew most of it and it's not like I was wildly guessing but the finals were worth 40%, and I didn't do well on the midterms for either class (slightly below average for both). I also feel the grading is really nitpicky for one of the classes, so that sucks too. 

I know there's nothing I can do now but my heart starts racing when I think of the grades for those classes. I'd just be bummed about having to retake the class although I guess I have the time/space to do so.

is it worth it to go on campus next semester?,"I'm a freshman and I received a housing offer for a RH single in Martinez Commons, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. One of my main motivations for going on campus would be to hopefully be able to meet some people and experience dorm life (as much as I can in the current situation, at least) because it's been pretty tough mentally living at home this semester. Somehow, an entire semester has already gone by and I haven't made a single friend. I barely even talk to anyone in general, and I've just been feeling shitty and unmotivated overall.

I learned a lot about the test though, but the problem was that I was so behind in Math53 and History7A.

Finally some good fucking news,"I just feel like sharing something good that happened to me since that's been such a rare occurrence this semester and I don't feel comfortable enough to talk about it with anyone Ik irl 🥺

I had a grandparent pass away from COVID unexpectedly early last week and could hardly get out of bed, let alone do anything related to school. I had several missing assignments in one course and had fallen behind on lectures. I was planning to catch up on both during Dead Week, but like I said before, I was too busy grieving.

Fast forward to this week and it becomes clear that it will be impossible for me to finish everything I need to do for this class and take the final exam. As a last Hail Mary, I email my professor and explain what happened (without mentioning COVID), and a whole day goes by. I've resigned myself to earning my first ""No Pass"" in my entire college career that began when I was an awkward 14-year-old in a dual enrollment art history class at the community college I would later attend upon graduation.

Then, a Christmas miracle happens: I refresh my email and find none other than a response from my professor that made me want to cry my eyes out. I am granted an ""Incomplete"" grade, and my professor wants me to focus on my other classes and grieving process as I will soon be able to spend much more time on finishing his course.

I haven't been this happy in a long time. I haven't cried happy tears in a long time. It just feels really nice to feel so supported by a professor at Berkeley during this time, let alone at all.

That's all. Sorry for the rambling.

Applying for CS (Questions),"Hello,

I'm planning on applying to Berkeley in the L&amp;S department next Fall. I will be transferring from CC as a junior. I'm leaning towards the Applied Math or Computer Science major but I've heard that once you do get accepted, you automatically start off undeclared. I know that it is going to be extremely competitive and given that I have about a year from now, I am willing to work super hard. I had a few questions however and would greatly appreciate any advices!

1. Regarding the CS major, do they care more about your grades or your experiences/projects (for admission)? I'm kind of torn between putting everything towards studying hard for my classes and getting straight A's or focusing more towards coding and getting some experiences (internships, side projects, etc). I definitely want a balance of both but as someone who struggles with math, I feel like I need to put more effort towards actually doing well in my classes. I don't think it'd make sense for me to put up my experiences and projects but present myself with a low GPA. I fear that if I were to go into the CS major, I would not have much coding experience and be completely lost. Is this something I shouldn't be worrying about as much since they will be teaching these things in CS classes?
2. We all know that when it comes to admissions, your personal statements matter **a lot.** To keep it short, I wrote my personal statements when I applied to schools last year and it was extremely bad. Got rejected left and right. Looking back however, I had no form of preparation and delayed those essays badly, so I ended up finishing them in a week or two *(I know. What was I thinking? But I'm a changed person now. LOL. I didn't care about my academics back then but I'm getting back on track in life).* So, my question with the personal statements is, how can I be well prepared for this as well? My writing skills are not up to par so I would love to prepare for them now. Whether it's taking a writing course or reading personal statement examples everyday, what are some other advices for writing a compelling statement?

Any help/advice would be appreciated! Thanks so much.",1608273841,1,0

This is not an unusual occurrence for me. CS70 and the possibility that I won't be able to declare gives me an extreme amount of anxiety, even though I'm a full semester away from taking the course. What are the things I can do to A) guarantee that I'll get a B in the class and B) stop worrying about it so much in the meantime?  

I'm currently writing this instead of studying for 16A, which I have a realistic chance of failing. But the shadow of 70 seems so much more real than the actual exam I'll be taking in 12 hours.

I'm aware of people who say that '70 is easy' or '70 is fun.' But I am wondering if any terrestrial people have anything to suggest, or maybe this anxiety is unique to me.",1608265118,12,0

Letter from Grad Dean on grad school admissions,"(Just got this, thought it might help students to hear it - Bob)

Dear Deans, Department Chairs, Graduate Advisors, and Admissions Teams,

We have heard from UC Berkeley undergraduate students who are concerned about how electing the Passed/Not Passed grading option for courses during the pandemic may negatively affect how graduate admissions committees consider their applications to graduate and professional schools at Berkeley.

In Spring 2020, the Council of Deans endorsed [a statement](https://calmessages.berkeley.edu/archives/message/73564) indicating that departments would  not penalize students who adopt P/NP grades during the spring 2020 semester.

Below is an updated statement from the Graduate Division which reaffirms this holistic review: 

*UC Berkeley evaluates applicants for admission to its graduate and professional schools holistically, meaning that we consider an applicant’s combination of personal accomplishments, letters of recommendation, personal statements, academic record, and test scores in making our admissions decisions. Such a review will take into account the significant disruptions of COVID-19 when reviewing students’ transcripts and other admissions materials during the pandemic. Thus, we will not penalize students for the adoption of P/NP grades and reduced research experiences during this unprecedented period, whether the choices were made by institutions or by individual students. What is most important is that applicants demonstrate that they pursued a challenging curriculum that was relevant to their plan for graduate or professional school.*

*As we have continued to observe in admissions cycles, Berkeley graduates have a remarkable track record of success in graduate school admissions to the most competitive programs in the country. Our graduates are admired for their academic abilities and resilience, and are assessed, as always, on their overall performance. We are confident that graduate admissions committees will make generous allowances for the academic challenges produced by the COVID-19 pandemic.*

...  **We ask for your assistance in circulating this email to your admissions teams, and any other staff or faculty who assist with admissions.** We will notify undergraduate advisors of this message.

Sincerely,

Lisa García Bedolla

The Disappearance of Sydney West,,1608225575,6,0
19yr Berkeley Student Sydney West Disappears in San Francisco September 30th 2020.,"Sydney West was born on July 11, 2001 to her parents, Jay and Kimberly West. The family, which also includes her younger sister, lived in Pleasanton, California for the majority of Sydney’s life, before relocating to Chapel Hill, North Carolina in the late 2010s.

Growing up, Sydney is described as being a sweet and goofy girl, who wasn’t afraid to be herself and let her true colours show. Those who knew her enjoyed her company, and her family says she made life better for those around her. She was also intelligent and well-spoken, with a love for the environment – so much so that she convinced her mother to start composting. This is attributed to her love of animals and the amount of time she spent outdoors.

Volleyball was one of Sydney’s passions, as she enjoyed living an active lifestyle. While attending Foothill High School in Pleasanton, she was known as a star member of the varsity team, and upon transferring to Chapel Hill’s Carrboro High School, she would become said school’s varsity co-captain. She would eventually transition to playing beach volleyball in 2019 and 2020.

Along with sports, Sydney was also interested in the arts. While she enjoyed writing and doing art, her favourite form of expression was music. She was known to attend open mic nights and would write, record and perform her own music, which her father has since been uploading to Soundcloud.

While Sydney might have appeared to have it all on the outside, she was known to struggle occasionally with her mental health. After graduating high school in 2019, she took a gap year, where, according to blog posts written by her, she began experiencing bouts of depression, on top of her anxiety.

In August 2020, Sydney moved back to California to begin classes at UC Berkeley. Her family helped her move into her dormitory, and while she had not declared a major, she showed a strong interest in medicine, business and biological sciences. She also joined the school’s rowing team. However, according to her uncle, she was having trouble adjusting to college life, with some sources reporting that Sydney eventually moved out of her dormitory and in with some friends in the San Francisco area.

DISAPPEARANCE:

On September 29, 2020, Jay and Sydney spoke on the phone, with Jay expecting to hear from his daughter the next day. However, that call would never come.

Not much is known about the day Sydney disappeared. All that investigators have shared with the public is that she was last seen at approximately 6:45am on the morning of September 30, 2020 near Crissy Field, which is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco. It’s known as a place where people go for outdoor activities, such as biking, running and yoga. On the morning in question, it’s said to have been exceptionally foggy out.

On October 2, 2020, two days after Sydney was last seen, a family member reported her missing to the San Francisco Police Department, who prepared a missing persons report.

SEARCH:

Since Sydney was reported missing, the San Francisco Police Department has been actively search for her across the city and the Bay Area. Her information has been entered into the National Crime Information Center database, and the case is being handled by the Missing Persons Section of the Special Victim’s Unit. They have remained tight-lipped about the investigation and any potential leads they are following up on, other than to say there is no evidence of foul play. They have publicly stated that they consider Sydney to be an at-risk missing person, given her history of depression.

In order to get the word out about Sydney’s disappearance, her family set up a Facebook page and an Instagram account, which they regularly update. As well, those who knew the missing girl have been spreading the word via their own social media accounts, in the hopes someone with information will come forward as to her whereabouts.

According to those who live in the San Francisco area, there are flyers posted across the city featuring Sydney’s image and description. The family has also hired a private investigator who is working alongside the San Francisco Police Department.

The family is asking anyone who frequents the Golden Gate Bridge area, either on their commute to work or for physical activity, to come forward with any information they may have. They are particularly interested in learning if anyone saw anything suspicious on the morning Sydney went missing. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office, which serves the Chapel Hill area in North Carolina, has also reached out to local residents, asking them to inform the authorities if they’ve had any contact with her.

Question for stem students: how do you actually do well in your classes?,"I’m a newly admitted transfer student. This is my first semester at cal.

I’m in civil engineering, but please respond if youre in stem (or really any major, I’m not picky). I need help!

My question is: Are midterms and finals similar to the homework or not?

For an engineering class and a civil engineering class I took this semester the homework was relatively easy. I could definitely do it. But the exams were just much harder. They had material we kinda covered in class/they had material that was just much harder than the homework. Is this normal? If so, how do you study?

1. How does this affect my tuition?  I am staying at home during Spring so idle housing cost is not an issue. 
2. If you withdraw (is this the only way to take a semester off?), can you still participate in club activities affiliated with the school?  
3. What affects does this have on your career—specifically, applying to jobs/internships and possibly grad school?  
4. Has anyone who’s done this experience any social repercussions? I.e. FOMO, loneliness, mental health. Would you say taking a gap semester was worth it?",1608213430,1,0

Please help bears!!!! (Dorming) :(,"I would really appreciate some help. I am a current freshman and stayed home this semester, and have a housing offer (unit 3) to return in the spring. I am not really sure what to do and my housing decision is due soon. P.S. I live in California,  only a few hours from Berkeley. 

A big part of me would like to go to campus for spring, especially as I probably will never get the chance to dorm again. It feels a little sad working really hard to get into such a great school and not being able to enjoy the beautiful campus and all. Especially with the friend-making and socialization aspect, I feel a lot of FOMO, to be honest. My intended roommate (rooms are all single now btw) is going back next semester too. I have been able to make some friends virtually, but I'm scared of not being able to find ""my people"" at college and being lonely. In terms of financials, I am low-income and do receive a decent amount of financial aid. I believe I'd pay 3-4k to dorm spring semester though. I do have a job at home, but then a part of me is also like ""Well, I'll be working my whole life probably. Life is short, and I want to just have a little more fun with my time."" A new environment would be nice, especially for my self-growth. The idea that I probably will never get to have that dorm experience feels a little disheartening. But I know there are transfers and other students who do not get to anyways and are doing amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another part of me is trying to make peace with staying home next semester. I would certainly save money being home, and get to spend some additional time with my mom and sister who I am really close with.  I have also started a new job and I really like it actually. I do feel like I am learning a lot from it and am able to give back to my community. When I drive home from work, I feel rewarded and happy. I would've never done this job if I hadn't stayed home. If I was to go back, I'd have to leave my position. I could try and talk to my boss about commuting 2+ hours to stay (I only work a few days a week right now). But this option is just a little intense, especially with commute time or last-minute work events. Staying home is obviously comfortable, I have my room and my own bathroom and all of that. Which I am incredibly grateful for. (One can argue leaving my comfort zone would also be beneficial with dorming) Face-to-face socialization at home is low, I have been just zooming/fting friends bc of social distancing of course. I talked to my mom about both of these options and she wants me to stay home. I do think I could try and convince her to let me go, but we would probably bicker about it lol, and I obviously don't want that. But idk. She knows what I'm thinking with these two paragraphs but I do think a part of her is simply afraid of me leaving the nest? IDK! 

Sorry for such a long post. I don't want to act ungrateful because I am so appreciative and lucky to even have the chance to choose between TWO places to live. If you were in my shoes, what do you think you'd do? I'd really appreciate some advice my fellow Bears, y'all r amazing. Thank you :( &lt;3",1606245908,1,0

Should I go on campus for spring semester?,"I am a freshman who stayed home for the fall semester due to the risk of contracting COVID and the impracticality of financial costs for zooming while living in a dorm.

Zoom has taken away the fun of social interactions and I really want the chance to experience this during the remaining time I have as a first year.

Transfer from L&amp;S to Engineering?,"Hi all,

I'm a prospective international student. I'm thinking of applying undeclared L&amp;S - intending a major in the physical sciences. The issue is, I am not entirely sure what I want to do. I have an insanely wide range of interests. Until recently, something in STEM has been my goal, but I've started to doubt that... I don't think the academic style and subsequent lifestyle is for me. Anyways, I want to join, take classes in maths, physics and also some social sciences, and then if I feel that university level STEM is for me, get into a STEM programme. However, if the converse turns out to be true, can I select a socsci major after having applied 'intending physical science'? Also, how hard is it for someone in L&amp;S with a good GPA (hopefully) and all the prequisites to transfer into engineering, if that turns out to be my thing? I know that engineering 1st year mandates some humanities, so would you suggest I get into that and switch into L&amp;S if it isn't for me?

I got the chance to interview a Berkeley grad on Twitter's Data Science team :),"Hey guys -

I spoke with Sayan Sanyal who’s a Data Scientist at Twitter on their Notifications team. He originally studied Computer Science as an undergrad before attending graduate school at Berkeley’s School Of Information with a focus on Data Science.

Thought I'd share some of it here, in case you find it helpful :)

**You initially studied Computer Science - tell me about that. Was that what you always wanted to do? Why did you pick that?**

In highschool, I was certain that I wanted to do something quantitative but I wasn’t sure what it would be. I was equally interested in economics, physics, or other engineering pathways. However, given cultural proclivities in India and oppurtunities available, computer science seemed to be the quantitative pathway that was the most easily available to me.

Once I started studying Computer Science, though, it became fairly clear to me relatively quickly that it could be applied to many different things - note that at the time, data science wasn’t really a thing. It was more around the line of analytics and there were certain companies that were trying to do things around that space, so that’s what I decided to explore further.

**What do you see as the main difference between analytics and data science (considering there’s roles for each sector)?**

Right after undergrad, I got into a business intelligence and analytics role. I think those types of roles are super interesting but I essentially just wanted to do more math. It boiled down to being able to understand and apply things in a slightly more sophisticated way, rather than just counting things and being able to display them.

I think that analytics is important however there are certain questions we aren’t able to answer. And for these questions, you need to infer things. We need to go beyond the data that’s available to us and think about processes that haven’t been observed. In order to do that, you need a different set of techniques - whether that be predictive or inferential in nature. And that’s what interested me.

**Can you tell me what your previous business intelligence role consisted of?**

It mainly consisted of 3 parts. One is ETL, which is basically getting data from place A to place B and ensuring that the data is cleansed. I think being able to build robust pipelines is a skill that I’m still leveraging today in the data science world.

The second aspect of it was the data modelling. That is trying to figure out how you would shape data that would enable different kinds of analysis. So for instance, this is where I learnt about snowflake versus star schema, ensuring transaction processing, and other things like that.

The third aspect of it was data visualization - so the dashboard building part. I think these three skills I just mentioned are useful even when you’re not in the analytics space.

**Did you have to pick up these skills at work or were they transferable from the computer science degree you had?**

The only thing that was transferable was the idea of normalization and that I had skills in trying to understand how programming works. I knew how to reason through challenging problems, I understood o-notation, I knew the fundamentals of databases, I knew how distributed systems worked - but mainly everything else was picked up on the job.

For instance, how should pipelines be structured in a way that they are fault tolerant? How do we implement error handling? These are things that I picked up on the job.

One of the projects I was working on at the time involved understanding weights and their impact on funding - and I knew that I would be able to do this via regression, but I didn’t feel like I had the mathematical chops to do it in a nuanced way. I thought that understanding data better and the statistical foundations behind this analysis was something I wanted to invest in further, so I decided to go to grad school.

**Tell me about your Berkeley experience. You studied Data Science. How was that overall?**

My two years at Berkeley challenged and pushed me to a degree that I hadn’t ever done previously. It took a lot out of me but I’m very glad for it. It made me question knowledge gaps that I had from undergrad and I tried to fill those as rigorously as possible.

The good thing about grad school is that it’s a choose your own adventure type of sport. Unlike undergrad where a lot of the programs are more structured, I would say over here I was able to have much more freedom over what I wanted to focus on. I spent a lot more of my time learning things that interested me. So for example, I went really deep into natural language processing and ended up being a teaching assistant for some of those classes.

I also worked with a professor trying to understand developmental economics using machine learning on satellite data. I spent a lot more time in grad school doing machine learning than causal inference, but now I do a lot more causal inference work than the sort of machine learning that I did in grad school.

**What team do you work on at Twitter?**

I work on the Notifications team. I’ll speak about 3 projects I’ve recently worked on.

One is far more engineering in nature. It involves building up a library using pyspark and python that helps you aggregate experimental data and perform statistical tests on them. This allows you to do flexible experiment analysis on Twitter data.

Another project I was working on was based more on observational causal inference. Trying to estimate the effect of a customer action on their long term user behavior. These are things you can’t always experiment with, so at that point in time you need to use observational techniques to do that.

Finally, another project was focused on trying to understand what happens when you change a machine learning model in one space and the downstream effects of that on the recommendations you end up getting in the notifications space. So trying to figure out how different candidate generation processes work and how they affect models is what I worked on.

As you can see, sometimes these projects include analysis of systems, sometimes they include observational studies, and sometimes it’s just plain engineering. Most of the time, I have one main project and other small projects.

**How often are you collaborating with other teams?**

All the time! You can’t work without collaborating with them. I most closely partner with my engineering tech leads and my product partners.

There’s a triumvirate in terms of product, data science, and engineering. So when trying to understand how to make the product better, a lot of the time we also take into account what user research has to say or we’ll also look at a design hypothesis that may have been laid out.

**How is working at a bigger company like Twitter different to working at a smaller company like at your previous role?**

The thing about Twitter is that being as large as it is, it still feels like a terribly small company compared to our other peers. For instance, our ratio of active users to number of people working here - that’s a really big ratio compared to some other companies in consumer tech.

One of the things that has been instructive for me is observing how planning, prioritization and strategy works across a larger company. Especially when there are multiple directions in which a company could be pulled. So being able to understand how to make an impact in that sort of an environment - which can get quite messy - has been a great learning experience.

**What new skills have you picked up within the context of this much larger environment?**

I think when I was getting into data science I over-index on technical skills. I think most people over-index on these skills and while it is always advantageous to go deep on certain topics, nothing beats being able to balance impact with rigor. One of the differences between academia and industry that I learnt through work is that we need in industry is anything that improves the status quo. It doesn’t need to be necessarily perfect, but it needs to ensure that wherever we are today, it is measurably better than that. And as long as that is true, you don’t need to spend 80% of the time polishing 20% of the last mile.

The second thing I’ve learnt how to do better is communicate succinctly and strategically. Being able to understand and collaborate effectively across different functions. Understand what priorities are and be able to frame things and navigate large organizations - these are all skills that are hard to develop.

You can pick these skills up outside of industry too, though. So say you’re at a large organization at school - people are the same. Across different stages, the way social interactions work out are not very different from one another. As long as you’ve navigated complex social systems before, there are repeatable skills you can pick up that will help you in industry.

Anyone out there with any idea how my midterm would be flagged and what the process is like for denying it? Do false positives happen frequently?

How to Study Well and Succeed in Classes?,"This past semester I realized one important thing about myself: I never realized how to study well since coming to Berkeley and don't really know when I truly understand a concept well enough to perform well (above average or even just average) on an exam when tested on that concept. How do you guys do it? I used to love tutoring math in hs and am fortunate to have known what it was like to understand something so deeply to love explaining it to others, but now taking the cs classes here I wonder if it's the difficulty of the material that I have never been adequately prepared for which hinders my ability and motivation to understand it fully, my own inability to see the gaps in my knowledge and reaching a point where I realize I did not understand most of the concepts in depth and must ration my time to prioritize cramming for concepts I guess will appear on the exam, or my standards of understanding material is now lowered to just performing the average and underestimating the difficulty of the exam as well as the knowledge of my peers which then enables me to consistently score lower than the average. 

Has anyone ever been able to pull themselves out of this problem and found studying techniques that actually helped them perform much better, or just figured out how to balance additional study time on top of extracurriculars, projects, other classes? For more background, I always score in the A-B+ range for projects and can commit about 30+ hours to working on them but as soon as an exam rolls around, I cannot seem to concentrate studying for more than 2 hour periods at a time, and last semester have scored -1 SD or worse on all of them. I really wish to improve and understand what I'm learning for future semesters, where I can even maybe become a tutor or just be able to explain concepts well again so I can actually enjoy what I'm studying.",1609377997,1,0

Math 128A and Math 124 Recommendation,"Hello fellow UCB students,

If you are an Applied Math major, I highly recommend taking Math 124. This was the most valuable math course I took during undergraduate. I was able to tackle engineering courses like Data 100 and CS 61B after taking this course.

10/10 would recommend Math 124!

For those who are interested in taking Math 128A and have no prior coding experience or weak understanding of algorithms I have some advice for you as well. I took the course having no coding or algorithm experience and managed to get an A, but it was honestly an awful experience. It was very stressful trying to teach myself how to code with very limited resources. The adjunct course Math 98 was also very unhelpful (sorry to say but this may vary by GSI).

Before or during the semester, I recommend reading chapters 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 13 of the Math 124 textbook - [https://robertsweeneyblanco.github.io/Programming\_for\_Mathematical\_Applications/Introduction/Chapter\_Intro.html](https://robertsweeneyblanco.github.io/Programming_for_Mathematical_Applications/Introduction/Chapter_Intro.html). You can find the associated homeworks on the course website - [http://persson.berkeley.edu/math124/](http://persson.berkeley.edu/math124/).

You will learn to code in the Julia programming language, which in my opinion is way better than Matlab. You'll also get experience with Jupyter notebook, which is a great environment for coding and organizing your work.

7/10 would recommend Math 128A. 

If I could do it all over again, I would take Math 124 and then Math 128A. 

Hope this helps someone :-)",1609369198,1,0

I have literally had one for not having my wheel turned sharply enough on a curb even though there was no slope.

Not sure where I want to go ahead as a CS student... How do I figure out what I want to do?,"I just finished my semester, and received my grade in CS70! I'M A CS MAJOR. WOOHOO!

While I finished this milestone, I've been so worried about declaring, that I've never actually thought about what I wanted to do with the rest of the 3 years I'm in school. I loved all the classes I've taken so far. I've enjoyed solving tricky recursion problems in 61A, learning about different data structures in 61B, and writing proofs in 70 was super satisfying (I was struggling so much in probability but I want to revisit it later because the application is interesting to me)! 

However, I've never really been so passionate in one topic. I know peers and friends who are interested in research ML taking 126/189 as soon as possible, career oriented people finishing their degrees ASAP to get jobs, programmers writing super cool side projects, etc. As for me, I've been enjoying learning and I've focusing on getting good grades in my classes, but I haven't found out what I really wanted to do. I'm afraid when I figure out what I want to do, I'm afraid that I might pivot and will want to do something else. I've been on and off on various hobbies and I'm worried this might be the same.

Bad memories of a failed premed.,"I came in premed as a freshman and had my dreams dashed by my B in Chem 3A. I also got a B+ in Math 10B that same semester. 

the next semester, after finding out a day before the 3B midterm that I scored average (a 72) on my Bio 1B evolution midterm, bringing me down to a B- in Bio 1B, further triggering the feelings I had after failing Chem 3A/Math 10B, I literally cried to my organic chemistry professor 2 hours before my 3B midterm about not knowing anything while also having a panic attack. That sucked. 

a year later or so, I took 3B again and would have only gotten a B+ in 3B had I not taken it P/NP. 

I also failed Bio 1A over the summer and dropped out after only scoring slightly above average on the first 3 quizzes.

Data 100 Recommendation,"Hello all,

I wanted to give some advice to those who are interested in taking Data 100 at UC Berkeley but have not taken some of the prerequisites. I took the course without CS 61A or Data 8, but still ended getting an A.

I did not take CS 61A and I really do think it's essential. I had basic programming skills that I learned from MATH 124, 128A, MATH 128B. I am an Applied Math major if you haven't guessed by now. I also took one module of this online course: [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python), which helped familiarize me with with the python syntax and prepared for data science programming you will encounter in Data 100. 

To prepare for the statistical portion of the course, I skimmed through the Data 8 textbook - [https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/01/1/intro.html](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/01/1/intro.html). If you are a Berkeley student, you will have full access to the whole entire course - [http://data8.org/sp20/](http://data8.org/sp20/),  as well as the homework assignments so you can test your understanding where you feel fit. I highly recommend making sure you prioritize Tables (Ch.3), Joins (Ch. 8.4)Sampling (Ch.10.1, 10.2) , Probability (Ch. 9.5, 18.1), Models (10.3,11.1), Comparing Distributions (11.1, 11.2), Confidence Intervals (Ch. 13).

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, you do need some knowledge of Linear Algebra. This MIT course is great - [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/). You will particularly want to look at concepts in Lectures 1, 2, 3 ,5,6 ,8, 9,14 ,15, 16, 29, 30. 

10/10 would recommend Data 100. It was really eye opening and I learned A LOT.

easy breadth - sociology 110!,"I took sociology 110 this semester, and was initially very worried because I hadn’t taken any sociology courses (I’m a CS major), and the prof’s previous distributions were somewhat intimidating. BUT, the format of the class was extremely forgiving. 

There are only 2 midterms which are week long papers (max 4 pages), with averages of 80% ish. There’s also 4 small papers (1-2 pages) and the prof gives almost everyone 100% on them. There is an art project ish assignment worth 30% of your grade and he gives almost everyone 100% on that as well. 
The final was multiple choice, with 57 questions but graded out of 50, so you could get some serious extra credit. (It wasn’t proctored, but there’s no way you would need to cheat if you did the readings OR went to lectures). 

I took the class PNP, but my equivalent grade was an A and I went to maybe 3 lectures in total. There are no discussions, just 3 one hour lectures per week. You can absolutely make it with just doing the readings (I even skipped the long ones that annoyed me).

my ibser stat 20 experience (fall 2020),"These sorts of postmortem reviews of classes taken are always super helpful to read, especially for those of us trying to decide whether a class is right for us. ill also be writing one for every econ and math class i took this semester.

Taken with Ibser, online, fall 2020, graded (for keyword searches)

Here's a rundown of what to expect:

medium amount of busywork, homework is difficult but graded on completion (and its on slader), three weekly quizzes (one 30-min and two 10-min), and multiple projects that absolutely required me to stay up-to-date with the lecture material.

\[On a scale of 1-10...\]

Overall Difficulty: 8.5

Faculty Helpfulness: 9.5

Exam Difficulty: 7

Quiz Difficulty: 7.5

Homework Difficulty: 3

I can't think of any other quantiles to consider. 

The way the 10-min quizzes work is that they're lecture quizzes worth 5% of your grade, each out of 4 points for a question each. Usually they're tough, but i quite appreciate that these forced me to watch the lectures on time (otherwise its easy to lag behind and get lazy).

The homework is helpful practice, i never once ended up copying it all from slader. instead i spent my time on it and used slader to check, since the book doesn't have solutions to all the problems. also helpful are the worksheets you do in discussion sections, which are plentiful and held morning til 4, with a couple sections at midnight for the asians.

one of the best things about the class was the strong GSI network. with the new online format, i've started attending office hours for the first time, since it's as simple as logging into a zoom meeting. there are office hours all day held by different GSIs, and its important to jump around and find the ones that are actually helpful (shoutout to one gsi in particular for being really good at explaining things and being friendly all around). there's also evening tutoring at 11pm, but i only used it a couple times for emergency questions.

i didn't find piazza to be that helpful, although the tutors and gsis were very active at answering real questions.

as for professor ibser himself, i found him to be easily likeable and a chill looking guy. he was always backtracking on due dates and some policy issues here and there which felt a little messy at times, but shows that he was always listening to our concerns and not being stingy with making adjustments to the way he ran things. he also gets easily distracted in lecture, and early in the semester he'd spend nearly the entire time answering questions in the chat instead of lecturing (take that as you will, i thought it was hilarious). 

afaik, this class is very tough on cheating, but nobody posted quizzes or exams to chegg i think. he also mentioned a couple cases of cheating in a recent email, but it wasn't a huge scandal like in other classes/semesters. early in the semester there was talk of a large wechat group chat held by many of the chinese national students that involved a lot of quiz sharing and cheating, but nothing was done about that. i was in a group chat myself, but all the econ kids were to scared to even instigate cheating, so it never happened fortunately.

with one midterm, a final exam, and a final project that togetrher make up more than 70% of your grade, realize that it's important to study at the right times. the quizzes should not be catching you off guard. if you fail a couple like i did, that's okay as long as you take the time to understand what you got wrong and improve. the exams are crucial, and a good group for your project is crucial. 

as for choosing pnp/graded, i had a lot of stress over choosing either. the final and the final project are together worth 45% of your grade, so prior to dec 4 it was going to be a major risk anyway. your only faith is your midterm score and your quiz averages (1.5+ SD should be a secure A/A-, and anywhere between 1.5 and .5+ should be a decent chance at an A).

I got an A, and i feel really proud because i think i worked really hard for it. you can't get carried in this class, even with friends who have taken the class with ibser before, because the format has changed significantly since last spring/summer. i believe it's gotten a little harder, actually.

if you're taking stat 20 with ibser, good luck. you'll certainly need it, but as thomas jefferson said: 

&gt; I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it.",1609289442,1,0

Gap Semester for Econ Major,"I'm looking to take a semester off during the 2021-2022 academic school year because I got accepted to a semester-long work program abroad. Currently, I'm a sophomore who is an econ major. When I was checking the website, there was some information on study abroad, but that doesn't apply to me since I'm not doing courses at an external institution. Also, econ advising is closed for winter break, so I was if anybody here has experience taking a gap semester as an econ major and if there are particular policies I should be aware of.

Personal Finance DeCal Returns!,"Howdy!

I am bringing back the one-unit DeCal on personal finance this spring, and it's time to recruit people to sign up.

This is going to be as easy and casual as I can make it while still meeting requirements. We'll be going over things like budgets, debt, investing, taxes, insurance, and the like. The course is intended as an overview of the financial terms and topics you can expect to encounter as you begin your life as a Real Adult™.

==[Additional Information on DeCal Website](https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/5445)==  
==[Link to Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wFg296_hB2ELq8RFCqer8FcbEAJvczU1gxiubxCaoig/edit?usp=sharing)==  
==[Application Link](https://forms.gle/Y6PuRVef3KfnPzS49)==

The commitment will be one hour per week of lecture (Wednesdays 5-6pm),  plus a weekly reading and associated very short writing assignment, plus a casual, one-time project consisting of a resume/cover letter activity or 3-5 page paper. There are no tests or exams. The class is graded P/NP (like all DeCals) and you only need a 70% to pass.

Applications are open now! Enrollment is unfortunately capped at 40 so that I can grade everyone's homework in a timely manner. The application is at [https://forms.gle/Y6PuRVef3KfnPzS49](https://forms.gle/Y6PuRVef3KfnPzS49). If you don't get in, you can still opt to have lecture recordings sent to you so you can ""audit"" the class.",1609285832,1,0

Review on CS70 (Rao),"**Content:** I enjoyed this class more than CS61A/CS61B. The course definitely changed the way I think about computer science &amp; it definitely provides the mathematical rigor necessary to understand algorithms at a deeper level. My mind was blown a couple times during the semester. I found the probability modules similar to a traditional math class like Math53, but also opened my mind on understanding how probability works. The content is dense, the notes are sometimes extremely difficult to understand, but the contents are awesome. I think the course is well-organized and all the topics ""flow"". **Overall: 10/10**, amazing content.  


**Course Structure:** The class is comprised of mainly homework, discussions, lectures, notes, and exams. I found the homework to be pretty difficult and time consuming; by design, it is more difficult than the exam-level questions. I studied mostly through the notes (honestly the best part of the course) for the conceptual understanding and attended discussions for learning the applications of the concepts. There are mini-lectures in the discussions so I heavily recommend attending them in person. I found the lectures not as helpful &amp; honestly found myself just being confused for 2 hours. The exams were very difficult (as expected of the 50% midterm averages), but I found that it was definitely ""pattern-match-able"" given 4-5 previous exam run-throughs. I found it easier to study for compared to a class like CS61A where the intuition matters more. **Overall: 8/10**, I wish the lectures were more helpful but otherwise well ran.  


**Tips / Tricks:** Because the course doesn't have projects like the other CS prereqs, I found it easy to fall behind because it doesn't really affect you until the midterm season. Make sure to read the notes in advanced CONSISTENTLY! Falling behind is a death-sentence. The homework is designed to worked on in a group. Either study with a friend or be involved in Piazza discussions if you want to finish homework in a reasonable amount of time.",1609276408,1,0

How to make friends? (Doing Cal Online Spring Semester Too),"Sorry if there's been a dozen questions like this already.

Freshman. Fall semester was rough. Not on campus. I was declared non-resident which kind of blindsided me and the anxiety of tuition  hung over me like a heavy cloud. 

But I also didn't have any Cal friends. Like sure, I know some kids who go to Cal and they're always like ""let's hang out when you get here!"" but we don't talk regularly, so I don't really count it as real college friendships. 

I think I've always been aware of my loneliness but when it was Finals season, I realized at what a disadvantage I was. No study groups. No study friends. 

I detest the large group chats like LoopChat. I am a social person but I am so repulsed by the idea of making a post about myself to the freshman Berkeley facebook or IG page or attempt to stand out in a 600 person loopchat. 

Sigh. So it's probably my fault and I should really put more effort in.

questions for data science majors,"I'm a freshman hoping for advice.....I just took Data 8 and am wondering.....

[RANT] To the Honest Kids: Don't Take MCB 102 if it's Online or Not Proctored.,"Disclaimer: this post is not directed to ANY persons in the class as it is merely a rant.

The biggest takeaway from MCB 102 in Fall 2020 is that being an honest student only places you in a disadvantage position.

Let's start by introducing the structure of this class: the average is curved to a B-, there are 3 midterms (third midterm = final), the class is curved, meaning that your final grade in the class depends on how your classmates do in the class (duh), and it's a class filled with premed students. Last but not least and perhaps most importantly, the class is NOT proctored (as in you download the exam.pdf and you have 2 hours to complete it with no other proctoring devices at all). There are basically 3 sections in the class, with a different professor responsible for each section

Now, let's get to the main point.

During the first section, we were given weekly quizzes on the Sapling software (basically an assignment software similar to the Pearson homework softwares). That said, all the answers are basically on Chegg (good job to those with $15/month to spare). In addition, the instructor specifically told us that the quizzes should be closed-book and NO collaboration is allowed. Also worth noting is that partial credits do not exist on Sapling. If you missed one subquestion (i.e. fill in the blank, drag this label to the picture, etc.), you get the whole question wrong. 0% credit. Now, an interesting phenomenon was observed: the first quiz had a decently low average (\~50% if I remember correctly), but the averages started to rise to around 80% starting on the second quiz (4 in total). 80% average on quizzes that offer NO partial credit in a class of approximately 450 students. Hmmm, convincing. Even the professor knew something was up, but of course, she had no way of catching who the cheaters were, let alone assigning the grades fairly. And then there's me, with a 50% quiz average lol.

On our first midterm, the average was 41%. It was an impossible test, and even cheating wouldn't have helped. This was the exam that I was able to score decently well on (\~ +1std). On the second and third midterm, the averages were close to fucking 70%, and I have only been able to score a few points above the average (not even +0.5std). ~~Now that the final grade is coming out, I already know I'll most likely end with a C+/B-, since the professors already insisted that the average will be designated as a B-.~~ (Ended with a B+).

Obviously, I am in no place of claiming how much cheating occurred. However, it would also be ignorant to claim that there is no cheating in a competitive premed-filled, curved-based, med school-prerequisite class. (Lmao, there's this girl who texted the MCB 102 group chat on Facebook Messenger LITERALLY DURING EXAM TIME (-\_\_\_-) and proceeded to unsend the message right after).

I just don't get it, why don't the professors proctor the exams? I have done very well in all my classes (even more difficult than MCB 102 imo) that require any sort of proctoring measures. Someone  suggested proctoring services to be implemented for the final, but it was ignored by the staff and dismissed by the student apparently due to ""syllabus"" issues. (The staff virtually ignored EVERY student's administrative concern posed on Piazza. The lack of communication was terrifying, and the students were literally ignored. Not exaggerating, ignored.) There are simply so many ways to cheat during the exam: collaboration with other peers, help from private tutors ($$$), friend/family with Biochemistry background, or different timezone kids receiving the tests before their designated test time. And when the professor announced that she will be conducting cheating investigations during Thanksgiving break, the same group chat mentioned above went OFF about how this is difficult for their mental health and it's unfair. Like, wait, if you didn't cheat, why are you even worried? Shouldn't you be happy that the professor is taking her time to find the cheaters so that your grade can ideally go up? What? These kids even started talking about the possibility of reporting said professor to the dean and the MCB department, like, BRO. Y'all sus as hell, just saying. Y'all sus as hell.

Sure, I could have studied more and dedicated more time to MCB 102 (although the required thicc reading every other day was well beyond the designated credits), but I simply cannot accept the grade. I can't take it. I simply cannot believe the score to be the accurate representation of my learning outcomes in this class.

Now, to all y'all cheaters who helped inflate the averages, remember that y'all can't cheat on the MCAT, and that's when the medical school admissions will realize YOUR grade is NOT an accurate representation of YOUR learning outcomes in this class. Watch me make a comeback on the MCAT Biochemistry section.

Lastly, to the 3 professors: I loved the lectures and the effort put into helping us understand the subject. It was truly unfortunate that I was not able to take this class with you in person. As stressful as this semester was, I still loved the subject. For that, I thank all of you whole-heartedly.

Interested in another major. Need advice,"Hey! I’m a freshman in the CoE. After taking an R5B course with a GSI that threw out constant questions about the human condition, I became fascinated with philosophy. 

Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed the introductory engineering course I took this semester and want to further the discipline. I even wrote in the journal of my freshman year of high school that I would major in an engineering discipline because I was so fascinated and excited about the people I could save. 

I have swept these feelings I have for philosophy because I repeatedly told myself that it was a mere intellectual drive and nothing more. The fear of unemployment, not a good paying salary, or disappointing my parents aided my decision. I have immersed myself so much in STEM (competitions, research in high school and a research opportunity during summer 2021) that I feel like it would be down playing what I’ve worked for. Also, I’ve taken roughly 20 units fall and planning 20 units spring to knock out the prereqs for engineering and it doesn’t really transfer to a philosophy major. These underlying fears have prevented me from engaging in the major. 

I have never experienced a philosophy course and don’t really have a grasp of what it truly is. But, I have gravitated towards the mind twisting questions and the dissection of people’s work.

I know the obvious answer is to just try it out but the fear of wanting to do it is what scares me. I’m so sorry if this sounds like a “ranty” teen.

B+ in 61B --&gt; impact on research/clubs?,"EECS Freshman here. Unfortunately I didn't study effectively for 61B and although I really liked the class I wound up with a B+.

I plan on improving my studying for the future, but I was wondering how these grades impact my ability into getting CS clubs like ML@B/Launchpad/Codebase and getting the opportunity to do impactful research (like through urap/cold emailing professors)? I have a genuine interest in creating AI projects and am worried that potential side projects cannot be ""proven"" unless they were part of such well know orgs.

Friendly tips for anyone who need a good grade in CS70 to declare,"After ALLLLL that stress, I just saw my 70 grade and I got above what I needed so I can declare!! Just wanted to share some things I learned through these stressful past few months for future bears in my position. 

1. discussion and vitamin grades DO matter, because if you look at the the standard deviation on the midterm and finals, it is usually within 5 percent (of the course), so while pulling .5 SD above the mean on the midterm is a huge win, you could easily lose that advantage if you lose a percent here for discussion attendance and a percent there for vitamins. the numbers look insignificant, but could make the difference of a letter grade and decide if you can declare or not. (I personally didn't think they mattered and got a letter grade lower than someone with similar exam scores, granted we might both be just a little above or a little below the cutoff) 
2. Don't stress too much about not knowing how to do all the HW problems, they are so hard so just try your best and use all the resources you can like CSM, discussion TA, piazza etc. I feel like I learned a lot through struggling through the hw problems which helped me a lot when it came to finals. 
3. When studying for the midterm and the final, make sure to make use of the notes the staff posts and the discussions, make a good cheatsheet for yourself not because you will actually have time to look through every line during the test, but because the process of making one will show you which topics you know well and which ones you are still shaky on. 
4. past exams, past exams, past exams. I personally found them way more helpful than re-doing the homeworks in my own semester. If you run out of time at the end, even just looking thru the past solutions helps a lot in getting into the grove of the 70 way of thinking too. 
5. YOU CAN DO THIS!!! I came into berkeley having never programmed before and did ok in 61a and 61b which built up my confidence in coding, however during the first couple lectures of 70 I was scared shitless because I just felt so out of place and so confused all the time, having been not the best at math all my life. But it is going to work out, if you put hard work into it, you will find that you are way more capable than you thought. Believe in yourself and good luck!!

"Course Reviews For CS170, CS61C, and EE126","I remember seeing a few course reviews posted here after last semester and I found them useful, so I thought I would continue that tradition also.

**CS 170:** **Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems** (Vazirani, Tal)

**Summary:** As one of the first upper-division courses most CS students take, 170 feels like a logical extension of the material covered in 61B, namely the algorithmic parts, but also using proofs and other material (namely modular arithmetic, graph theory, and some probability) from 70. I felt like the overall pace of this class was perfect, spending approximately 2-3 lectures on each topic.

**Workload:** The workload of 170 is concentrated in the homeworks. Every week, there's anywhere between 3-7 problems, mainly algorithmic design ones. They aren't really long, but they are definitely very challenging and take a decent amount of just thinking before you arrive at the answer. I think on average, I spent anywhere between 6-12 hours on the homework depending on the length. Other than that, there's also a coding group project at the end of the semester where you try to tackle a NP-Hard problem. Our group probably spent around 20 hours on it and placed around the 85th percentile in the class. 

**Difficulty:** Personally, I actually found the material itself not too difficult to understand, mainly due to the lectures and textbook both being pretty good. The actual problems given out on homeworks and on exams are quite a bit tougher and involve more thinking beyond just understanding the algos covered in class. To prepare for exams, I usually first carefully read through the solutions of homeworks/discussions to understand what types of detail they are looking for in our answers (this turned out to be really helpful as for both MT1 and MT2, there were always 1-2 questions that were similar to HW). I also did anywhere between 2-4 practice exams. After that, you can usually notice some common patterns that solutions tend to take (ex: for graph problems, making copies of the graph, adding a vertex, reversing edges are common approaches), which will help a lot for tests. 

**Overall Thoughts**: I really liked 170. Walking away from the class, I feel like I truly understand a lot of the algorithms and why they worked that I didn't quite understand from 61B and grinding LeetCode. Definitely a must-take class if you are a CS major. 

**Rating: 9/10**

**CS 61C: Great Ideas In Computer Architecture** (Garcia, Nikolic)

**Summary:** 61C covers a wide assortment of topics relating to computer architecture and serves as a gateway course/prerequisite to more EE upper divs and a lot of important CS upper divs, like CS162. 

**Workload**: Surprisingly, out of the three classes, 61C ended up taking the most work. Most of the work isn't really that particularly hard, but there is just a ton of it. To start, there are four partner projects, which increase in workload/difficulty as the semester progresses. The first project took me \~10 hours, but the last two probably took like 20-30 hours each. In addition, there are around 11 homework assignments, each of which took between 2-4 hours to complete. There are also weekly labs, which takes a few more hours. Also present this semester are clicker questions to complete for each lecture. Another unexpected source of time drain: wasting time being confused since OH queues routinely takes 4-6 hours. The relief policy implemented midway through the semester helped lessen the workload a bit.

**Difficulty**: Material wise, the content in 61C is probably the easiest to understand out of the three, particularly since Garcia's pre-recorded lectures were very well-made and well-explained (Bora's weren't nearly as good, but still not bad). That said, the class covers a lot - you learn to program in C and RISC-V and there's a ton of other material (number representations, circuit stuff, datapath, cache, virtual memory, performance programming, etc). To prepare for tests, I found looking through the lecture slides and discussion answers, as well as doing 4-5 old exam questions per topic to be helpful and sufficient. New this semester was having actual coding sections on both the quest and the midterm, which was a pain. 

**Overall Thoughts**: As evidenced by the many 61C posts this past semester, there is a lot of room for improvement for how this class can be run. That said, I actually found the material to be quite interesting a lot of the times since I've never really thought about how computers truly worked until this course. Parts of the projects are also pretty interesting, but they are definitely frustrating and stressful. For the Garcia rendition, you can have project partners, so make sure to pick someone reliable that is also taking for a grade if you are. 

**Rating: 7/10**

**EE 126: Probability and Random Processes** (Parekh)

**Summary:** EE126 is an extension on the probability portions covered in CS 70. In the first month, we do a speedrun of all of the probability concepts covered in CS 70, followed by MT1. The rest of the class covers more advanced concepts, with a particular emphasis on Markov chains (infinite and continuous) and estimation (MAP, MLE, hypothesis testing, LLSE, MMSE, Kalman filtering). The class moves very fast overall.

**Workload**: Similarly, the workload of 126 is concentrated in the homeworks. Every week, there's around 6 problems and they usually take me anywhere between 8-13 hours. There's also weekly Python labs where you apply concepts learned in class that take 2-3 hours. We were blessed with 3 HW drops and 3 lab drops, which helped a lot in the weeks I had midterms/projects due. 

**Difficulty**: Out of the three, 126 by far has the most difficult to understand material. The lectures are quite abstract and just zooms through a ton of proofs and theorems. Parekh was a decent lecturer, but the material was just hard and the textbook honestly wasn't that useful and was even harder to understand. That said, the actual homework and exam problems are doable even if you don't 100% understand everything covered in the lectures. I personally found just doing/looking over 4-5 practice exams before each test to be really helpful as the problems are more application-based rather than proof-based.

**Overall Thoughts:** Overall, I liked 126. The material felt a bit dry at times, but I think the class definitely helped build up my ""mathematical maturity"". That said, I'd only recommend the class if you felt you did well/liked the probability part of CS70 because it does move pretty fast and if you didn't like 70, you probably won't like 126. Definitely make sure you have the probability and markov chains portions of 70 down cold before taking this class.

**Rating: 7.5/10**

**Conclusion:** As expected, taking the three of these courses together, along with a breadth, turned out to be quite exhausting. I ended up surviving and got A's in all three, but I essentially had to spend almost every waking hour on studying or working on problem sets/projects. I didn't end up spending nearly as much time as I would've liked on recruiting for internships and, once again like last year, have not managed to land anything. I would only recommend taking the three together if you are a strong student/don't have much other time commitment, but I definitely feel I learned a lot this past semester.",1609215761,1,0

As a proud Bear student, we are doing everything we can to get through this difficult pandemic. Please discuss with your faculty that while currently in Lockdown in CA, we are all stuck at home, with LESS THAN IDEAL Wifi at times, UNABLE TO GO TO OTHER PLACES FOR GOOD INTERNET SERVICE, YESTERDAY WE EVEN HAD A POWER OUTAGE IN OUR AREA FOR 8 HRS. So their expectations to have video supervised final (Econ 1 Teacher Prof. Tang) is simply ridiculous. We sometimes don't even have good wifi let alone make sure we have a video supervised exam next week!!!! Give us a break won't you! We really are trying to do our very best.

Finding internship for CS advice,"Hi, I've been applying to over 150+ places and basically been rejected from all of them. I've had like 5 hackerranks which were quite hard (Snowflake, IMC, Tiktok, can't remember, can't remember) and not passed them. I've had one technical zoom screen from veeva, and while I didn't bomb it, I didn't ace it either. It was on some string manipulation stuff, one of them was quite easy, and one of them I didn't think of the solution because of nervousness. Anyone else struggling here? What should I do. I've put in a ton of effort into 61c, got burnt out, decided to PNP, and now I'm gonna grind fulltime for a position. Doing CTCI problems rn.

Chem 3B vs. Physics 8A?,"For context, I’m taking Chem 3A right now, and was wondering if I should continue with the same instructor (Robak) for next semester into Chem 3B while the information stays fresh. However, right now, I’m enrolled into Physics 8A with Bordel. I heard Bordel will teach it anyway in fall, and Chem 3B is a ton of spots left too right now. Although, I didn’t take Chem 3AL this semester, so I’m planning on taking it next semester.

So besides this one class spot for Chem 3B or Physics 8A, I’m planning on taking the following classes for Spring 2021: Japan 80 (Soga), Sociol 1 (Swidler), and Chem 3AL (Marsden).

another struggling bear,"hi guys. another depressed bear here (what's new?). I'm a freshie. I just needed to vent a bit. I'm currently on campus right now living in the dorms. it's honestly not so bad and I like the independence and freedom I have. my hallmates are all pretty friendly although I wouldn't call any of them my ""friends"" yet. they've all seemed to grow really close with each other but my
depression and anxiety is preventing me from spending time with them.

but I'm struggling so much in online classes. my depression isn't helping either. I've struggled with untreated depression for years, and especially through high school. my parents had a stigma against mental health so I couldn't get the help I needed. but recently I just consulted with CAPS and the ship health insurance let me get anti depressants for cheap. 

I just got started on them but I'm a month into the semester now. and I'm so fucking behind on classes I feel like I'm drowning. I cant even get out of bed to do basic things like take a shower and brush my teeth. I've let my room fall into disarray and it's such a mess I can't leave it open like all my other hallmates because I'm embarrassed to let people in and socialize. my depression gets so bad I just lay in bed and starve myself and let my meal swipes go to waste because I have no motivation to go to the dining hall. my grades are terrible and seeing more and more assignments pile up just worsens my anxiety.

I feel like I'm gonna get a terrible gpa this semester and it's gonna impact my whole future. no chance for research opportunities, internships, grad school, etc. I'm so afraid of failing this semester but I know there's no way I can save my GPA at this point. not to mention I'm already not that smart, and my depression is now hindering my ability to focus and get work done. idk what to do. my anti depressants aren't working to be honest and I know they're not an instant cure-all. but every day I still wake up with no will to even take care of myself, much less be productive with schoolwork.

I feel myself falling behind on all aspects at Berkeley. schoolwork, extracurriculars, and socializing. fellow freshmen are going to office hours and getting to know profs and GSIs and getting involved in student orgs when I can't even get out of bed. my future seems bleak and hopeless. and I'm so, so afraid of disappointing my parents. they FaceTime me every week and I put on and act and pretend I'm doing fine in school when really I just want to die. I'm gonna have to face the music eventually but I just don't know what to do.

"To the person who posted about their failed suicide attempt a couple weeks ago, I hope you’re still here and still alive","A couple commenters grew worried after you deleted your original post and throwaway account. OP, if you happen to see this, please please please seek help if you feel like you want to try taking your own life again. 

I hope you are getting the love and support you need. If not, the CAPS program at Cal seems to be very helpful, even if you’re at home! 
If you’re on-campus, just call the CAPS number — (510) 642-9494 — to schedule a first-time appointment. 
If you’re at home, CAPS can connect you to off-campus psychiatric care providers regardless of your insurance plan. Here’s a link for more info: https://uhs.berkeley.edu/counseling/counseling-and-psychological-services-caps/campus-counseling-referrals

CAPS’ after-hours support number is (855) 817-5667. If you feel like you’re having a psychiatric emergency it’s probably better to just dial 911 though. 

Anyway, I really hope this reaches you, and I hope this post has been useful for anyone else struggling with mental health and depression. It gets better — I used to be in a dark place too and now I’m so grateful that I never made the irreversible decision to commit suicide. 

Please don’t make the biggest (and last) mistake of your life! Suicide is the worst permanent “solution” to absolutely TEMPORARY problems. You are valued, you are loved, and you are enough! &lt;3",1602039482,1,0

You can ask whenever you want without interrupting the lecturer for every single question, and can have other students answer your question instead.

Do you think this is a heavy load? (I need to do well for grad school so grades matter) 

I also work Mon-Fri from 8-2 so Idk if I should not take a breadth this semester to focus on the three classes.

i feel so helpless,"I know we have a lot of stressed, reasonable rants posted at least once every day already. And to be honest, I've been doing okay. I like staying home, and online classes are a pain but doable. I'm okay with not meeting friends cuz all of them are in different countries as of now. 

But I'm an international student living in a shitty time zone, and my even shitter schedule has me running on 3-4 hours of sleep each day. I kinda have insomniac tendencies so that usually takes at least 40 mins away from what I could've gotten. I would watch recordings, but then I find myself not being able to focus at all. I'd have 4am lectures and 9am discussions and crap. 

I was able to do it, though, since I ran on 4 hours of sleep sometimes in high school as well. It didn't seem like a big deal, and besides, there are other people in my shoes. But then today, I was so friggin tired but I couldn't sleep till 7am. I had 2 discussions from 9-11am, and couldn't wake up for them. I ended up missing both, and discussions aren't even lectures - they're mandatory. 

I dunno, I never missed anything because I couldn't wake up for it in my whole life. I was late to things, but I was always there. Now that it's happened, I'm just scared it's gonna happen again, and what scares me the most is I don't know how to fix it. It's not a mental health problem, and I can do nothing about my sleep schedule - it's either give up efficiency or give up sleep, and I need efficiency right now. 

Spring 2021 is remote, and I won't be going to the US. Frankly, I just feel tired af and terrible that I missed not only one but two mandatory discussions. I'm not even behind on any work, but I feel behind. 

yeah had to get that out thanks for reading guys - go bears",1601969179,1,0

CS70 Unfair Policies,"I want to preface this post with that I am trying to look at everything in a positive light for this class. I have tried as much as I have seen to try my best and look positively but at every corner, I see completely **unnecessary** blocks to me learning placed in my way.  


I started by finishing the 15 part question HW 5 and on piazza, I saw the following posts to name a few:

https://preview.redd.it/67hd9az15er51.png?width=1067&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=035e9c34ab95580df97e83d31b776a130156f22a

Again, I maintained my positive attitude and dismissed the posts openly as demanding and unnecessary. I agreed with some of the points such as the limit of cheat sheets to be pointless since if someone really wanted to cheat by hiding some extra cheat sheets they can do so and just not show it on camera so this will hurt people who aren't cheating (other classes like 61B which the post mentioned allowed for this reason). And in any case, Prof Rao's past exams don't seem like something unlimited cheatsheets would help with because of the **tight time constraints** but if it makes it more organized for you and you want to write bigger then that sounded reasonable. 

Prof Rao had already mentioned at the start of the semester that he thought the summer exam conditions went well and that he'd mostly aim to replicate them so I was expecting to have extreme proctoring and since that reduces the chance of cheating in a curved class **I was fine with that**.

Then this:  


https://preview.redd.it/5qcmf63laer51.png?width=1070&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84008e1721895d0ae5a0b3ea6aaec5350683bad1

I was assuming that the summer policies were the policies we were going with and that new changes were not going to happen last minute like this but apparently, we cannot use tablets for the midterm. This means that I now have to go through the stress of finding a way to scan my exam and everything. The closest thing to an explanation I found was   


&gt;While I personally believe (and root for) students, I also believe (and last semester saw) students slide down a slippery slope in using communication technology inappropriately during an exam.

If we are being recorded I do not see this as an issue and I definitely do not think this has been an issue in *any* class many of which have had less strict proctoring policies. I do not think students would be this desperate to cheat especially at Berkeley of all places. If someone communicates with someone else while being recorded that's on them, they should get an F, others who aren't breaking the rules shouldn't be punished for this...  


However, instead of listening to students, course staff followed up on their bar of technology with this:

https://preview.redd.it/40t78827aer51.png?width=1070&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea4e9f3dad994637e56c6cf7ed5211947b2cd526

It seems like course staff wants us to be stressed by rewriting our notes uselessly (I already spent the weekend LaTeXing my notes up from notability and now I need to handwrite them up for the third time??) — we are already being proctored why can't we use a device which can make everything easier for everyone? Why does course staff want students to be stressed scanning exams in a time-crunched exam? Why do they want to make everything new and hard for us? They already have had *a lot of issues* releasing stuff on-time **consistently** throughout the semester and to make stuff even harder for students is a combination of pure laziness and unfairness in itself. This is a CS class at the end of the day and to be against using technology as the course staff has repeatedly said seems pointless especially since many other classes have allowed all the stuff other classes have not without any problems.  


tl;dr   
CS70 staff: gives long hw psets with hard questions  
CS70 staff: introduces new counterintuitive exam logistics last minute  
CS70 staff: Bans typed notes since ""we don't want to disadvantage people without devices""  
*as they require u to be proctored by 2 devices*  
(Most people who don't have an ipad prefer handwriting anyways)  


Students: are stressed and do bad
