"Reminder: UCF will use the past year to justify putting more majors online, don't let them","It's no secret that UCF is a school that wants to be ""innovative"" rather than actually be a quality university. Ever since that Bill Gates visit where he praised the online program, UCF has been putting more and more of the university online, starting with the business college. The rumors are that CS is actually next. 

The results are clear: online learning is a colossal failure. If our leaders were smart, they would be shutting down bars, resteraunts, gatherings, etc so that schools could open. But since they aren't schools and universities have to swallow remote learning despite all the evidence coming out that students don't learn much of anything remotely.

Make \*\*absolutely zero\*\* mistake: UCF will declare that the remote class experiment was a ""raving success"" and proof that we can ""integrate it into curriculums"" (read: shove more majors to online only or mixed-mode-but-actually-just-virtual-like-COBA). The only way that this can be stopped is if students peak up when these discussions start happening and let them know this shit is a absolute failure.

I spent the next hour picking up thousands of tiny pieces of plastic from a puddle of champagne while half of the confetti was blowing into the reflecting pond.

Since the UCF registrar is closed this week I figured I'd consult this sub for some answers.

Does UCF have anything to say I can't do this? Or is there some process I have to go through? My thought is just not to register for classes but I want a second opinion.

Engineering vs Physics at UCF,"Hey, I love learning about multivariable calculus as a high school student and want to go into a field where I can apply as much high level math as possible. I’m in IB (straight A student, taken ~13 APs) and I really enjoyed writing academic papers on applied math through the program, but I’m afraid there’s no money in that. I am frustrated as well because everything I’m reading online seems to suggest majoring in physics is not good for getting a job, and I fear I might get bored in engineering if it’s all application with no intuition. A lot of the engineering majors at UCF seem really cool though, I think I would love learning about fluid mechanics in aerospace and mechanical, but also I think circuits are really cool too so I would probably enjoy electrical as well. My issue though is I only enjoy the process when I understand the intuition behind why things work. I don’t have any experience taking engineering classes either, just physics, so I don’t know what to expect. So, I guess my real question is, given I go to UCF, what program is best for me? I could really use some advice from majors on either side if y’all are out there :)",1609258468,1,0

"Business Major thinking about switching majors, would really appreciate some questions answered by the awesome UCF community!!","Hello! I'm currently a pre-Management Bussiness Major who is thinking about switching to another major. I'm already planning to talk with my advisor but I was hoping to get some additional info they may not be able to provide and some extra opinions wouldn't hurt. So I was originally really into the idea of management but as I ventured more into business courses and explored other things I began to sort of drift away from it. My questions:

1. I feel like my best move would be to do something involving technology. Math doesn't particularly excite me though so I feel Engineering may not be the best fit for me. However, I have recently begun learning to code and so far I've quite liked it. Because of this strange circumstance I've been looking into IT and it seems to hit all my buttons; involves technology, isn't brutally math-intensive, plenty of high-paying jobs for it (if I selected this I would probs be a Security Analyst) and just seems to be a nice fit for me. For anybody in IT, how do you enjoy your major? Is there any regrets or something you wish you knew before going into it?
2. I'm pretty set on doing something involving technology, I'm not married to IT. Are there any other technology-dominated majors I should look into? I'm particularly fond of computer hardware and enjoy working with it. 
3. I would hate to see the business courses I've taken so far to be for nothing, so I've been given the advice that I perhaps want to make business my minor while I make something technology my major, or vice versa! Could this be a good idea, or is the very idea ridiculous? 
4. Finally, I've also been advised that perhaps I want to dip my toes in something IT or Engineering or technology otherwise before switching anything. What entry classes give me a good idea that I would like a certain technology field?

Emergency Foster for our Cat,"Hi everyone! 

My roommate and I are in a bit of a difficult situation. We have had an emergency situation arise, and we have to make sure our cat is taken care of while we deal with everything. We had originally planned to board our cat for a week and then everything would be figured out- but some additional unforeseen circumstances mean that we will need about two more weeks without our cat to make sure everything is figured out and she can come home to a safe and healthy environment. 

We live in the UCF and we are both students at UCF, but we do not live on campus. We are looking for someone who would be interested in fostering for about two weeks, from about 12/31-1/8. We can provide all the necessary materials that she needs (food, litter, bed, toys). She is a very sweet and cuddly cat, and she loves everyone. She climbs into laps and takes naps with us, and we know that she would probably love whoever fosters her for the two weeks. If you would like to see pictures of her, you can send me a message! She's very cute.

A strong alumni support system and information network is great for a school, as it will allow to continue supporting and helping our fellow knights long after we graduated from UCF.

math placement test,"im an incoming freshman (summer 21) and i read on UCF’s orientation page (for spring) that students are required to pay $10 on top of the orientation fee to take the math placement test

so, i don’t have any AP math credits that would potentially transfer, but this upcoming spring im dual enrolling MAC1105 (i understand this is a required course at UCF as well).

the financial aid office is on my last nerve,"Alright, so I really needed somewhere to rant so be prepared for a lot of grammar errors and what not.

Basically, since the semester started, I’ve been calling the financial aid office to check on the progress of when my aid is going to be dispursed. I’m a transfer student so I’m used to receiving my aid within a week or two after classes start. 

I’ve called their office at least four times this month and spoken to numerous people about my aid and when it’ll be arriving because I live in Orlando all by myself and I’m heavily dependent on my aid to pay for my rent. I called last week on Tuesday and asked why I haven’t received my aid yet since I need to pay for books for my classes still and the staff member I spoke to on the phone said that I’d be receiving my aid within that week.

Well, I didn’t :)

So,  I called again today and waited an hour and a half on the phone to speak with someone. When I finally connected with someone from their office, they put me on hold for another ten minutes before telling me that there’s a hold on my account preventing me from receiving my aid. I said that’s impossible because I submitted and completed all of the necessary information to be able to get my aid in time AND I had been calling for weeks and no one had told me about this “hold”. The staff member basically told me there was nothing they could do and I had to speak to the Office of Admissions. I asked if hypothetically I were to get this “hold” removed how long it would take to get my aid, they just responded with “6-8 weeks” as if that were perfectly reasonable. They didn’t even explain to me what this mysterious hold on my account was. 

So, calmly, I called the admissions office and was told by a “counselor” or whatever, that there’s some hold and they can’t do anything about it or explain to me what it is but I have to reach out to another department within the admissions office that I don’t even remember the name of.

I’m so tired of this nonsense that I kinda just want to drop out for the semester and wait until Spring to start classes again but if I do that, I’ll have to pay back my Bright Futures which I obviously don’t have the money for.

I’m going to call again in the morning to find out what exactly this “hold” is that’s basically being hidden from me and preventing me from getting my financial aid but I honestly don’t know what the hell I’m going to do.",1600833155,1,0

Online Volunteer Opportunity! Make a difference! :),"Hey everyone! Recently, I became an online tutor for an volunteer organization that provides free, high-quality tutoring to K-12 students. It's a fun way to give back to the community and it's super flexible. I reached out to a lot of college students recently and many of them were interested. So now I want to extend this opportunity to all the other incredible schools out there. :)

If any of you are interested in becoming a volunteer tutor, comment down below/message me for info.

Some perks of being a tutor include volunteer hour certificates, awards, a personalized letter of rec, and most of all you're making a difference!

Like make your own tests dude or let us study with the product we paid $70 for. That’s literally how I study, and he didn’t even give us a study guide or anything. There used to be a whole cheat sheet you were allowed to use on the exam and a review test. 

There isn’t any kind of feedback on how to do problems so like if I was confused in class on how to do something then I’m just kinda stuck.

Also he “doesn’t do attendance” but has 5 question quizzes you can only access from class. That you get ONE MINUTE for, until we complained and now we get THREE MINUTES. It takes my laptop 30 seconds to load.

How is UCF Managing Relationships Between Students and Non-Student Neighbors? Research Project Question,"Hi Knights!

I'm a student at UNC-Chapel Hill and I'm working on a consulting project for a business writing class.

As part of our research, my group and I are wanting to learn about how other colleges in the Southeast are dealing with this issue. So, to those of you at UCF, have you had to take any kind of training to learn about how to be a good neighbor? Have you had to learn about marginalized neighborhoods in Oviedo/Orlando? What is UCF doing to promote good will between students and non-student residents in these communities? Any other information you have to share on the topic would be appreciated!

1. The amount of time given for tests is so little that everyone ends up failing them because they have to rush.

2. “Zoom” sessions are actually pre-recorded lectures. And they’re painfully long and not helpful AT ALL. 

3. Pearson MyLab royally f*cking sucks and instead of creating their own content, professors just shove this onto students, make them pay for it so they can avoid assigning homework. Not only that, this homework has nothing to do with material on the tests.

Bright Futures (FAS) 24 Credit Hours,"I’m expected to get 10 credit hours this semester and planned on taking 14 credit hours in the Spring by taking an extra 1-credit course (yoga).

To make sure, I emailed OSFA and they also said BF works differently and it is okay to be part time so I will not need to make it up with taking an extra course like yoga.

Downside to online learning,"I'm not sure if anyone else has this problem, but has anyone noticed that 'online learning' translates to 'teach yourself'?

Some professors offer no teaching material, videos, demonstrations, or tutorials of any kind. You're assigned a e-textbook and expected to teach yourself enough material in hopes that it will be sufficient enough to pass. Your success is contingent on googling not only the right material, but enough of it to sufficiently teach yourself enough to pass. I'm doing the professors job at this point, and I'm not even sure why I'm paying UCF, because everything I'm doing, I can do myself, for free. I don't need to pay UCF thousands of dollars when I can sit on Google/YouTube/Khan academy and teach myself. Hell, at this rate I'll even be printing my own degree. It's very frustrating. I spend 12+ hours a day scouring the internet for material to teach myself. I have no contact with other classmates and the professors are already very busy with their other careers (most dont work at UCF full time) and they don't care nor do they respond to pleas for help.

FSAG cancelled?,"Hi everyone. I was just curious if anyone has ever had their FSAG canceled in the middle of a semester. It just happened to me, and I have no idea why. And not only that, but now I’m supposed to repay the one I already received for the fall. I’ve already spent it though- on luxuries like eating and having a roof over my head. So now I’m short $1k for the next semester and also owe UCF $1k for this one. 

I’m meeting SAP, doing everything I’m supposed to be doing, making good grades, etc. I just don’t understand this. And of course no reason was given to me either. I love UCF but the financial aid office is a raging dumpster fire! I had problems with them the last semester too, through no fault of my own. There’s nothing like having to spend every semester constantly dealing with the financial aid office. I am depressed beyond belief at this point, and feeling totally hopeless. And of course trying to call them is a massive joke too.

Anyway... I was just wondering if anything like this has ever happened to anyone else on here. I thought it might make me feel better to know that I’m not alone at least. 😢",1601996237,1,0

So, in one of my classes right now I'm working on a story about how the financial aid office has failed to help students effectively during the pandemic.

If anyone reading this has had struggles with financial aid this semester and is open to being interviewed later in the week, please send me a dm or leave a comment here. 

Just a warning, this is for a broadcast journalism class. So if you are uncomfortable being on camera,  then that might be something  to consider before agreeing to an interview.

If you decide to vote by mail, you should send in your ballot as soon as possible. With everything that's going on with the postal service, don't risk mailing it too late and not having your ballot arrive on time. If possible, you should hand-deliver your ballot to a drop box location. Check with your local elections office to confirm if this is available where you live.

You can apply for a mail-in (absentee) ballot here: [https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/supervisors/](https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/supervisors/)

Concerned about Financial Aid shortfall,"So I have a concern about a what if scenario about financial aid for freshman year of next year. I knew a guy who applied to UCF in the past but chose another state school due to concerns about finances.

## 2014 Financial Aid Package
* Pell Grant: $4,100
* UCF Grant: $1,200
* Stafford Loan (Subsidized): $3,500
* Stafford Loan(Unsubsidized): $2,000

Basically, the guy told me that some finanical aid rep said to him that his mom would need to take out a private student loan or a PLUS loan of about $6,700 for him. He ultimately withdrew his admission to UCF because he did not want to be ""saddled for life"".

We Deserved To Lose That Game.,"Listen - I want UCF to make a run, go undefeated again, show everyone that we’re a powerhouse, and make a hell of a memorable season during all this craziness in the world...

...but that’s just not the way to do it. Just an absolutely unacceptable amount of penalties coming from our line (consistently), and that stunt with throwing the Tulsa player’s helmet was just plain stupid. The kind of behavior our team displayed tonight will carry in the minds of P5 teams for the rest of the season as to why we don’t deserve to be competitively ranked. Players need to be benched or HEAVILY corrected if we’re going to avoid living up to the stereotype that every establishment school has of us. If we want to be taken seriously, we have to act like it and not make the same mistakes over and over. 

Rant over. I’m not saying we deserved to lose that game, but I hope it will be a serious kick in the pants for our team that some corrections need to be made if we are to remain relevant.",1601784035,1,0

No loan disbursement,"Yeah, just like everyone else I've been waiting on my FAFSA loan and haven't received it. Yesterday I wasn't even able to get on hold with FinAid and read a few things about late fees being waived or people getting extra long updated deadlines so I didn't worry about it and now I have a hold and a late fee.

A week ago I actually managed to call FinAid, and was told that I did everything right, and I was just waiting on the school to disburse it. She told me disbursements were on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and if I didn't get mine by my deadline, ID GET AN EXTENDED DEADLINE. I clarified this and asked her if so by October 30th I didn't get it it would be extended until whenever I got it, and she said yes. 

Is this going to prevent me from enrolling? No one answers questions in a timely manner. Who else can I contact? Do I just try to find a private loan in the next few days (I don't have a cosigner so don't know what to do there)?

I would graduate in 2023 instead of 2024 if I switched to computer science, but I have absolutely no knowledge of computer science whatsoever. I basically just chose aerospace because I like math and I like space, so if I could save some money doing 1 less year of school, I'll take the opportunity.

I've heard that computer science programs usually aren't beginner friendly. I did code academy in like 7th grade lol and I really enjoyed it, so I think I'd have a good time doing computer science as a career.

I had a great internship with IBM over the summer and was eventually offered a return internship that is to start in January. 

UCF still hasn’t dispersed my loans and pell grant. And it’s not like I can get ahold of the finaid office to ask them about it. While UCF has said they won’t drop my classes, they said they will charge me $100 for not paying my tuition. But I can’t register for classes. If I can’t register for classes, my job with IBM that starts in January might not allow me to work for them because I’m not a student.

My housing development has threatened to evict me if I can’t  pay my rent by mid-November . 

I’m at my wits end and don’t know what to do. I have no where else to go and I can’t qualify for outside loans on my own and my parents won’t co-sign.",1604103643,1,0

Parking ticket for PARKING BACKWARDS?!?!?!?!?,"How is this even legal? I seriously got a ticket for parking backwards because apparently it's ""unsafe"" to do so. Have you ever tried parking a truck into a tight parking space forward? Exactly, it's impossible. It's literally 10 times safer to park in backwards considering there are cameras in most (that includes mine). How can something like this be legal? Does anyone know where I can file a complaint or possibly dispute something like this? I have let UCF bs their way into my wallet many times, but I refuse to pay for bs like this. If we ever come back to normalcy and I will have to park in rush hour, I guess I'll just have to walk from my house because there is no way I can park a big truck pulling in forward in a tight space",1604100313,1,0

1. How much work (he, busywork, etc) is the class?
2. How hard are the exams, and are they fair?
3. Is the class well organized?
4. How much work would a person with a decent physics understanding have to put in to get an A in the class?

Did anyone apply through Common App? I'm sort of lost on this application....,"I'm trying to apply to UCF through the Common App.  Looking through the FAQ on their website, it says:

&gt;Although optional, an essay assists the Admissions Committee in knowing you as an individual, independent of test scores and other objective data. We ask that you respond to two of the topics below. Your responses should be no longer than a total of 500 words or 7,000 characters.  
&gt;  
&gt;1. If there has been some obstacle or bump in the road in your academic or personal life,   
please explain the circumstances.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. How has your family history, culture or environment influenced who you are?  
&gt;  
&gt;3. Why did you choose to apply to UCF?  
&gt;  
&gt;4. What qualities or unique characteristics do you possess that will allow you to contribute to the UCF community?

...but there's nowhere to write these essays on the Common App?  They have a why UCF prompt, a why major prompt, and something to talk about one club.  The word limits are also completely different and Common App has no character limit.  I'm completely confused about that.

It also says:

&gt;The application for admission provides space for a listing of extra and co-curricular activities; this portion of the application should be completed in lieu of submitting supplemental materials.  
The essay is an optional component of the application for admission. If you elect to submit an essay, please select a topic within the application form and submit it within your completed application.  
Supplemental materials – including essays – sent after application submission will not be included in your admission file.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities or work experiences.

I already have a list of activities as part of the normal Common App.  Are they saying this essay is recommended only if you *don't* have that?  Or is it recommended anyway?  I know it's optional but I want to get into the honors program so I don't want to do anything silly, but also from my understanding I apparently need to apply really soon because even though it's rolling, scholarships/honors will just like fill up over time (I think?) and then admissions gets way harder.

I might be the only one confused by all of this but can anyone please help?  I'm really in a rush right now because I didn't realize there was an incentive to applying early and I'm just totally lost on all of this.  UCF seems like a great school and I don't want to miss out on opportunities because I'm too incompetent to figure out how an application works, so I would really appreciate if anyone can help here.",1604075784,1,0

I seriously can't take this school anymore,"I wanted to love UCF, I really did. I'm currently a sophomore and I feel like I can't do my best in this school anymore.

After endless attempts of calling and staying on hold for hours only to be hung up on, I finally was told that I should be getting my disbursement soon. They still say it will take two weeks though. My rent is due soon, and so is tuition. I can't go into the office because no one is there. I can't even take out a loan because my verification is ""still pending."" I understand that covid has made things difficult, but I had this same problem with last year's aid too. I really just can't take how impersonal this school is sometimes.

BAS in Computer Information Technology questions?,"Hello all,

I've been working in the Hospitality Industry for several years, and graduated from Valencia in 2016 with my associates in Computer Information Technology. While I really enjoyed the courses I took at Valencia, minus programming (unfortunately, not a giant fan) and had aspirations of becoming a Network Admin, I was able to land a lucrative field in my current industry, and declined to pursue my education further.

And then, Covid came along. While I still am in my current role, I have realized this may not work out, plus I think it is imperative to have back up plan. Hence, my interest in going back to finish my Bachelors. 

I have to admit I am nervous as I have forgotten a lot of what I learned. I can say career wise, I know my disinterest in programming may hurt, but I am very interested in the Network side of things. I was preparing to get my Comp Tia in Net+ Sci+ before I decided to stop my studies.

Does anyone do IT-related entry-level work virtually while studying at UCF full-time?,"Hi all! I hope everyone is having a nice break so far! 

I have to admit, this semester has been pretty mentally draining and I've yet to find a scholarship or work related to my major. So currently I've been applying for places to work while studying full-time next semester. This is a big priority for me because I really need the experience. My class load for next semester is pretty doable, since two of my classes are core IT classes and passing those should allow me to get internship credit in the summer (Object Oriented Programming and Discrete Math). The third class is an easy IT class, and the two other things are just mandatory IT degree things. So I'm trying to look for virtual work, since most are virtual due to the pandemic and is convenient as I have a home office room. I hope to find entry-level IT work like Help Desk Tier 1. I'm not sure of other virtual positions I should be looking for with my limited IT experience, as I did change major from Marketing to IT and am new to all of this. I've heard of sites like [RatRaceRebellion.com](https://RatRaceRebellion.com) and [WeWorkRemotely.com](https://WeWorkRemotely.com). I also used the UCF Handshake site but it's pretty limited. To be honest, I'm confused as to where to start. I did edit my resume but it has more educational/project experience listed, and I have applied for internships/jobs with no update yet. I do have an IT internship for the summer, it's just that I'm waiting on the next step for that process and would like something to do to help me gain *more* experience before it happens.

Hi I'm New,"(""Hi New, I'm dad"")

Anyways. I'm a transfer student who's planning on coming in the Spring. I'm talking to a financial aid advisor today and then after, probably going to try and finalize my housing plans. I'm also a dum-dum who forgot where the ""pre-orientation to-do list"" even is, or maybe that's just nerves talking. 

Although in regards to housing plans, I don't know if its better to get a dorm or to live off-campus yet. That's spooky. I'm 21 and don't (yet) drive. I saw that there's info on the reddit so I guess I'll go there too.

I'm also looking for new friends. Folks to chat with on, say, discord or something so I can get the hang of this ""moving out of home"" situation. I'm interested in STEM and art, I'm LGBT+, and I already see some discords for that sort of thing, but is there anywhere else I can go?",1606922787,1,0
Was your advisor kind of... rude?,"I’m taking one of those “career advising” courses and recently had a meeting with an advisor.

One of the things you have to do in that class is plan how you are going to navigate your classes until graduation.

So I did that and during our meeting she said that it looked unrealistic(?) because some semesters I put that I’d only take one class. In the moment I was kind of taken back so I just auto-agreed to everything she was saying...
But I did that because two of my classes are rough. She told me to set up my final draft of this plan as 3 classes, off, 3 classes. And do that for two years.... but isn’t this *my plan?* 

Like okay I’ll do it for the “Satisfactory” but I know it won’t go down like that at all. 

Also, she asked me why I wanted to major in this field and I replied something like “I was just introduced to it and was immediately interested in it. Before that I never thought that someone like me ever had a chance doing something so complex. And besides, I like puzzles. I think they correlate.” Her responded with,” ookayy.” But as if what I said was weird. It kinda made me rethink everything honestly. 

I don’t know. 

I just felt like I was supposed to come out of that meeting feeling like I have a well established plan but I just feel judged.",1606921396,1,0
Tuition for 2021 Spring and Financial Aid Disbursement,"Hello everyone. So, I checked my account today and found out that, apparently, ucf made an invoice so I can pay for my tuition immediately and forget about it... However, I can't fully understand how financial aid is disbursed... AFAIK, the total price is without applying all grants that I allegedly accepted. Thus, do I need to pay a ""full price"" and then wait for disbursement or there is a specific date when they will reevaluate my total automatically  with inclusion of grants? My charges and find.aid. screenshots [can be found here](https://imgur.com/a/A0HRzRp).

P.S. I would have asked fin aid office about this stuff but the speed with which they answer is so fast that, I believe, I would had to wait until the end of the January to hear anything from them, which isn't their fault... They, most likely, doesn't have enough personnel to answer everyone in a timely manner.",1606919355,1,0

A Guide to UCF Basketball Attendance 2020,"The games for this season are limited capacity and the arena is still promoting social distancing + masks. This guide is for some of the things UCF ISN’T telling you about attending the games this season. 

•after scanning your ticket, someone is going to mark your hand with a black Sharpie. (The only reason this is on the list is cause it seems kinda unhygienic to mark person after person on the part of your body that is more likely to transmit germs.)

•If you plan on sitting with a group of more than 3-4 people, they will separate you unless you fit within the social distance tape. Plan your larger group seating accordingly. 

•students are closed off to other areas of the arena. You must stay within the parameters of the student section, including the hallways of the student sections. There is no venturing around the arena in its entirety. You can’t even attempt to move past the roped areas as there is someone standing there telling you you can’t. 

•you only have ONE option for food. Even though there are several food places inside the arena, students are limited to (what I like to call) the Disney equivalent of quick service (hot dogs, popcorn, nachos, candy, pop/soda, and water). The other food places appear to be open, just not for students. 

•since the knights are abiding by NCAA guidelines, there is no player interaction this season

“Unfair” Orgo Professor,"So I should start off by saying that I’m taking this course, Organic chemistry 1, transient at a state college near me. This is because I couldn’t get into orgo 1 at UCF and if I didn’t, graduation would get pushed back blah blah blah.

Even tho this doesn’t really apply to a professor at UCF, I feel like some of you might give me insight on how to deal with this class. I so far have a low A in the class, mainly because i REALLY love organic chemistry and find the concepts to come easily to me. My professor is honestly an amazing lecturer and he takes time to really explain concepts in detail and help you if you’re struggling. Even tho this orgo class is at a state college, it’s pretty rigorous because of the material and because of the way my professor has this class laid out. We have a test EVERY SINGLE WEEK on a new chapter of information. These tests are 10 questions long, no room for error. I honestly don’t mind them terribly. They allow me to keep track of learning the new material and study everyday, without exception. 

However, this professor really fucking sucks at adapting in person exams to online version exams. Don’t get me wrong, I cant even imagine how hard it is on his end to get orgo exams to shift to online. But as a student it’s honestly frustrating that I know the material so well and invest so much time into the class, only to find that Im at a borderline A and will possibly get a B because of his exam style. The last test that I didn’t do too well on, I had the right work written down and answer I wanted to select. The reason I did so terribly on this exam was because all of the answer choices on respondus merged together and I really couldn’t tell which was the correct one. That hurt my grade a lot and I spoke to him and he said he’ll fix it but won’t help my grade out. Cool. We had an exam last week where the answers left out a very simple detail that I had written on my own scrap paper, but the answers had so many options (none of the above, all of the above, more than one correct, A and D) that i didn’t think the detail was a big deal and chose the wrong answer. This has cost me to the point where I need to get above a 90 on each upcoming test in order to get an A in the class.

Do you see where I’m getting at here? It’s unbelievable that I spent hours studying orgo not only for the grade but because I throughly enjoy it, only to find that my grade will suffer because my professors poor exams. I tried asking him about this and his response was that our class is a “guinea pig class” and therefore he’ll learn for next semester, which. I think isn’t fair.

UCF application question about the essay portion (I'm so confused),"I wrote two 500 word essays to two different prompts, is that ok? The instructions are very confusing I read it as each prompt can get no more that 500 word responses and the total characters between both responses can't be more than 7000. However someone recently said that I need to do two 250 word essays that total up to 500 words instead. But if that's true than why do they even mention 7000 characters to begin with?",1600310054,1,0

Easy Money for Smarties," 

TLDR: Need an in person tutor for a college level chem 1 course, in person, in the College Park area of Orlando. (Would follow CDC guidelines)

I am a student and run a tutoring business across Florida called Subject Saviors. We recently hit a spike in customers and need an in person tutor for the Orlando area. I am currently looking for a college who would be comfortable tutoring in person while following CDC guidelines in chem 1. Ideally they would also be comfortable tutoring math, physics, or higher levels of chemistry both in person and online.

The pay is $18 an hour and the hours are very flexible.

You can check out the website [https://subjectsaviors.com/](https://subjectsaviors.com/) and PM me if you are interested in applying.",1600302612,1,0

Help a fellow Knight protect our conservation lands!," 

Hello all! Mark Meta for Soil and Water District 5 here. As a life long citizen of Orlando and Central Florida, I just want to remind you to vote against building a toll road through Split Oak Forest. As our state booms in population (600k a year), we must protect our conservation lands at all costs. I am the only candidate in my race that will use my influence once elected to protect these lands. As a public administrator and an educator, I will make sure all the county stakeholder's voices are heard. If you want to learn more about me, Google Mark Meta and my socials/Ballotpedia profile will pop up.

See you all on November 3rd! Go Knights!",1600294052,1,0
Question in regards to MAC 2311C,"Hello there,

Thanks for stopping by. Is MAC 2417 considered a pre-req for MAC 2311C? I was wondering if I can take MAC 2147 alone rather than taking trig and pre calc separately so that I could fulfill the pre-reqs for MAC 2311. However, I do not know if taking (and passing) MAC 2147 would fulfill the pre-reqs to take MAC 2311C.

I also looked up the pre-reqs for MAC 2311C, but I was confused  what ""combination of appropriate score on the UCF Math Placement Exam and “C” (2.0) or better in MAC 1114 or [**MAC 1140C**](https://catalog.ucf.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=2&amp;coid=4631) , or [**MAC 2147**](https://catalog.ucf.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=2&amp;coid=4632)**""** meant. (Also, I passed all MPTs, but I finished the trig and precalc MPT 4 days before the fall semester, so I couldn't sign up for a math class in time. Yeah, it was a stupid move.)

Again, thanks for stopping by and helping me out.",1600292115,1,0
