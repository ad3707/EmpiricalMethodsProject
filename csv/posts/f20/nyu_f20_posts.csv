Stern Tech MBA?,"Hi r/nyu,

I'm a PhD student in Tandon CBE and I came across the 1 year Tech MBA offered at Stern. Is there anyone in this program right now that might be able to give me some info?

Specifically, I am wondering if it is at all feasible to manage doing it concurrently with a PhD or if I would have to do it separately. Do you have courses all day or is it a few courses and mostly project-based? I could manage my time around a project, but if I had to be in class 9-5 it would be hard to get lab work done.

Is there anyone in the department that I could contact? I sent an email to Stern MBA admissions to ask about this but in my experience reaching out to individual administrators (especially if you know them to be nice and helpful) tends to yield better results.

Thanks!",1601996855,1,0
"NYU RETURNS The New York State Positive Case Threshold for Colleges, and Continuing on as We Are for Now","In late August, New York State set thresholds for temporary suspension of in-person classes (PDF). For NYU's Washington Square location, that number is 100 within a 14-day period. Even though our case positivity rate remains low — roughly 0.5% — as you can see from our dashboard, we are approaching that number.  


Accordingly, we have been in touch with NYS authorities. Based on our overall conditions — primarily our low positivity rate, which is significantly lower than the area surrounding the school, and the robust program of testing — the State has advised that at this point we should continue to carry on as we have been, and do not at this point have to pivot to remote instruction. Schools, units, and individual faculty members should not independently make changes in instruction or other operations.


We will remain closely in touch with the State, and will, of course, follow any guidance and promptly relay directives about any changes from our current course. If there is a change, you will hear from the COVID-19 Prevention &amp; Response Team, the Provost's Office, or your dean's office with specifics about what changes are to be put in place.  


If a transition to remote learning becomes necessary at some point, we want it to be smooth and orderly. So, while we continue to move forward as we have been, it is nonetheless prudent for schools and individual faculty to be thinking ahead about how they would respond to a transition to remote instruction. 


Thanks. Take care. Be well. We will be in touch again soon.",1601991478,1,0
Email today from Provost re: COVID,"""We have been in touch with NYS authorities. Based on our overall conditions — primarily our low positivity rate, which is significantly lower than the area surrounding the school, and the robust program of testing — the State has advised that at this point we should continue to carry on as we have been, and do not at this point have to pivot to remote instruction.""

The email goes on to say, of course, that if numbers continue to rise and the state changes their mind, they hope to have an orderly transition to remote learning. 

What are your thoughts on this announcement? Does it ease your mind or does it just make you more anxious? 

Personally I still think it's likely that a directive will be issued eventually which forces at least part of NYU into remote learning, so this just kind of feels like delaying the inevitable. 🤷‍♂️",1601991368,1,0

Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We  don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the  anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's  applications

Good luck!",1601899217,1,0

"PU letters for NYUSH students to be issued, freeze on student visas has been lifted for NYUSH students","Lehman just sent out the following email:

&gt;Dear Members of the NYU Shanghai Community,  
&gt;  
&gt;We write now to share some good news.  
We have now learned that the approval process has been completed with regard to visa issuances for international students. Thanks to truly extraordinary efforts by the governments of the Pudong District and Shanghai City, as well as the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NYU Shanghai has been given an “exemption” from the prevailing freeze on the issuance of student visas, so that we may bring our international students to China  
We are especially happy to note that this exemption applies to both students in Group 1B and students in Group 2. There will not be any gap between the transition of entering first-year students to Shanghai and the return of upper-year students.  
Now that it has been granted, this exemption must be implemented through a set of procedures that begin with the issuance of Invitation Letters. These procedures will be set in motion by the authorities at the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office once they return from their National Day and Mid-Autumn break, which lasts through October 8. Each of the hundreds of invitation letters must be produced individually in accordance with an exacting process. We expect all the invitation letters to be issued during the week of October 12. We appreciate your continued patience and understanding while these procedures are completed.  
This Friday, October 9th, Dean Pe will be sending our returning international students a full set of instructions on the steps that must be taken to transform Invitation Letters into new visas as smoothly as possible. Even before receiving Dean Pe’s instructions, returning students can begin to prepare in the following ways:   
  
&gt;  
&gt;1) Identify the location of the Chinese embassy or consulate within your geographical jurisdiction;   
2) Visit your embassy or consulate’s website and review the requirements for submitting an application for the issuance of a visa;   
3) Identify possible COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing facilities near you that have the capacity to administer a test and provide results within a short window (we expect that you will need to have taken a nucleic acid test within 72 hours before you board your flight and to have had the negative results of that test certified by your embassy or consulate); and  
4) Explore flight options and possible dates of travel.   
&gt;  
&gt;By doing this preparatory work, students can help to ensure that their entry into China proceeds in as orderly a manner as possible. (Please note that it is still premature to focus on the topics of quarantine and university housing; those matters can be addressed once a visa is secured.) If you have immediate questions, you can email Dean Pe at \[(his email)\].   
We Are Shanghai!

I've been doing terrible so far this semester and I have a midterm on Monday. If my laptop isn't fixed by then idk what to do.",1601656715,1,0

international student,"hello! may i know if i have a chance to be admitted to nyu. i am applying ed1 which is due on nov 1. here are my stats:

gpa: we do not use 4.0 scale in the philippines. i have 92 average from grade9-12. i got a 94 on my senior year. also, the system in our country is different, i took 8 classes per sem since grade 11 so in total, i took 32 classes in just two years with mostly A’s. by mean of A is at least 90%
i haven’t known my rank but i think i’m in top 15%  in 300 students.

sat: nyu is test-optional and the earliest date i can take is in dec.

aid: i’m an international student, i am not applying for any aid, i’m set to pay it full if i get accepted, does not applying aid raise my chances of getting admitted?

ecs: 
• 80 hrs unpaid internship in a real estate company
• math quiz bee finalist
• 2x bronze in intramural sports (volleyball )
•cadet certificate (actp)

essay: i’m good at writing essay and i’m confident at my grammar too.

i’m really good at math, i’m applying to nyu stern and looking forward for their dual degree program in accounting. i also consider liberal arts core just in case nyu put me there if i don’t get accepted to my primary choice which is  stern.",1601632428,1,0

Stern Transfer Question,"Hello! I am super interested in Stern. 

I currently hate everything about my current school. So, I would like to transfer as early as possible. 

Should I transfer now into the Spring 2021 term and then attempt to internally transfer into Stern for Fall 2021? 

Or, should I stay at my current school during this Spring &amp; attempt to transfer externally/directly into Stern during Fall 2021? 

I know it’s super hard to get in, I’m just wondering in advance. Thanks!",1601605679,1,0

Rant about CAS CS and the career fair,"Is it just me or does the CAS CS department does not actually care about its students? 

They seem to have no initiative, especially when it comes to employment opportunities and trying to get employers to come. Meanwhile, the Tandon CS career fair is not open to CAS and they get most of the tech employers. The chair of the department and other top people just don't seem to care. **They should never have allowed this to happen.** 

I do not think Professor Denis Zorin(the chair) nor the chair of the undergraduate dept has the slightest idea as to what happens here. Zorin's office is literally 10 blocks away from warren waver hall at 60 5th ave, away from the ""mess"" so he does not have to see. 

Also, what was that joke of a ""career fair""?  It hardly even qualifies as a joke. I get that this is during COVID and all but how did the Tandon career fair(to which CAS is not allowed in) get so many employers? 

I guess any prospective CS students should just go to Tandon, at least they will get to talk to someone in their fairs.

I was extremely lucky to get a summer internship for this summer, no thanks to NYU. Now I am worried about the next. (I have a return offer but do not really want to go back.) Meanwhile, people at other universities have a leg up because they actually have some competent administrators running things.",1601603581,1,0

When will classes be posted on Albert for next semester?,"im coming up on my final semester, and Im graduating early so my schedule is suuuper strict. normally they have it on the academic calendar when classes will be posted, but they don't have the date anywhere yet. im paranoid and forgot to plan properly this semester so I just wanna know when i can see course options lol

has anyone heard about when courses will be posted?? would it be strange to email a professor and ask if they think a course theyve taught in past spring semesters will be available??",1601589540,1,0

"[RANT] Why the ""step-motherly"" treatment towards grad students?","Why doesn't NYU (and most universities) allow grad students to join clubs and organizations (including greek life) as a **committee member**? 

I am aiming to join student organizations (except the student association) because I want to have something other than just academics on my resume, especially since I will be applying to deferred MBA programs next year. I wanted to join the **Strategic Venture Society's venture team** and was really looking forward to it. But then I got to know that only undergrads can join (scream induced with tremendous rage). 

I am an HBS aspirant and as everyone knows, that school expects the sun and stars from every damn applicant. I highly doubt I will get in solely on my grades, work experience and the GMAT. 

Some people might say, ""that is not the point of the master's program"". Forgive me, but I think that **the students should be the ones to decide what the ""point"" of their own education is**. I know that there are things outside the university's purview that we can do but considering the fact that I am an international student, a lot of limitations exist. Some people have also said that I shouldn't even aim to join these clubs because I will have to answer to undergrads (As if that is even a problem). 

The only genuine argument that I have ever heard is that graduate programs are more intense and thus there are severe time constraints. However, **whether they can or cannot devote time should be left to the students to decide**. Personally, I am able to complete all my assignments and projects ahead of time and yet I can't join which is simply unreasonable. 

I know that NYU isn't the only university that has these rules but hey, nobody forced the univeristy to be like the others and it can always choose to be different than the norm.",1601582470,1,0

NYU Therapy/Psychiatrist ?,"Okay so I was just informed NYU had their own psychiatrists, I had no idea! Does anyone know more about this? For context, I’m someone who has struggled with mental health problems for years but hasn’t been officially diagnosed because my parents don’t believe me when I tell them I think I struggle with mental health and would rather ignore my issues. I know my problems are real and to be honest I just want to finally be okay. My problems make school a lot harder and I truly think my life would be so much better if I could just talk to someone. If I do speak to someone and they recommend medication will my parents have to know? I’m asking because they without a doubt would not want me taking any form of medication. For further info I am not on NYU’s Insurance plan but I have one of my own (i think it’s under my dad’s plan). Medication is most likely is the best option for me, but I know I cannot get it if my parents were to be notified. Sorry for the weird question, any help at all is appreciated.",1600925370,1,0
Calc 1 midterm,"With the calc 1 midterm in less than a week, I’m definitely nervous/anxious considering this is my first ever midterm.

Does anyone have any recommendations for how to best prepare? Or does anyone have any study guides/practice exams?

Undergraduate research opportunities in mathematics,"I'm currently a freshman math major at tandon wanting to quickly jump into math research or any math activities that are part of nyu but I'm having a hard time finding any.

I feel like there aren't a lot of math research opportunities for undergrads because you simply need to know a lot of advanced math in order to do any research that's meaningful. That's why I'm planning to take Calc 3 and Discrete Math in the summer, if that's possible, so  that I could then be able take Honors Analysis in my sophomore year.

Anonymous support app for college students,"Hey all! Former college alumnus of 2018 here (anonymous account). After dealing with anxiety my entire life where it became severe while in college, I decided to do something that I wish I had when I was desperately struggling in college.

I'm building a community-based app that gives college students a safe, anonymous place to share personal things in a supportive and open environment with others at your school. It will be social and will be focused on sharing the difficult things in life that can be so hard to share due to the social pressures of college.

I really hope to make a positive impact and help as many people as struggling silently and alone. I'm currently developing it and would love any and all feedback. 

If you could take a couple seconds to fill out this 8 question survey, it really would mean the world to me. Thank you so much! :)

should i apply for nyu's financial aid as an international student? will it disadvantage me in the application process?,"I'm an international student (singaporean) and applying for fall 2021. i was wondering if i should apply for nyu financial aid? my household income is in the low-middle income range and i was wondering if applying for financial aid will disadvantage me in any way since nyu isnt need blind for international students. 

if i choose not to apply for nyu financial aid i'll apply for external scholarships provided by various singapore government organisations and most of these cover full tuition fee for scholarship recipients. so i would prefer not to apply for nyu's financial aid if it would disadvantage me in getting in... nyu's financial aid likely wouldn't cover my full need anyway. 

thanks for the help :D",1600746271,1,0
Reddit’s Favorite Restaurants in the NYU area (an update),"A month and a half ago, a friend and I set out to put together a map of Redditors’ favorite restaurants (original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/i1ulhk/reddits_favorite_restaurants_in_the_nyu_area/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). 

After hours of coding and adding restaurants, there are now more than 400+ restaurants featured on the website, all thanks to the generous contributions of Redditors from r/AskNYC, r/Brooklyn, r/Bushwick, r/nyctakeout, and other subreddits. 

It’s no longer a map, but a feed of photos featuring food from nearby recommended restaurants and is meant to be something to help you discover new restaurants around you that also happen to come recommended. We’ll bring back the map in the near future. 

Enjoy!

"New Student, Very Confused","Hi,

I'm a freshman this year and I'm a STEM major in CAS and I'm so stressed out. It's only the third week of school but I feel like I'm so behind and that I don't understand the material. I'm worried this will keep piling up and I'll just fall behind. Online classes don't help because it's so hard to pay attention or find friends in a class. I literally have no friends in any of my classes and idk how to make them for when I need help with homework or anything since we're all online.

A short message for CS undergrads from a recent grad,"**Apply for every damn job/internship and do it early and often**, it doesn't matter if you're a Sophomore who just learned how to print 'Hello World' or a freshman who came in with a 5 on the CS AP who thinks they have time to do internships later (this was me). Don't put it off in order to play League or get high with your friends or whatever you do to pass time during COVID. 

I spent three years coasting when it came to internships and side projects because I thought my good grades would get me an internship and a job; when it came time to apply for post-junior year internships I got turned down by every single tech company I applied for and I realized I had completely mis-allocated my effort. I blew off prime recruiting season (around aug–nov) because I decided I'd rather be at the pub with my friends in London than filling out applications. It was the *worst feeling in the world* realizing that I basically threw away my time and severely harmed my career chances and there was nothing I could do about it. 

I ended up working a shitty internship at a corporate bank that had fuck all to do with coding and I spent all my time making excel macros so I could put on my resume that I coded something. I had a *miserable* full-time recruiting season grinding out applications and watching my peers—who were comparable coders to me but had much more experience under their belts—get job offer after job offer while I got ghosted and rejected. While my story has a happy ending I would never wish anyone to have to go through the stress and uncertainty and despair that I went through last fall. 

I'm not saying everybody should get into Google STEP their first year or be a returning intern at Facebook (but do apply!), just get any kind of experience on your resume starting freshman year so you can build your way up to landing a coveted internship your junior year and an even better full-time job afterwards. Anything that has you working with code is fair game, even if it's just writing CSS for a 3-person Wordpress shop in your hometown or grading for CS101. If you really enjoyed a class and did well then being a grader or TA is a *fantastic* way to load up your resume during the semester and is super easy to get into. Everybody starts somewhere, but it's much easier to work your way up during four years of college than to try to make a 10ft leap at the very end. 

Oh and if that's not motivating enough, many big tech internships pay $40/hr+ so you can finally afford to drink in NYC :)",1600724297,1,0

The Beauty of NYC Restaurants,"NYU alum here. 

I had ramen today. It came neatly packed - noodles and toppings separated, broth sealed tightly in a ziplock bag to prevent spillage. Every single little detail taken care of. 

This was ramen Ippudo, a restaurant that I first came across 7 years ago when I first visited NYC to look at colleges. I was intimidated back then by all the people in that restaurant, how different they were to me and how much more established and proper they seemed in comparison to my teenage self. 

And yet I remember feeling optimistic. That I too one day could be in a restaurant like that talking business with a client, having lunch with a friend, or simply enjoying my own company. I liked being in that restaurant - so full of life and in one of the greatest cities in the world. 

7 years later and I’m still optimistic. It’s been 8 months since I’ve been to a restaurant, but I know that beauty is still there in all the great restaurants that I’ve been to. Beauty in the people, in the food, in all the little details that these restaurants take care of so well and so pridefully. I know that eventually, I’ll get to go again, and enjoy that beauty with friends and lovers.

Difference between BPE and normal Stern BS? Applying ED1 to Stern and need Advice,"I'm applying ED1 to Stern but am conflicted whether to apply BPE or the normal BS program. If you're able to answer/elaborate on a couple of my questions below it'll be extremely helpful.

1. \*Do I risk my chance of getting into Stern by applying to BPE?\* IE, do they first accept me to Stern, and then accept me to BPE, or do they straight up reject me from BPE if my application isn't strong enough?
2. \*Is it harder in any way to get finance/wall st jobs if I do BPE compared to not doing BPE?\* Is it harder because I can't have a concentration in finance?
3. \*If I apply to regular Stern, are there some poli sci elective classes I can take that are similar in a way to BPE?\*
4. \*Is there a really heavy finance culture in normal Stern that I can't avoid, or are there a decent amount of people there that are chill (overall)?\*

For some more background information: Stern is 100% been my dream school, as I've become really interested in finance/consulting based jobs this summer. However, the reason I'm conflicted is because I'm heavily interested in politics and international relations as well. I'm not sure if I want to follow a career path in this, but I know for a fact that I would love my classes more if I took BPE. I also would be surrounded by more like minded people, because although I want to go into finance, I don't want to be surrounded by ""finance bros."" I just \*know\* that BPE will be a group of people I can connect with. However, all that being said, I just want to end up at Stern and don't want to risk being rejected because I applied BPE because then I know I'll regret it later.

Bottom line: I want to go into a career in finance, but the group of people in BPE and the classes sound more interesting in BPE. However, I'm sure that I can accommodate these aspects without BPE too, so I'm conflicted.  Help me out.",1600579373,1,0

"How is everyone's experience here so far? Do you foresee it being more ""normal"" by next semester, maybe 2 or more?","Hey guys,

I'm a prospective non-traditional student (took a lot of time off), looking to finish my undergrad degree at NYU. Before COVID or any of this ever happened, this was something I was planning for years and was really looking forward to it. It goes without saying we're living in unprecedented times and no one has a true idea of what the future holds. 

I've heard very mixed reviews - some positive musings about how NYC in general has a better handle on things due to the experience with the initial mania and that lot of people seem to take the social distancing and other safety measures seriously. On the flip side of the coin, I've also heard nasty takes of some students with a IDGAF mentality, how online classes are a pain to deal with, and how it's ""never going to be a true college experience ever again"". I realize, of course, accounts will vary depending on the background and context, but would still be interested if anyone currently attending (whether live or remotely) could shed some light. 

For me personally, I'm someone who's very cautious about the COVID presence but wouldn't consider myself overly paranoid. While I'm excited to get back into academics for personal reasons, I also relish for a second chance at the aforementioned ""college experience""; not so much the whole get hammered and party 24/7 part, but moreso about living on campus, forming camaraderie with other fellow students,  being a student, etc.

Any honest feedback (positive or negative) would be greatly appreciated! It would really help me gauge if it's worth applying for next semester or I wait and pursue some other projects before things really settle down with more certainty. Thanks in advance!",1600556055,1,0

The Rubin quarantine protocol is inconsistent with my quarantine experience. I’m annoyed at the COVID-19 response team,"For context, I’m the author of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/immvh3/self_reporting_is_prohibitively_inconvenient/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).

Long story short, I have to quarantine for 10 days despite having one negative rapid test and one negative laboratory test.

If you don’t already know, all of Rubin has to quarantine for 3 days, since 4 people tested positive for COVID-19. 3 days of quarantine isn’t enough time to actually isolate anyone who really has the virus, but is enough time to test those students and see whether their laboratory tests are positive or negative. Logically you would then continue to quarantine the positive cases and let out the negative ones, right?

Yeah that makes sense.

In my case, I had 2 negative results, one a laboratory one at Gould Plaza, and another at MinuteClinic as a rapid test. Despite having two negative tests, they still didn’t clear me for quarantine?

It’s just really frustrating and adds insult to injury that they’re being more stringent with me, someone who self reported a minor cough, hasn’t been in contact with anyone with a positive case, and as far as we currently know, no one in the building I’m staying at has a positive case, than they are with a building where there have been 4 positive cases, and 1 positive case last week. 

In my circumstance, they assumed both of my tests were false in order to be extra safe. If anything, it makes more sense for them to make that assumption for Rubin, a place that *actually has COVID-19.* 

There’s absolutely no consistency in NYU’s response! I’ve basically spent the last week in quarantine for no reason! 

I don’t mean to diminish what Rubin’s kids may be feeling. Quarantine sucks and I hope you guys hold up as best as possible during these 3 days. It’s just insulting that NYU’s response is so lackluster, inconsistent, and disregarding of people’s lives. 

At any rate, I’m getting out on Monday (9/14) so all of this will be behind me. But spending 24 days in quarantine is not a fun time at all, and I’m incredibly upset at the NYU administration that they treated me much worse than the other students who are in a much more serious situation.",1599960765,7,0
"""It’s Hard to Keep a College Safe From Covid, Even With Mass Testing""","Um so 

""According to the school(UIUC), some students ignored the requirement to isolate after testing positive, even going to and hosting parties, and tried to game the system, including repeatedly seeking out another test and trying to get around the school’s app, Safer Illinois, which shows a badge clearing students with negative results to enter school buildings and even some local bars. One student who posted a video on social media trying to show people how to hack that app is “facing discipline,” and about six have been suspended.

These actions, by only about a dozen students, paired with parties, drove the university’s surge in cases, administrators say. The vast majority of cases have been among undergrads, Burke says. “The problem is the math is brutal,” he says. Even a small number of people who willfully break rules “can cause an extraordinary amount of damage.”

If only I could meet someone who feels the way I feel about this song,"NYU alum here. 

When I transferred to NYU, I found it quite difficult to meet new people. I joined a lot of clubs, went to a lot of events, but honestly did not meet many with whom I could connect. So I spent a lot of time alone, either in Bobst or in my room. 

And whenever I was alone, I'd listen to all kinds of music that would make me feel nostalgic - about relationships I never had, memories of past events that never took place. Music also made me think about the future and at times fire me up. I would pay close attention to those emotions.

Sometimes, I'd wonder if there was someone else out there in my situation - not anti-social, but just not good in large groups. Interested more in plain conversation and simple things like grabbing coffee, going to the bookstore, going for walks in parks, and not parties and going out. Someone more interested in emotional authenticity. 

For some reason, I would never really meet these people, even after going to lots of club events. I guess they were just more comfortable with being on their own or just with one or two other close friends as was I. 

I think a lot of you are currently going through what I had to go through during my years at NYU so I decided to start r/musicmeets, a group for those of you who want to meet someone, a friend or maybe even a romantic partner, through music. 

Because it's hard to fake your emotional reactions to music. And finding someone who feels about a song the same emotions that you do may be a sign of emotional compatibility.",1599955458,13,0

How valuable is a degree from NYU?,"I'm considering going to NYU for either Law School and pursue Cybersecurity and Privacy Law or get a M.S. in Cybersecurity Risk Mangement and Strategy.

I do plan on getting some certs e.g. Security+ and the CIPP/US. 

I guess the thing that I'm most nervous about is studying law school is cold-calling and the bar exam. I'm not the brightest studious person as I find ways to bs my way through work.

Experience trying to receive counseling living outside New York,"Hey all, 

I just wanted to share my experience trying to get counseling as a student living on the West Coast at the moment. I stayed here because all my classes are remote anyway and it saves me money. I deal with panic attacks and anxiety and I thought, as a grad student starting this fall, I would take advantage of the free counseling services the school offers. 

First off, the people in the Student Health Center are great. The desk staff were helpful and thoughtful and the 10-15 minute phone interview to discuss my needs went really well and the psychologist I was speaking with has been nothing but helpful. 

The issue is that, because of beaurocracy, the student health center cannot offer me remote counseling. In my state, there are laws about Councelors licensed in other states so I am totally blocked off from help from the Student Health Center. 

Obviously this is not the Student Health Center's fault, and really not even NYU'S, but it is an important security blanket that I have lost due to COVID and other thing that I'm paying for at NYU that I won't be able to take advantage of. I'm bummed",1599777381,1,0

**Question:** 

I am exploring the possibility of transferring internally from CAS to Tandon BS in Computer Science program in my Sophomore year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know your thoughts on this and if: 

**1)** You think it is realistic and possible (I've heard that internal transfer acceptance rates are very low!)

**2)** You think it's worth it

&amp;#x200B;

Here are **my thoughts** that influenced my decision:

\- I would like to have an engineering school experience instead of a liberal arts experience. 

\- I would say the BS in CS program at Tandon is more rigorous than BA in CS at Courant, just from the courses required for both. 

\- I feel like there's better employment prospects with a Tandon engineering degree than one from a liberal arts school

\- It just feels like the environment at CAS is geared more towards arts instead of technology/engineering side. 

\- Extra curriculars and clubs at Tandon are way better, plus I would be surrounded by engineering majors instead of arts majors, which I believe is a big influence.

Help needed gathering syllabi!,"Hi y'all,

I am an Arizona State University currently doing my undergraduate honors thesis on Information Systems curricula across the country, and I would like to examine NYU SPS's Information Systems Management program in greater detail. 

As part of my research project, I would like to examine Information Systems Management syllabi in greater detail for all classes.

For the past couple of months, I've been trying to get in touch with SPS leadership and advising, but they haven't been responding to my emails at all. It's starting to get very frustrating since it feels as if I'm talking to a wall, and COVID has made my research project (which I got approved before COVID) close to impossible (considering every university's administration is running around with their hair on fire). 

Therefore, I was wondering if y'all knew any better way to get my hands on IS Management syllabi without individually contacting the instructors. With other universities, I have received a lot of pushback from instructors who aren't willing to share without department approval, and would like to avoid repeating that process.

Pass/Fail,"Is NYU considering adopting a modified pass/fail policy for major requirements this semester? If not, who do I talk to to ask admin to consider? As a remote student stuck at home, I thought I’d have all the time in the world to study and focus on my classes this semester, but the pressures and hardships of covid have still been negatively affecting my schoolwork just like the spring. I work three jobs to support my family, I don’t have a perfectly quiet background because my entire family is crammed under this one roof, and the time difference for my classes is awful. I thought professors of online classes were going to be more accommodating and considerate of the circumstances, but if anything, they seem to be acting like the global pandemic has stopped. My classes have almost zero leniency for technical issues, watching recorded lecture instead of attending live, or even something as simple as zoom fatigue. I understand that a lot of NYU students are well off and are operating completely fine under these circumstances, but I’m exhausted. I regret not taking a semester off so much. As schools around the country start to adopt new pass/fail policies for this Fall, I wish NYU would do the same. It would allow me to focus on the aspects of my education that actually matter instead of just counting points and weighing the importance of losing that .5 points off my grade for missing a class vs sleeping during my 4am lecture. Sorry if I sound like I’m just throwing a pity party for myself, I just needed to get it all out there. I understand the argument against pass/fail is that I knew what I was signing up for this semester, but truthfully, I don’t think I did. I didn’t expect my parents to lose their jobs this late into covid, I didn’t expect my city to go back into lockdown, I didn’t expect my professors to require more this semester than any previous one. NYU pretends like we’ve fully adjusted to remote classes, but I think we can all agree that we haven’t. I’ve already talked to my advisor and weighed my options with the current pass/fail policy, but with the tides turning at so many other schools I’m curious to see if it’s something we can get going here. Sorry again for if this post is negatively received, I really just wanted to rant and find a solution that could maybe benefit other students like me.",1602950591,1,0

I am really interested specifically in becoming a Game Environmental Artist, someone who works a lot in computer art programs such as Maya, ZBrush, Photoshop, etc. I realized that Tandon does not offer a lot of courses that will help me hone my skills and pursue this career, so I am considering applying for an internal transfer to Tisch at either their Game design major or IMA major (Interactive Media Arts). 

I am seeking for any general advice of what to do in my position from anyone studying currently in the field or have any knowledge, I have heard a lot of people on different threads say pursuing a Game design degree is not worth it and they push people just to get a minor in it. However, this type of curriculum (modeling) is something I can see myself have passion towards, but having little to no information revolving the field. 

I have a 3.8 GPA (everyone always references this so here it is) 

I appreciate any advice in advance. thanks!",1604035073,1,0
Quick Question about Testing Drop-Off,"I'm a commuter student at Tandon and head to campus two days a week (M/W). The weeks I'm scheduled to get tested, I  pick up my test on Monday and then activate the kit and complete the test on Wednesday. This week I only went to campus on Wednesday. I'm gonna be on the Washington Square campus tomorrow and it'd be easier to drop the kit off at Bobst.

Many other schools have done to try reduce the spread, but yall act like we’re the only ones in the world who have to deal with this. 

NYU made a lot of mistakes with handling the whole covid situation, but for the past few months they’ve done a lot better with testing and containment than a lot of other colleges.

Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We  don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the  anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's  applications

Good luck!",1603713611,1,0

I swear they are squeezing in 40 hours' worth of work in the 20 that I am allowed to work for and this has cost me potential internship offers (missed many application deadlines, couldn't prepare enough for the interviews). 

I am required by them to write a research paper but, there is **no formal contract that binds me to said condition**. So my question is that if I resign from the lab midway, is there a chance that I won't be able to work on campus anymore? My fear is that they might contact CIMS' HR department and say that I didn't honour the conditions of my employment.

Is it right to celebrate election 'results' now ?,"Recently, I've seen lots of people taking to the streets in NYC to celebrate Biden's winsince the election 'results'  came out on Saturday. I can totally understand how this seems like a cause for celebration in these hard times, but I feel like people are forgetting that there is still so much that needs to be sorted out before we can gain a sense of who the true winner is. Lots of states are currently conducting recounts of the votes while election data changes daily, not to mention Trump's pursuit in the Supreme Court claiming nationwide voter fraud.

so, I'm thinking of taking LOA....I don't really care if it means graduating a semester late but one thing that catches me up is Internal Transfer.

I'm tryna do Internal Transfer and the major I wanna go to only accepts Fall transfers, which means I gotta apply for it during Spring 2021.

Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We  don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the  anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's  applications

Sublet Available on 13th Street and 2nd Ave,"Hi All! I am subletting (landlord approved) my room in a 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment conveniently located a short walk from NYU, and just one block from Trader Joe's. The room is a true bedroom (NOT a flex room) and is $1,600 per month. 

The apartment has an updated kitchen/bathroom, dishwasher, in-unit washer and dryer, as well as an already furnished living room with a couch, TV, and rack right by the door for winter jackets and coats. The bedroom has a built in close with large drawers and shelving in addition to two hanging bars. The room is easily big enough to fit a full size bed and a good sized desk.

This room would be perfect for any NYU student looking to move into the city for second semester. The room is available immediately, but I would be willing to do a Spring 2021 sublet. The lease ends in July 2021 with the option to renew and stay onwards. The location is unbeatable and we have fast, reliable wifi in the apartment.

On the School’s Coronavirus Response and a P/F system,"Many people have commented that we shouldn’t have a universal pass/fail system in place this semester because (paraphrasing) “we knew what we were getting ourselves into.”  or “we signed up for this.” 

I think it’s important to clarify your (individual) viewpoints on this, as the University also seems to be shifting their perspective on what we “signed up for.” 

We signed up for an in-person bachelor’s degree program which would take four years (8 consecutive full time semesters) to complete. 

*We did not sign up for a 5 year bachelor’s degree or a 4.5 year bachelor’s degree.*

*We did not sign up for an online degree.*

*There was no discussion or agreement ahead of time that the format and length of our education would radically change from semester to semester (without regard to our academic performance (such as needing to retake classes)).* 

Pretending like a four year degree is now a semester-to-semester agreement is disingenuous to the point where it’s laughable. It’s disrespectful. 

At this moment, second semester sophomores and above have nearly no chance of transferring to a different program, let alone one in the same “rank” as NYU. First semester sophomores have about a month left, then they’re in the same boat. It’s important we’re honest with ourselves here. A majority of the NYU student body is “stuck” at NYU. That doesn’t mean they don’t like NYU. 

It simply means the semester-to-semester narrative is no more realistic than Narnia. 

___

*The next major defense of NYU and Universities in general is “there was no way to foresee this situation” and “what we’re supposed to do during a global pandemic?”*

I’m obviously not saying we should’ve maintained in-person classes throughout the pandemic. However, I still believe this whole situation was managed terribly by the administration (admittedly better than some other universities though). 

In regards to first point: this argument might make sense for a university located in a rural town in the middle of the country. For a school that claims to be “in and of the city,” you’d think NYU would have better disaster relief plans and funds. Particularly given the *city* in which we’re located. A plethora of disasters have affected the city since the school’s conception which include (but are not limited to): 9/11, Sandy, Irene, 1977 Blackout, The Great Depression, The Great Recession, Polio, H1N1, HIV/AIDS, multiple terrorist attacks, many fires &amp; explosions, multiple airplane crashes, etc. The list goes on. If any university in the world should be ready for a disaster in a moments notice, it should be NYU. 

___

*In regards to second point (what could we have done?):*

Perhaps instead of focusing on relentless real estate expansion and building a “global footprint,” they should have had their shit together in NYC. Maybe it’s not a good idea to have more than 230 areas of study (which will likely grow in the future). LS is still a money making scheme imo (Srry to those in it lol but I’m talking more long term). NYU’s marketing tactics abroad are still extremely questionable. Also, does nobody else find it a little concerning that Langone + School of Medicine account for 75% of the school’s operating revenue? That we have one of the smallest endowments relative to other universities similar to NYU? 

This goes to a broader issue that we students refuse to discuss or, more importantly, do anything about. NYU is a real estate and company first. They continue to grow and build without improving the quality of education or student life. 

Admission rates are obviously dropping because more people are applying every year. Meanwhile they’re touting the continuous expansion of the Abu Dhabi and Shanghai campuses (increasing student body size), and beginning to offer entirely online programs. Looking back, they also merged with Poly in 2014 which was another major expansion (for better or worse). 

All while they couldn’t handle their shit on the NYC campus. This relentless expansion leads to administrative bloat. The university has become too big and broad for its own good. 

They had it coming. They deserved every dollar lost, every news story, every lost applicant, and every lost transfer. It won’t stop either. They’ll continue to expand. However, the bubble will burst in due time. It will make them wish for a time like this again. Once again, they’ll deserve it. Also, if the college bubble bursts, the value of our degrees goes out the window with it. 

If we refuse to do anything about it as students, then we deserve it too. Nothing would work without proper organization. We are supposed to run the university, they do run us. We pay for them to operate (well us + school of medicine makes half lol). It is unacceptable that they are allowed to operate in this fashion. 

We must recognize that we signed up for a four year degree, we are not paying semester-to-semester rent.  We can’t stop going or choose another school whenever we’re dissatisfied. That’s simply not how degrees work in practice. 

Sorry for the ramble. P/F is related bc people keep mentioning how “signed up for this” and “knew ahead of time.” Disregard anyone who tells you you’re not allowed to complain. We’re paying tens of thousands of dollars for a product that impacts our lives. It’s absurd to think you’re not allowed to criticize said product.

Dear ________,

My name is ________ and I am a ___ year student in the _____ School of ______.

I have some concerns with how the university is handling grading this semester.

With the strains this semester has placed on students’ mental health, I, alongside the rest of the student body, would like to request a universal Pass/Fail policy, as we had in Spring 2020. We have seen multiple other institutions enact this, such as UC Berkeley, Penn, and Stanford. Columbia students just uptown have access to a universal P/F option, as does NYU’s own Shanghai campus; what is stopping the administration at the Washington Square and Brooklyn campuses from showing the same care for their students?

While it is true that students enrolled in this semester knowing that they would be taking online and blended courses, most students are on a strict timeline for financial and other reasons that made it impossible to defer a semester, forcing them to adapt to clearly inferior modes of learning; it is simply unfair for students to be graded on the same metrics they would if they had all resources and the reduced stress of a regular semester afforded to them. 

Students across the board have wrestled with a decline in their mental health, with a survey of the student body on the NYU subreddit showing that 73.9% of students have been struggling with mental health due to the circumstances of this semester. While students and professors are trying their best, it is reasonable to believe that it is more difficult to learn and retain information, on top of personal obstacles that each student is likely facing as a result of the pandemic.

Given the unique situation that we are all in this year, there is absolutely no reason for NYU to not show the same consideration for its students and their struggles that multiple other institutions of the same caliber have. It is incredibly insensitive on behalf of the administrators, and, as a student, I strongly encourage and urgently request for the Pass/Fail policies to be changed immediately to match those of Spring 2020.


Looking forward to your response,

Int Student; Should I come to campus in Spring?,"\*PLS HELP

To people who went on-campus in fall: Was it worth it? Especially with regards to the whole quarantine process. I know food was a problem but did it get better? How did you manage to get stuff for your dorm before quarantine? 

\------

So I'm an international student and I have my F-1 visa. I planned to go on-campus in Spring but my parents are worried and honestly, rightfully so. I'm having second thoughts now because neither of my parents can come with me because of the travel restrictions so idk if I can manage moving to another country alone. So I have a roommate (she's from NJ) but she can only move-in once my quarantine period is over and I know a few people who are planning to go from my country, so I'm trying to co-ordinate flights and stuff but my concern is quarantining alone for 14 days. To clarify, I don't have a problem staying alone but it's more to do with stuff like finding mattress toppers/blankets/etc for my dorm and also the food. As I understand, you're not allowed to go out of your room for 14 days at all. I'm also a spring admit so it would be my first semester at NYU. On one hand, I don't want to be dealing with all these potential issues in my first semester but also I'm certain that I don't want to do online classes from my home country. The reason is the timezone difference. During fall, I've had many internships/volunteering activities that required me to attend meetings and be active during EST and it's been a total shitshow bc I'm awake when my family's asleep so I feel isolated even staying at home. I can't handle waking up at random times and doing exams at 3AM, it's just not how I want to approach it. A lot of my friends are also struggling bc of this. I've decided that if I can't go to campus in spring, I'll take a gap year (bc I have lots to figure out anyway so it wouldn't be the worst thing). 

But I'm wondering, considering COVID and how it was in fall, should I come to campus in spring? Or is it not worth it? What are your experiences?",1605953578,1,0

Research Questions,"Idk if there's other resources about this elsewhere so sorry if this post asks questions that should be obvious, but I honestly never thought about doing research until the last month or so so I'm sort of clueless about where to start looking.

So I have a couple different areas I'm curious about starting research in. My first question is just sort of how do you get into research period. I honestly have no idea where to start looking, particularly in humanities/arts (I'm in Cinema Studies and would be interested in issues of representation and stuff like that).

But I'm also wondering if research ever happens in areas that don't have majors assigned to them? For example, I have some topics I'm interested in in the areas of Disability Studies, but while there is a Disability Studies minor and a ""Center for Disability Studies,"" there's no major or department (I'm not sure if a ""center"" is the same thing as a ""department"" I guess?). Will there still likely be research opportunities for students even when there is no major or department for that topic?

Finally, do you need to be majoring or minoring in a particular area in order to do research in that area? So, for example, like I said I'm in Tisch Cinema Studies, and I have one Tisch minor declared, but am still figuring out whether I want to do a second major or a second minor, and if so, what I want that to be. However, my other areas of interest are basically all related to issues of like social justice, gender studies, ethnic studies, disability studies etc., and I am wondering if I need to have actually declared a major or minor in a department like Social and Cultural Analysis or declare a Disability Studies minor in order to do research in that area?

I did apply to Pace University’s Preforming Arts Department for directing as well, and it looks good, so I’m trying to weigh my options. I know that you have to pay a lot to go to NYU, and that being so, I don’t want to waste my parents’ or my own money.

I got into UMass for computer science and I also am about to apply to NYU for data science.

NYU SPS POST TRADITIONAL DEGREE,"Hello all, 

Im most likely transferring to NYU in fall 2021 (I’ll actually be on the wrestling team) and one of the coaches was telling me about SPS and how it is cheaper but still provides the same opportunities in terms of education, internships, and connections. I was planning on transferring into CAS and majoring in Econ and minoring in cs or data science, however one of the post-traditional degrees in SPS stuck out to me being “Applied Data Analytics and Visualization”, and now I’m actually considering transferring into SPS instead. So I guess I have a few questions: 


1) Is anyone on this sub majoring in the applied data analytics degree at SPS, or already receive the degree, and if so what do you think of it overall (classes, teachers, workload, etc) and do you feel confident that the knowledge and skills gained from it will help land a job as a data analyst/scientist? I haven’t been able to find much of any info on this degree besides that on the SPS site, so I take it that it is quite new. 

2) Can I take electives or extra classes at CAS if I’m an SPS student?

3) I’ve heard most of the classes at SPS are offered in the evening after reading some forums from a few years ago. Is this still the case? (I would much rather take the majority of classes in the morning so this may be an issue for me)

4) How is social life, if at all, different being an SPS student as opposed to one of the more traditional schools? (CAS, Tisch, Stern)

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We  don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the  anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's  applications

Questions about NYU/Career Path from a HS student,"According to multiple sources across the internet, NYU is a great school if you want to break into high finance. I am a junior in highschool right now and my GPA on a 4.0 scale is a 2.67, I know, horrible. However, I've done well on the PSAT when I've taken it. Last year I scored in the 89th percentile and that was without any SAT prep classes (I will be taking some in the near future). Still, applying to NYU with a GPA so low is pretty pointless. In order to combat this I would like to try and transfer in from a community college. On NYU's website it states that in order to be eligible to transfer into CAS you must complete 16 credits prior to transferring. Assuming my GPA is in the 3.7 - 4.0 range after my first semester, and I have completed 16 credits specific to a Finance/Econ major, would you recommend applying to transfer then, or after a full year, or two? Ideally I would like to spend no more than a year at the community college as I would still like to get the whole college experience.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I was reading something on Wall Street Oasis that said NYU CAS Econ/Finance Majors are non targets for the bulge bracket banks. I then also read that someone that was an NYU CAS Econ major got a job out of college at a hedge fund. Obviously, there are many more things that factor into this like internships and connections, but can anybody offer some insight to this? When people say NYU is a target school for Wall Street are they referring to strictly NYU Stern? If I did manage to make it into NYU CAS should I try to transfer into Stern?

This seems like a good choice since I just started learning CS this semester and I was really enjoying it, plus I realized I just enjoy doing hands on work and learning hard math. My only concern is that, at CAS, the CS and Math major is a BA and not a BS. Is this gonna make a big difference when I eventually graduate and apply for jobs and stuff? I eventually want to make over $100k and I am not sure. Any other CS majors at CAS here? Let me know your thoughts!",1607194964,1,0
can i bounce back from a c,"i’m a freshman and i’ve had a really rough time this semester. my mental health is terrible, i have awful zoom fatigue, and just getting used to the first sem of college during this time was really rough. 

i’ve done alright in my classes, it looks like i’ll end w 2 As and a B/B+, but i really struggled with this one class for a number of reasons. it counted towards my major, so i couldn’t withdraw or p/f it, and it looks like i’m most likely going to end w a C+ in that class. it’s enough to pass, but like...it’s a c. 

i’m quite freaked out because i know it won’t look good on my transcript. also, i’ve seen a lot of people in the comments talk about how a W looks better than a C, which makes me even more nervous. so i guess my question is, can i bounce back? 

i’m not going to pretend like i can see into the future, but i learned a lot just about how academics in college works and i feel much better prepared for next sem. i’m also taking a lighter coursework next sem, so i genuinely think i’ll do better than i did this past sem. 

i know this sounds really ridiculous/arrogant/annoying/freshman-esque but i literally just oscillate from being like “it’s chill just do better next sem” to “i’m so screwed” and i just wanted some outside opinions so i can stop having panic attacks about this. sorry if this sounds dumb i just feel like everyone around me is doing so well and getting great grades and everything and i’m the one dumbass that’s struggling",1607191621,1,0

Is it more competitive, social, or collaborative? Also would I be too old to join clubs/ interact with younger students? I’d be 24 when I start, if I get accepted.

Wellness Exchange sent me to a psychiatric ward,"
Trigger Warning for Mental Health ahead. 


So, I have always been aware of my mental health issues. If I ever self harmed or felt hopeless I knew to call hotlines and have been in therapy since I was 15.  Moving to New York for grad school is the longest I have been without one. So I got acquainted with the wellness exchange right off the bat. 
I was having a panic attack as I am planning of taking spring semester off but without my aid I wouldn’t be able to afford my rent in New York, and I just adore it here. I hit myself in the cheek, I used to self harm by hitting myself in the head to stop overthinking (very bad I know) I explained this wellness, I said I’m so stressed I wanna bash my head into a window. I never expressed the want to kill myself, nor did I want too.
They told me to go to Tish Hospital and asked if I would like them to call ahead to let them now I was coming. I thought great. Maybe I won’t have to wait in the waiting room with Covid people.
I wanted something to calm my panic attack. Like Xanax and resources outside of NYU. 
I’m in the Psych ER. I talked to one person and they said I needed to be committed. I expressed my fear over being committed as I can’t be away from my job that long and it’s finals. As well I am immunocompromised and in fear of COVID-19. The doctor said if I did not voluntary commit myself she would involuntary commit me.  I was in the ER from 2-11PM. I got to the ward and talked to nurse. I was crying and shaking because I was scared to sleep in a room with a roommate with Covid. They “let” me sleep in a padded room. Crying my eyes out I was told I had to stop and I was bothering the staff and I need to stop. They gave me ativan to pass out. I stayed up till 7 am and was given another Ativan and slept until noon. My team of psychiatrists gave recommendations on new medications and I begged be let out as I am far to scared to get any proper help. They said that was not possible and I had to be there at least for two days. I even explained I never had thoughts of killing my self. You don’t see a therapist. From my understanding from other people there. You get a team to adjust your meds and at the end of the stay you meet a social worker for therapy. No one talked to me about my issues that caused my anxiety attack. I had to do two groups to get my cell phone. Which is standard but they are not group therapy. I had to paint a picture and then do 5 minutes of meditation. After throwing up my 3 ativan, the team said they would release me, but it would against their recommendation so I was not given any adjustments to my mediations nor any calming tools. I’ve been out for a day now and I keep having flash backs of the padded room when I close my eyes and I feel like I was in a nightmare and don’t know what happened in those two days. 
Please call a hotline if you feel lost or DM me even. But do not go there.",1606976570,1,0

My grade was 94 until final exam and I got a C+,"My midterm, two presentations, and participation were all 94-95.

The final exam format was 10 multiple questions and 50?60? short answer responses. I think it was 50 but someone in my class said 60. There were no lines for these answers and under every question, there was just a big box capable of holding like 100k words. No guidelines on how much to write and a lot of the questions asked for two or more things (list and describe all 5 of the ___ and the practices that come with them) We were given 2.5 hours and there was a timer attached to the exam.

The usual classtime is 9:30am-12:15pm but the exam opened up at around 2pm and my schedules were too packed to fit the exam in. It was finals season and my Thursdays are 8:30am-8:30pm so I stayed up to study and prepare for other stuff and took the exam at 7am.

I ended up not being able to even finish the exam. This was the case for a lot of other students as well. We all emailed her and only a couple students received a response back and it said “the exam will be curved and we will make sure the grades for the class are on the usual curve.” However, I still received a C+.

I got a response from her after a week from that and she told me to send her a complete study guide (she uploaded a study guide a week before the exam) by 5am of next day to receive extra credit bcs she has to travel and can’t respond often after that. Again, my schedule was already packed with other classes’ stuff and I tried to fit it in by staying up but I could not do it.

I let her know and asked if I can get it replaced to an incomplete until she can help me at her most convenient time but she said she can’t accommodate bcs she’s out of country rn and told me to contact the professor who hosted the first half of the semester but added that she’s not sure if I’ll be able to reach her bcs she’s also out of country.

I’m just completely bummed out. I am going to try contacting my counselor about it but is there anything else I should do??

Also, how is the Anthropology and religious studies program? I know it says good things on the website but I would love some insight from students. And how is the community’s NYU? I know that without a campus it can be more isolating, but are there still parties or fun events you go to? Such as dancing and what not, do you take advantage of the city night life?

Stern international student internship,"Hello!
I am an international student and an incoming freshman for stern class of 2025. I have a few questions regarding the internship opportunities i have and would be really grateful if any international students could clarify them for me.

1. Is the earliest time i could join an internship program 1 year after I am enrolled as a full time student in NYU?

2. Could i do unlimited CPT internships during the academic year and full time internships during summers as long as my full time internships does not exceed 12 months?

3. Would I be eligible for 36months of OPT after I graduate as long as I take either statistics or econometrics and Quantitative economics which are both listed as an stem program for stern undergraduate.

4. What's the pay usually like for a finance internship? 

5. My initial plan was to graduate a semester early as my A level has a few transfer credits, would taking 18 credits per semester be too much to keep up with if I am doing an internship during the semester?",1608213641,1,0

NYU Waitlist,"I applied ED 1 to NYU, and was put on the waitlist. There’s a form for me to fill out stating if I would like to accept a spot on the waitlist, as well as a category to update on other schools (besides the one I initially applied for) within NYU I would like to be considered for, as well as a spot to update admissions on anything i have done since submitting my application that I would like them to consider. Besides that, it seems they are very clear that they do not want waitlisted applicants to send any other materials or updates to the admissions office. However, NYU has also stated that there is no “order” of ones spot on the waitlist, and candidates will be reconsidered as spots open up. 

With that being said, what am I supposed to do to make me more eligible for a spot if one opens up? I’m kind of confused, if there are essentially no other opportunities to update admissions on what I have been doing to prove myself to be a worthy candidate, how do they make these decisions? I know they will likely evaluate whatever I put in the waitlist form and my mid year grades, but is everything else kind of up to chance? I don’t want to send a LOCI (which I have seen many general sources recommend) if NYU has explicitly stated not to, so I’m not really sure where I am supposed to go from here.",1608194753,1,0
