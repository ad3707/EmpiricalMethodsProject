Should I transfer to UPenn?,"I'm an international freshman at USC, and bc of covid I literally have not bonded with ppl in school that much so I am considering transfer to UPenn. I got admitted into USC's Annenberg school as a communications major, and also wish to study communications at Penn, esp since I have taken courses in Penn's Annenberg School for the pre-college summer progream(got an A+). I had a great time at UPenn last summer, connected with a lot of people and just in general is more comfortable in Philly than else where. And also I really want to double major in psychology/cogntive neuroscience, but USC is not very strong in this. 

I'm thinking about applying for transfer in march 2021, but I also heard it might be better to consider transfer after second year.

MCIT On-Campus experiences?,"Hi all,

Just wondering if anyone here is studying/has studied MCIT and can comment on their stats/experience?

As an aside I am also hoping to apply to the MCIT program, but my application is split between two universities; I performed very poorly at my first university due to various reasons, but after transferring to the second university I performed really well. My GRE is also very good (90+ percentile for both Verbal and Quant). I know it's highly unlikely anyone here is on the admission committee, but was wondering if anyone also has experience about the admission committee overlooking poor grades from 2+ years ago if I have shown improvement?

Accountability / disappointment,"I'm a freshman here so definitely some bias as my experience with Penn personally is only in a Covid world. But l'm a bit frustrated and disappointed. I feel like at most turns Penn has let me down as a student. I know that Covid is serious and online learning is a challenge for everyone, and I really think professors are handling the change well. I guess my main frustration is comparing Penn's response to other schools. Only 2 days off this semester, no day off for Election Day, not bringing any students back, reversing the decision so late. The social and mental stress of classes is really taking its toll and I feel like the further this goes the more isolated I feel from my peers. I know we'll be there eventually, this just sucks. I'm also very grateful for my living situation and know that I have a lot to be grateful for. 

This turned into a ramble but basically, is there anyway to hold the administration accountable? I really feel like decisions aren't really considering social and emotional health right now... and I feel like the administration doesn't seem to care much for us as individual students. Trying to hold on to hope for Spring but also wishing I had some way to turn these strong feelings into action or at least trying to hold the administration accountable.

Scores and grades now dictate my life and I feel as though I am just a number. I feel like my GPA is worth more than me. I literally don't feel an ounce of happiness or relaxation anymore. Tears can't even come out because all sense of self and soul has left by body. This seems like an exaggeration, but this is the truth. I feel like a stale piece of bread. The only reason I eat is to fuel my body to study again. My phone has been on 95% battery life because I barely get down time anymore. My eyes feel strained from going on PennCanvas so much and watching virtual lectures.  I literally get relieved to end class just to go back to studying.  This is kinda a rant but kinda not.

Why did you choose Penn? Would you choose it again?,"Hey everyone, I’m a prospective student. 
Penn has been on my list since I first made it, but now I’m starting to reconsider. I’ve already sent my recommendations but I haven’t started my supplements. 

For background, I’m planning on majoring in Health and Societies on the pre-med track. I really want a collaborative environment and I’m really trying to avoid toxic pre med culture. Recently I’ve been hearing how toxic the pre-professional culture is at Penn and initially this didn’t bother me because I figured it was mainly people in the business or finance majors. 

So I’m wondering, why did everyone choose Penn and would you choose it again? I like that Penn has affinity housing for Black students and not many of my other schools do. Also my major is kind of rare. Also like that they have clubs that support things I’m passionate about.",1602906913,1,0

How likely would you be to use a forum like this to meet other students?,"How likely would you be to use a [Discourse](https://meta.discourse.org/)\-based forum to meet other students? you'd be able to login using your PennKey so no need to create a new account. There would be sub-forums/groups for different themes and regions/countries. Discourse is an open-source forum platform but the overall approach and interface is pretty different than something like Facebook so idk how likely people would be to actually use it. traditional social media sites aren't really a great option for this specific purpose since a lot of the student user base would be in China. Optimally it'd be accessible via PennKey or Google/o365 sign-on so no need to remember another username.

Another Meandering Vent Post about Nothing in Particular,"I know that there are about eight million posts like these (I saw one like it today), but I just need some way to express myself. I'll probably delete it later once I grow too embarrassed, but for now, this will do. TLDR at the bottom.

This virtual learning environment just doesn't seem to work with me at all. I'm super awkward with others, especially online, so all my breakout rooms are either silent or rushing way ahead of me because I don't understand what's going on. I can't seem to get the help I need and I don't know where to start on how to fix it. I've gotten a C and D on my two PHYS 150 tests so far, and a D on my first CHEM 101 test followed by getting the lowest score in my entire class (far below 50%), which really hurts since I thought that I was really understanding the material. My MATH 104 class, as often and as annoying as it is to hear about it, fills me with dread every time I think about it. I've had multiple panic attacks over not understanding anything and the recent grades that I've gotten. Even with pass/fail, I'm not certain I'll pass them and it fills me with anxiety. I understand that imposter syndrome is a real thing, but I can't help but feel like I'm not nearly smart enough to be here at all.

I've talked to my parents about whether or not I really want to be a biochemistry major since I've always been mediocre at math and physics and I'm absolutely miserable. When I bring up creative writing, which I actually do enjoy, I'm told that I'd be wasting money by going here instead of somewhere cheaper for that and that I should just stick it out for the biochemistry degree. It's just demoralizing, especially since I've been growing lukewarm to the prospects of biochemistry for the past few years now.

I've gone to CAPS to try to talk about my anxiety, both induced by the situation and by mental illness, but I don't think it's helped much. I can't get motivated for anything nowadays because it all just worries me and I can't seem to make it stop. I only feel happy whenever my club meets or I play video games (Genshin Impact and Hades are the ones eating most of my time right now).

It doesn't help that I am incredibly lonely. All my friends from high school are either working or at their colleges, meanwhile, I'm stuck at home. I haven't had to make new friends in years, never online, and I'm afraid that I've forgotten how to do so. I am a part of a club, and it's the one thing that I look forward to every week. Everyone is nice, but I don't think they see me as a friend, but rather as a member. Which is fine, I just think I might be so friend-starved that I'll start to annoy them. I'm awful at chatting via text, I much prefer actually talking, but that is unfortunately uncommon now so my prospects for meeting people are depressing.

I'm hoping it'll get better, but I doubt it will. Classes will only get harder and I'll be left behind. Upperclassmen are just as lonely as I am, even when they were on campus. My anxiety will only get progressively worse as the semester goes on. I apologize for taking such a pessimistic tone, but this is what I need to vent about to at least make myself feel a little better.

UPenn Systems Engineering MSE Questions

Hi everyone! I am very interested in participating in UPenn’s program in systems engineering. I graduated from Texas A&amp;M a couple of years ago and have been working in industry since then. 

In readying my application for the program, I ran into a couple of questions that I was hoping someone could answer. 

1) I was wondering if anyone had any feedback on the program? 

2) Is the program focused on the technical engineering aspects of complex systems or does it focus more on the business side of managing projects/life cycle management ( I saw that there were opportunities to take some cross-functional classes at Wharton)? 

3) Are there any opportunities to manage any engineering projects while in the program so as to learn by example?

Any response would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance!",1602447429,1,0

I'm thinking right now that it'd take the form of monthly (at first) speaker series where we'd invite a guest to come give a talk/host a discussion over Zoom, record it, and release the audio/video as a podcast and/or YouTube videos.

To that end, I'm looking for anyone who might be interested in getting involved in the planning and direction of this thing. My experience and background is in leftist organizing/labor power so my interests and perspectives skew that direction but I'd love to collaborate with folks who have experience/in-roads with other disadvantaged and/or marginalized communities to bring amplification to those causes as well.

Anyway, if you're interested in doing a little side project and think this sounds interesting feel free to hit me up at admin@PennUnderground.org or check out the (placeholder) site I threw up at PennUnderground.org.

Thanks

tl;dr - long time leftist looking to start a speaker series for marginalized voices, looking for folks to get involved.

Disclaimer: When I say I want to platform ""outside the mainstream"" voices, I mean people/organizations working against injustice and inequality, so don't talk to me if you think this means ""let's bring Charlie Kirk/Ben Shapiro/any of those dinguses to Penn!""",1604952034,1,0

I'm also thinking that there will be added convenience with in-house dining halls + better food, and suitemates will be nice given the reduced social activity. Is this a good move to make? Is it even possible for me to switch into one of the nicer dorms?",1604897501,1,0

Is there an age limit for staying in dorms?,"Hi everyone! I hope this post is allowed. 

I am applying for UPenn's ABSN-MSN program this year. I have been weighing the options for housing and am leaning towards thinking that staying in dorms with a meal plan is a better option financially for me than finding a place to live. The only catch is that next year when I attend (if I get accepted) I'll be 27. I'm not embarrassed or ashamed or what not to be living in a dorm, however, is there an age limit for being able to do so? The university I graduated from previously had a cut off, but I can't find information on any website or handbook or rules stating anything about a max age limit for dorm living.

Any help would be super appreciated! I was planning on calling someone in resident life this week, but figured I may get a quicker answer on here.",1604880771,1,0
P/F and the “adjusting to online classes” myth,"In the debate about pass fail (which, contrary to popular belief, is the most important day-to-day issue affecting Penn students) there seems to be a belief as “time goes on” it’s less of an issue. This is bull. It’s way more of an issue. It’s true initial adjustment difficulties mattered at one point but they aren’t the main issue. The issue is that the online education simply has way more problems.

 It’s harder to focus, many home environments suck, people are interrupted during tests, academic integrity is a nightmare... none of these things are changing as long as we have online classes, and if Penn goes back to standard grading next semester it’ll make a mental health disaster (a whole year spent behind a screwn) exponentially worse. This doesn’t get easier the longer it goes on, it gets way harder. This idea that a return to standard grading is justified because we’re now “used to” the zoom experience is pure crap.",1604873929,1,0
Gap Semester,"So idk about y’all, but I’ve found online classes to pale in comparison to in-person. I gullibly believed Penn could do some hybrid courses last sem, but I don’t want to fall prey to that mindset again. 

Penn will likely have all their non-nursing classes virtually Spring 2021 too, right? No chance small seminars (&lt;15 ppl) are actually going to be delivered in person? 

If that’s the case, I really think a gap semester is for me. Any one else considering gap semesters, and if so, has anyone spoken to the fin aid office about how or if this will impact one’s fin aid?

This time, if they do ye olde ""pull out at the last second"", I want to see what part of their PowerPoint strategy got screwed, or literally anything more than a paragraph.

Upset that I might have to leave my Chestnut community,"Seeing Penn’s announcement today was bittersweet. Obviously I want other freshmen to experience Penn!!

I would honestly love to just pay the extra money and pay for this apartment and a dorm, but I think most of my friends are looking to move on campus. Even in a pandemic, us 50 freshmen have really grown close, and I’m scared to lose that when going to the dorms. So right now, I’m honestly really hoping Penn cancels its spring plans so I can stay here in the Chestnut, and also eventually cancels its plans to force sophomores to move in on campus.",1604079419,1,0

If you or someone you know voted by mail, you can check the status of your ballot at: https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/ballottracking.aspx

If your or someone you knows vote is rejected, you can always request a provisional ballot on election day. There's a lot of noise of voter suppression, especially in PA.

Online LPS BAAS (Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences) - Which Concentration to Choose?,"Hi Everyone -

I'm looking to apply to the Online LPS Bachelor of Applied Arts &amp; Sciences program but am deciding between **Data Analytics &amp; Psychological Sciences** OR **Leadership &amp; Communication Concentration**. 

Do you guys have any advice on which one is better? For context, I do have a bachelor's degree from a lower tier university. Now that I have more time two decades later, I would like to earn an online degree from an Ivy League school but am balancing between A) true learning / intellectual curiosity; B) which concentration is easier / easier to get better grades in and C) which concentration offers better option value if I'm considering possibly doing grad school after.

If any of you are in either concentration or have taken any of the classes (whether online or offline), I would really appreciate your advice.

Anyone owes money all of a sudden late into the fall semester?,"I got a notice saying I owed money and a late payment has been charged.

I noticed that the numbers to my fall semester changed beginning of October, which was frustrating and surprising.

Why Penn will NOT be closing for the spring (hopefully this does not agree poorly),"Tl;dr unless some completely unexpected catastrophe occurs, Penn won't reverse its decision because they ignorantly believe (with weak evidence which I discuss) that an outbreak won't occur with everyone back on campus.

Context: I was able to get the housing exception and was placed in Rodin. I'm a sophomore and I'm from a third world country, so I do believe that I did have a legitimate reason to stay at Penn. 

Why did Penn take so long to make its final decision during the summer? Because they're money hungry cowards! You see, the Penn administration didn't want to lose out on the housing money. They blindly hoped that if the pandemic miraculously got under control but July or August, that we could all come back and everything would be fine and dandy. Penn wasn't confident that they could test adequately and that an outbreak wouldn't occur - now things have changed.

I do want to say that I remember a poll going out around that time which showed that freshmen were disproportionately accepted for on campus housing. And being in Rodin, I certainly did see many freshmen. After speaking with a lot of them, most of them couldn't believe that they had gotten the exemption. Their circumstances weren't anywhere as extentuating as mine or some other internationals.

So my theory was that Penn did that on purpose. That they accepted these freshmen as a sort of 'experiment'. They wanted to see if they could provide testing and if an outbreak would occur. Thankfully, nothing huge happened and Penn has been testing pretty well.

So after running their little test, Penn believes that nothing wrong would happen since they can now test and since the high rises have been outbreak free. I personally think they're getting ahead of themselves, but that's a topic for another day.

Anyways, unless an outbreak occurs between now and next semester, or Pennsylvania creates laws (which they won't because it's too costly for them to lose Penn State) or Philly puts laws (which they won't because the Philly colleges also bring in a lot to the economy) or the federal government puts laws (which they won't because it'll be deemed unconstitutional), I believe that Penn is confident in themselves to not fuck shit up and hence they will not close.",1606064144,1,0

I was wondering what the reasons were that other people chose to transfer from their original institution, any advice for narrowing down schools to send applications to, the number of transfer applications you sent out, or any other tips related to the whole process. Basically, any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated!",1605951009,1,0

Penn for PILOTs // pennforpilots.com,"""Statement of Penn for PILOTs  
The University of Pennsylvania’s announcement of a gift to the Philadelphia public schools is a welcome first step toward resolving the debt that the university owes our city's public school system. Above all, it testifies to the power of mobilization by public school students, teachers, city leaders, and members of the Penn community. We are committed to continuing that mobilization to ensure that Penn pays its full fair share on an ongoing basis.  
The chronic underfunding of the Philadelphia Public Schools cannot be resolved with a limited commitment of ten annual payments; it requires a system of public finance that ensures that the city's wealthiest institutions pay their fair share every year in perpetuity. The University of Pennsylvania is Philadelphia’s largest private property owner, and in the city of Philadelphia, property taxes are the principal source of local revenue for public education.  Year in and year out, Penn’s property tax exemption deprives the public school system of funds that students, teachers, and staff need and deserve.  Year in and year out, the poorest big city in the United States subsidizes one of the richest universities in the country by forfeiting a portion of its property tax revenues.  A time-limited gift will not make up for Penn’s accumulated debt to the public schools, nor will it ensure that Penn contributes what it owes in the future.  
Furthermore, Penn’s commitment to pay $10 million per year falls short of the standard that our community has set.  Over 1,000 faculty and staff members, speaking in harmony with parents, teachers, students, community organizations, and members of the City Council, have called on Penn to pay 40% of what it would owe in property taxes every year.  By our calculations, that would come to approximately $40 million per year—four times what the university has offered.  
Public schools are not charities, and public education is not a gift or a privilege whose provision can rightly depend on occasional acts of beneficence.  The provision of public education has long been one of the most firmly and universally established responsibilities of government in the United States.  Generations of Americans have held to the idea that every child is entitled to an education that is freely available to all, financed by all, and governed by all through legitimate democratic procedures.  Private charity cannot sustain such a system.  To suggest as much degrades the egalitarian, democratic promise of public education.  
For these reasons, we remain resolved that Penn must make annual payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) to the public schools—40% of what it would owe in property taxes, paid into an Educational Equity Fund governed by the School District and City of Philadelphia.  No gift will substitute, and no gift will quiet our calls for Penn to fulfill this basic civic responsibility.""",1605681953,0,0

I got a job in Manhattan after I graduate this spring and I’d like to live in Manhattan to avoid this same feeling of FOMO, despite the fact that some have advised me to live in Queens or Brooklyn and commute to work in order to save on rent. 

So my question to those who live in NYC is: would I be making a reckless financial decision by living in Manhattan w/ no roommates? Is living in Queens/Brooklyn analogous to living in West Philly, or are these boroughs exciting enough to not experience FOMO?

Because it’s relevant:
-I want to live in a studio/1BR. This will run me 2-3K/mo in Manhattan.
-I will be making 165K/year. (This will be liquid/not stock.)
-I will be paying off 70K in student debt over the next ~5 years.

Off Campus Housing Challenges with Summer Lease for Big House,"Myself and 4 or 5 other friends are interested in renting a big, 5 BR house off-campus. Most of us are FGLI, so I'm hoping to see if someone has a good understanding of the costs and challenges of renting a big place among many people. My (limited) understanding is that rents go pretty cheap for bigger units like that, but the leasing process is pretty restrictive. That is, I believe many of the leases for the bigger houses open up in June and are leased for the whole calendar year. Is that correct?

If so, what are some ways of mitigating the summer rent burden? Subleasing is an obvious option, but myself and others in our group are worried finding someone willing to sublease for a summer is too unpredictable to count on. I also believe nearly all big houses come mostly unfurnished, so is it smart to get a place going for lower rent and furnish it with the expectation of saving in the long run? Any answers to the  above or perspectives on the process of taking on a bigger lease would be great! Thx",1607076474,1,0

Confused regarding UPenn LPS and the new BAAs,"I am currently 36 and looking to complete my degree I never completed. I have actually become very successful (thanks to quitting college and enlisting in the navy where I became a navy nuke operator). For my own personal satisfaction I want to complete a degree and expand my learning. 

I was pretty set on with the NYU adult program or the Columbia adult program. I then met someone who attended UPenn and spoke extremely highly of his experience and the results. Unfortunately I worked with him on a week long project and we did not exchange info and I haven’t talked to him in about 6 months. 

So I’m curious about this program and anything anyone can tell me. I am currently a senior level manager at a marine construction company. I want a ba in something management related that if I choose would allow me to apply to grad school down the law. My company will happily foot the bill for most masters programs. 

Is this degree a UPenn degree or will it say something different like the Harvard extension school.

Question about biology major classes,"I just had a quick question about the courses that count for the biology major. 
 
For the biology major from this site:

under Intermediate Biology (3-4 CUs) in Group 1 it says that BIOL204 or BIOL205 counts for Group 1. However, since I plan on attending dental school after undergrad, I think I need to take both BIOL 204 and BIOL 205 since they are important for the DAT and are prerequisites for many dental schools. 
 
If I take both BIOL204 and BIOL205, will one of these courses count for GROUP 1 while the other course count for “Four Additional Biology Courses (4 CUs)” as an additional BIOL200 level course?

One strategy (I vagely remember that it was used by Swarthmore) is under the pandemic situation, students could set a goal for the class (let's say around the p/f deadline). For instance, I set my goal for Class A to be 90, and if I get a 90 or above, it will show as a letter grade, and if I get a 89, it will be a pass. I will work as hard as I can for this class to get a 90+, but if for some reason I didn't do well in the second half of the course, (COVID effect, online distraction, or other reasons), I won't get let's say a C or something but just a pass.

Probably going to get bad grades in Chem 241,"I've just been doing really poorly in Orgo 1 this semester. After having completed the final, I'm -15 points below the average score using the grade scoring mechanism we were given (and dropping the lowest quiz grade), which is obviously very bad. I'm really worried about my grades, because while I don't think I'll fail, I really feel like I'll get a D based on what I've heard about the curve. How poorly will this reflect on me, as a freshman? I know I can retake Orgo 1 in the summer and sort of offset whatever I get this semester, but that D will still be visible and will still tank my GPA. I was planning on doing a chem major, but I feel that getting a D in Orgo 1 completely destroys any chances I have.",1608207923,1,0

international students accepted with aid,"hey guys,

i was just deferred from upenn cas as an international student who asked for about 50% aid. my theory is that since they only accept 45 intl kids requesting aid, they may have deferred many/most of us because they want to compare us all with the RD kids. was anyone on here accepted ed as an intl with aid? do you think aid is the main reason i may have been deferred? also, does the specific amount of aid we need matter? I've heard penn is more likely to accept an aid applicant if they are low income because they would rather give one student 90% aid then give a few 30% aid. Is this true?

Mind you that I did this whole tangent while getting straight A's, varsity sports, extracurriculars, etc. Though I can admit that I have some bad ED issues, I think that the mandatory meal plan is bringing more anxiety by making feel that I'd waste so much money.

A goodbye to Penn,"Hi,

Today ED decisions came out. I've never wanted anything so badly in my life, but unfortunately I was rejected. I definitely didn't expect an acceptance, as one never should, but I didn't expect the way that this rejection would make me feel. I'm not frantic, or sobbing, or anything of the sort. Instead I just feel a heaviness in my heart, weighing my whole person down. I imagined myself participating in all of the things at Penn: cohorts, the quad, heyday, the clubs; but I guess I wasn't enough. I really don't know why I'm posting this right now, but I'm in the worst pain I've ever felt and I guess this is just my coping mechanism. It's hard to realize that every night for the last year I went to sleep thinking about Penn and woke up with the same thoughts. It hurts badly to say it went to waste. On a positive note, I wanted to congratulate all of you guys. Please don't forget that you are in an extremely fortunate position, a position that many of us, including me, would give everything for. I guess that's all, I really need to shake off this depression by tomorrow so I can work on the rest of my RD apps. Also I wanted to thank my interviewer, I know she frequents this sub (I was the kid with the Chopin Ballade :)), I really enjoyed speaking to you and wish you all the success in the world, along with all of you guys.

International Student Financial Aid,"Hello everyone,

As Penn is need-aware for international students, I am wondering whether to just not apply for financial aid. My gross family income is about 200k per year, and I will be the only child in college for my family, so I can technically afford the tuition, but I would like to see if I am eligible for any aid, nonetheless. 

I know that being low-income plays into the admission of international students, but in my case, where my income is relatively high, would simply filling out the financial need forms to try my chances also decrease my acceptance? Or are acceptance chances generally decreased when you require high aid, too? (I read in [an article](https://blog.getintocollege.com/5-reasons-wealthy-students-should-apply-for-financial-aid-college-coach/) that it is the actual need for ai that plays into admission; applying for aid doesn't on its own affect admission, but it was an article directed at domestic students, not international ones... so I would appreciate the perspective of anyone, including international students who have been through this?) Thank you!

Here is a statement from the Penn website: 

""If your family has the financial means to afford educational costs, we recommend not applying for Penn-sponsored financial aid, as the offer of admission for non-citizens is directly linked to the ability to meet expenses. If your family cannot afford the total cost of Penn, then you should apply for financial aid. Please note you will be in competition for very limited funds. In recent years, we have offered an average of 45 aid awards to admitted international freshmen, and one or two to admitted international transfer students.""",1609344011,1,0

Did anyone take CRIM270 this semester? (Or can answer questions about grading policies at Penn),"I was looking for other people who took the class, because I feel like the grading policy is weird and wanted to discuss with other students. Grades were never made public on canvas, and there was no feedback on any assignments to even know what we did right or wrong, so the grading already seems arbitrary. The professor decided to bell curve the final grade in the class, but not each individual assignment,  which also seems off to me. This grading method was never discussed in the syllabus either and there was no rubric for the assignments (which were all writing assignments), so we had no way of knowing what exactly was expected, which goes back to my point of the grading being arbitrary. I was wondering if this is normal at Penn? Shady grading policies unknown to the students and grading of assignments that seems rushed. Also the final grade distribution is not going to be published, which also seems sketchy to me. If you’re going to bell curve FINAL GRADES without prior notice to the students, it at least seems fair that we get to see the distribution. I am a freshman thought so I guess I don’t really know what I’m talking about, but I just wanted to know if this is normal?",1609286880,1,0

Wharton prof is being a jerk. Who should I escalate this to?,"So this one prof has been really rude and unprofessional. He tried discussing my private medical issues in front of my classmates and we argued about it so I reached out to my college advisor/etc and brought it to their attention just in case he tried to retaliate or something. Now that he gave me a bad grade, he started to make up requirements and other things to make me look like I deserve it. I have proof (emails from him, ""testimonies"" from the 3 other students in the class) that prove he's lying, but who do I go to with this? I don't think this qualifies as a typical grade change/grievance because it's a rather complicated situation.

Should I go to the Dean? The chair of the dept? This is starting to take a toll on my mental health but there's no way I'm letting him treat me like this especially after a semester that's been so shitty for all of us.

PHYS101 with Devlin final exam cheating,"He recently sent out an email regarding cheating:


I've been spending the last two days grading the final. I'm actually almost done. One thing that happens when you grade 96 finals back to back is that you start to notice trends. In particular when people get the same weird (and wrong) answer, have gibberish and then the correct answer, or just do the problem in a style that is a bit off.

Well - it turns out that most of the exam is up on Chegg. It might not surprise you that two of the solutions are wrong (!) (you get what you pay for). Needless to say, it is pretty straightforward for me to identify patterns whether they came from Chegg or your friend.

Once I bump this up to the University, it is out of my hands. If do bump it up to the University, I will follow through on my promise about your future. I have seen the future, and it is not good.

On the other hand, you can come clean *right now*. Not tomorrow, not after I send you a personal email - now. In other words I have already identified a few exams. So, you should consider yourself already caught. Do yourself a favor and minimize the damage by contacting me. This goes for anyone who *knows* anyone who cheated. You can contact me and I will make sure it remains anonymous. If you are in that grey area where you gave your answer to, or helped someone - If I find out, you both go down. If you let me know and make your case, it will be easier for you.

You have until Noon ET December 27th. 

To the vast, vast majority of you who worked so very hard this semester, I really do hope you have a great break! It will be a bit hard for me to assign grades until I work this out, but I will get it the process started. Sorry about that!

Professor Ghrist is a complete joke,"Professor Ghrist seems to find comedic value in the fact that over 500 students under his curriculum have filed complaints and concerns over the teaching methods he has enacted this semester. Enough to the point that he can joke about it on twitter as hundreds of students are still left struggling to learn material on their own because he thinks that a 15 minute YouTube video can teach an entire topic to a student who has never seen this before. I have linked the tweet below. I don’t care how great this guy thinks he is, he clearly isn’t a humble person. [image of tweet ](https://ibb.co/cx7NmDc)",1601990807,1,0
Feeling Optimistic for Spring 2021,"Many colleges that are open are doing fine and it seems like if Penn can get it together and create an effective testing + social distancing strategy, I see no reason why they wouldn't have a hybrid semester. (no in-person classes though) They want that coin obviously, so I think they're going to do everything they can to go down the path of reopening. Maybe this is just speculation, but I'd say with or without a vaccine, they're leaning towards reopening and looking for ways to reopen properly, rather than just sitting around and waiting. For the sake of my mental health and sanity, I hope we get a hybrid semester. WEAR A MASK, VOTE, AND SOCIAL DISTANCE NOW. Anyways, thanks for coming to my tedtalk.",1601964174,1,0

MCIT Online vs On-campus: Any advice for me?,"Hi, I’m a ROK-based professional Korean-English interpreter/translator who happens to be into producing. 

After having pursued my career path in the legal field for a little while (this may sound like a lot, but it really isn’t. I’d just spent several months in prepping for the LSAT.), I finally decided to stop pursuing my career in such a field (at least until I feel like I should come back, if ever) and subsequently turned my eyes toward the tech industry, though I technically have almost no background in tech. 

But, I do have some thoughts on starting my own business and personal projects to achieve it. 

After having done my research on ways to get there, I figured getting some formal education in Computer and Information Technology would be immensely helpful for me to get a decent boost and Penn’s MCIT program looks like a fantastic opportunity. 

But there’s one thing that really makes me keep puzzled, which is that I’m not so sure of which program will better suit my plans and goals. 

To tell you a little bit about myself, I currently plan to go to the military to complete my mandatory military service at the beginning of next year, and if I get lucky enough, I guess I’d be able to get some time to study with my laptop, maybe a couple of hours a day.

And even if I somehow won’t go to the military next year, I can’t move to the States and get enrolled in the MCIT program (of course, only if they’ll ever let me in) due to some intricate situation I’m facing at the moment and the covid crisis. 

So, it looks to me that applying to the online program is a good option given I won’t be able to take offline courses, but if I’d choose it over applying to the on-campus program after I finish my service, I won’t be able to get a student visa, which I guess will apparently have a lot of doors to the US tech industry closed as I won’t be able to do OPT (Optional Practical Training) or whatever that allows me to work and even stay in the U.S. 

And money also seems to be a big thing to consider. As you’d know, the online program’s much cheaper than the on-campus one, and I’m also wondering if paying some extra hundred Ks (living expenses included) for the on-campus education could get me something special that I can’t experience in an online setting in return. 

Of course, I know I always should and will be the one to make the final decision, but I think I could use some help from people who’ve already walked through the path. 

So, if there’s someone out there who’s been through the process or have some thoughtful advice to share for future applicants like myself, I’d appreciate it so much if you could share your thoughts and insight. 

Thanks so much!",1601892423,1,0

Anyone feel like tests/quizzes are much harder than in person?,"Naturally I expected tests/quizzes to be a little bit harder because of the at-home/open-book format. But lately it seems like they’re just way too hard. Not at all like the content exposed prior in class/hw/etc. It’s probably an anti-cheating mechanism on top of the ridiculous time limits.

But, if it’s a 20-minute quiz with long calculation problems, there’s no way an unprepared student is gonna learn how to do the calculations in that time frame anyway. So why screw over the honest students with exam content that looks nothing like what was practiced in class/homework? When studying, prior exams from Fall 2019, 2018, etc., all very doable and fine! Then I click the god awful ‘Take the Quiz’ button, and it feels like my soul has left my body when I see the questions. 

I’m keeping up, but it’s requiring an ungodly amount of studying. I also need to work, take care of myself, etc., and barely have time for that. The workload is significantly more than what I ever did in-person.",1601830990,1,0

My question is, does it get better after 104? i heard many people say that 104 is the hardest since it is calc ii and since it is an introductory course. Should I just drop the whole idea of becoming a math major and go become a stripper or something?

Plz help a failing freshman...should I switch to pass/fail?,"I've had a pretty rough start this semester, especially because I came back from taking a gap year and with everything being online.

I was wondering if switching some of my classes to pass or fail would be appropriate. I am not sure I understand the email sent by the college about how it is different for the pandemic. What are the downsides of pass/fail grading and would it be disadvantageous in the future?(not counting towards credit, effect on grades, opportunities, etc.) 

I'm currently in CAS came in thinking I'd be pre-med but nope....decided it's not for me. I want to explore business/economics major as I enjoyed economics in high school. How likely it is for me to be able to transfer to Wharton, without prior related activities in high school? And would the classes still count towards requirements for transfer if I switch to pass or fail. (Lol probably not right?💀) Is there a minimum GPA required or expected?

I am taking two classes that satisfy the requirement: MATH 104 and ECON 001. I am doing okay in ECON but struggling with MATH 104 and CHEM. If I switch it to pass/fail, but earned a 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam, would it be okay?

Surviving NETS 112,"I'm taking NETS 112 this semester, and this class is super boring. I'm having extreme trouble focusing in class. Even when I'm trying to focus, there is so much information for a introductory class to network science.

The lectures are just slides with a lot of formulas. Our homework is reading a research paper done in the networks field, and answering six questions about each paper. I don't feel like the information we are shown in lecture is sticking at all. There isn't really any reinforcement where we practice the concepts we learn.

To top it off the research papers, slides, and the readings from the book are ""fair game"" for the exam. I  feel like this a bad introductory class, but I have to get through it.

Taking MATH 240 P/F vs. Taking the Credit Exam Next Sem,"Hi! I'm a freshman in MATH 240 and majorly regretting my decision. The lecture notes are super confusing, the videos just repeat the notes word for word, and the synchronous Zooms don't seem very relevant to the lectures. The only thing saving me right now is Ivan Li's videos and other random Youtube videos.

I think my raw grade right now is in the C range and I honestly have no idea how the class is getting curved. I'm only getting more lost as the class progresses so I'm debating between dropping the class or taking it P/F. I might be able to scrape by with a passing grade but the weekly quizzes are honestly stressing me out so much.

Since I'm basically learning all the material on my own, I was wondering if it'd be better to drop the class and either take it again next semester or keep up with the self-learning and try taking the credit exam in the spring. I feel like I'm better off learning on my own without the stress of weekly quizzes. However, I'm not sure what the P/F policy will be like in the future so I'm not sure if I should take advantage of it now while I still have the chance.

To my dear Penn - Some Colleges Successfully Re-opened / Cornell/Tulane show (so far) Opening Can Work!,"Yesterday 9-30  in the Washington Post the President of Cornell and its Provost wrote a joint opinion echoing thoughts this Redditor imagined in September on other posts:   ""At Cornell, science informed our decision to invite students back to campus...Our epidemiological models showed us that by opening our doors for instruction and implementing robust pooled testing and contact tracing programs, we could keep our infection rate lower than if we were strictly online, knowing many of our students would return to our area anyway"".  How did they do it?  it came down to robust, fast and regular testing (2x per week) and other efficient science-based measures. They are not out of the woods, as spikes are being seen across the country, but semesters will soon close out or can be halted sooner if things get out of control and measures at Cornell are in place to deal with spikes.  ""Students have proved themselves more than capable of acting responsible"" the article states.  

Not being able to manage isolating students from hot spots for 14 days and the inability to get testing done (do to contract and delivery issues at the time) were 2 of the initial reasons cited by Penn for cancelling the Hybrid experience.  But, these are logistical problems that other major universities like Tulane and Cornell have overcome.  Penn is in a more dense City environment, which we all must consider. However,  I call for everyone's considered view as to whether students and their families are truly safer on the off campus campus or at home when they can be infected by, or where they can infect, family and friends.  Penn, use that knowledge for good and if Penn can truly open up, open.  The loss of even one student or faculty to Covid because of re-opening would not justify re-opening, but if the infection rate in our campus community can be controlled like other major large Universities have done so far, it is possible that the overall health and safety for Penn, its surrounding community and for Penn family members will be better not worse by opening the campus with safeguards in place.",1601565533,1,0

To the Upenn sophomore who assaulted me in July (tw),"hello,  


it is not my intention to ""expose"" you or identify you in any way. I do NOT want to start any sort of witch hunt just to be clear which is why I am remembering details for you to recognize only. I simply cannot bring myself to directly confront you but I hope somehow this message reaches you.  
you met me in march. I was in the neighborhood gym right before the beginning of the coronavirus. You hit on me there and got my Snapchat.  I ended up at your house a couple of nights later. We talked for a while and began hooking up. I explicitly told you I did not want to have sex. You ended up finishing in your pants from dry humping and awkwardly dropped me off at home. You didn't contact me for months which I expected and was honestly relieved by because the end of the encounter was extremely weird. 

  
in august, you actually began snapping me and I blatantly said you were too much of a ""player"" for me whereas I liked to date. I feel this detail is worth throwing in because I think I did convey in some desperate notion that I wanted a boyfriend and I was cognizant of the fact that you seemingly wanted to hookup. More importantly, you were cognizant of the fact I did not just want to hook up.  


after we both tested negative, I came to your house around 7pm. you introduced me as a friend to your mom before we went to your room. We spoke breifly and began hooking up. I once again immediately and explicitly said I did not want to have sex. you took off my top and shorts as well as yours and I felt comfortable. You began to take off my underwear and I started to feel weird because I was on my period. I began the awkward process of telling you I was on my period and you quickly put yourself inside of me without a condom while you were on top of me. I explicitly told you I did not want to have sex. I said, ""I don't want to have sex.""

  
when you penetrated me, I felt frozen. there was blood on your sheets and dick. you expressed some desire to sleep with me again and I responded affirmatively yet coldly because I wanted the encounter to be over and I don't think I could wrap my mind around what had happened.  I still can't. I walked home. Fortunately, I do not attend Upenn. 

I just want to know, how could you do that to me? I will be fine. I am sure I will fall in love and have normal sexual relationships and find happiness with someone I trust. But really... what the fuck? Everything about you disgusts me. I subtely detected your narcississm from your obsession with brand name clothes to your endless requests for verbal praise yet I wrote off these qualities as sexy arrogance as opposed to legitamate red flags and an indication at a larger lack of empathy. I will be fine but I can't ever articulate the profound ways this night disturbed me and shaped the way I view love and sex. 

I bet one day you will have a nice house with a nice wife and cute kids. A nice job and all the bells and whistles and an ivy league degree in tow. I always think you will be an insecure parasite.

I'm a senior currently and while I've done everything career services has told me to do, (including attending career fairs, networking) etc. I've been having a terrible time finding employment for after graduation.

My former roommate got stuck in London back in March, since he was back home during university spring break.  Long story short, he completed his masters program remotely in the UK and I need to ship his belongings back to him since it's unlikely he will be able to enter to US for months.

USPS is the cheapest at ~$600, but I am totally lost when it comes to filling out the customs form.  It's just his personal belongings like clothes, books, shoes, etc., but it seems the customs form is all geared toward commercial items.

Penn's Math Department is Making MATH104 Harder During a Global Pandemic,"Disclaimer/Context: I hate it when people complain about school just because ""it's hard"". Yes, Penn is hard. That being said, I love calculus and worked hard to enjoy the subject. I was a good student in calculus in high school. I took Honors Calculus II senior year, and my placement score on the Math Diagnostic this year was borderline with MATH104 and MATH114. So I decided to take MATH104 because it fit my interests better, and it was good for review just incase I wasn't fully ready for MATH 114. Yet, I never expected to be baffled during my first week of ""Calculus 1"" in college. The class started off with Taylor Series, a concept taught at the end of Calculus BC. We are now learning Big-O Notation, a concept commonly used in CS, not in ""Calculus 1"". MATH 104 has **never** started off like this before. This begs the question: why change the curriculum during a global pandemic?

Recently, Professor Gressman responded to many students' concerns about MATH104. Essentially, his letter asserted that the Math Department intends to keep the updated curriculum, and all students can succeed. What Professor Gressman does not recognize is that in the midst of a global pandemic, many students cannot succeed with the structure of this course being so drastically changed. Many of us were tricked into taking a Calculus course that we thought would be a continuation/transition of AB Calculus into BC Calculus. While Professor Gressman may be right in that students can learn the material, **it is unreasonable to ask students to learn a completely new version of Calculus I during a global pandemic**.

Consider this: MATH104 currently operates by teaching students via free YouTube videos online. The University is charging over $50k a semester for Zoom tuition. MATH104 is a ""flipped class"", meaning that the TA's and Professors don't spend much time teaching the concepts, but rather assume that we have a good understanding of the concepts already before coming to class. This structure of the class is incredibly flawed; students cannot learn as well via these confusing YouTube videos. If the University were learning in person, one could argue that these changes to the MATH104 curriculum could be bearable to students. **But for those struggling in this pandemic, YouTube videos do not cut it. We are missing key concepts because we lack the in person interactions which smooths out confusion when learning a new topic.** Given the incredible circumstances, now is not the time to fundamentally change the curriculum of MATH104. Considering that even Professor Rimmer, one of Penn's best math professors, is confused from the curriculum change, I think it is safe to say that students do not deserve this unfair adjustment in a period where many are struggling from factors external from classes.

I appreciate Professor Gressman's address to our concerns, but I genuinely do not think it is an adequate response. Please, Math Department, do better.

EDIT: To those who say that the concepts we are currently learning are manageable, I ask you to consider this: You are a freshman just entering college, and the last concept you learned were applications of integrals. According to the Penn's diagnostic exam, you are strongly encouraged to take MATH104, maybe even MATH114! Okay, so you enroll in the class. Imagine on the **very first day**, you are introduced to Taylor Series, a concept that according to Penn's own diagnostic exam, you didn't have to know to enroll in the course! Is that fair now? It's easier to say that the content is easy to learn **after** you learn some basics of Calculus and the concepts **leading up** to Taylor Series. But **starting** with Taylor Series / Big O Notation via free YouTube videos is not fair **when we still have not been taught the foundations**.",1600034458,0,0

I've been sad since I've got here and I'm not sure that'll change.,"Sophomore here and let's just say, it's been rough. Freshman year ended up miserable, doing poorly in my classes, spending long nights in the library, not having any friends after around October, skipping club meetings to cry in my room, and honestly having that sigh of relief after my last final knowing I wouldn't have to listen to my hallmates nag about how antisocial I became. I even ditched work once purely and walked into the city for no reason because I couldn't stop beating myself down about failing yet another midterm. My roommate would call me hardworking, not knowing that all my late nights and dinners spent in VanPelt were because I didn't feel comfortable being in our room because of their comments and that more often that not my studying never truly paid off. I made it out of that semester and was doing pretty well in the spring, joining clubs, doing well in my classes, making time for myself, and overall being the happiest I could be byy myself. When everything went online, life definitely changed, but I was content with it. Sure I lost some time on campus (which I now miss more than anything) but at least I could have someone to talk to and didn't have to worry too much about all the little things. I'd say that semester went well for me, I still got a B in one of my classes, but overall, I felt much more positive about things and was looking forward to the fall.

Long story short, I stayed home, thinking that whatever I had in the last chunk of spring would be the same. It's not. I've had a weeks worth of lectures and material to cover in a few short days. Mandatory classes seem pointless to me, I feel like I'm not learning anything and that there's much more work that's not done during class/instructional time (I mean cmon you expect me to watch your three fourty minute lecture outside of class then come to class for three hours a week to do worksheets and such). I simply feel as if I'm just dragging myself through classes and doing the work because I have to. Time management hasn't been a struggle and I still have work and other commitments, but I haven't felt so burnt out and sad so quickly. Even making friends has been hard, I went to a few GBMs this week and felt so left out of the loop. Everyone seems to have their groups and have their friends and I'm just sitting there smiling, waiting to see if things will be better, only for me to slip out when they inevitably don't.

I'm not saying Penn is a bad school. I love Penn. I love the campus, the libraries, the academics, the opportunities. I love exploring Philly, love everything about it. But, in my year or so of being here, I've never felt such overwhelming sadness and now it's too late for me to transfer or do anything about it. And trust me, I'm not some antisocial hermit. I'm used to being surrounded by people, going to parties, having fun, grabbing dinners with pals (or at least that's how it was during high school until around NSO)

This isn't meant to be anything bad about the school, just my experience, I don't blame Penn, I don't blame the people. I just feel that people need to know that they're not alone when it comes to feeling this way and that there are people that pretend to have it together where in reality they don't.

Feeling Stressed and Lost? Join Our Free Two Day Self Growth Seminar!,"Hey everyone, 

I am a senior at the University of Connecticut and over the past few months my team and I along with the sociology department at UConn have been working hard to develop a workshop to help college students attain more meaningful and purposeful lives. Given the stress of COVID-19 and the lack of mental health resources available at many schools across the nation, I invite each of you to join our two day seminar and meet college students from across the nation as you develop the skills needed to live a more meaningful life. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Posted below are more details about the seminar: 

How can one attain a meaningful life without knowing what it is that they value? 

In this webinar, we will demonstrate that many people live their lives without the framework necessary to achieve true purpose. We will help you identify a set of “core values,” and demonstrate how to live your life according to your self-identified value structure so as to realize a meaningful life.

This webinar will take place over two, 45 minute zoom meetings. You must attend the first meeting in order to join the second. In between meetings you will be given one, ten minute reflective assignment to support your growth and learning.

Meeting 1: Thursday, Sept. 24th from 5:00pm to 5:45pm

Meeting 2: Saturday, Sept. 26th from 5:00pm to 5:45pm

Penn Friends-Making App Launch!,"Hey! You may remember my post from about a week ago about Berri–the anonymous live-matching app for friendships at Penn. I'm excited to announce that we've officially launched the app at \[berri.io\](https://berri.io,) so you can start matching and connecting with nearly 1k fellow Penn students!

It's real disheartening seeing all these posts about FOMO and loneliness; remember you're never alone, and that your fellow Penn students have your back! We hope that this app can be a ton of fun and provide a new way to meet new Quakers you wouldn't be able to meet before, and take your mind off a stressful virtual semester. It's also a real fun way to guess who's who among your friends ;). If you have any feedback or questions, please contact us at support@berri.io, or click on the Suggestions tab once you login!",1599521206,1,0

MATH Credit Away During the Semester?,"Hey all,

Given how bad MATH 114 is at Penn and the monstrosity that is the internal credit exam, I'm looking for alternative ways to get credit for MATH 114. The department website says that I can ""Take a Calculus course, during the regular academic year (Fall or Spring semester) at another College or University, and receive a grade of C+ or better"" to receive credit. The department also explicitly states that taking a calculus course at another school over the summer will not be accepted.

However, College and Wharton policy state that ""Any courses taken after matriculation must be taken during the summer unless the credit is completed at a Penn-approved study abroad program.""

These are contradictory statements. I want to be able to take Calculus III (the MATH 114 equivalent) at another school and receive credit for it. Does anyone have experience with doing something similar? If so, I'd appreciate some explanation in the comments. Thanks!",1599511438,1,0

International Student Applying to UPenn ED with financial aid,"Hey everyone!

So I'll be applying to UPenn ED this November for the Class of 2025. 

I am an international student who will apply for financial aid (for most of the tuition, probably). 

I am in the full IB DP and have 44/45 predicted (HL: 7,7,7. SL: 7,7,6). I've had pretty good grades throughout high school but my extra-curriculars are pretty mediocre. 

Considering I'm international with financial aid (need-aware), what do you guys think about my chance of getting accepted?

Last year, the acceptance rate for UPenn ED was 18% (some years, it was over 20%, like 22% and 24%), and I'm assuming mine would cut down to about half (max. 10%), considering my circumstances. Would it actually be way lower, like 5%? I'm really worried cuz I'm not sure if it'll be worth all the time and effort to apply if it would only be the chance of winning a lottery. 

Also, if any of you got into UPenn with financial aid and is international, could you PLEASE tell me briefly about your stats, or what part you think your application was strongest? It would be VERY VERY appreciated.",1599502592,1,0

CIS 515 or math for machine learning in general,"I want to take CIS 515 but when I looked at the first chapter of book/ first videos on vector space I simply had no idea what’s going on. 

Full disclosure: I only took single variable calculus in undergrad like 6 years ago, don’t remember anything, never learned linear algebra. I took 519 last year and studied linear algebra on my own for a little bit and ended up doing well in the class. However, I also realized my math def is not enough for me to go far in ML so I want to make up for that by taking 515.

But the first week video and homework already discouraged me... I’m not sure if I should take another lower level linear algebra class, or stick with it...
 (I saw there are like 3 undergrad calculus class and 1 linear algebra that has the calculus III as prerequisite. My level is probably just above calculus I right now)

What do you suggest? I don’t want to be a researcher, but a machine learning engineer sounds like a good career path to me",1599437056,1,0

College Loneliness/Meeting New People,"Hey y’all,

My team and I are currently working on an app that makes the process of meeting new people easier for students during the pandemic. We want to have people meet that new person who they can vibe and talk to during in spite of online courses. With the help of 500 user responses and several psychology papers, we created a unique profile outline that should match people based on the most important traits. We have deployed a website to gather actual user responses to match and are trying to test and validate our matching algorithm and require people to help us by reviewing their matches. By no means, is our algorithm final and we would love people who are honest and willing to help us out. To make our app a safer place we are restricting it to only college student so we **require .edu emails.**
