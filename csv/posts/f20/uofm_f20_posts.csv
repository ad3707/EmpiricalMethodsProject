I'm starting to worry that after next semester I'll be behind as far as building a resume and networking.

[UofM Student Startup] Learn web development in two weeks.,"Hey all! I'm a Sophomore @ UofM building a better way to learn to code. 

Over the summer, a few Michigan students &amp; I launched a two-week cohort, where we brought together students who were interested in gaining practical skills in web development. Since then, we've grown to over 200+ cohort members and hundreds of project completions, and we're only getting started. 

This isn't an online course. Instead, it's a **two-week interactive cohort** where you'll build **three projects in HTML/CSS/JS** and learn how to interact with APIs, work with databases, deploy web apps and more — all within a supportive **community** of fellow students &amp; mentors. The cohort is designed specifically for **beginners** and starts this **Sunday, December 6th.** We've had students of all majors join the cohort (STEM, business, pre-med, humanities, etc.) and get a lot of value out of the experience. 

Normally, the cohort costs way more for professionals (we've had non-technical folks at Microsoft/Github/Stripe take the cohort), but we wanted to make it 90% off just for Michigan students over this winter break to make our program accessible to everyone. You can [learn more here.](https://enlight.nyc/courses/web-development/?ref=michigan-eecs-281)

A note on finals and such: the first project (personal website) is super easy and we guide you through the process so it won't take up too much of your time (time commitment is less than an hour a day!). After the first project, most (if not all) of your finals should be over.",1607011753,1,0

A Not So Great Semester,"A short rant about this semester. 

I’m not sure how I have classes that have managed to stack up due dates in the perfect way in order to ruin my time this entire semester.

Why as soon as I’m done with those projects I need to grind for 281 again? Oh wait a midterm within 2 days of those projects? Gotta spend time studying for that, oh wait now I’m behind on the last grind of my project and need to take a late day. Oh shit out of late days, and back into the shit grind. 

What kind of shit semester has made me feel like I’m always in grind mode, makes me feel like shit for working less than 8 hours as a day off, and makes it so I can’t leave my room (love COVID).

So, I'm working at my job so I can pay for school, but, because I'm spending so much time working, I'm not doing well in my classes, and I'm afraid that my financial aid might get decreased due to my poor grades, which just further fucks me over :/

Mental Breakdown,"This morning I saw an email that my professor from last semester passed away. The news struck me so hard since she was a life-changing teacher for me. Before transfering to michigan, I never thought about studying pure math, but in the last semester at my previous institution, her teaching and passion made me realize how beautiful this subject can be and I switched to math major at UM.

What distressed me the most is the sudden and unexpected nature of the whole event. Everything happened after she was diagnosed a few weeks ago. I never thought this would have happened cuz she was so young as a scholar and energetic and passionate and all the memories with her were so real and close. In this summer, I even saw her virtually visiting UM math department to give grad students lectures on random matrices. I took both her and her husband's classes and enjoyed both. There are photos of them and their children on their teaching websites. For me, she was a model of academic brilliance and domestic devotion. This fall semester she and her family were at the university of oxford to be a visiting professor. And now I cant imagine how devastated her husband and children were on a foreign land. It is just hard to believe that all of a sudden everything's changed forever.

I have been extremely stressful since I saw the news and tried to look for mental services. Never since the start of covid had I felt so upset and disturbed by the fact that someone I loved and respected might leave me forever unanticipated. Also as an international student I haven't seen my family for a year and expect that I will not be able to see them at least till next summer or even 2022. I live alone in my apartment since my roommate moved out two months ago. I just went through several finals and am still waitlisting for classes for the winter semester. All these factors are pushing me to the brink of a mental breakdown. But the school mental services had stopped with the fall semester ending, so I will appreciate it if anyone could give me some advice on coping with the distress or finding other mental services. Thank you!",1608328132,107,0

The only thing I think I have going for me is that the project was only building a linked list, something that is a very common thing to do in the CS field so I guess it’s possible that somebody did it the same way I did???? I guess I’ll have to wait for the details of my violation layer.

Questions to MS CS students (Online),"Hey everyone! Congrats on your finals.

I was just accepted into the online masters in Computer Science. I have some questions - hoping to hear back from people in the program:

1. What are your general thoughts about the teaching staff?

2. Is this a strictly 1 campus course or can you take classes from other campuses if they're offered online? (in Florida it was possible with permissions)

3. Are there any publicly available materials from the core classes? Sample homeworks / tests / lectures - anything that's **not against academic honesty**. I can usually gauge a class in seconds by looking at its actual material rather than official syllabus.

4. What is an acceptable workload for someone working full time? In other words - if a class is 3 credit hours, how much time would you reasonably need to spend on it every week?

5. There's a ton of conflicting opinions about UMich campuses and their quality of teaching / resulting diplomas. For someone who can only do DL, main campus doesn't offer much. Is this something to be worried about? (MS CS Online is offered by the Flint campus)

6. More hands on or coding on paper?

7. Exams - understanding or memorizing?

8. Any other advice?

9. I have been asked to complete one fast track course in something that's been my expertise for over a decade. Should I ask about possibly recognizing my experience instead or will that be frowned upon?

Bio 172 and my future...,"howdy. T-30 min until my bio 172 final and I really am just sitting here. Debating whether I should even go into medicine. Or biology. or even be here at all. I did relatively alright in high school, got here, and all of my classes felt like a drag this year. I just did the math and found out that unless I somehow ace this final that I have barely studied for, then I'm not getting anything higher than a B. This is killing me but I feel like shit too much to care. Will this even matter? Does any of it matter? 

I know that med school is hard work. But is it the only way in which I can survive as a biologist? People keep telling me that I can live with a PhD but I'm still nervous. None of that matters if I flunk out first though, I guess. I want to be a pathologist or a medical examiner. That requires an MD, so I'm not sure why I keep looking at PhD paths alongside them. I feel as if no matter what I do I'm setting myself up to fail. I'd be surprised if I somehow get higher than a 70 on this final. Then what? God, imagine being one of your high school's token ""biology kids"" and then getting bent over by an introductory course. embarrassing. 

I'm probably spiraling but I just needed to vent and maybe get some advice. I'll probably have more clarity post-exam because what-ifs aren't always the best.",1608075433,1,0

Mindset. (Story of how I found motivation for my chem 130 final),"I was doing near perfect in chem 130. Had a 98% after 2 midterms. Thanksgiving break and I thought nothing could go wrong. That was when I chose to do nothing to prepare for midterm 3. Didn’t even watch the lectures. 

Got slapped in the face with a 40% score. Near the lowest in the class. Lowered my grade to a 78%, a B with the chem curve. 

That was when I really started doubting myself. I had dropped out of Math 116 after getting cocky and getting my shit kicked in for it. I’m taking it again at WCC, but that’s not the point. 

Point is that I had failed a math exam, and then I failed a chem exam. What’s next, my other classes? The finals? My semester? 

I doubted myself. I didn’t believe I was meant for Michigan. My dad gave me the only advice he knows because of the way he was raised: 
“Figure it out.” 

I had near broken down on Sunday, when the final for chem was Friday.  If I failed this, I would have to repeat chem 130 as well as math 116. My dad would not let me live it down.

I got a call from a friend a year above me, and he told me what my issue was: I had no motivation. 

He asked me of what I’m working for.
I said a good grade.
He said no, I wasn’t.
I asked him what he meant.
He said that I’m working through all these dumb boring classes to get to the good stuff, to get to my major, to develop my passion, to get to my dream job. The grades are only a few steps to help me to my final goal.

He then ended with, “as long as you go to bed everyday feeling a little better about yourself, a little more confident about your final, a little more like the you that you want to be, then you’re doing just what you need to do.”

That’s what he meant when he asked what I’m working for. I was working hard now so that I can be happy in the future. One class at a time, I’ll get there. 

I worked with study groups for the next four days straight (with math out of the way it was all I had to study for). Every day, I sat down at my desk and worked to make answer sheets for all the midterms, for all the practice finals. Every night I still doubted myself, but I kept reminding myself what I’m working for. I worked to learn all of midterm 3’s content in time for the final.

When the final arrived, I felt calm. Throughout the final, when I started to panic, I took a deep breath, and continued to feel calm. After the final, I felt calm. 

The grades came around, and my final overall was a 80.03, equivalent of a B+ in the class. I had pulled it off, even if it was by a hair. It may not have been the 98% I once had, but it certainly wasn’t the D- I had envisioned.

I cried. Sure, it’s embarrassing to say, but it was tears of happiness. This final was proof that with hard work, and more importantly, the right mindset, I can eventually reach what I’m aiming for. 

I didn’t have much point of writing this here. I just wanted to get it out there, since after I told my pops, he asked me what GPA I needed to get straight into a graduate program. I know he cares, and I know we all will eventually get to where we want to get, but let me have this victory please...

For anyone reading this and struggling, hopefully my story will help you find your drive/motivation to work hard too. I feel pretty confident that I’ll have the motivation to work through next semester because of the life skills I’ve discovered and memories (like this one) I’ve made this first semester. I hope I can be that friend to at least one of you that need to be reminded what you came to Michigan for. 

You deserve to be here. Don’t ever doubt that.

The RA compensation policy adversely affects low-income students. How can we change this?,"Dear fellow Wolverines, 

The University of Michigan tries to be diverse in many ways. The University has policies and programs available to students of different races, genders, sexual orientations, and ethnicities to try provide extra support to these groups while also promoting diversity on campus. 

One aspect in which the University fails to promote diversity is with low-income students. Yes, the University provides outstanding financial aid to in-state low-income students, but I fear that much of that support ends at the financial aid office. 

At this time, the student population does not have much diversity in terms of economic status. We have a disproportionally large number of high-income students, with a disproportionally low number of low-income students. The policies and actions on campus by administrators do not acknowledge this gap or try to provide more assistance to close this gap. 

A policy that clearly adversely affects low-income students is the policy in which Resident Advisors (RA) are compensated. RAs, according to the [Housing website](https://jobs.housing.umich.edu/job-descriptions/undergraduate-traditional-resident-advisor-traditional-ra/), work 20 hours per week during the school year, and work more than 20 hours during training, move-in, and move-out. As compensation, the University provides RAs room and board, worth (according to the Office of Financial Aid) $12,034. 

On paper, this opportunity seems great. When you do the math, RAs are paid a good wage hourly. But, the RAs never see the money they recieve, and its instead directed to ""rent"" for their room. This is not the issue with compensation for RAs, the issue lies with how the compensation is distributed to students.

When a student is hired as an RA, they will see a charge on their student account for the price of housing. This is charged just like any other student living in the dorms: through wolverine access, just like tuition. The RA then receives a scholarship from housing worth the same amount as the room and board cost. This is their pay, their compensation, for working the year as a Resident Advisor. 

If the transaction ended here, all would be fine. The issue is that the Office of Financial Aid notices this housing scholarship, factors it into the student's financial aid package, and then **lowers any other grants the student receieves from the University of Michigan.** In effect, the student is actually losing money that they would have if they were not an RA just because they became an RA.

Now, how does this impact low-income students, you might ask? Well, first let's look at a student who does not recieve any University of Michigan grants. They receive that housing scholarship in full, and nothing else changes on their financial aid package. They are paid in advance for their service in full. A low-income student, on the other hand, is paid as well, but then loses money from other University scholarships. This policy effectively discriminates against low-income students and pays them less for the work done as an RA. 

When working a job, you should not expect that job to hurt your financial aid. As a low-income student, your wage from the dining hall will not be factored into financial aid and decrease your scholarships from the University. So why is this the case for housing?

This policy discourages low-income students from becoming an RA. The language on the Housing website even acknowledges this disparity: ""Please consult with the Office of Financial Aid to determine how the job compensation may impact your award package"". At information sessions last year, speakers encouraged students to talk to Financial Aid before applying because housing would not have to waste their time on revewing your application should you realize that the compensation is not just. 

Personally, I recieve a refund from the University that I use for off-campus housing. While it does not cover all of my expenses, I would only have to work 25 hours per month to cover the rest. If I were to become an RA, working 20 hours a week, I will have to pay $750 per semester to cover the loss in scholarships. How would becoming an RA actually make me pay more to the University out of pocket?

High-income students do not have to worry about the loss in scholarships because of the RA grant. Low-income students do. This, like I said, creates an incentive for low-income students to not become RAs. This creates a problem in the dorms as there are limited amounts of low-income RAs who are able to connect with residents who are in a similar position as the low-income RAs might've faced. 

I hope this makes sense. If there are any questions at this point, please let me know. 

Now, how do we fix this discriminatory policy? 

After speaking with students from two other Universities, I think I have come up with a couple of solutions:  
1) Give RAs room and board without charging their student account or applying for a scholarship on their student account. This will completely solve the issue of Financial Aid redistribution students' packages because of the Housing RA Compensation. Why do we have to go through financial aid and billing to give the student their housing? If you charge the student the same amount you compensate, then no money was really even transacted. Why could housing not just give the student the dorm room without charging them and compensating them for it? 

2) Another solution we have would be to prevent the Office of Financial Aid from redistributing a students' financial aid package because of the Housing RA Compensation. After all, why should students be punished because they found a job and are working? 

3) Finally, the last solution would be to allow the University to still charge RAs for housing through billing, but compensate RAs with the same amount outside of the scholarship. Compensating them with cash, for example, would allow the RA to pay for housing using the cash at hand instead of a scholarship that will adversely affect their financial aid. 

Now that I've laid out the problems and potential solutions, what do you think? Does the Housing policy hurt low-income students? Do you agree with the solutions? And, most importantly, **how can we get the University to change this policy?**

Who can we speak to in order to get this fixed? Will it ever be changed? 

Let me know if there are any questions I can answer for you.",1602000547,1,0

I hope this club can help fill that gap and maybe make the onboarding process in a career of this nature more enjoyable if you have none or minimal past Excel experience. Figured this club would work as follows:

1. Classroom sessions Learning Basics of Excel; Pivot Tables, Graphs, VLookups, Match, Index, Scenario Manager, Financial Functions, etc.
2. Applying this to real situations, ex. Receiving broken data, learning to manipulate it and make it meaningful and accurate
3. Might sound super nerdy lol, but hosting competitions like who can maneuver around Excel and complete different tasks in Excel the quickest without using a mouse (Sharpening skillset of using shortcut keys)
4. Last is TBD, but maybe dive into VBA

How to deal with unrealistic/lack of expectations for assignments?,"One of my classes is largely focused on in-class group work. We have 20 mins. per class to discuss ~7-9 questions as a group, type up a paragraph or so for each in a google doc, and submit it before going back to the larger class to discuss. I’m used to this kind of work although i’m not used to classes where this is all we do every class aside from goi  my back to the larger group and then answering the questions yet again. 

Since this is such a focus of the class, these google docs submissions make up 15% of the final grade. My group has consistently gotten 4.5/5. This isn’t a bad grade certainly, but I’m used to participation/group work being more graded on effort and sitting with close to 100% in that category so I can worry about the other categories of grading. I talked to my professor after class today and asked what my group could do to raid our grades as we were all confused by this (she never laid out any expectations for group work) and rather than list specific feedback, she said that she generally has a “pass-fail” idea in her mind and gives mostly 4.5 unless a group goes “above and beyond” (shockingly she didn’t explain what above and beyond meant to her). She also told me that only one submission has gotten a 5 this semester. That’s out of 4 classes where we’ve had to submit and there’s 8-10 groups so out of ~30 assignments only one has been good enough to warrant more than a 90%. 

I tried to express to her that it is difficult to be told that there’s essentially no way to raise my grade in this category that’s worth 15% of my final grade, and she responded “I’m gonna do what I’m gonna do. I know things are tough with group work due to COVID and time constraints, but I’ve seen it done in the past”

Any advice for dealing with this? I know a 90% in one category of my final grade won’t kill me, but if this is any indication, she seems to be a pretty tough grader and I’m a bit concerned that when I expressed interest in how to improve in her class she essentially told me to fuck off.",1601912775,1,0

Spent 3 days writing the wrong paper,"First year master student here who just needs to vent out because I don’t know who to reach out too.

Basically I’ve spent the last three days writing a policy memo for class thats due Monday night. I have several other papers due Monday night as well. I thought this paper was pretty straightforward, there wasn’t a huge description of how they wanted the paper done so I thought I understood the concept. It wasn’t until I finished the paper that I logged on Canvas &amp; saw an example from last year of what the paper was supposed to be. Wasn’t formatted like mine at all. Barely had the same concept going on either. I haven’t started any of my other projects yet and I just wasted three days on this.

Overwhelmed,"I'm a student in chemical engineering and I just don't know if I belong in ChE, engineering, or even college at all. It just doesn't feel like I was meant to be in engineering but this is something I care about and am passionate about so I can't even see myself changing to a different major because I don't know what I would do instead. On top of school being shit the world seems to be constantly on fire, and the election approaching is giving me so much anxiety and stress that I just want to curl up and go to sleep because it would be better than dealing with this shit. I truly feel like I have reached my breaking point.

For anyone saying ""just switch majors man!"" I don't have the money to stay in school any longer than the 4 years I signed up for, I'm too far in this major to think about switching, so even practically speaking I don't think I could switch even if I didn't enjoy this major. Everything just sucks and I just feel completely hopeless like there's no point to continue on in school so I should just drop out.

This is a bit of the rant but I guess I will explain why I feel like this. The years before this I've struggled with my mental health and transitioning to college, but this year I started going to talk therapy and I have all around had a much better start to my year (going to classes regularly, going to discussion, turning in homework mostly completed and on time which are things I fucked up in previous years) and I thought that I was actually somewhat intelligent and that if I worked hard and didn't have the mental health struggles I would be on top of my game. 

I mean shit last semester one of my professors straight up told me that he believed I could be an A+, 4.0 gpa student if I just worked harder and got treatment for my mental health stuff. For context: I went from scoring 0s on the homeworks and the exams and managed to come back and get 5 points over the average score on the final exam --&gt; which was what my professors said I needed to pass (this was for my major specific classes since I was performing equally bad in both). 

One of the professors went as far as to say he legitimately had never seen a student pull off a comeback like that and I was the first to do that: So I was pretty confident if I just got off on the proper foot, dealt with my mental health issues, and made sure to consistently attend class and take advantage of all the resources provided that I would be an A+ student. I mean I made that comeback last semester despite COVID-19 fucking everything up.

But instead I've found, after the first test and the first exam for my two major-specific classes, class 1 and 2 respectively, that I am thoroughly average even when I am working my ass off. I studied extremely hard for the first test and managed to get 1/2 a point underneath the average score whereas people I know that spent half the time studying got double my score (and had the audacity to say they did ""bad"" when they were 1 point off the top fucking score) despite the fact I was teaching those very same people the content for this class in office hours. 

The other class I'm in, we had our first exam, and our professor designs the exam so that it is impossible to finish so it doesn't even feel like I have a chance to show that I do know the material. 

Basically he puts like 4 questions that take 45 minutes to an hour to complete each but only gives us 2 hours to finish the exam -- therefore turning the exam into a goddamn speed run. Despite the fact I knew how to do every question on the exam -- I only finished one question and maybe 1/5-2/5 (each question had five parts) of questions 2-4 whereas the classmates I have spoken to have told me they finished 3 out of 4, or in some cases all but 1 part of 1 question. I don't have a mental illness or something that prevents me from working fast ( I mean I have anxiety so i guess but not really?) so I doubt I could get an SSD for it. I personally just have trouble working in high pressure situations and despite knowing how to do every problem I just couldn't fucking finish because he purposely did not give us enough time.

It just feels like the deck is stacked against me. Even in the class where I know I know the material I get fucked just because I can't speed run the exam. I study hard, I stay up all night studying, I don't play video games anymore, I don't hang out with my friends when they actually do fun stuff only seeing them when we study together, I don't work out, I don't drink, I don't party, all I fucking do is study, go to class, eat, sleep, shower, and go to therapy once a week, and all I get is a C for that I get the ""honor"" that I didn't fucking fail again like I always do. 

One of my classes, class 1, is just plain difficult, and I accept that and I have been trying so hard: going to tutoring, going to office hours, talking to the professor and going to his office hours etc and to their credit the teaching staff is great and they are so helpful and really help me out with the content. But I still get a C when I know I should be at the A level but I literally just can't spend anymore time working on the class than I already do. 

The other class, class 2, is a different story. The class is artificially made hard for no reason, for example: our professor has admitted to us flat out that sometimes he will give us homeworks that have material that he won't cover until after the homeworks are due and that we have to ""use other resources to figure it out"", this is the same class where the exams are speed runs, and finally he also flat out told us that sometimes he will just skip material but put that material on the homeworks and we are expected to figure it out even though every class before this, even class 1 that we are in right now at the same time, we have been told the material we see on the homework is what we saw in class.

All of this capped off with the fact that I can't get a job or an internship anywhere because I'm simply told ""your GPA isn't high enough"". Even when I had a good gpa they still didn't think it was high enough despite the fact I had an internship experience (from a CivE company) and research experience on top of my gpa being ""good"". So I don't even know for sure if I will enjoy working in industry or not because I can't find any internships that will have me.

Meanwhile the advice I get for improving my grades is that I'm told simply to ""work with other people in the class"" but most of my classmates, except a handful here or there, completely ignore me despite the fact that last year I tried my hardest to try to connect with them despite not really having similar interests and struggled to find someone who I truly got along with and that wanted to work with me. This is even harder now thanks to good ole COVID-19. 

This is not to say I have no friends, I have friends at UofM and even in UofM engineering but none of them are in ChE with me so they can't really help me with homework because the content they learn is not quite the same as what we learn (or they simply don't have the same classes at the same time). On top of that since I am in one of the smaller engineering majors, and despite the fact I don't know everyone in my major, I do know a large chunk of the total cohort: and the people I do know are entitled rich alcoholic (some of them at least) assholes who get upset that they got an A instead of an A+ while I have to bust my ass to just get a C which just makes me feel even more like I'm a fucking idiot who is in over my head. I know classmates who, in the past, would go out drinking the night before an exam (while I would be in my dorm grinding) only for them to get the high score and for me to be fucking average as always -- which again just makes me realize that maybe I am a fucking fool.

As I said some of the classmates I have gotten to know are not that bad, but a lot of them entitled as fuck and just kind of toxic to be around which is the icing on the shit cake. Out of everyone I know there are a handful people I know aren't that entitled or assholes or whatever, but I can't exactly call anyone a friend right now: maybe that will change this semester or next but who knows.

For example they got mad at the professor for class 1 because they claimed he didn't care about his students all because he said he thought we learned a concept in high school physics that a lot of people didn't learn in physics, they also got mad at the same professor (class 1) because the test was extremely difficult claiming he was artificially inflating the difficulty even though 1) I know he isn't because he flat out told me in office hours that his goal is not to try to ""trick us"" and 2) he said he would curve it and those same people ended up scoring the top score on that test. 

Meanwhile these same people who complain about that professor ignore the fact that professor 2 for class 2 flat out admitted he makes the class hard for no reason other than to ""challenge"" us even though we are past the fucking weed out stage. They spend all this time bashing professor 1 but that professor is trying their best to make the class easier when they can so it just makes me upset to see them get bashed by my classmates behind their back, and just makes it a lot harder for me to want to try to befriend my classmates because I feel like it speaks to their character (or maybe lack of character) that they would complain and attack a professor just because his class his hard even though that professor is trying their best to make it easier for us.

They went on to claim that professor 1 was making the class hard because he introduced a concept not covered in the math classes we have taken before this, except for the fact that he told us 

1. We would never have to solve what he was showing us merely just set it up which we definitely did learn before this class
2. If we were asked to solve it we would be given a sheet with solutions so we could just plug in the solution after setting it up and 
3. And finally, the fact that he literally asked in lecture if we had seen it before or not because he didn't know.

This same professor that they complain about talked to me for almost an hour 1 on 1 outside of office hours because I was concerned about my performance -- meanwhile when I asked the professor for class 2 (the one these people seem to like better for some reason) for the same thing he spoke to me for 5 minutes 1 on 1 at the tail end of an office hours despite the fact I asked him for time not during office hours, because I had a lot to ask about, and was seeing him because I wanted to ask him about studying tactics for his class, his expectations, and ways I could improve. Not to mention that the professor for class 2 didn't even fucking remember my name when he first started talking to me during office hours, and got me confused with a student who's name sounds nothing like mine.

I talk about my classmates so much because like I said at the start I just don't feel like I fucking belong and they make me feel like I don't fucking belong which sucks when an important aspect is  collaboration with classmates. 

It is just hard to understand why I am doing this major when: my grades are shit, most of the classmates I know personally are shit, 1/2 of my professors are shit, and I can't even get a fucking job or internship, meanwhile my classmates post about how they are working at Pfizer and BP and all the big names in this major. But I can't get anything anywhere because my gpa is shit and I probably won't improve it at all this semester despite the fact I need all A's this semester or the scholarship keeping me at UofM gets taken away (they told me this semester is my last chance to get my gpa up). 

On top of that the world is fucking on fire, I'm worrying if I will have enough money to make my rent (even though I ended up not coming back bc of COVID) because my therapy isn't covered by my insurance because American healthcare is a fucking trainwreck, I can't fucking go anywhere because I live in a hotspot my parents berate me for anything under an A (which trust me was great when I got a D in one of my classes last year), and meanwhile (as another post said) Professor Michigan still wants his goddamn essay on time. 

TLDR: I guess I should just drop out because I don't know how I am going to get the grades I need this semester, and my major clearly just doesn't fucking want me in it.",1601767690,1,0

Additionally, I am coming from a high school experience where I've gone to school with almost the same group of people for years and still haven't found my ""group"". I've heard people say that you can get lost going to a school with 30k undergrad, but I've also heard that at medium-sized elite schools (WashU, Vandy, Harvard, Yale) might not have a balanced group of students that focus on a social life just as much as academics.

Does anyone get overwhelmed with planning their future for post graduation (undergrad)?,"I personally don’t have much trouble with school work itself. I have good time management skill, I do my assignments and readings and study before exams. But I am getting stressed the fuck out by trying to figure what I wanna do after graduation, because I don’t know what kinda career that I am passionate about. I don’t know if should look into grad schools like PA/PT schools or just look for a job. I basically have to do preparations for every path that might be available, so not only do I have to do my normal school work (which is vigorous enough) and struggle to have a social life that is pretty much nonexistent for transfer student like me at this point, I also have to plan to study and take the GRE, look for grad schools, get clinic and volunteer hours, AND try to build career networks just in case I decide grad school is not for me.

Unnecessary Fees for Remote Students in Winter 21 - Why are we paying for things we can’t use?,"After looking over my account finances today in preparation to pay the arm and leg it costs me to attend UM as an out of state student, I was a little off put by a few fees that are being charged to student accounts. I understand some fees are necessary and extremely beneficial to students, like legal services, and many others that anyone at u of m can use at any time, remote or not; however, there are some fees in my opinion that are completely ridiculous where students that are remote (which is the majority) cannot even attain the benefits from paying these fees. 

Lab fees - students in labs are still required to pay a lab fee, even though a majority of labs for classes have announced that they will be completely remote, regardless of being on or off campus. It is my understanding that the lab fee goes towards purchasing materials that the students in the class can use throughout the semester, but now that labs are remote, labs often results in just watching a prerecorded video of a profession performing the lab himself. 

Rec Sports - a large potion of a $65 fee goes to Recreation and Sports, which has been nonexistent in the first semester aside from opening the IM, NCRB, and CCRB (even these buildings were closed for half of the semester). This fee seems unnecessary as minimal programming was done during the fall semester, and remote students will not even be able to utilize these campus resources for winter semester. 

Covid Health and Safety Fee - a $50 fee was put in place at the beginning of the year which went to “goodie bags” that contained a a few bandanas, masks, and a bottle of hand sanitizer for students. In addition, the funding would help with accessible student testing, even though that fell short during the fall semester. Students who are remote should not have to pay this fee as they cannot utilize the benefits of free testing to students and other health and safety measures that would be taken for on campus students. 

Basically, I just wanted to point out what I think is just another way for departments to retain money during covid. I am ready to hear “it’s only a couple hundred bucks, why are you so uptight”, but my argument to this is coming from out of state, where little to no financial aid is ever given, a couple hundred bucks is worth saving and can maybe be put towards something else like my textbooks, especially for those in greater need than myself. 

TL;DR: Students should look at their account history and look for unnecessary fees that don’t make sense because the university is hemorrhaging money. Try and dispute these with campus finances, departments, etc. and it very well may save you a few hundred bucks.",1609390285,1,0

r/uofm is ranked second best university subreddit! (half shit post),"As I was applying to college this year, I visited a lot of universities subreddits. Even if there are some memes you find everywhere, I was hit by all the little specificities. So, as I only have a few days left to complete my applications, I was thinking, why not spoil the little time I have left  by ranking universities subreddits? 

1. UCLA ( r/ucla): LA kids are roasting anything that breaths: Berkeley, USCC, UCSD, their own university... It is one of the most active university subreddits, with a wide range of quality content.  

2. University of Michigan's ( r/uofm) subreddit is one of the most creative college subreddits. There is a reason why QS ranks them first in memological science.  

3. Cornell ( r/Cornell) has a nice and chill subreddit, with the absolute best campus pictures. 
4. UC Berkeley ( r/berkeley) has a state of the art subreddit, with more serious content than anywhere else. It is definitely not feel good, since 50% of content is about failing or being depressive. Come on bears, less whining, more memeing.
5. Notre Dame ( r/notredame): ND students are the absolute bests at roasting their own college. Cool pics too.

&amp;#x200B;

Honorable mentions: 

Johns Hopkins's (r/jhu) subreddit, despite being small is genuinely funny, even for an outsider

The University of Central Florida  ( r/ucf)  has one of the biggest university subreddits, with a wide range of quality content

Almost all of the University of California's subreddits (particularly r/UCSD) are active and fun. If calling UC Berkeley UCB does not make you laugh, you can skip

The University of Waterloo, Canada's pride ( r/uwaterloo) has one of the biggest university subreddits and was one of the few universities to reach r/all 

Dishonorable mention:

The University of Chicago's ( r/uchicago ) subreddit members spend their time making jokes on the fact their university is not fun. Neither are they.

Harvard ( r/Harvard ) is disappointing.  It is a middle sized subreddit, where 30% of the members have nothing to do with Harvard, 30% are pretending to be Harvard students while the others are sucking each other's dick in a circle (they call ""announcing someone you are a Harvard student ""dropping the H bomb).

If I apply claiming I want to major in Econ but then decide I want to change to one of the others instead — after I get accepted — will that be a problem? I’m assuming not because they are all within LSA; it’s not like changing to another school like Engineering, etc.

Remote political volunteer opportunity for U of M students,"Done Waiting is a progressive group that endorses and advocates for progressive candidates and policies all around the country.

The application can be filled out at [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mRJ_81wYDz0j1BN8WUzuJHn9K7VsPqBbcO0XjIWIhJc/viewform?edit_requested=true) and it takes about 30 seconds to complete.

You can apply to be an intern, which is 4-6 hours per week, or a fellow, which is 8-10 hours. Note that this is a fully volunteer-run organization, so all positions are unpaid. Because of this, we try and keep hours flexible. 

Much of what you would be doing would be voter outreach, usually through phone banking. There is also a weekly mandatory meeting on Wednesdays at 9 pm EST. The availability of leadership opportunities in the organization can vary, as our need for more positions increases as we grow. Leadership positions could include managing social media accounts, leading phone bank shifts, helping create graphics, and more. 

Any work you would be doing would be completely remote, and we accept people from any location. 

If you would like to be a part of an organization advocating for progressive values, while also learning how to organize and lead or manage teams, apply to Done Waiting. You can meet hundreds of other young, like-minded progressives from all over the country. Letters of Recommendation will be provided for strong performance in the organization.

You can learn more about us and our values [here](https://www.donewaiting.org/).

What was that CSE email at 10:52 pm?,"Is anyone else incredibly confused by the email CSE just sent out about Jason Mars? I’ve read it over and over. Like is he teaching or not?

For reference:

“Recent attention has been drawn to our assignment of Jason Mars as one of four co-instructors for EECS 370 next term. 

This will be a fully remote class with fully remote office hours. We will be communicating directly with students enrolled in EECS 370 in January, prior to the start of classes, about instructional arrangements for the course. Mars taught a senior elective course, EECS 498, during the fall 2020 term.
 
I am writing to ensure our community has relevant context and information, including this statement from the College of Engineering:

The College has learned that Jason Mars has engaged in conduct that the College of Engineering determined was contrary to its values and standards regarding the conduct of faculty. The behavior was unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the College. Appropriate preventive and corrective actions are being taken in response that will further the College's goal of embracing and promoting a culture of inclusivity that is free from harassment and other forms of misconduct.

CSE strives for a community built on respect and integrity. Actions against those values not only hurt our community members, but weaken our community and what we can achieve as a whole.”",1608785620,1,0
Any other seniors feel like crap?,"Anyone who looks thru my post history will know that I really did not have a great experience coming to Michigan for college. Don't get me wrong, the education and degree I am getting is good and I do feel blessed I had the privilege of pursuing college in the first place. 

But reflecting back on my time in college, it really feels like I took a step backwards as a human lol...if that makes sense? I have made exactly zero friends in college, gained tons of weight, and have the worst self esteem I've ever had in my life. I know a lot of this is on me; I regret not going to more parties, exploring my interests more, or having the confidence to join random ass clubs or meet new people. But those reassurances from countless strangers, advisors, professors that ""things will click eventually"", or ""it takes time to adjust"" never really came true.

It doesn't help that I stupidly decided to room alone for my senior year, and there is a pandemic that limits nearly everything I could possibly want to do in my last two semesters of what is supposedly the best years of my life. It doesn't help that I will be graduating with a humanities degree with 0 job offers or prospects. It doesn't help that the seemingly prevailing experience post graduation is 9-5 grind 40 hours a week for the rest of my life. I know that just being an adult doesn't mean I can't do college things and more, but it will certainly be harder, and given how hard it was for me during college, I can't imagine the nightmare of what it will be like trying to do it out in the real world. 

More than anything I just feel so shitty that it seems I wasted four years of my youth, and did not take full advantage of an experience that really could've changed my life in a lot of ways, as I've seen it do for so many others. The worst part is that I finally feel somewhat empowered to change things this last semester, but I feel like due to the circumstances (COVID) and timing (last semester), it won't make a difference.

I'm not really looking for advice, given that I feel there's not much I can really do, and that time has run out. I'd just like to know that I'm not the only senior who feels like this. If other seniors or recent alums wanna commiserate in the comments, I'd love to hear from you. And I guess if you're an underclassmen, don't do what I did. Please please please put yourself out there and make the best of this experience, the remorse is incredibly soul crushing and you all still have time to avoid it :)

I am looking for a fluent German speaker, preferably associated with either UM, WCC, or EMU to assess my German levels and fill out a form confirming our work together.

I am currently applying for a graduate position at Georgetown in the department of European and German Studies that requires a Language Proficiency Assessment to be uploaded as part of the application. The assessment requires the proctor to assess reading, writing, speaking, and listening from a scale of poor to excellent. You would decide what and how that looked like.

If you are interested or know someone who is please feel free to respond or directly DM me. Of course I would certainly pay you for your time and work which can be decided when we speak together, either in person or through zoom, skype, etc.",1605114598,1,0

International Education Week is Coming!,"&amp;#x200B;

[\(Image Description: A maize banner image with the Block M on a watercolor globe states \\""International Education Week, November 16-20\\""\)](https://preview.redd.it/9rf8xumsjmy51.png?width=2100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5735b978da1361633271db08d61fb3a06b75c4bd)

Hello all!  I'm a staff member at U-M and I wanted to let you know that a group of us have been working hard to put together a Canvas site for International Education Week (Nov 16-20).  Ordinarily we don't advertise events on Reddit, but given this year's unusual circumstances and the desire many in this sub have expressed to feel more connected to others and to campus community, I thought I'd share here.

IEW is a week dedicated to celebrating the benefits of international education and exchange worldwide.  To celebrate this year's IEW, the U-M International Education community has put together a series of resources to get you excited about intercultural learning.  We have intentionally kept Zoom fatigue in mind, so while there are a few live, interactive events, we've put careful thought into cultivating content that is ""consumable"" so that you can interact with it on your own schedule and give your brain a needed break from Zoom.

The content on the Canvas site becomes accessible on November 16, but you can join now using this enrollment link: [https://umich.instructure.com/enroll/9WM7HG](https://umich.instructure.com/enroll/9WM7HG)

***Here's what you can expect for International Education Week!***

* IEW event calendar
   * Featuring IEW events such as

Affordable Housing Open Winter Semester," With the dorms closing in the winter, many of you hoping to stay on campus may be looking for an affordable place to live. You may want to consider the Co-ops.

The Intercooperative Council (ICC) is a member-owned collection of houses all across campus (both Central and North!) that was founded to provide an affordable alternative to the other housing options on campus. **We were** ***founded*** **to make housing** ***cheaper*** **for students,** ***not*** **to make a profit.** 

Here’s the deal you get, for some of the best rent in Ann Arbor:

### What you get out of a Co-op:

1. Furnished Room
2. Food (dinners made for you, pantries and fridges always stocked!)
3. Community and Friendship
4. Common Spaces/Amenities (living room, ball pit, rock climbing wall, TV room etc)
5. Utilities (free laundry and detergent, wifi, everything)
6. Leadership Opportunities

### What you put into a Co-op:

1. Charges (cost of membership)
2. Chores (based on preference)
3. Cooperation

EECS 281 scheduling advice?,"I'm a CS-ENG sophomore. This semester, I took:

* EECS 280, 203, and 270 (logic design),
* IOE 265, and

which added up to be a seemingly-doable 17 credit semester. It hit me like a truck, though. I had to drop 270 to have a fighting chance in 280 and 203, but after doing that, things have been looking a little better.

I'm definitely taking 281 in winter 2021, but after this semester, I'm a little lost as to what I should pair it with. I don't need any more elective credits, thanks to my highschool APs, but that leaves me with nothing but core EECS classes left to take.

Taking a Language Class while in the School of Engineering,"Hi everyone, I am currently working on applying to UofM School of Engineering to most likely pursue a CS degree. I was quite conflicted about whether I would do this by applying to LSA or Engineering, but I eventually decided on Engineering since I don't enjoy humanities classes as much as math and science classes. However, I would like to take either German, Japanese, or even both during my time at UofM. 

Is this possible to do at the School of Engineering? I know there is no language requirement, but I can still take a language if I want, right? Also, is it at all possible that I could manage the workload of two language classes at once, and work for a CS major?

RA or Apartment,"I'm a freshman living in the dorms this year, and I'm trying to decide what to do for housing next year.

I've had bad experiences with housing this year and have absolutely no desire to work for them or live in the dorms next year, but my parents are being kinda relentless (""you have to apply and take the job if you get it""). Financially, I have the money to pay for an apartment, and that doesn't even account for whatever job I get in the fall. I have no passion for being an RA and honestly don't feel like dealing with other people's problems for a living, so the literal only reason I would do it is for housing.

After letting him work for a bit, he wanted me to look over his code again. To my surprise, a lot of the code he wrote looked very similar to the code that I had written in my past project.

"Register to Vote, and Vote Early in Person Now!","Hi everyone!

The deadline to register online to vote in Michigan is 10/19, make sure to do so here: [https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/RegisterVoter](https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/RegisterVoter)

You can register in person any day through Election Day, and Michigan also has same day registration so you can still register at the polls, but it's best to just do it ahead of time.

If you're having trouble with that link, try registering here: [https://iwillvote.com/](https://iwillvote.com/)

If you decide to vote in person, I encourage you to vote during Michigan's early voting, which is already underway now through November 2nd. You can do so by going to your clerk's office, requesting an absentee ballot, filling it out, and handing it in there on the spot. 

If you decide to vote by mail, you should send in your ballot as soon as possible. With everything that's going on with the postal service, don't risk mailing it too late and not having your ballot arrive on time.

You can apply for a mail-in (absentee) ballot here: [https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/avapplication](https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/avapplication)

UMich Example Essays,"I'm currently an HS senior applying to UMich (probably comp sci), and I was wondering if anyone can let me read their essays to get some reference on what an admitted essay looks like for UMich. The prompts I'm specifically talking about are these two: 

Everyone belongs to many different communities and/or groups defined by (among other things) shared geography, religion, ethnicity, income, cuisine, interest, race, ideology, or intellectual heritage. Choose one of the communities to which you belong, and describe that community and your place within it.


Describe the unique qualities that attract you to the specific undergraduate College or School (including preferred admission and dual degree programs) to which you are applying at the University of Michigan. How would that curriculum support your interests?

"Stop Normalizing ""Staying Up Late""","College students in particular, tend to equate staying up late with how hard you're ""grinding."" Imo, this is a toxic mindset, as the idea that college students can't get 8 hours of sleep is utter and complete bs. How long do you spend on your phone? TV? Do you start working right after you wake up? I know a few people balancing school, research, clubs, etc who stick to a consistent schedule and I can tell you it is possible to still get good sleep AND maintain a social life on top of your work. The cliche you can only choose two of the three (GPA, Sleep, Social Life) is false.

this semester is going to be worse for my health than corona ever was,"Yeah sure moving out of my dorm early and back home last year sucked and was really an unprecedented situation for all of us, but once I got in the rhythm of being home, and finishing my assignments online it was not too bad. This semester has thrown all of that out the window. The university made false promises to students about moving back, and now we are all facing the consequences. 

last semester all of my professors were very understanding about homework and grades because of the situation. Now they act as if they expect me to not have any more issues regarding the situation.

Every day is the same monotonous routine. There's no walking to class, there's no activity on campus, the weather is changing. Soon I won't even be able to enjoy going on a walk outside because of the weather, and if I do go outside, I have to make sure I am wearing a mask. Every day I wake up, roll over, turn on my computer, and sit in front of a screen for hours on end listening to some prerecorded lecture from LAST YEAR. Then, I have to sit in front of the screen even longer to do homework for hours on end.

Professors are giving out more work because I have ""more time"" due to classes being online. In the midst of the GSI strike, I was given exams on material that I was expected to teach to myself with nobody to help me through it. My grades are plummeting.

I am in so much fear of contracting the virus, simply for the fact that I fear that my professors will not make adequate accommodations for me. I am simply doing work to get a passing grade. I am not learning. 

Is this anyone else's experience this year or am I alone.",1600835686,1,0

Does anyone have any experience being ChemE and pre-med, and if so, how is it like? Would it be doable or 100% death?

Btw, before you laugh in my face, yes I know ChemE is a hard major, especially in this school. I know I’m not getting as high of a GPA as I would be getting as a hard bio or chem major.

I would be lucky to have pulled off a 50% on that exam (yes it was that bad). I left probably 25% off the exam blank.

Looking For New Friends,"I know this is super unorthodox, but given that we are all in (mostly) the same boat in terms of COVID restrictions limiting the social scene on campus, I thought I'd give this a shot. 

I'm 19 years old, a guy, and a sophomore in LSA. I'm currently studying neuroscience (but thinking of switching) with a pre-med track. Right now, I'm living in an off-campus apartment with a few of my friends from last year. After a few weeks of being back on campus, I decided I wanted to try to make some more friends (since I haven't been able to see quite a few of my other friends due to various circumstances, both COVID-related and not). Like many others, I quickly realized just how hard it was to meet people due to a lack of in-person classes, clubs, and sporting events, a tough but necessary evil. 

Given that I'm sure many others are in the same situation as me, I thought I would come on here and introduce myself, and I encourage others to do so in the comments. That way, if anyone else is looking for new friends and sees someone who they think they might like, they can contact each in a safe way while also not violating any university guidelines. Hopefully, this way everyone can have a safe semester, and maybe meet some new friends along the way!!

About me: As I already mentioned, I am a 19 year old sophomore who is currently neuroscience pre-med. I'm pretty outgoing, and always up for an adventure, no questions asked. I also enjoy listening to lots of music (Frank Ocean, Mac Miller, and ASAP Rocky are my favorites), watching TV and sports (HIMYM, Brooklyn 99). I also love to walk and hike around Ann Arbor (if you have some good spots, let me know!), and I'm trying to start to get into photography. Lastly, I'm a very curious person who loves getting to know people who have totally different interests from them! A lot of my friends and I have very little in common in terms of things we like to do, but we always have a great time and get to show each other things that the other person may have never heard of, which I think is really cool. If you think we'd get along, or want to know more about me, don't hesitate to reach out!",1600733898,1,0

I try to socialize over zoom, but I don't enjoy meeting someone and socializing through a screen.

No more 2.5 GPA requirement for EECS,"From the advising office:

Hello EECS students,

The department would like to inform you about two important policy updates:

1. As an addendum to the policy for Winter 2020: no attempts in Spring, Summer, or Fall 2020 terms will count against the two-take limit for EECS 203, EECS 280, or EECS 281.

2. EECS 281's enforced prerequisites of a C or better in EECS 203 and 280 will remain enforced, but the requirement that the two grades average to a 2.5 or better will be moved to an advisory prerequisite, beginning in the Winter 2021 term. It is still strongly recommended that you achieve the 2.5 average between the two prereq grades before moving on. If you would like help in determining whether or not you should continue on to EECS 281, please schedule an advising appointment to discuss your situation with an advisor.

If you have questions, please feel free to contact us through the CSE Peer Advisor Piazza or by sending an email to CSE Advising at ugadmin@eecs.umich.edu.

Best,

Increasing Covid-19 Enforcement and Increasing Stress,"It feels like every time a new covid-19 restriction is pushed onto the undergrads the university justifies it with some new clause they add. I don’t understand how the things get added to the Student Rights and Responsibilities, or how enforceable / legal they are from a public school perspective. 

All the university is doing is driving social interactions that may have been distanced underground where that’s much less likely. Lawn or yard gatherings are now being canceled for basement parties because if you’re going to get suspended over something off campus it might as well be worth it. 

This year sucks and it keeps getting worse, it’s terrifying that we can’t choose our own level of risk and are being treated like children for our 13-16th years of schooling.

It's just been so mentally taxing, and I feel like we're not even allowed to address how frustrating it is, or question the validity of these decisions, without 70% of the student body telling you how bad of a person you are.",1603994396,1,0

Is there anything in university guidelines that prevents him from doing this? It seems pretty ridiculous. I know final grades have to be submitted 72 hours after the final exam, but I can't find anything regarding other class assignments.

Stresses With Unfair Exams and Classes,"This semester has been hard on everybody, yet I am concerned, stressed, and frustrated with taking exams. The nature of this semester being online has created an uneven playing field and has exacerbated inequities that already existed before as well as created new ones. 

Every class has a different type of exam; some allow you to write on tablets and others don't; some allow you to start an exam at a specific time and others give you a time window; some can be printed, others have to be, while others can't be; some choose different MC questions for each person while others give the same exam to everyone. Every class has had to adjust how it distributes exams.  Yet a lot of these ways give an unfair advantage to certain people and cause new stress in other people.

Unfair advantages present themselves in various ways. People can cheat, which can lead to better results for them, and this is easier or harder depending on the format of the exam. Also, people with better access to certain resources that will help them take the test in a better area or faster way will be able to be less stressed during the exam and/or have more time. For example, if an exam must be printed, but someone does not have access to a printer nearby, might have to take an exam in a testing environment that might be loud or disturbing. Another person might have to walk 5 minutes to a printer and 5 minutes back to print. Some might have a tablet and be able to write directly on it after downloading the PDF, which would be much faster. There are other resources that matter a lot; the speed of one's WiFi connection, the reliance of a computer (mine shuts down often for example, which has happened during an exam), the size of one's screen and/or availability of a monitor, which makes a difference because many of these exams are open note. To limit the unfair advantages that exist, I believe one of the first things to do is to make all exams Open Internet. Many already are; but for the ones that aren't, many students will use the Internet anyway because they figure that others will be doing so even if that might not be the case, effectively a self-fulfilling prophecy. This disadvantages the students who stay true to their honor and don't go online, which actually disadvantages those that are doing the right thing!!! What are others ways of limiting unfair advantages you guys can see?

There are also new stresses that exist now. Exams taken before were so different. You went in a room with your mind, maybe a cheat sheet, your test-taking materials, and were in the exact same conditions that everyone else in that room was in. Now, this is not the case at all; you have to choose your test-taking environment, you might have loud roommates, you might have a really warm room, you might have no light in your room, you might not have noise-cancelling headphones. Again, this creates an uneven playing field based on resources, but it also creates stress. I have anxiety and OCD tendencies and during exams, some of my mind is focused on things that matter for my performance: did I pick the best testing environment; why are my roommates being loud and will they keep being loud; is it worth the time I would lose to tell them to be quiet; why did they turn off the A/C, is it worth it to lose time and turn it back on just until the end of the exam because it's way too hot; should I put my headphones in and turn on music to not hear them or will that distract me; would I have been less tired if I had chosen to take this exam at an earlier time? These are the types of stresses I did not have during exams beforehand because everyone was under the same conditions and I had to just take the exam to the best of my ability, at a specific time that I had no control over, knowing that everyone else was under the same conditions. Does anyone have advice about reducing these stresses? Has anyone had these too?

I know professors and instructors are doing their best to address these issues and make it as even and fair as possible for everyone too. How can we create a more level playing field for people taking exams here at UofM, prevent inequities from being exacerbated and new ones being created, and how can we have less stress during exams in this new format? I miss going into a room, knowing it would be over within 2 hours, with no technical issues or stresses, knowing everyone had test-taking materials and their minds and the likelihood of others cheating and having unfair resources compared to others was slim and minimal.",1603987511,1,0

What the fuck are the Co-ops and why do they sound like a cult????,"Hmm, yanno that is a really good question. If youre curious you should check out this info session that is tonight from 6-8pm [https://icc.coop/icc-community/events/](https://icc.coop/icc-community/events/) 

On the realest, I think only someeee houses feel a little culty and thats at specific times. But in a good way. Like in a ""yes we have an annual party(when safe to) with a really wacky theme and we call our deep cleaning day a 'holiday'"" not too much like a candles and robes thing. At least as far as I know. We just really like living together and the community we create each year \\\_(""/)\_/  Honestly been a really cool spot for me. I made good friends in the dorms but better ones in the co-ops, also I learned how to cook, and I live in a lil mansion with some people I would have never got the chance to meet otherwise.

Worried about my mental health during next semester.,"Sorry for the long post, but I just need to word vomit all my thoughts and get some advice. With the winter 2021 course guide being released, I've been thinking about what next semester is going to look like for me and I have to say I'm very worried.

I am living in Ann Arbor in an apartment with a roommate, who is also my closest friend. Our day to day lives look incredibly different, as I am a full-time student and my roommate is taking a gap year and working three jobs. So, basically I spend all day alone in my apartment and I don't talk to anyone except for my roommate once they come back from work (except for occasionally calling my family and texting a few other friends). This is fine with me, as I am very introverted and this leaves me to concentrate on my classes all day (and my roommate is very extroverted, so this works for them as well). Just having one person to talk to at the end of the day is really all I need to be happy. However, my roommate has been offered an amazing job opportunity that will have them be moving far away for \~six months at the beginning of 2021. I absolutely want them to take this opportunity and think it will be an amazing experience, but this also means I am going to be alone in our apartment all of next semester. 

As I said, I am really introverted and I am the type of person to have a small group of just a few close friends. When I am really stressed out and in a bad mental space, my coping mechanism is to pull away from everyone and be alone. This is not healthy, I know, but it's just how I've learned to cope. This means, with all the stress of what is going on in the world and in my life right now, I haven't been talking to a lot of my friends for weeks at a time, broken up with very sparse communication. For me, I don't really like calling, texting, etc. so I have been relying on my roommate as someone to talk to and be listened to by. With them leaving, I'm really worried about my mental health. I don't want to put that pressure on them and have an unhealthy reliance on them, but this pandemic has driven me into my shell and I can't go out and meet up with my other friends right now, as we all are taking the pandemic very seriously and each dealing with our own stressful lives (and I haven't even talked to a lot of them for weeks).  I also hate to put pressure on someone to basically keep my mental health afloat. Furthermore, I am really bad at reaching out when I'm struggling and I rely on face-to-face interactions to feel fulfilled in a friendship.

So... what do I do? What can I even do? To me, there isn't really a clear solution to this problem, so I've just been bracing myself for the possible shitshow of next semester. I want my roommate to be able to leave and not worry about me, but tbh *I'm* worried about me. I've been thinking of maybe finding a therapist for next semester just so I have someone to talk to and to help keep an eye on my mental health, but that of course won't fill the need to talk to other people and have people around me who care about me. I know I can call and text my friends, but to be frank, that isn't enough for me to be happy. If my mental health gets really bad, I can always move back home and live with my parents, but I don't think I will be able to focus on schoolwork as much as I'd like to if I move home, so I want to stick it out here for as long as I can (also I feel like it's such a waste of money to be paying rent for an apartment no one is even using). 

So, does anyone have any advice? Does anyone share this concern, or has already been living in a similar situation? I love being an introvert and if the world was in its normal state, this wouldn't be a problem. But in such isolating times, introversion can be a serious flaw. I'm afraid I'm just going to recede further and further into myself and my mental health will keep getting worse. 

Tl;dr: I'm going to be living alone next semester, and I don't know how well I'll fare with no one to talk to.",1603898929,1,0

Need help meeting new people?,"Over the past few months I've seen a lot of people on here feeling alone, left out or just not really having the social experience they wanted to have at michigan.


I completely understand this because I've been in the exact same boat. I had a hard time meeting people last year, and of the people I did become friends with, I've either grown apart from because of covid or they because they didn't even come back to Ann arbor this fall.


Sooooo. Hidden behind the anonymity of the internet, I decided to make a little discord server for people who are feeling the same way. I'll try my best to get to know anyone who joins, and hopefully anyone else who joins will do the same. I know a general umich server exists, but this is aimed to be a little more tight-knit and geared towards a different overall purpose than that one.

STATS 510 Midterm,"I'm burnt by the mid term. We have only 90 min not 120 min to solve 4 problems within which we are required to solve 2~3 questions. I left 2 small questions blank because I have no time finishing it. My classmate has half of the big problem left unfinished. The instructor said the midterm is easier than HW, and the problem is supposed to test our knowledge and skills to solve realistic problems. Yet, that is a complete joke; the midterm has nothing to do with that. The difficulty is way harder than what instructor taught during lectures, and it tests knowledge way beyond the purview of lecture notes. Of the 4 problems, one is acceptable, one is a proof, two others are freaking nuts. 

I Googled a midterm practice exam posted by a previous 2019 fall lecturer from MIT. Neither the scope, nor the difficulty is in the same level. The problem from that 2019 is way more manageable within 90min. It so shocking to me that the way to teach and test the same subject is so dichotomously different.

i feel like i'm slowly melting into a pile of sludge,"please, if y'all have advice or are even just willing to yell at me to get off my ass, it would be greatly appreciated. here's I guess my life situation:

\-I am essentially nocturnal at this point - the past week I've been going to bed at 6-7am and waking up around 5pm. not good when I *know* I have seasonal affective disorder and yet cannot seem to stay awake when the sun is out

\-since graduating high school, I have not exercised regularly at all. I ran cross country in high school - from june to november, every year, I ran an average of three miles a day. now I'm so out of shape that walking up a flight of stairs gets me out of breath (tbf, I have asthma, but *still*)

\-academically, I'm actually doing pretty well, as I'm only taking 13 credits and four of those credits are minicourses. keeping up with schoolwork is surprisingly not the issue! so not everything is bad

\-however, when I'm not doing schoolwork, I'm doing nothing of value at all. my free time is spent getting high, scrolling through instagram and reddit, watching people's snapchat stories, playing among us, watching netflix, and eating junk food until I physically can't fit anything more into my stomach. I can tell I've gained weight, but that honestly doesn't bother me much - I'm more concerned about how goddamned unhealthy I am, mentally and physically

\-oh, yeah, there's a deranged fucknut running the country, my rights as an LGBT woman are slowly being eroded, Black people are being murdered, people are dying of treatable diseases bc they can't afford health insurance, children are stuck in abusive households, animals are being abused, the top 1% own 90% of the nation's wealth and it's almost impossible for poor people to escape poverty, America's justice system is corrupt beyond reason, and there's a global pandemic - which I am reminded of every time I log onto social media!!!! :))))))))))))))

I feel miserable all the time. I'm constantly irritable; the only two people I spend time with are my roommate and my husband, and I hate how easily I get irritated by them. I'm not treating them well, I'm not being a good partner or friend. obviously I can't see any of my other friends bc of the stay-in-place order, and a lot of them go to different schools anyways, but I still feel guilty because I'm not making the effort to stay connected with them and check in on how they're doing.

I'm scared I'm going to get blood clots and die because of how sedentary I am and how poor my diet is. the thing is, I have a meal plan, but I feel like the dining hall food isn't actually very healthy. when my only option is chicken tenders and a salad with ranch - idk, I don't feel good after eating that. and obviously the weed-induced binge-eating is terrible for me.

So CGIS just cancelled their summer Spanish 232 programs, which is totally understandable but I'm highkey devastated. I'm currently in 231 and the work is so hard and mind-numbing and there's so much of it and our professor has been less than helpful (and even assigned us a whole 3rd project the week of exams/oral exams). Mini-rant aside, I clearly hate the core Spanish courses at Umich but at this point, I'm too far in for another language- is there a class that counts for 4th semester Spanish credit that would make it so I don't have to take 232? I just truly can't stand Michigan language anymore.",1606174203,1,0

Access to Canvas After Graduation and Saving Files,"Hi all,  

Looking at how much I have spent to attend this university, I had the bright idea to save my lecture notes and assignments. After 4 years I have quite a lot of canvas material. Is there a good way to download everything, and a place to save it to online that I can keep after graduation? 

In addition some of my lecture videos can't be saved. it is possible to download these using a toolkit. I had the thought of just having a zoom meeting and recording the lecture while playing it. Of course this is a lot of time, and I want to respect the wishes of the professor as well. I don't want to download there material if not possible.",1606156209,1,0

Michigan Marriage Pact - the new Tinder #NSFW,"So, I understand that most people don’t take the Michigan Marriage Pact seriously. And that’s fine.

And two seconds after we start talking and I’ve sent you a pic of my kitten (not metaphorical, real cat)?? Have some decency. I barely know your name. You never even asked what I was on there for. What I’m comfortable with.

And, also, just a pro tip for other dudes (people, in general): don’t fucking keep comparing yourself to other people. Like DAMN. Have some sense of self worth and know that asking every five minutes if you’re “good enough” or “big enough” is a huge turn off and really shows your insecurities. Focus on the present, on yourself, on your partner, on the experience; understand someone’s with you/talking to you for a reason. Know that smile and confidence can often be the best thing you can wear naked. All just my opinion but still.

Anyone who took this class before knows what the cutoff for a C was in previous semesters with the curve? Or know how I can tell based on the exam averages?

I've always really enjoyed pretty stationary and writing letters, and I'm not gonna be on campus next semester so I'm looking for ways to connect with people and somehow it always feels as though I am able to do that a bit better by letter than through social media. 

A bit about me:

*  18/F/USA 
*  I don't currently have a major, but I am gonna try to transfer to Ross next semester, and if that works out I will probably minor in performance arts management &amp; entrepreneurship with SMTD!
*  I lived on campus for about 2 and a half months before heading home after AA went into lockdown - I don't live very far away at all, and it was just easier / a good way to save money. 
*  When I'm not taking unnecessarily fancy biology notes I'm probably reading or trying to make the most out of these last few days of fall before the winter really sets in and hiking and biking become a *lot* less fun. Or watching GBBO ;)

He likes video games (like Zelda, Super Mario, Stardew Valley), coding, Asian food, and going on walks; ideally these would be things you could bond over, but it's not a requirement.

Question about applying to UMICH.,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi!

I hope you are doing well. I am a Freshman at a community college in Virginia and am starting to plan my post community college educational plans. I will, hopefully, complete my associate degree by the summer of this year because I am taking 18 credit hours per semester, summer courses, and AP credit. I am very interested in the University of Michigan. I was wondering if anyone has any tips for applying there. I also have a question about which school within the university is ""easiest"" to get into. I am very interested in the University of Michigan School of Public Health but if it is very unlikely for me to be able to transfer into that school I would be okay with applying to LSA. School of public health is an upper-level graduate degree so UMICH students who are sophomores already at the school also apply to the program as well and spend their junior and senior years in the school of public health. If anyone has any information on this please let me know!

Here are my HS stats:

1.) GPA Unweighted: 3.356

2.) SAT: 1500

3.) Went to an extremely competitive high school but had relatively decent ECs (Founded a tutoring organization that teaches chess and programming, did a software test engineering internship, did an internship at MathEdge, Secretary of Youth Public Policy Institute)

1.) Current GPA Unweighted: 3.87, Projected GPA Unweighted: 3.78 - 3.94 (Taking CSE12, one of the hardest lower-division CS classes and hoping to receive B+ - A)

2.) 29 quarter units (Summer 2020 + Fall 2020)

3.) ECs: Involved in Google DSC club and doing an independent mathematics/computer science research project. 

4.) Ok/Good Essays

"How do the ""tracks"" for computer science work?","I'm a little bit confused by the course requirements for the ""tracks"" of upper-level classes in LSA-CS. I'm planning to double major in CS, already declared another major that has some overlap with one of these classes. Do I have to declare these courses in any special way? They mention on the program sheet that the courses cannot be used to fulfill LSA core requirements. I emailed the computer science advising team, and I think they answered my question but I'm struggling to actually understand it for some reason

&amp;#x200B;

""Thanks for reaching out. On the bottom of page 7 of the CS-LSA Program guide, it states "" If a course is used as a CS-LSA Major Core Course, it may not also count for a CS-LSA Track course (no double

counting)"" This does not refer to double counting for TWO majors. It simply means if you use the course to satisfy the core requirement for CS-LSA, then you will not be able to use the same course to fulfill the track requirements.""

2021 housing plans fell through; recommendations?,"Basically my some of my friends kicked me out of our housing plans for reasons I won't discuss here (to answer any questions in advance: no I was not on the lease we signed. they signed it and verbally said I could stay there, no longer can). 

Now I'm left out of housing for next year and it's mid-December. From what I can see, I have a few options left. Please let me know your opinions on these housing options and share with me any other options that I might've missed out on...

1) I can do a co-op. Most of the spaces in the houses I'd prefer to live in seem full, though. I guess I can join some of the waitlists, but what are the chances I'd get off of a waitlist? The only houses I'd be interested in living in that still have spaces open are Nak and Truth, neither of which I'm really that excited about...any co-opers have any general advice?

2) I can find someone on facebook who has a space open. Not a big fan of this though. 

3) I can become an RA (since applications still haven't opened), though that might not be the best financial situation, at least I'd have a nice place to stay, right? 

4) I can find a studio apartment somewhere. though I doubt there are any left open, and they're pretty expensive.

Umich Vaccine Rollout Plans,"To All Members of the U-M Community:

With FDA ""emergency use authorization"" of the COVID-19 vaccine, Michigan Medicine is ready to begin vaccinating health care workers this week. This is great news and, knowing how challenging the last year has been for all of us, we are optimistic about these first steps on our road back to normalcy after this long journey with COVID-19.

Our COVID-19 Vaccine &amp; Therapeutics Taskforce is identifying the first groups to be vaccinated based on guidance from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS). MDHHS follows Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations based on input from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is a CDC advisory committee made up of medical and public health experts who develop recommendations on the use of vaccines in the United States. The CDC and ACIP have defined populations for different vaccination phases:  

    Phase 1A includes paid and unpaid persons serving in health care settings who have direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials and are unable to work from home, as well as residents of long-term care facilities.  
    Phase 1B includes workers in essential and critical industries, including workers with unique skill sets such as non-hospital or non-public health laboratories and mortuary services.  
    Phase 1C includes people at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness due to underlying medical conditions, and people 65 years and older.
    Phase 2 is a mass vaccination campaign for all adults.  

In order to appropriately plan for the number of vaccines to be administered, we need our faculty, staff and students to complete a questionnaire to indicate whether you want the vaccine, you are not sure at this time, or that you don't want the vaccine. In addition, we are asking for health information in the questionnaire to help with prioritization of vaccine distribution.

Schedulers will contact those who want the vaccine to make an appointment as we receive allocations of vaccine. Given the phased approach to vaccine administration, you may not be contacted for several weeks after completing the form depending on your assigned phase and available quantities of vaccine. The vaccine is not mandatory and people who complete the questionnaire indicating they want the vaccine can change their minds about receiving the vaccine when they are contacted to schedule an appointment.

Please be alert for an individualized link to the questionnaire, which will be sent via email this week. As we work through operational processes, we have identified about 200 team members who are volunteering to participate this week in a ""test run."" These individuals all fall into the recommended first phase guidelines from federal and state health agencies.

We expect to receive 1,950 doses today, and should continue to get more vaccine supply on a weekly basis. We will eventually have enough supply for all who want the vaccine.

You can find more information here on the Michigan Medicine Headlines page, which is updated frequently. We want to express our continuing thanks to the task force, whose members from both Michigan Medicine and the campus are working extremely hard to coordinate this effort. We also want to thank you in advance, for maintaining flexibility and patience throughout this very complex process, and for helping us to engage all of our community members.

Sincerely,

"Struggling PhD Student: Considering Leaving, Seeking Advice","-In August of 2017, I entered my PhD program in the humanities less than three months after graduating undergrad and then undergoing a major,  life-altering surgery due to a degenerative illness that I was born with. I had no idea at the time just how life-altering and stressful the continued care following this surgery would be.

-I excelled in the first year. By February 2018, though, my health was going downhill again. To make a long and complex story short, I had a type of an early-stage lymphoma related to my other health issue. I lived alone, I hadn’t made close friends yet, and I was terrified. I was in and out of the ER and OR. I felt so alone and overwhelmed and scared. I survived the lymphoma. 

-The next school year and then into the fall of 2019 (my third year), I was still trying to process what had happened. I began several new meds and struggled with them. I imagined that I had new difficulty processing information and concentrating. My doctors didn’t believe me because of my record of success. I passed prelims and did well, yet I still felt overwhelmed. 

-By March of 2020, I was feeling burnt out. I started to lose interest in school and teaching. Despite my struggles, I always remained engaged on some level, so this was alarming.

-Then COVID hit. A chronically ill person, lymphoma survivor, one thousand miles away from family, already feeling depressed. I completely fell apart. As in, I didn’t get out of bed for months and had delusions. I tried to hide this from friends and acquaintances. 

-This fall semester, I tried to get back on track with academics. It mostly worked... but I’m struggling again. I don’t even want to write out how badly I’m struggling: I feel ashamed and embarrassed to write it out. I want to catch up, yet worry that it’s too late to catch up. At the same time, many days I struggle to even motivate myself to take a shower, let alone do my work.

-I think that I want to leave. I want to try to get a job with a more regular schedule and that doesn’t emphasize academic &amp; intellectual performance. Oh, and that pays better than the PhD program, so I can at least afford additional resources that might help me (for example, a car to help me get to medical appointments and make it easier for me to run errands).

-At the same time, I’m worried that I’m making a decision to leave based on how I’m feeling during a depressive spiral and that I’ll regret it later.

-I’m a first generation college student and my family will be extremely disappointed if I leave. I’m struggling with this, too.

-Please... if anyone has any insight, please share. If you left your grad program at UM or know someone who did, how did they go about getting a job? How are you/they doing now? If you have struggled and then got back on track with the program and continued, how did you do it?",1607892362,1,0

Effects of NRC grade?,"I have sooo much stress right now my head is pounding—I’m currently taking Japanese I and have struggled immensely with its starting time due to sleeping problems exacerbated by COVID. As a result, I fell behind on attendance pretty badly and my grade is currently an 82. I decided to convert my letter grade to the pass/fail scale, as I don’t want my GPA affected and Japanese I has almost no relevancy to my degree as a polisci major except for my language requirement. I’ve already decided to not take Japanese II, so I really have no reason to further care about Japanese I, right? I won’t be using it to fulfill my language requirement, and won’t need it for anything else. 

Should I, then, worry about the class at all? What are the implications of a NRC grade? I know my GPA won’t be affected and I won’t get credit for the course, but would it fuck me over in the future? I would rather spend these last 2 weeks focusing on the classes I earnestly care about and that hold relevance to my planned major. I’m not even sure I if I would get below a 70 (minimum grade for a P) from where I am currently, even if I skipped every assignment and the exam (I used Canvas’ manual grade tool to check). I’ll still do some of the easier assignments for the sake of grade padding, sure, but I have no desire to try and do well on the exam (or even attending parts of it in general). I’m simply too burnt out, have bigger fish to fry, and I feel like I have basically no point in trying on a class I’ll piss away anyways when I elect to take a different language in the future. Currently I’m thinking of taking French, Swedish, or German during summer quarter to make up for the time I wasted.

TL;DR: Should I care about getting an NRC grade in a language class I don’t plan on continuing in the future? It would be a massive relief to my mental state if I could just blow the rest of this class off while I focus on more “critical classes.” I’m already planning on taking the class as pass/fail, so my GPA wouldn’t be affected anyways.

UMSI worth it?,"

I’ve been pretty invested in trying to get into SI for a while now (first semester sophomore in LSA) and used to be more okay with risk with career stuff but now I’m super worried. 

A lot of people on this sub seem to be really critical of the program and think it’s a farce that markets itself well. On top of that, it seems like UX design roles are impossible to land and that even if you do they have terrible career growth potential. All I want is a decent career and I’ve spoken to people in the program who say it’ll do that for me, but I guess I’m still pessimistic.

People also seem to say that it’s pretty easy coursework which I have less of a problem with, but I still would feel uncomfortable with that because I’m the kind of person who feels like college is a waste unless they’re taking a heavy course load, but at the same time feel like Im not smart enough to do so. Yeah, I could improve my study habits but I also just got diagnosed with ADHD so I guess that explains part of it. I should probably be less afraid to take difficult courses and get like a B-/C/C+ but I just can’t see myself doing well in a lot of things.

My backup plan is to continue majoring in LSA econ but I’m not as positive about the career prospects of that as I would be if i majored in MechE or CS. Idk with both UX or econ I feel fucked either way.

Sorry for the rant but the question Im trying to ask is is UMSI a good pathway? Has anyone here graduated and enjoyed their job (and moved up)? Thanks in advance",1606805483,1,0

Contrast that to the labs I do really well in. I know that there's also the common trope that engineers care much more about completion of a class than the GPA itself, but I obviously still want to optimize my academic/career opportunities, so I'm not quite sure what a ""threshold"" might be for when you'd mask a grade as a ""P"" v.s. show the letter.

Finding it hard to come back,"I think Thanksgiving Break was a mistake. I think the break was too long and was horribly placed with the end of the semester approaching so fast. I think that maybe a few days off would have been better than having an entire weeklong break placed a little over a week before classes end and exams begin. I appreciate the sentiment and understand that having breaks was a difficult subject due to COVID and people undoubtedly wanting to travel from and to campus, but I still think a week long break right now, right before finals like this, was too much.

I feel like I am behind and should be doing work since exams are coming up so fast, yet at the same time I know it was break and I know that this was supposed to be a time to sort of chill and unwind a bit from this hellhole of a semester. I don't really even have any work to be doing, so I don't know what I feel worried about. I was lucky enough to have profs which didn't assign anything over break, but I feel like I have forgotten all of the things I spent time learning during the week or two leading up to the break. Every single week in this semester has felt like a month to me and, even though I moved out of dorms just a week ago, it feels like I haven't been in class or on campus in eons. With some exams coming up in like 1.5 to 2 weeks, I feel sort of stressed and feel like I should be rushing to complete assignments or rushing to rewatch lectures. I've been finding it so hard to return to course work and to get back into the groove of doing assignments, especially knowing that I have everything crammed into this one week before having to start preparing for exams. Anyone else sort of feeling the same and finding it difficult to return to class after this break?",1606639605,1,0

Building your personal wealth,"After reading that other thread where everyone was competing to see who was the most middle class, I wanted to share something my dad taught me that Michigan will never teach you unless you happen to be in Ross, Econ, or IOE.

For the record, my dad is a doctor.  We wouldn’t be considered middle class by any reasonable standard, but he came from an actual lower middle class household, worked his ass off in college and medical school, and continues to work his ass off for every dollar he earns.  He didn’t inherit anything, nor did he have any privileges besides two loving parents that encouraged him to succeed.  Now that he is where he is though, he gave me the advice that he follows and recommends that I follow, and I think other people could benefit from that advice.

[This philosophy is how the rich get and stay rich.](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Main_Page)  It’s kind of a lot of material that you should read on your own, but the summary is that you, a Michigan student, can build up your own wealth by making smart choices.  If you’re financially able to, the most important thing you can do is open a Roth IRA.  There’s a lot of math that goes into it, but if you were to contribute $1,000 a year to a Roth IRA invested in S&amp;P 500 or broad market ETFs, you would have $200,000 when it’s time to retire.  By contrast, if you put that money in savings, you would only have $40,000.  According to data published by the university, the average salary of a CS student is $60,000 starting.  That means you’d be putting away less than 2% of your yearly income, assuming you never get a raise, promotion, or advance your career in any way.  

If you become even slightly more successfully, you can contribute up to $6,000 a year to a Roth IRA, which would be worth 1.2 million after 40 years, plus you can set up backdoor Roth accounts, 401ks, 529 accounts, HSAs, and all kinds of other accounts that will grow tax free.  Tax free growth at 6-8% a year (stock market average) will typically double your initial investment every ten years.  It may possible to make significantly more than that in the short run with options trading or penny stocks, but according to the efficient market hypothesis, no one can outperform the market in the long run, so it makes the most sense to follow the market.

You don’t have to already be wealthy to take advantage of this stuff.  You just have to budget judiciously and make smart career choices.  

There’s all kinds of other useful information on that website, covering asset protection, insurance, taxes, emergency fund planning, and living below your means.  For all the bullshit classes we’re required to take as Michigan students, one would think they’d have everyone learn about this kind of stuff, but since they don’t, the only way you’ll ever hear about it is if someone tells you about it.  I don’t know how many people on here already know about this, but if even one person learns something new, I’ll be happy.

On a final note, this isn’t a get rich quick scheme, nor are any outcomes ever guaranteed.  There are people who make all the right choices and still get screwed over, and there are assholes who happened to pick the right stock or bet on the right number or sports team.  With that said, this is the most optimal financial strategy.  The math and statistics don’t lie.",1606546330,1,0

Is it possible to work 40 hours/wk as a full time CS student at UMich?,"Hey all,

I'm an incoming transfer student at UMich for spring 2021. Since my parents make 200k/yr but won't help me out financially and won't co-sign a private loan, I'm SOL when it comes to financial aid until I turn 24 unless I get married or join the military. I'm considering working full time while taking classes full time in order to pay for my tuition and room + board. I did this for the last two years and maintained a 4.0 at a community college, but I'm not sure if it's possible with UMich's rigor. 

Is it possible to maintain a 3.5+ GPA as a full time student at Michigan while working full time? Would I have extra time to do the things that will make me more attractive to tech companies (self-study, work on projects, leetcode, research, etc)? Has anyone pulled this off before? How many hours per week does it take to get a 3.5+ in 15 credits of CS classes here?

Any input/advice is appreciated!

"University of Michigan does not ""teach"" Math","My son is a freshman student who scored very well on both his SAT subject test for Math, as well as on his AP Calculus Test in High School, he started Calculus 2 at the University of Michigan this fall, completely online, being already somewhat familiar with Calculus 2.
From the beginning, his Calculus 2 instructor, who happens to a Graduate Student, was lacking in the ability to instruct. He basically performs an example, where he does a problem on video in a Zoom class. He does not explain how he calculates any of the work being done. My son asks questions, but his instructor responds with answers that have little to do with the question. I emailed the director of this particular class about the issue of this instructor not teaching or even lecturing and here was his insulting, sarcastic response.

Dear Lisa,

I'm sorry I'm just getting to your message.  This week I was in charge of administering an exam to over 700 students, having that exam graded, offering a second exam for students in different time zones, fielding emails from students about technical problems, the list goes on.  

Your concerns are important to me.  I can't speak specifically about the class student is in or specifically about their instructor due to federal laws, but I can write you about our general philosophy and the mission of our courses.  

Fundamentally, math cannot be learned from ""being taught"" passively.  Math needs to be done in order for skills to be gained and concepts to be understood.  Most of the time, students succeed in learning on their own time, while doing homework and pouring over notes they took during class.  They record information while they are in the classroom, and they learn outside the classroom.  Students actually learn more if they do a significant amount of work in the classroom, in the presence of an expert, their instructor, who can help get them on the right track in real time.  

The part that sounds right about what your son is experiencing is that there is not much traditional lecture in the classroom.  Our hope this semester, while students are learning remotely, is that they can engage with the material in the course between classes through short videos we have produced, by reading the book, and also by doing the reading homework which are questions based on the reading.  Then when they get to class, they are ready to work on problems with their classmates.  Students who do not do these things between classes tend to feel lost during class.

The instructor's job during class is to briefly supplement the material that students were to engage in between classes, and help students navigate difficult problems as they are working in groups during class.  They receive significant training and support on how to facilitate this kind of work in the classroom.  This style of classroom can be uncomfortable for students, mainly because they are being asked to learn differently, in a way that's unfamiliar.

It seems from your description that something about the class is not working for your son.  He feels lost during the class, and that is a problem, in my opinion. 

I have said most all that I can say in generality about the class and our philosophy.  I am happy if you want to pass any of this information on to your son about the structure of the class in general.  If he is having specific issues with his instructor, please know that he can write me directly at any time.  It is part of my job to help students who are struggling in this course.  

I truly want the best for your son, and I believe he can succeed in Math 116 with the right guidance.  Again, please have him reach out to me if he would like further support.

All the best,
Paul Kessenich

Has anyone succesfully petitioned for having a graduate-level course count as an Upper-Level CS (ULCS) elective?,"In the CS-Engineering [program guide](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/cse_guide.pdf) (on page 5) it says that ""Students with interests in research, graduate school, or specific areas should discuss graduate course options with the Chief Program Advisor, who may approve graduate courses on a per-student basis for use as ULCS"". 

Has anyone ever done this, and if so what did you use as your reasoning to convince them to let it count as an ULCS? The specific courses I am thinking about are EECS 583 (advanced compilers), EECS 591 (Distributed Systems) and EECS 576 (Advanced data mining).

The reason I'm asking here is because I tried asking an advisor and they were all very vague about the process. I also talked to a few friends about this who have tried petitioning for taking 500-level classes for ULCS, but they have all been unsuccesful.",1606425002,1,0
A question for older alumni,"What do you suggest we students do in adapting and adjusting to the pandemic? This is a serious question.

A lot of alumni have wrote disparaging comments that students are somehow inept by how we're handling the crisis. This seems unfair because mental health now compared to the beginning of this year is down, for most age groups, and across most demographics.  Many experts have said the pandemic is unprecedented and its effects haven't be fully realized, so why are folxs so critical? The only time I can think of where people felt something close to something like this was the 2008 u.s. recession. But even with the 2008 recession while it's the closest thing to compare, it doesn't fully compare... what I guess I'm saying is, from something that can't be compared, a lot people are tying to compare. 

I know Michigan is comprised with a lot of rich kids, and their life have been mostly unaffected. The pandemic, social distancing and what not is more of a nuisance than anything else. For many, this will be a small chapter in their life's book.

For others, their biggest hurdle is the increase of classwork. Challenging but still manageable. For some coursework isn't manageable and grades are taking a dive. 

And yet for some students here, the pandemic is an ever present part of our lives. We have relatives who are dying, parents being laid off as the economy implodes on itself, family homes being foreclosed upon, evictions in rentals, and in some case food insecurity.   


We may be in the minority, but we're still students at the university. We still paid tuition as everyone else. Even if a student qualifies for the maize and blue scholarships, they still have to pay for housing and food if they had to take one of the classes that offered remotely.

There is so much more stuff to worry about than just school and the inflexibility you older people have is just disheartening. Sorry we don't have all your resources and haven't learned your mental fortitude? The traditional college student is only 18-21. Why are we getting penalized for not having the time learning the skills and not having the fully mature brain like you all have. I suspect many of you would be in the same position as us when you were our age.  


We aren't lazy. We work hard. We probably work harder than you did to get into the school. According to freshman profiles, the average admit in 2019 has a significantly higher sat, act and gpa than the average admit in 2009. This trend is expected to increase each year. So stop telling us to just shut up and hit the grind stone.

We are and we've reached beyond the point of diminishing returns.

Public Health Dual Degree with Spanish,"[Link to dual degree umich public health website](https://sph.umich.edu/undergrad/degrees/dual-degree/index.html)

This new dual degree program came out for public health students. I'm debating on double majoring in Spanish and BHS (Biology, Health and Society) or doing this new program and have Spanish as my other degree. I feel like with a public health major, you're given way more opportunities than a regular biology one. However, I don't know if it's really worth it.

Also, I really don't want to have to take additional summer and spring classes on top of this.

Calc 3 is the only thing coming in between me and graduation,"This is my fifth year attending this dumpster fire of a school.

I thought I was in the clear after they announced that grading was being reverted back to the winter 2020 grading system, but then they announced the ""oh yeah a c- is still failing uwu"" thing in an email I saw yesterday. Calc 3 has been the most stressful thing I've ever had to deal with. I've done well on assignments, but the exams I keep screwing up on because everyone else understands the concepts better than me. The thought that I'm one bad exam score away from not graduating is terrifying. It's even more terrifying knowing that my score will be compared to everyone else's scores and that I kind of have no control over whether or not I pass. I first thought ""hey even if I fail I can just take it again next semester"" but then I found out that I needed to take 15 credits next semester, so there's no more room for an additional class.

I don't know how I'll survive. My only plan is to block every source of entertainment and study 5 hours a day until the exam, but I doubt that will be enough.
