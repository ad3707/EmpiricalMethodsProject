"I took THINK 23 online last spring! I thought it was fine—the lectures were pre-recorded Powerpoints which I found hard to engage with, but live section was fun and we had some really insightful discussions. The workload wasn't bad at all, we had weekly reading responses/asynchronous section work, one group project, and a final essay. There was quite a bit of reading but I thought it was well-written and interesting, so it didn't feel like a lot. I definitely learned a lot about cancer, but it did sometimes get a bit depressing. We had some important discussions about inequities in healthcare &amp; ethics in research which for me was the most interesting part of the class. Overall, I didn't really have strong positive/negative feelings about the class. I only ended up taking it because my original THINK got cancelled and only a few options had space left, so I don't think I'd have picked it originally, but I'm also not super interested in medicine (which it sounds like you are). If you're interested in learning more about cancer, THINK 23 does it in an approachable way and discusses cancer from a variety of perspectives (biological, societal, ethical, etc.)",1614813392,1,0

"My personal experience when I took both my junior year (winter+spring of 2019) was that 143 was far easier than 140, but still not an easy course by any means. The coding assignments felt more structured and easier to follow, the exams felt fairer, and the lecture material felt a lot better paced than 140. I genuinely can’t remember if there were written psets; if there were, they were unremarkable compared to other systems level coursework.

That said, I think this comparison depends on who your 140 prof was, as I took it with Mazieres. I’ll also add the caveat that the first project felt significantly more difficult than the latter two, perhaps on par with the first 140 assignment. Overall, I’d say the first project took me about 20 active hours working on it solo over two weeks (I had a partner for an additional 15 hours who I had to drop due to him consistently pushing non compilable code to master and randomly replacing my functions with paragraphs from his PhD dissertation, but that’s a story for another time), the second took about 10 solo, and the third took about 10 with a partner. If you can survive the first project, you can survive the full course. I still missed some edge cases on the first project, but had no big issues with anything else.

I have no idea how things have changed since then due to time and the pandemic, but this was my personal experience, and I hope you find this response useful. If you’ve got more questions, I’d be happy to answer them!",1615972898,1,0

"Gotcha. I think those Zillow monthly cost estimates are off, in particular the property tax estimates. For 614 Natoma they assume a prop tax rate of 0.67%, but the ad valorem tax in SF is sitting around 1.18% at the moment. Then there are special assessments and parcel taxes that can tack on at least another couple grand on top of that. So 1.3-1.4% is a safe bet for property tax.

Yeah, the competition is an issue right now. I don't know how you would line up the initial financing for this kind of arrangement either, whether you could get an investment loan or some other product. Then you have to consider how how that works with the TIC legal papers and how to split the financing between the tenants.  

Don't get me wrong—if you could find the right group of people, I think you could make that plan work. But there are a lot of moving parts working against you. It'd be a tough sell to go in on a TIC as a young + relatively poor PhD student with near-complete strangers for sure.",1615920476,1,0

"I graduated a few years ago, but I can assure you that the feeling of the unknown is something that stays with you. I've had quite a few discussions with other friends and I think this pretty much one of the most ""common"" feelings amongst my Stanford friends. 

It's really a process of growing up, especially as a ""high achiever"", that you learn to embrace that feeling of the unknown. All the way up to getting into university, you've had milestones, test scores, and other things to quantify and measure your success. You had clear goals that were almost unambiguously clear; life seemed like a linear path towards college. But as soon as you finish high school, (unless you're gunning for medical school or other professional post-graduate schools), you lose a lot of that sense of progress and instant feedback through test numbers. The road forks wide open, and you really don't have any more clear directions on where ""best"" to go. 

Almost everyone has lingering doubts or FOMO around what they studied or did back at Stanford, and lots of us still question if we're doing the right job, or if we're at the right place. There are a rare minority of folks for whom passion truly drives then, but for everyone else, passion is simply a post hoc story of convenience when in reality it is a ""lucky"" combination of being talented at the right subject at the right time and place. 

Ultimately, you'll have to come to peace with the fact that you don't know what you don't know. No one will give you direction in your life unless you direct it yourself. You'll always be operating at a view of the world that's limited by your own knowledge and experiences. 

My perspective was the use Stanford as a platform to convert as much of the ""unknown unknowns"" into the ""known unknowns"" in areas that I had some interest in. That way, I'm not pigeonholing myself into any area without missing out on getting a much broader sense of what's out there. Once I know where to start to learn about something I didn't know, I can carve out my own path, but it's hard to be even exposed to those new areas once you are outside of school.",1615862097,4,0

Be really honest-- are you the type to be okay with some mess or does it drive you crazy? Are you an early riser or a night owl? Do you take 50 minute long showers? Will class schedules or other obligations match up?

"If you'll permit me to check your envelope math, I think the situation is more favorable. Zillow has several 4 bedroom properties in East Palo Alto for $900k-$1.5m, with an estimated monthly cost of $6,343 for the most expensive $1.5m property. If you look at SF, there's a number of 4+ bedroom properties for \~$1.1m, with estimated monthly costs of \~$4,688 (e.g. this 5 bedroom, 4 bath property [https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/614-Natoma-St-616A-San-Francisco-CA-94103/2072570921\_zpid/](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/614-Natoma-St-616A-San-Francisco-CA-94103/2072570921_zpid/)). Even if that monthly cost is $6k, with 5 residents, that's a balmy $1200/month/person.

Commuting to the city certainly takes time, but I think there's a nonzero number of graduate students who would be interested in living in SF. Regardless, EPA and MV are options. Here's a slightly pricey property in Mountain View that would be affordable to grad students with a $2k/month budget ([https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2211-Rock-St-Mountain-View-CA-94043/19509511\_zpid/](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2211-Rock-St-Mountain-View-CA-94043/19509511_zpid/)).

"I didn't know what I wanted to do going into undergrad, I didn't even really know what electrical engineering was. I just knew that I enjoyed the stuff I did with electricity in high school physics and could see myself working with computers somehow in my career. I had heard that over 50% of people change majors in college, so my thought process going into undergrad was ""I'll probably end up doing some sort of engineering, and it probably won't be electrical but I have to start somewhere"" then enjoyed it enough to stick with it. I was a bit iffy on grad school at the end of my 3rd year, but decided to apply anyways and fall quarter senior year I found a telecom class sequence (that I continued winter and spring quarters) that I loved, so that became my grad school focus. 

Money didn't really play a role in my decision of major. When applying to undergrad, my guess (after zero research) was that lawyers made the most (something else I considered), followed by computer programmers, then all other engineers which made a comparable amount to each other, followed by anything else I likely would have ended up doing. 

If you really enjoy being a TA, have you considered looking into teaching at a code academy or coding boot camp? It might be a way for you to explore teaching for a year or two and see what you think of it, while still keeping your technical skills really sharp. I don't have any idea what the typical compensation would be for that sort of job, but maybe something to consider if you haven't thought about it. 

I also feel like some of the ""regular software work"" is not that appealing to me, but what I've found makes a big difference in my work satisfaction is how interested I am in the project I'm working on, more than specifically what I'm doing. What are your interests or hobbies? Do you think you might find it more appealing if you're stitching together APIs that you might end up using as a consumer of your company's product or service, or does that still sound unappealing to you? 

On the last topic, I wish I had a good answer for you. I sort of lucked into it. I did 3 internships, Northrop Grumman (after my junior year), Cisco (between undergrad and grad school), and finally Viasat (where I've been since graduating in 2012) between my 2 years of grad school. I felt like the pace of projects at a defense contractor and what I perceived to be the company structure didn't lend itself well to the sort of flexibility I wanted. Egotistically, I felt like if I had the chance to prove myself I would move up or around faster than average so I wanted to really feel like I could have that opportunity. At Cisco I ended up feeling sort of the same way - everyone seemed content working on their little piece of a large project and I concluded I might feel trapped or confined in that environment. A large part of why I chose to go back to Viasat for full-time after graduating was that the company felt productive yet unstructured. That may not make a lot of sense, but it's sort of what I see at startups as well, people are expected to shift what their responsibilities are over time and if you do the same thing for a long time you'll get questioned if that's really what you want to be doing (and for some people it is). 

Here are some example questions that might help you evaluate company flexibility or career paths, and personally if I was interviewing someone for a position I wouldn't see someone asking any of these questions as negative. I'm certainly not recommending you ask everyone all of these questions, but some for you to consider at least: 

* How common is it for people to move between teams and products/projects? 
* Do people pretty much work on the same team for the life of the product/project/program, or do people have the opportunity to move around internally? 
* If someone joined your team, do you have any thoughts about how long you'd expect them to stay on your team before evaluating other internal opportunities? For example, 2 years? 5 years? ----- Here you want to make sure they don't think you're just trying to get in the door then abandon them 
* How often do you see people leave the company and come back? Are there any reasons for coming back that you've heard people give that you'd feel comfortable sharing? 
* How long have you been here at the company? What has your career progression looked like? What keeps you here compared to looking for a different job? 
* When you post new job openings, is it expected that there will be internal applicants for it or are new positions typically only filled by external applicants? 
* I'm looking to find a company that I want to stay with for a long time, and one of my concerns is in 5 (or 10 or whatever number you like) years from now looking back and feeling like I haven't grown along my career path. What resources are available for employees to take advantage of so that they don't end up stagnating and doing the same thing for their career if that's not their desire? ----- Or alternatively, ""How do employees here keep themselves continually growing as professionals?"" 

I didn't end up having to compare startups with any other companies, since I got turned down for all of the startups I applied at (I think I didn't have enough practical programming or circuit design experience to satisfy any of the ones that I applied to), so those questions are all geared more towards large (1000+ people) companies.",1613859270,1,0

With that said, yes it’s insanely expensive to live here and I think most of the apartments are poor quality. I’m in one of the Stanford owned apartments (the colonnade apartment), which is actually pretty nice, but there’s a wait list to get in. My goals were to either get into one of the Stanford affiliated apartments or go 20 minutes east to Sunnyvale where rent is a little cheap. I’m paying 2,700 for a 732 square foot apartment. I can only afford to live here because my girlfriend also got a job out here and we split the rent. You most likely need a roommate or will have to settle for a studio (but as I said before most of the apartments are shit quality in Palo Alto).

I don’t know what department your postdoc is in, but I think the benefit of being a postdoc here is I do notice odds of publishing in the top tier journals are much higher than where I was as a PhD student.

there is minimal contact between undergrad &amp; grad students (outside of TAing). overall, it seems like undergrads think grads are stuck-up and/or skeevy while grads think undergrads are immature. granted, i’m only a second-year so most of my time in grad school has been during the COVID era, but COVID definitely hasn’t helped things. i think a lot of undergrads blame grad students for why stanford continues to delay their return, especially with GSB making the news recently.",1613809066,1,0

Second, many departments (if not all?) have a process where they can match you to an advisor based off your interests. So, contact the undergrad admin for your department and inquire. It's a less awkward way to approach a potential major advisor.

Last, it is easy to change advisors. And, your mentor who you find later on in your student life need not be your major advisor. End of the day, major advisor's primary role is to sign off on your paperwork. Feel free to continue developing more relationships with your professors.",1613776840,1,0

"Seconding this post. Was rejected from around 99% of the opportunities I applied to on and off campus. The things I was accepted into (Sophomore College Assistant, TAship, internship in NYC, studying abroad, research) have each changed my life in dramatic and positive ways. Notice that that's only like 5 things out of the hundreds of opportunities that I wasn't able to get.

If you are really interested in a competitive position such as CURIS, I strongly suggest networking. If you know someone well, they can make an acceptance happen much more easily than a blind application. In my experience that's what makes some people seriously successful and others feeling frustrated. Unfortunately that doesn't always translate to the most qualified people getting the spot, but that's just life. You can also try taking lots of grad classes early to show that you're qualified for next year, but it's really the personal connection that seals the deal in many cases.

More importantly, don't get too bogged down by any one particular rejection. There are so many opportunities that you can do that you can always try something else, such as an internship at a startup or an REU outside Stanford.

If you're really worried, you could consider getting a minor in a more technical major like CS.

"A few things that have helped me:

- Where allowed, **find study/homework groups**. This really cuts back on wasted pset time where I tell myself ""oh, it'll be better if I solve this problem entirely by myself"", rather than first taking an honest stab at a solution then talking over approaches with someone. Knowing in advance that I will be discussing the work with a peer means I won't feel ""trapped"" in finishing the pset that particular night. This also helps me _actually_ learn the material instead of getting a 0 from a TA without any feedback.
- Be honest with yourself about **distractions** (this Chrome extension really helps with this: [Pause – Stop Mindless Browsing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pause-stop-mindless-brows/ljfdccdjpfjpfjbpdiihanpodilolofh))
- Using a **light run** as a healthy distraction instead of Reddit + YouTube. They usually clear my head and make me look forward to coming back to work. And I'm really talking about a *light run*, that way you don't resent running too :)
- As you've said, try to take the **entirety of Saturday or Sunday off** (at least one—although this can be tough). This gives me time to recharge and makes sure I don't resent my work by the time I get back to it.
- One thing that overwhelms me is the mountain of emails and little things I have to do; what really helps me here is to use **Google Tasks** integrated into Gmail. This way, when I get an email either 1) I immediately respond or 2) I turn it into a Task and archive it out of my inbox. Then I have all of my tasks I can refer back to (especially when I'm procrastinating bigger tasks I tend to look down my list to see if I can knock off something small, yet important). This is helpful when juggling life + school tasks too. BTW, you can integrate your @stanford email into Gmail, which helps to manage your personal emails with school emails.
- Plan everything (within reason) on **Google calendar**. That way you don't have to hold everything in memory and can rely on just checking your days/weeks schedule. This is also something I've done to plan our my coursework + research for *every quarter* ahead of time in **Google sheets** (that one is a little more time consuming but it gives you a bird's-eye view of what to expect during each quarter, and makes sure you're getting the right requirements / pre-reqs before taking harder classes)
- Letting myself stop working if I'm stuck or frustrated and just **go to sleep**. I used to grind psets until they were finished (resulting in many 5-6 am nights), but once I switched my attitude to allow myself to sleep and revisit in the morning, I've noticed—on countless occasions—I come back to the work in the morning and immediately solve what I was stuck on for an embarrassing amount of time the night before.

**The upshot is this**: work with others who are also probably burning out (especially now when we're all mostly in isolation), planning out my time reduced my anxiety (although it may seem like a daunting task itself), organizing my tasks and emails puts my current work into perspective, going for a light run can be used as a mental tool, and allowing myself to rest all *tremendously* changed my attitude and productivity while at Stanford.",1613691589,6,0

"I agree with most the advice here, but firstly I think it’s pretty odd and gatekeep-y to say there is a “Stanford way.” And secondly, as a several-time TA, this very much is the Stanford way from where I’m standing.

A lot of (very smart) people care a lot about their GPA, and will send us concerned emails if they might get an A-... Others privately email to ask what they can do to push themselves over the A+ boundary, or how much work that would take. You may not hear about this, but it really happens quite a lot, and often from some of the best students too. I’m very much not judging people for this—I really like my students, and am very glad they trust us enough to email and ask. I think they have a total right to care about and be proud of their GPAs, especially as we try to make their grade a reasonable proxy for how much they learnt. But I’m not going to pretend that Stanford students don’t explicitly optimise for getting A+’s, because many of the best students definitely do. 

Sure, I don’t necessarily think these students chose my classes for an easy A/A+, but I know for a fact that people in my classes have chosen things like grading basis to maximise their GPA, and sometimes at the expense of their education. I know of multiple students who have dropped to C/NC because they are worried about getting a even an A-, and then stopped doing good work and consequently learnt a lot less. Stanford actually has a very late change-of-basis deadline—and people do exploit this to minimise risk of low grades.

"Stanford has a financial aid calculator that should be pretty accurate. The EFC is FAFSA’s estimate for how much your family should pay for college. Stanford actually ended up charging us much less than our EFC.

As for AP credits, you can 100% graduate in 4 years without any credits coming in. The main benefit that AP credit offers you is flexibility, not necessarily money. We pay by the quarter, not by the unit. I guess you could try to load up on AP credits to graduate a quarter or two early, but I don’t really know much about that. I came in with a good bit of AP credit, and it’s been nice not to have to worry about taking some intro-level classes. For example, AP Calc BC is a very useful credit to have... I don’t see any people raving about how great Math 19-21 are. Same goes for Chem. Not every intro class is great and most grade harsher than upper-level courses too. Hope this helps.",1617030239,1,0
"I'm also a '25 admit so I don't know much, but I'm pretty sure that taking more classes at Stanford will increase your cost. The two reasons for that happening that I can think of are that you might be on campus for another quarter which comes with its tuition, boarding, etc. costs, and then you may need to pay for books and other materials for the class. To answer your last sentence, taking the intro classes will affect the budget.

Other than that, I barely know anything about how financial aid works so I can't really say anything about your family's EFC and how all that stuff works. However, I still hope I was able to share something useful.",1617028260,1,0

How special does your extracurricular have to be? I knew a kid who got into Stanford with a 3.6 GPA. However that was because he was taking classes and doing research at Caltech while in HS. He just ignored his HS GPA. He founded a company before college. He later dropped out after becoming a Thiel fellow. [His company is now worth $3.4 billion.](https://www.forbes.com/profile/austin-russell/?sh=642769ac6aa8) Prove that you can be a special changemaker outside of test scores/grades and you will have a serious shot at Stanford. The Stanford admissions process appears to be a crapshoot only because there are very few high schoolers that meet the standard that Stanford wants. Stanford instead looks heavily at potential.

So it's hard to reach Stanford's standard. You have do something that makes you stand out on a massive scale to stand out. Generally the top students in the world are a lock. I remember a professor (Gio Wiederhold) saying that he would only encourage the top 10,000 students in the world to apply and have a serious shot. We have rejected Stanford professors like former Provost John Etchemendy and Nobel Prize winner Andrew Fire. Everyone else who got in is probably luck.

That isn't a real loss. I seriously believe the reason why most of the kids who come out of Stanford successful are successful because of their own hard work and initiative. Don't aim for Stanford.

It's difficult to say anything concrete about how many hours of work you might dedicate to this class – it seems like the only courses that we've taken in common are TCS/Math, which have very little overlap with 110 in terms of skills required.

Stanford's name carries so much more weight when going into the job market/applying to grad school. Outside of the Northeastern US, nobody really knows about U of R but literally everyone knows about Stanford. Also, I (along with many classmates) really struggled getting an actual engineering job after graduation from U of R because of limited connections outside of the greater Rochester area.

I assume U of R must be close to family or they are giving you more money than Stanford, but four years down the line, I think you would be better off for grad school/finding a job if you go to Stanford.

"When it comes to making a good chunk of money right out of college, there are a few considerations, some of which other commenters have touched on, but it may help to lay them out explicitly. In order to make the most money as quickly as possible, you not only want to think about feasibility and starting salaries, but also promotion schedules/salary deltas--and quality of life (QOL) for yourself, which directly impacts your ability to get those promotions and make more money. Here's a summary of common options (focusing on options right out of college):

Investment banking (/sales&amp;trading): Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley

* Comp: $100k + \~$50k bonus starting, promotion is every \~3 years and increases total comp by \~$150k. Somewhat ""up or out"" (promotion, or asked to leave) but not as much as consulting. The majority of the money is in bonuses, which are tied to both your performance and the firm's. Most people try to get into private equity (PE) after a couple of years/B-school, where they can make even more money (\~$400k total comp) --&gt; median probably \~$3-5M total over 10y
* Feasibility: very feasible to land if you plan appropriately. Stanford isn't as large a feeder as the east coast schools (because tech is more attractive re: QOL), but &gt;100 people in each class go into finance
* QOL: 100 hours a week of being an Excel monkey. not fun. most folks only do IB for a couple of years and then escape to PE/VC or business school because IB burns you out. lots of my friends barely got through the summer.
* How to get the gig/what to study: the more math and econ the better, but anything goes here. network a ton. internships are key.

Quant/hedge funds: Citadel, Two Sigma, Jane Street, etc.

* Comp: $250k+ starting, promotion schedule is talent-based and ""up or out"", but if you're good, you can make a helluva lot more--&gt; median probably \~$5M total over 10y
* Feasibility: fairly difficult to land because they actually test for problem-solving talent. interviews are fairly grueling, 4-5 rounds of math. The good news is that you can learn the necessary style of thinking if you work hard at it; it's not that they test for advanced knowledge, but more for a facility with mathematical/probabilistic thinking
* QOL: fairly stressful from what I've heard, but not like investment banking. many people are happy here because they just get to work on interesting problems all day and get paid well for it (esp. compared to math/stats phds, which is what most of them would be doing otherwise)
* How to get the gig/what to study: math, physics, (theoretical) CS. focus on developing an intuition for probability and combinatorics. The problems are similar to difficult high school math competition problems (\~AIME); [*https://artofproblemsolving.com/*](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) is a go-to for high school math kids, so is probably also useful here.

Big tech: Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc.

* Comp: $120k starting + $100k stock grant vesting over 4 years (don't discount how valuable this can be!), but promotion schedule is mostly talent-based (many people cap out at \~250k total comp)--&gt; median probably \~$1-3M total over 10y
* Feasibility: straightforward to get out of undergrad if you're comfortable with core CS skills (definitely 106a/b, 107 + 161 not necessary but help a lot). CS section leading is a great way to hone these skills (and also a recruitment pipeline)
* QOL: the best out there. work as much as you want, when you want. you can be in at 10 and out at 4 if you want, and the chefs/nap pods are totally a thing
* How to get the gig/what to study: CS or symsys. feasible from other majors but you need to work harder. *Cracking the coding interview* will prepare you for interviews.

Consulting: McKinsey, Bain, BCG, etc.

* Comp: $100k starting, promotions every two years with a \~$100k raise each time but ""up or out"". Consulting also has some of the best exit opportunities out of the bunch, in that when you leave the firm, you can go become an executive at most Fortune 500 companies (usually Director/VP roles--1 yr consulting = 2yrs internal at the company)  --&gt; \~$2-4M total over 10y
* Feasibility: just about anybody can get a consulting gig if you learn how to do case interviews; Stanford brand name makes even MBB jobs straightforward to get
* QOL: \~12h days during the week, weekends protected. Lots of perks (travel, credit card points, great insurance/retirement). Good balance between grinding, growth opps, and perks
* How to get the gig/what to study: anything goes here, consulting doesn't assume prior knowledge, but maybe a slight bias towards engineers b/c consulting traditionally hasn't attracted them. *Case in point* is the go-to case interview prep book.

With all of these, try to get an internship your junior summer--all of these firms fill up to 75% of their full-time classes with interns from the previous summer, and intern interviews are generally gentler than for full-time. Plus, you can make anywhere from $15-30k for just 10 weeks of work at these places.

"To answer a few of your questions:


-Intro CS classes (and a lot of intro STEM classes) are several hundred people. You’ll have a section with an upperclassman section leader with ~15 students. There are very established ways to seek help on assignments, so no issue finding a TA to help with assignments if you’re stuck.


- Mental health support is pretty bad - anything long term (more than ~6 sessions) must be done off campus (or in the med school but they don’t accept the student health insurance for outpatient visits). This involves biking at least 2 miles since freshmen aren’t allowed cars. Keep in mind that virtual mental healthcare sucks when you have a roommate.


- Quarter system can feel rushed, but it really depends on how you work / learn. It’s good for people who can stay really engaged for 10 weeks but would get bored before 16 weeks are up. Bad for people who are going to want to take a break after midterms since there isn’t typically too much of a lull before the end of the quarter stuff. 


- A huge factor here is environment. Do you want to live on a pretty insular campus in suburban CA or do you want to live in New York City? I’ve lived in both and both are awesome, but obviously very different. You definitely have to consider your gut here.

"&gt; Would I have the benefit of the doubt given that I am a frosh, we are in a pandemic, and that anything I plan to apply to in the future will most certainly not be related to theory or discrete mathematics?

Not a problem at all. You’ll have plenty more chances to prove yourself in future advanced classes. Many people I know (myself included) have gotten fucked in at least one class, and it has never been a handicap on opportunities.

For CS internships, what matters much more is getting referrals and studying for the coding challenges. For research opportunities and coterm admissions, it helps to do well in the relevant classes, but there are also plenty of other ways to prove your skill/motivation. For instance, meeting with professors at faculty lunches (hopefully available soon) is a great way to get to know about their work and possible ways to help out.

It sucks that CS 103 is structured this way during COVID. As mentioned in the other comment, it’s not too late to find a study group. Just know that even if you end up with a subpar grade, you won’t really be blocked off from any opportunities (especially given your more applied interests).

You were able to show admissions officers that you have an incredible capacity to achieve without all of the extra help so many other applicants had. That in and of itself is an incredible accomplishment, and you definitely deserve to be here.

"Financial aid is really strict with the kinds of people they allow to apply as independents, since there has been a trend with wealthy families at other schools to lie in order to save money. Unfortunately, it's probably impossible for you to qualify for financial aid as an independent. The only people I know who have been able to do so are a few asylum seekers, and a student whose parents both passed away. As the other posters are saying, your best bet is to reconcile with your parents, and convince them that you've reconsidered your relationship with their faith. Parents are on campus two or three times a year, and will have no way of keeping track of what you do here. I've usually seen this situation apply to some LGBTQ students and international students. I know of someone who learned the tenets of a religion so well he was able to convince faith leaders of his devotedness, all in service of getting a religious exemption to the meal plan. If you've been raised in a religious environment, it should be even easier for you to convince your parents of your faith. You might even be able to position the argument you had with them as you struggling with your faith, and it motivating you to reexamine your beliefs and become even more religious. I don't follow a theistic religion, but I still find most theist texts profoundly interesting, and I think they contain a lot of truth about the world and existence in general. Convincing your parents of your beliefs doesn't need to be wholly dishonest. I recommend being as charitable as you can to their beliefs, and using this as an opportunity to better understand them. Engaging with their religion from a position of faith (or charity toward faith) might even help you all find some common ground.",1619139667,1,0

"Storage: many clubs rent a storage locker. If you have some members who are living in their own space (grad student apartment, off campus apartment), they may offer to hold some stuff in their room.

For space to operate: the official option is you can rent a space on campus (25Live). But it is pricey, probably $100+ per hour for a decent sized space. Otherwise, many clubs who have connections (e.g. upperclassmen living in Row houses on campus) can unofficially rent out a common area space in that Row house for free to carry out their activities.

So TLDR, if you have connections then you won't spend much money, but if you don't have connections then prepare to pay. Actually, you will come to find out, a lot of things at Stanford need connections to pull some strings for you lol

You can get funding for your club thru ASSU, if you register as a VSO.

They aren’t bringing the ovens/stove back next year according to housing people but there is a communal kitchen in EVGR (not sure if it’s shared between a couple floors or the whole building).

"Given that Mirrielees is easier to get into and they 100% have kitchens I would focus more on that. But historically it is hard to draw into Mirrielees without a med-draw for needing a kitchen. If for some reason this might apply to you, I suggest looking into it further. Med-draw is how countless athletes get into Mirrielees. The last thing to consider is that Mirrielees and EVGR turned a lot of their two room doubles into two room triples. Meaning that it is very unlikely you will get a two room double so if you’re just drawing with one other person be prepared to share with a stranger/someone else. Additionally living in Mirrielees with two people in one room seems horrible and a really tight fit.",1619109739,4,0

"I think this is definitely doable but challenging. I’m currently doing a full-time internship and taking 5-units for my flex term, and I’ve also taken CS110 online. Time-wise, if your internship  is truly around 40hrs/wk, you’ll be fine. CS110 is easier online than in-person, and when I took it, there weren’t any exams either. Recorded lectures and a large number of office hours make the class very doable with a full-time job, especially if you manage your time well.

"&gt;What is Harvard telling you about their respect for you as a hardworking student instead of merely a source of income?

I don't really think it is a matter of respect. I believe they stopped what they called their ""advanced standing program"" just a couple yrs ago, through which students would get AP credit. They got rid of it b/c no one was really taking advantage of it. They still let you place out of some requisite courses based on them tho.

"You are in an enviable position.

My wife (we are both Asian American East Coast Stanford alums) chose Stanford over Harvard, and I was shocked that her parents allowed her to do so, due to the brand-name pride that comes with the big H name.

That being said, we both have plenty of friends from the H circle (post-graduation due to socioeconomic factors, lots of H and S crossover occurs), and in my completely sample=biased exposure, we find that Stanford alums have both a better ungrad satisfaction, and a lower standard deviation from that satisfaction. I sure wish there were better satisfaction metrics available.

The finance/consulting thing is, to me, a non-factor. All the blue chip firms recruit heavily from both firms.

With regard to CS, the education itself is certainly going to be excellent at both schools. The network effects of being in Silicon Valley, though, for CS cannot possibly be overstated. Stated differently, Google and Facebook etc. will recruit heavily from both schools. But it's the smaller, growing companies that are harder to access if you're not right there in the Valley.

"Happy to, hope it's helpful! 

In my opinion a lot of what I'm doing now doesn't qualify as traditional electrical engineering, a lot of the boundaries / definitions become less clear over time. I'd say what I'm doing now is more along the lines of system architecture: 

* With somewhat of a software view (e.g. ""an operator should interact with a UI in this system which should get the info from this other system via an API"") 
* With somewhat of a network view (e.g. ""when a user over here wants to get authenticated this component is going to communicate with this server hosted in a private datacenter in a different country, do we have the internal routing in place to support that?"")
* With somewhat of a traditional system engineering view (e.g. ""You're building me a solution, here is a list of my use cases that I need to see how they will work with the solution you're providing."") 

So is this electrical engineering? Maybe, I haven't really tried to define it. Whether it is or not, over the next few years I see myself continuing to move into more technical leadership from a system or end-to-end perspective for communications networks, and I see myself staying at Viasat for at least another year or two (for years I've been saying ""at least a year or two, not going to try to think really past that""). 

In terms of my network, I felt like it helped quite a bit for getting my internships, but not at all for my job offers. For my internships: 

* My first one (only a few weeks) was for a startup my mom's friend founded 
* My Northrop Grumman one I made a good impression/connection with the recruiter at a career fair with my planning and research on the company (unrelated to my resume). This probably got me the internship - so no prior network, but I think I got the internship for non-resume reasons (of course my resume had to be ""good enough"") 
* My Cisco one I ran a 70+ company career fair in undergrad, a few days before the fair Cisco's lead college recruiter invited me to an interview unsolicited, which led to the internship. Even though I don't think I had talked to her directly before the interview offer, I count this as my network getting me the internship
* My senior year of undergrad I was also part of the first group through an engineering leadership center. At the end of the year at the farewell dinner (for the 5 of us that were graduating out of &lt;20 in the center) I met one of the Viasat co-founders who was on the center's board. After I started grad school I reached out to him again and he put me in contact with the person in charge of college recruiting, so I feel that my network got me this internship. 

For my job offers: 

* At the end of my Northrop internship I was told ""You made it clear that you want to do grad school. If you didn't, I would have offered you a job after you graduate."" 
* At the end of my Cisco internship it was strongly hinted that if I applied for a full-time job I would have a huge advantage over any other applicant because of my internship. 
* After my Viasat internship ended when I applied for a full-time position, I didn't even do an interview, I was just offered a full-time position. Either I slipped through the cracks somehow, or my internship was good enough that they didn't feel the need to interview me. 
* I got a full-time offer from Lockheed Martin in Sunnyvale that I declined. I think my first contact with them was a career fair outside of Tressider Union, so I didn't feel my network played any role here.",1614381343,1,0

Usually lack of motivation started happening when I overworked myself or lost sight of my ultimate goals. One other thing that might help is to shift perspective in some way--try doing something new or meet a new person, and that might help realign you with why you're here.

"Lots of good advice here as always. The best advice I can give you is to set yourself up with all the conditions necessary for success early. That means:

*Make sure your living space is conducive to studying or at least getting regular sleep. If your roommate is an obstacle to that, address the problem as soon as it arises--don't wait and hope it will get better. And don't be afraid to raise it--a roommate who doesn't treat you well isn't going to be a longterm friend anyway. My frosh roommate had his girlfriend over every night, and I was kind of passive aggressive about the situation, but didn't address it head-on. Needless to say, it never got resolved, my grades suffered, and we haven't spoken since freshman year anyway.

*Assume that you are slightly below-average and work extra hard to compensate. That doesn't mean you should assume you didn't deserve to get in, but rather that you are just an average Stanford student. If you take this approach you'll do better in your classes and your classmates will like you better. And you'll have plenty of time to celebrate your achievements later.",1614351017,5,0
"I agree with most of this except for making friends freshman year. We definitely had people in my frosh dorm who stayed close (two married couples even), but you shouldn't feel pressured to commit the energy to long-term friendships in your frosh group if you don't feel like you have much in common with them. I met two of my closest friends at Stanford my sophomore year, and we're still good friends more than a decade later.",1614349143,5,0
"I think what matters more than any of that are your answers to the following questions (assuming you’re not legacy, etc.): 
1. What would you do with your life if you got into Stanford? 
2. What do you want to do during high school regardless of whether or not it resulted in a Stanford acceptance? 
These questions might seem vague/not the information you’re looking for, but you should really think about them. I wish someone broke it down for high school me this way. I think the majority of the people who go to Stanford, at least before they got here, had commonalities in their answers to these questions. 
Good luck! Good job seeking your dream but remember at the end of the day it’s always a crapshoot  and wherever you end up you will do great things with your life :)",1614348441,1,0
"Hey, some people here *really* don't like high schoolers posting, but I thought I'd give my two cents:

(Of course, disclaimer: I'm just a college sophomore who had an unhealthy obsession with college admissions two years ago. Take my words with a grain of salt.) Colleges in general don't really look for a specific ""mold"" of student; their goal is to build a diverse class. Especially in Stanford's case (our admission decisions definitely seem a lot more random compared to peer schools like HYPM), there's really no guaranteed ""one-size-fits-all"" laundry list to check off to get in. As a result, the best way into Stanford (and similarly, other top schools) is to pick a niche, get very good at it, and have some compelling statement explaining why you are unique and how you stand out from others. Of course, intellectual vitality is important as well (it is literally scored by the AOs in the application), so make you show some love for exploration. 

Personally, I went to an incredibly disadvantaged (literally one step away from alternative school) high school, and my niche was in math. (No APs, instead took Dual Enrollment courses to Real Analysis/Abstract Algebra, and did a cool semi-selective math camp.) Scores wise, 1530 SAT (SAT Subjects are abolished now so I won't mention them here). Since Stanford required so many essays, I wrote about a lot of things: from exploring concepts in math, to my love for ethnic food and video games. Outside of my niche, I also explored stuff like physics, chemistry, and integrated that a little into my writing. My application readers mentioned potential and success despite adversity, but also dinged me for not having any national awards, so that might be something to consider (Honestly in hindsight, math is probably one of the most objective ""spikes"" one could have and I played a dangerous game using it as my focus despite not having any national awards)

Also, no, you don't *need* to be ahead in math to go to Stanford. We have Calculus I here, and many people take that their first year. But if there is an option to pursue higher math, you should definitely do it. Beyond just college admissions, coming in with greater mathematical maturity and starting off at a more advanced class really pays off. 

So sorry if this seems vague, but I hope these general tips and my experience with the process helps you. You can also DM me with any additional questions (this post might get downvoted to oblivion when everyone wakes up, so you might end up deleting it) - I'll be a bit busy these upcoming weeks but will be happy to answer any questions over spring break!

I don't think the CURIS stipend is taxed either. Take home for this internship is ~$2300 a month which is awful for Bay Area tech.,1614314684,5,0

&amp;#x200B;

Now if this is a preseed startup I'm a bit out of my depth since I've never dealt with salaries from companies at that stage. However, when I evaluate financial decisions I usually compare it to the baseline salary I could receive which for me is summer research through CURIS. You receive a $7500 stipend for 2.5 months of work which is a rate of $3k a month. With that in mind, I'd probably try negotiate to see if they can at least match that.

&amp;#x200B;

Also keep in mind living costs. If you're working physically in the Bay Area, your monthly rent is probably going to be $1k a month so most of your salary is going to be eaten up by those living costs.

In general, BOSP wants as many undergrads to study abroad as possible so they’ll be more likely to accept upperclassmen who will be graduating soon or people who aren’t flexible in which quarter they can go.
