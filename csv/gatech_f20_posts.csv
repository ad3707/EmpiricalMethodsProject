OSI Trial for Academic Misconduct,"The number of OSI cases has increased ridiculously this year, but there's not a lot of information on actual experience with OSI for students who are accused of academic misconduct. Aside from OSI's website, there's the Chegg-Physics case, the CS1371 one and some comments and posts scattered about on here. It's a stressful, time-consuming process and I wanted to write out what I learned from my experience so students have an idea of what they're in for (particularly with smaller, first offenses).

When you are suspected, the Complainant (typically a professor) usually won't notify you, they will just report you. Your grades are supposed to be entered normally, so you won't know until OSI contacts you or you receive an Incomplete in the class. OSI is able to go back and change your letter grade in the class even if the semester is over or even if you've graduated (although this is for heavier assignments like finals, I believe). Because of how many cases there are lately, it can take about a month to be notified (things are sped up based on the nature of the case and the timeline of the student, like graduating seniors get priority).

OSI first emails you asking for a meeting with an administrator for the incident that occurred on X date, in X class, for X violation of the Student Code of Conduct. Once OSI contacts you, this is the initial process (1):

 * Review of Student Rights
 * Review of Information Submitted to OSI
 * Case Resolution Preference

You meet with an admin one day (for online, you can choose BlueJeans or Phone call) where you review the process and your rights (2), and then you review the evidence submitted with the admin. You choose how you'd like to handle the case, through an administrator or through the Student Conduct Panel (a group of students who review your case). Most people go with admin, as I hear the Student Conduct Panel tends to be harsher. 

You meet with the admin again and provide your statement. They will ask you certain questions pertaining to you as a person and to the case, such as your performance in the class prior to the incident. You can submit whatever evidence/information you deem relevant to the case (although there often isn't much to submit) things like your thought process for a line of code or question, your notes, or even a letter from someone (employer, professor) attesting to your character. The admin then reviews the information you submitted and contacts you if they have any follow-up questions. They then reach out to the professor with follow-up questions after speaking with you. I believe they inform the professor of your statement and ask questions pertaining to the plausibility of your statement or for additional facts regarding the incident. You have the right to view your professor's responses so you can see all the information being considered in the decision and provide a response if you wish (2).

After following up with the professor and the student, the administrator reviews all the information submitted and makes a decision. From what I understand, OSI usually does not do any investigation or fact-checking on their own - the documentation and statements they receive is all they look at in making their decision (as well as any prior history of misconduct). They may be involved in a more investigatory capacity depending on how big the case is and the parties involved. The usual process is that they receive the complaint, collect statements from the students, follow up with the professor, and make their decision. You receive your decision in an email stating whether or not you are responsible for violating the Student Code of Conduct. Your faculty is notified of the decision as well. If you're found not responsible, congratulations and there's nothing further except to wait for your professor to fix your grade. I'm not sure what the process is if you are found responsible, but for your first violation, sanctions start at a 0 on your assignment or failure in the course (3). After the decision, there's an appeals process to review the decision, but I don't know much about that. 

Cases are unique and vary a lot. Some professors will try and speak with the students informally first, although they are obligated to report perceived misconduct to OSI. Make sure to ask your professor if they've reported you, I've heard of students who come to an informal agreement with the professor only to later learn they were already reported and have to go through the trial with OSI. OSI also has a certain reputation for being severe - ""the standard of proof for OSI’s rulings is a Preponderance of Evidence (if there is a greater than 50% chance that the accused is guilty, they are guilty), not beyond a reasonable doubt"" (6). 

Even though it's extremely stressful to be under investigation, especially because of how much power OSI has to affect your academic life, it's important to remember that it's not the end of the world. Stay calm and positive, try not to let it impact your mental and physical health and reach out to people you trust for support. The worst part is waiting, but keep in mind that OSI is swamped recently and that initiating contact with your case handler through repeated emails and meetings will help move things along. Right now is a trying time for everyone. A lot of students have been cheating lately, but the number of false reports and professors jumping the gun to report have gone up as well. If you did not violate the Honor Code and got accused, stay calm - consider the evidence against you, provide your statement and any evidence you can to back yourself up. If you did violate the Honor Code knowingly or unknowingly, be straight with OSI and be careful in the future.

Class is consistently going over 5-15 minutes,"I have one class that keeps going \~10 minutes over.

I feel like the precedent is set and I would feel awkward pointing it out during class or even emailing the professor personally. Am I being too picky? Should I just leave the call when class is technically over? Worth saying anything? A few minutes here and there is fine, but a consistent minimum of 5 minutes over, and sometimes as much as 15 minutes adds up to \~15-45 extra minutes each week, and roughly an extra class period every 2-3 weeks.

My professor for one of my courses sent out a canvas announcement that people had violated GT honor code on our last quiz and that he wanted people to reach out to him and make a voluntary statement saying whether or not they had done so. I felt like that was directed towards me. The day before that quiz, my grandma passed away from complications of pulmonary fibrosis and I lost my will to study. I was already unprepared and I accepted that I was going to fail. I emailed my professor asking if I could have any sort of extension or if anything could be done, but that ended up not happening so I took my quiz in the morning and had to drive up to my relatives house afterwards. I was already so stressed during the quiz and I had to use the restroom urgently so I stood up and left the camera in the middle of the quiz while Honorlock was on. I took pictures of the timestamps on the quiz for evidence but I was so extremely depressed the rest of the day and week that I never even sent them to him. I emailed him regarding my situation but he doesn't respond to anything I say. Maybe its just a professor thing or something in academia to not respond to students but I am suffering from tremendous mental pressure right now that I can't express to him through email. I'm thinking to myself that he either doesn't like me because I don't have a good grade in his class or he doesn't believe me and he wants to report me to GT academic integrity. I was so stressed that I emailed him multiple times and even asked to talk to him. Maybe that was a mistake. What the hell should I do? I can't bring this up during his regular office hours without sounding like a loser. I feel like complete shit right now. I'm supposed to be studying for a test but I can't even motivate myself to do that.",1603855833,1,0

I’m about an hour or so outside Atlanta at the top high school in the state but that means I’m basically just a mediocre student here with modest resume filler- one or two STEM things but most of it is art oriented (since SCAD is too expensive a digital media degree from GATech w/ Zell Miller is financially more feasible).

These anti-cheating systems do almost nothing to prevent cheating and inconvenience everyone,"In my physics class, we are required to be on camera the whole time and to show our desk to our proctor; but there is nothing stopping anyone from hiding notes in their desk or using their browser, and someone has cheated with Chegg on the last two exams. In my Chinese class, we use Honorlock, which has a variety of problems related to security (and forces you to use chrome) but importantly is buggy and made switching between the Chinese and English keyboards during the exam difficult. Meanwhile, in differential equations we have no overt measures to combat cheating other than a tight time control, and it has been a great experience with no observed issues. 

My point is that if anti-cheating measures don't actually prevent cheating, maybe it would be better to skip the hassle and at least allow the testing experience to be convenient and simple.",1603840702,1,0

Question for international students,"Hi fellow international students !

I am French and will go to GT Atlanta during Spring 2021 but i'm pretty lost with all the steps to go through to get the visa.
Indeed, I still not received any information about the I-20 form and cannot do anything on iStart.

Are others in the same situation and for those who experienced it, do you have some insights about it ? 

I did all the medical stuff but did not send any medical or financial documents yet. Is it mandatory to send them (on a plateforme or whatever) to get an access to iStart and the I-20 form ?


Thank you for reading !!!",1603828332,1,0
Situational Awareness: Tropical Storm Zeta,"# [SITUATIONAL AWARENESS](http://prepare.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/SitReps2020/sitrep_20200210_2020-8.1.pdf)

**SUBJECT:** Tropical    Storm Zeta

**SITREP #: 2020-8.1**

**ISSUED:** Tuesday, October 27, 2020 at 1:30 PM

**OVERVIEW**

The remnants of Tropical Storm Zeta will impact the metro Atlanta region Thursday morning with heavy rain, high winds and possible tornadoes. Zeta is expected to strengthen into a hurricane as it moves into the Gulf of Mexico today. It should make landfall along the SE Louisiana coast late Wednesday and track generally to the NNE through Mississippi and Alabama. For our region, the biggest threats will be from high winds, flash flooding and a possible tornado. Wind gusts Thursday morning may peak between 35-40 mph, with sustained winds above 20 mph. This will likely lead to quite a few trees down and power outages in the metro Atlanta region. Typically, we see minimal impacts to our campus electrical grid (mostly underground) from this level of wind. ***However, for those who are teaching, learning and working remotely, you may experience some power loss Thursday morning in the metro region.*** The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued a Flash Flood Watch for North Georgia, including Fulton County from Wednesday morning through Thursday evening. Rainfall totals should be between 2-4”, especially as Zeta should continue moving quickly to the NNE. Finally, an isolated tornado will be possible in this highly sheered environment. Remember that tornadoes spawned from tropical cyclones are often small, short-lived, and difficult to detect. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Forecast Wind Gusts \(NWS Atlanta\)](https://preview.redd.it/pi9hx8ggyov51.png?width=539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3b5c1a2dd8464f62b3504a3efec1650ead16e07)

**PRIMARY HAZARDS**

* Winds gusting to 40 mph, bringing down rain-weakened trees and power lines.
* Isolated tornadoes
* Flash flooding, especially where heavier bands train for a longer period.

**TIMING**

The main threat will be Thursday AM (5AM – Noon)

**NEXT STEPS**

* The Georgia Tech Police Department Office of Emergency Management will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as necessary.
* Follow the GT Office of Emergency Management on twitter [@gtpdalerts.](http://www.twitter.com/gtpdalerts)

Why salt in pasta water is a scam,"We all know salt lowers the freezing an boiling points of water, but how does this help cook pasta faster? If it only lowers the boiling point of water, and you place the pasta in at this lowered boiling temperature, then it is effectively the same as placing the pasta in unsalted water at this lower temperate (pre-boil). So then why do we put salt in pasta water before the pasta? The only logical conclusion would be to make us feel better about putting the pasta in while its boiling but not have to wait for it to actually reach 100 Celsius.

I genuinely would like to hear an expert opinion on this to give me the truth.",1603826941,1,0

Has any international student here applied for a tuition waiver?,"Hello, how are you all doing? :) I hope you're well physically and mentally. I'm not fine at all, I hope you're not like me. :)

I have a question for fellow international students, or if anyone knows anything, please let me know.

I'm planning to apply for a tuition waiver this spring. My dad had a stroke in the summer unexpectedly, and they said the deadline was too late for the fall application so I had to take a loan instead. The deadline is coming up soon so I'm in kind of a rush, I've been so busy with work and school, trying to get by barely. 

I want to ask how the process went for you guys, was it easy? fast? did it go smoothly?

How did you prepare and what did you include for the evidence and documents? I'm sure my family has medical bills and stuff, but they're all in vietnamese, so I don't know what to do with the translation process. 

How did you guys write the essay? I'm honestly in a dark place but I don't want to sound pitiful, because I don't think they'd care anyway. 

Please share your process and experience going through it if you don't mind. I very appreciate all your help. :)

Thank you for taking your time reading this.

I'll start:
I never EVER felt comfortable asking for help in my classes or otherwise. So... I didnt ever go to office hours or PLUS sessions. I was terrified that my questions would be deemed ""too dumb"" or I'd be laughed out for being so behind. It was at the point where I literally rehearsed my questions BEFORE clicking the bluejeans link, but never actually joined. Although virtual office hours are slightly better (disabled audio/video), I still couldnt bring myself to ever join.
     I was driven to desperation with O chem, however. I forced myself to join office hours AND a plus session (wild right??) and guess what? Nobody laughed at me, talked down to me, or put me on the spot. I actually learned a lot and feel much more confident about the material.

Taking a gap year and now kinda unsure if I still have a spot next year :(,"I apologize for deviating from the usual covid-related posts on this sub, but I'm hoping someone here can help ;(

Due to coronavirus, I decided to defer enrollment til next Fall. I got approval from Georgia Tech and was told to regularly check my email/student portal throughout the year for info from the school. However, I recently got notified that my school email would be closed because I'm no longer a student. I guess this is an automatic process, but it said old emails are deleted for graduating students or students who are leaving GaTech (of which I'm neither). Now I can't see the old emails I got from the school, including the one they sent me with info about my gap year. When I emailed, they said I'm in their system as an ""applicant"" not a ""student"" anymore, so that's why I won't keep my email.

But I'm also kinda confused because they made it sound like I'm supposed to maintain communication with them during the year? And if I'm an ""applicant"" in their system, does that mean they're not guaranteeing my spot anymore..?

Sorry if I'm worrying over nothing, but I'm not really sure if this is an accident or not and have no idea who to contact. If anyone has taken a gap year before enrolling or has any insight on who I should contact for help, it'd be very much appreciated!",1599790051,1,0

"Join Committees, the Judicial Branch, or the House of Representatives!","Hey guys! We have a couple of opportunities to get involved in making real change on campus. 

1) The first is to join an SGA committee. You can access the full list of committees here: [https://www.sga.gatech.edu/undergrad-exec/executive-committees/](https://www.sga.gatech.edu/undergrad-exec/executive-committees/), and they include things like Government Relations, Sustainability, IT Board, and more! These committees do really tangible work in specific spaces of campus, so if you want to make real, tangible change, this is for you! The link to the app is [sga.gatech.edu/commmitteeapplication](https://sga.gatech.edu/commmitteeapplication) **Apps are due Sept 14th at 11:59pm!**

2) The second would be to join the Undergraduate Judiciary Cabinet. The UJC serves two main purposes: (1) upholding non-academic integrity and (2) interpreting any actions or legislation of SGA to uphold the system of checks and balances provided for by the Undergraduate curriculum. A justice on the cabinet is an individual who demonstrates strong leadership capabilities, a passion to better the Georgia Tech community, and strong moral character. They hear a variety of cases, ranging from academic issues to social misconduct, and serve alongside the Office of Student Integrity to achieve their mission. Many of the justices have found this to be one of the most challenging yet rewarding ways to serve the Georgia Tech community, and we continue to find each case more interesting than the last. If you’re interested, please fill out our Fall 2020 application by **11:59 p.m. on Friday, September 25**! **Application Link:** [https://forms.gle/npFFchPU1e1bwABr5](https://forms.gle/npFFchPU1e1bwABr5)

how to deal with a rude professor?,"I’m posting this for my friend because they don’t use reddit.

Today my friend had a particularly upsetting interaction with their professor. My friend is in a class that has a group project component, and today during lecture the groups were put into breakout rooms to discuss their projects. While my friend was talking to the other members of the group, the professor entered the breakout room (without my friend realizing). My friend was talking about something for the project, and happened to use the word “like” a lot while speaking.

The professor did not approve of the way my friend was speaking, and told my friend they sounded like “a pathetic uneducated middle-schooler” and should be speaking more professionally. This professor said this in front of my friend’s entire group, and my friend felt extremely humiliated.

My friend understands that using the word “like” in a professional setting is not favorable. However, this was a group project meeting. Moreover, the professor could’ve easily given this criticism in a much nicer (and more professional!) way. These comments have really upset my friend and really took a hit to their self esteem, and that’s why I’m posting this for them, because I’m furious and I think this professor needs to be called out.

I know other people who have taken this professor, and they have all said he maliciously calls out students (most of the time it’s women). Obviously I think professors should be able to give criticism, but criticism in this way only discourages students. It doesn’t promote learning, and makes students fear their professors. So, how does one go about dealing with a professor like this?",1599679223,1,0

An Unoriginal Vent Post,"I know I’m not alone in this at all, in fact, as a CM student I’m sure my current workload is significantly more forgiving that many of yours, but I had to vent for a second. 

I’m really struggling with this online situation. I’m a transfer student, and I knew tech wasn’t going to be easy, but I managed to get all A’s my first semester (Spring 2020) because I put the time in, both in class and at the CULC. I was able to bisect my life into campus and home, I could wake up in the morning, attend class and do homework between classes, go to the gym at the end of the day, and be done, relax, and only need to seriously cram when exams were right around the corner, and even then I felt carried and assisted by the momentum of the in person lectures, reviews, and group study sessions with friends and peers in my class. 

Now, I wake up, roll out of bed, and maybe half the time make it to my lecture on time. I feel totally alone, drained of energy and attention span, and perpetually behind. Multivariable Calc is especially scaring me right now— I flat out earned a 15 on our first quiz, and our first test is right around the corner. I’ve been studying for almost a week, but I have a sinking feeling that I’ll have to drop the class anyway— the content seems insurmountable to me right now, especially because the lectures are next to useless and because the TA’s can’t see us, I feel as if they feel more emboldened to rush through problems with little explanation. I feel disconnected from the content and the class community at large. 

So much of my time is spent in the same chair, the same house, the same bed. Lines blur between the time to work and the time to rest to the point that I don’t do much of either. I’m upset, to be honest, that I’ve managed to let things get to this point. I know consciously that a W probably isn’t a huge deal, but I don’t want another one on my transcript (I already have two). 

I don’t know, I guess I’m wondering if anyone could share similar struggles, or maybe offer some solutions that have help them so far with these kinds of feelings. Stay strong everyone.",1601847162,1,0
Is senior design exploitative?,"Doing ISYE senior design rn and my team and I are working our ass off to improve various processes &amp; save this company some money. We aren't paid or compensated in any way and spend anywhere from 12-20 hours/week/person working on this stuff. The average cost savings for an ISyE SD project is $3.3 million. I even recall one team a while back that saved Walmart (#1 on Fortune 500 list) $16 million annually.  

I can't help but think the program in its current state is exploitative, making students work literally for FREE to improve the finances of a random company. In any other context, this would be unacceptable. I wonder if it also is teaching us the wrong lesson about the value of our time as employees. Of course, it's successful in that we finally get to apply the skills we've learned throughout the curriculum, but I think its ethical questions should be addressed.

But they do not reply to my emails.

Their lessons they never go up on the board or work examples they simply read off a word document in a monotone voice and they get angry if you ask them question in office hours. They never show their face or work. Their lectures are not very useful.

I have lost interest all together. I found a solution.,"I've been at GT for 3.5 years. In person classes were hard, but they were at least interesting. There used to be a social life on campus, and there were always good ways to blow off steam. None of this is true currently.

This semester has taken the fun out of engineering and I'm struggling to find the motivation to even watch lectures. I cant stand watching lectures that are lower quality than a 2007 youtube video streamed through AOL. Its frustrating, it doesnt spark a joy of learning and everything feels like busywork and homework.

My solution (after this semester) is to quit! I'm taking next semester off and I might stay on break until covid is overwith all together. I'm currently applying to internships, coops and professional jobs to make up the time. GT doesnt require you to get your whole degree at once, so I figure while covid has made school suck ass, I'll go do something else. I dont want to pay full tuition for a lesser understanding of the subject.

I know I could saddle-up and power through these hard times, but fuck that.

A professional job/internship builds your resume, helps you pay for more school and (for me) its a lot of fun. 

To all the students that are having a shitty time like I am, I would recommend looking into what else you can do to make your time worth while!


[Edit] I dont blame GT for the shortcomings forced upon them by covid, classes are just frustrating asf.",1601586478,7,0

GT should dip into its endowment in these unprecedented times,"Just an alum rant here.  From what I can tell, GT is raking in the same tuition as last year but for a significantly lower quality product.  They know online isn't as good as in-person, which is why OMSCS is significantly cheaper than a brick-and-mortar MSCS.

GT has $1.8bn in investments, which is about 80% higher than ten years ago \[1\].  This is a once-in-a-century situation, and the students are being hung out to dry.  If GT isn't spending down their endowment in a crisis like this to give its students partial or full tuition reimbursement, I have no idea what such a large endowment is even for; it strains the definition of a ""non-profit"" institution.

A TA of my class screenshot the profile picture of my email (which is supporting Hong Kong protest and things) and posted on Chinese social media. I’m already in trouble last year and I couldn’t ever come home. Well what she posted, if it goes viral, that’s gonna make my family in trouble too. 

Remember in China if they can’t come to you they come to your family.

No matter what I stand for, even if I support Hong Kong independence, Taiwan is not China, whatever it is, I have the right to say here. If you wanna debate, email me or debate me here. What she did, posting on Chinese internet, is totally a threat to my family and trying to shut me up. 

Also, as an TA, keep your professionalism. I never express my view on the slack or to any of my students. And I don’t really care if you’re a pro Trump or pro Biden. Even you’re supporting Chinese government I don’t care it’s your right.

Question Regarding Math Credits For a Transfer Student,"Hi, I’m a transfer student from an out-of-state college that is looking to transfer to Georgia Tech. I’ve already done a good amount of research but haven’t gotten a clear answer and was looking for some help on this subreddit.

I already know that I need English 1101 and English 1102, but something that tripped me up was the Calculus 1 credit requirement for transferring. Searching up Calculus 1 brings up Math 1501, but the page seems outdated as it says that the class is “not offered after Summer 2015.”

I just want to know if what they mean by Calculus 1 is now Math 1551 for sure. If Calculus 1 is Math 1551, then I can take the equivalent at my current college in spring semester and then transfer to Tech next year.",1602539640,1,0

I made a website to help CS students set expectations when applying to internships/jobs,"Hello, your CS program is top 5 so I thought to share this here- I made a website ([jobchance.me](https://jobchance.me/)) with the goal in mind of [emulating a chance website](https://www.niche.com/colleges/admissions-calculator/) I used when applying to colleges. That website took your GPA and SAT and plotted it with others GPA/SAT and the status of their application (accepted/denied). Instead of SAT score, my site uses school rank, previous internship quality, and number of previous internships for the Y axis. A lot of the application process can't be boiled down to statistics or a resume, but lets face it- for large companies that get 10s of thousands of applicants it definitely has a large impact. I have added a lot of internships and new grad jobs already (with links to apply), but if you find a company/job that isn't listed there is a tab to add that. Also it currently relies on the honor system, so please enter data truthfully :)

Tech's Plan after Suppressing Wave One,"I did not think we'd get here. COVID cases are in the single digits, and many cases are off-campus ([https://health.gatech.edu/coronavirus/health-alerts](https://health.gatech.edu/coronavirus/health-alerts)). Test positivity rates are incredibly low ([https://gatech-covid-tracker.com/](https://gatech-covid-tracker.com/)). I think we can say that Georgia Tech has navigated through it's first wave of COVID cases. 

&amp;#x200B;

How did this happen? I'm not an epidemiologist, and even Dr. Fauci himself wouldn't be able to give you a 100% correct answer, because nobody can give you a 100% correct answer - there are too many unknowns. But, we can look at a few factors.

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Modified herd immunity threshold. Immunity is likely a real phenomena with COVID-19. Yes, there are now 7 confirmed cases of reinfection, but immunity is not a binary thing. It is not as if every person infected with COVID will either be immune, or they will be as unprotected as the rest of us. It's likely that the majority of COVID cases will gain some sort of immunity, and some will gain no immunity. For the sake of simplicity, let's just assume everyone infected with COVID at our campus has immunity.

Georgia Tech has, in total, around 900 positive COVID cases. There are \~14,000 people on campus if you wildly extrapolate from a few surveys taken on this subreddit - if anyone could find where the actual number is, it would be helpful.  Additionally, around 5-10% of the US was probably infected in the original Feb-March surge, which would be 700-1400 people. This brings us to 1600-2300 immune people in a population of 14000. 

The herd immunity threshold is given by (1-1/R0). Uncontrolled, the R0 for SARS-CoV2 is \~4. This means roughly 75% of the populace must be infected to gain ""true immunity"" - IE, you can do whatever you want, no distancing, no masking, etc. Obviously this is a bad idea. But, we aren't letting SARS-Cov2 spread uncontrollably. Mask compliance is high, people are trying to distance, people are washing their hands more often, etc. R0 is a function of environmental parameters as well - increasing distancing and hygiene decrease your R0. So what is the R0 with distancing and masking? That's a big question, but estimates from New York and Western Europe say it was somewhere around 0.8-1.1. A college campus will have a higher R0 than a typical state or nation, so we'll shift this up to 1.1-1.3. 

&amp;#x200B;

This brings our herd immunity threshold to anywhere between 9-23%. We currently have in the gane of 11.5%-16%, and some cases on campus may have gone totally undetected. [Here's](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1291092311045283841) a twitter thread by an MIT data scientist if you want to read more about the ""modified herd immunity"" phenomena.

&amp;#x200B;

2.) The people who took the most risks have already gotten COVID. Anecdotally, and logically, this makes sense. People going to bars, frat parties, etc have already been infected, and that was our ""first wave"". Unfortunately, I don't know how to quantify this in any meaningful way, but it is probably a factor.

&amp;#x200B;

3.) Behavior change. People could've seen the surge in cases and decided to be more careful - get tested weekly, avoid indoor dining, go to the CRC early in the morning when it's less crowded rather than in the middle of the day, etc. This would lower R0 as well and aid with point 1, although again, I don't know how to meaningfully quantify this.  But it is a possible factor.

&amp;#x200B;

The question now is what Tech should do. Frankly, I feel like I am wasting both money and time this semester. This is unavoidable, and not Tech's fault or USG's fault - just a virus doing it's thing. But, just as governments - those of New York, China, South Korea, Germany, etc - gradually eased back on restrictions as the first curve was crushed, I believe Tech can and should do the same. We should not throw the floodgates open and let all hell break loose - but I think we can slowly loosen the screws in a manner that improves educational experiences, and in a way that avoids a second wave. Remote learning sucks. At least for intro classes, there is far better free material on Coursera - made by people who know how to deliver content online and who have been doing it for years - as opposed to professors who were thrown into this a few months ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

As we all know, many ""hybrid"" courses are pretty much all online. I'd suggest the OPTION - for both professors and students, mandates are a god awful idea - to have more in-person hybrid sections. This won't give me my money's worth - but it'll give us something. As of now, I have three hybrid classes - and yet have not had a single in person class. These classes can be conducted in a safe, distanced/masked manner, as to keep our R0 low and keep reaping the rewards of the ""modified herd immunity"" discussed above. This might be difficult to implement in the middle of this semester, but I think it can be implemented next semester, in the absence of mass vaccination until (in the most optimistic case) February-March. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other things include opening up lounges in dorms. Also, I know visiting other dorms is technically banned, but everyone I know is ignoring that rule. Many people aren't even aware of that rule - might as well just get rid of it if compliance is close to nil. But, I'd prefer more in-person classes above all else. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was a long post. Ultimately, COVID is a game of trades - we could lock everyone in their homes until there's a vaccine, but that would destroy our society. We could let everyone run wild until there's a vaccine -  again, that would destroy our society. It's a multivariate optimization problem, where we are trying to maximize safety, education, and the student experience. I'm just a dude trying to help us find that maximum. 

&amp;#x200B;

This literally just happened. We are still shaking. I was rear-ended in the Cook Out drive thru, got out to get the other driver’s info and he immediately started yelling at us and backed up his car. Then his passenger got out and started screaming at me and my girlfriend, getting up in our faces and called me a “socialist bitch”. I was in a mask, she is not wearing one because she was the passenger in the drive-thru and we did not expect this to happen. After the confrontation the driver backed into me and almost hit my body with his car as they tried to drive away. After the video cuts he also called me a coward for wearing a mask and screamed in my face some more and an officer walked up and talked to them but we were told to leave.

Conditional Pathway Deadlines,"Hey guys,

In January of 2020, I was offered the Conditional Pathway at GaTech and I am really considering taking advantage of it. I am on track to complete all the course requirements for my major (Computer Science - Lab Science Sequence, ENGL 1101 &amp; 1102, CS 1301, and Calc II) by the end  of my Winter quarter at my institution (which ends on March 19th).  So, I will be good to go in that regard.

However, I will (just barely) miss the deadline of June 1st to complete 45+ quarter hours worth of credit  because my courses will still be ""in progress"" at that time. Instruction actually ends on June 4th at my school and my official transcripts will take about 1-2.5 weeks to process. I talked to an admissions counselor and she said that "" We will do our best to try to work with you.  Send in your official transcript (she was referring to my Winter &amp; Fall transcripts) prior to the deadline and we welcome the opportunity to receive unofficial mid-term or available grade information from your institution by June 1st and consider it before our June 15th decision release. "". However, when I viewed the Conditional Transfer Webinar, I saw that official documents are required by June 1st for an application to be considered complete. 

So, with this conflicting information, I'm doubting whether I'll still be eligible for the Conditional Pathway at all. Has anyone gone through a similar experience when transferring and could offer some insight?

Supporting Registration Issues - Email from The Office of the Provost,"Dear Students:  

 

We are aware of the technical challenges in DegreeWorks, OSCAR, and Banner Self-Service that affected the first day of Phase I Registration (Monday, Nov. 9). The Office of Information Technology (OIT) was able to resolve issues with all three services between noon and 5 p.m. on November 9.  

 

We know some graduating seniors missed their opportunity to register for key classes as a result of these technical issues, and we apologize to all students for the stress and frustration these issues created. School chairs and academic advisors have been made aware of the issue and know that exceptions may be necessary. Together with the Registrar’s Office, they are prepared and committed to help students find solutions and stay on track to graduation. 

 

For any graduating seniors in this situation, your first step should be to inform your advisor immediately. Advisors will work with school chairs and the Registrar's Office as necessary to resolve concerns. 

 

Any other students who were unable to register for desired classes should also contact their advisor to discuss appropriate planning for subsequent semesters to ensure their academic progression. Priority will be given to students who have a pending graduation date for Spring or Summer 2021.  

 

OIT continues to monitor these platforms very closely and will address any persistent issues. Should you experience any problems with DegreeWorks, OSCAR, Banner Self-Service, or BuzzPort, please do report those issues via the Services Portal. 

 

Thank you for your feedback and patience as these issues are resolved. 

 

Regards,  

The Office of the Provost",1605135148,1,0

Should I let my grade slip in pursuit of growing my technical skills,"This is one of those posts where I feel like I already know most people's answer but somewhat looking for someone to oppose it or provide success stories, but some background:

I'm being hammered right now in a major class, which I think has a reputation for being one of the harder classes in my major (honestly not as bad as I had imagined but I'm still getting wrecked from simple mistakes and no partial credit on exams). I also just had a long interview last week with a company that I would love to work for in the future that didn't go too well. That interview made me realize that while I've built things, I haven't really had to apply to a technical level any of the stuff from my classes. While my grades have been really great so far, I don't think that I have really grasped the concepts outside of exams and their applications--the interview made me realize my grades do not reflect my working, applicable knowledge that well.

So here I am, procrastinating on said hard class because a part of me wants to give up on salvaging the grade for the sake of my mental health (still give effort and learn all the material of course because i find it fascinating, but not to the level of burnout for the highest grade I can on exams) and focus on (re)learning other stuff and projects that would be more practical and hands-on and probably make me feel happier at the present, especially with summer job search going on. The biggest dilemma in me ""letting go"" is that I still tie much of my worth to my grade, despite being conscious of it and preaching against it to my peers; more directly, I want to go to good grad school outside of my home state and don't want to diminish my chances as I'm told GPA somewhat matters in grad apps. Also, a bit embarrassed because the class I'm not doing well in is taught in a different section by the professor I work for. 

Not sure what i was really seeking from this post but all feedback and personal stories welcome.",1605111194,1,0

FAQ for out-of-state students on registering to vote in Georgia,"Out of state students: share your stories about voting in Georgia! Here are some FAQs to make registering to vote for out of state students less intimidating.

**Can I register to vote in Georgia?**

Students have a choice about where to register to vote. Students attending college may register at their campus address or choose to remain registered or register at their permanent or home address. 

Voting in both locations is fraud. DO NOT DO THIS. Don't get intimidated by changing your registration though. While *cancelling* you're voter registration in your home state (if applicable) is generally a good thing to do so they have accurate info, all you really are required to do in most cases is register in the new state and not vote in the old state after doing so.

**But what about ID laws?**

If you do not Georgia voter ID or license, you can register to vote via a MAIL application (the online application requires a STATE ID so GT student ID doesn't cut it).

Georgia Tech student IDs are valid photo IDs. If you get turned away, call Fair Fight's Georgia Voter Protection Hotline at 888-730-5816

I'm counting on out-of-state voters without state IDs to comment with their experiences.  It's possible you may want to bring some proof of address (literally anything mailed to you by USPS).

**But what about $$?**

Registering to vote in your school's state does not affect your tuition status.

Registering to vote in your school's state does not affect your parents' ability to claim you as a dependent.

I'm not 100% confident on how this impacts your own taxes but my best guess is that you should use a GA address on tax documents if you are registering to vote in GA. Someone else please advise and cite sources.

Creating the next (bangers),"Hey y'all! I'm Fly Montag, and I'm an EDM producer/DJ here at Georgia Tech. Over the summer, me and a couple of other electronic/dance musicians created a Discord server called BUZZD, to promote collaboration and create a community of like-minded artists here at Tech. While you may have seen me plug our Discord server in the past, I'm here to announce that as of tonight, we're also operating as a ""label"" (really a small Youtube channel uploading music from our members), accepting original submissions and uploading them to our channel (think ""Proximity"" or any other similar channel). 

If you're a fan of EDM or similar genres/styles of music, check us out at: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzVst2OHg2-fh3URyTugacA/featured?view\_as=subscriber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzVst2OHg2-fh3URyTugacA/featured?view_as=subscriber), and follow us on IG at @buzzdofficial

If you're an artist/musician in this genre at Georgia Tech (preferably current students only, but if you're a relatively new grad, I'll allow it), and would like your music promoted through us (this doesn't give us any rights other than the right to create a visualizer with your music, so you can release it elsewhere independently as well!), fill out this form:  [https://forms.gle/8egdvNcUUtJNyFnPA](https://forms.gle/8egdvNcUUtJNyFnPA)

An update on Current Tech Scene after being away for long,"So, I am going to be back on campus as a sophomore in December after around 9 months of staying back in my home country taking online classes since March. Super excited to see everything again. But I'm especially kind of bummed about the Student center being demolished and then of course COVID. So I don't want to be really disappointed when I return to campus if it's pretty much not as lively as i hoped it would be despite these things. Just wanted a heads up on the current scene at tech with all these changes so that I don't have any high expectations and that I'm not surprised when I see the current state. I fear that everything's changed. How's the social scene, the restaurants, the new student center buildings (I don't think anything can replace the old student center but are they maybe even half as good as the old one?) and just the overall vibe on campus?

I Demand a Refund PTS,"Georgia Tech PTS ceases to amaze me how willing they are to completely disregard the students that pay the overpriced rates to park on campus and I'm tired of it. Their most recent email now demands that 

""All locations must be cleared by 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, November 25 and remain clear through Sunday, January 17.""

PTS, let me put this into perspective for you for all of the students that you are inconveniencing every game day or event that you force students to move their cars. This fall alone, you have forced students to move their cars for over 40 days, requiring them to not rightfully use the parking zone that they purchased. As someone that purchased a Fall Semester pass, let me do some quick maths for ya:

Days I had purchased the ability to use my parking pass (8/15/20-12/31/20): 131 days

Days I have **not** been able to park in the zone I purchased: 41

Percentage of days I was **not** able to park in my zone: 31.3%

Parking Pass Fee: $400

Refund I am demanding (31.3% of $400): **$125.19**

Students that have to move their cars should be financially compensated with lower parking pass rates than those that do not have to move their cars all semester. Although we can move our cars to other zones, we shouldn't have to; we paid for our specific zones! I'm not walking a mile to my car everyday because PTS is too lazy to send out the specific info regarding every individual event and the times which my car cannot be in my parking zone.

Need help figuring out what to do about my grades?,"Hello!

So this semester has been REALLY tough for me (which is the same for a lot of people). I have been having family issues, financial issues, but most of all, mental issues (this might be time, but I am struggling with EXTREME Ocd and anxiety). All of this has led to a huge plummet in my grades. I got all Bs last semester , and it was actually my first semester at Tech. I had already been burnt out, but Covid made it worse. I have always gotten As, and as a transfer student I had 59 credits and a 3.9 GPA. Tech does not combine the classes though, so that gpa does nothing for me now.

This semester I am sitting with a B in 2 classes (6 credits) a C in 2-3 other classes (5-6 credits) and a D in 1-2 classes (2-3 credits). This semester will bring my GPA down to around a 2.5. It makes me so angry that Tech does not accept my transfer GPA. I mean, I am an upperclassman taking hard classes, so why can I not be given the cushion of my past ""filler"" classes?? I know that I can bring this GPA up with dedication and hard work. But, I just dont understand why they do this kind of stuff. I used to look up to GA Tech so much, but lately I absolutely despise it... (sorry to anyone who likes tech). 

**On to my main concern. I am sitting at a D in Dynamics. Unless I get almost an 100% on the final, I do not think I will be getting a C (I have contacted the professor multiple times). This class is a major requirement, and I have heard that getting a D in a major requirement is not allowed. My Major Is Environmental Engineering. I have contacted my advisor, but she has yet to get back to me. Does anyone have any input? I see on degreeworks, that when Dynamis is a prerequisite for some classes, it says ""must have received a D or higher"". So, I can continue to take all the classes I need. But I have received mixed info from the internet.**

I was also wondering if GPA is that big of a deal? I am going to try to do internships soon, as well as look for some research opportunities. I also know that I can bring my Gpa back up to around a 3.0-3.5. I just worry that this will set me back? It is just one semester, and I have plenty of excuses. But the perfectionist in me feels like I need to have Straight A's (among other things like research/co-op) in order to get good job opportunities.

I interviewed a recent Georgia Tech OMSCS grad about his day to day at Amazon :),"Yo! Recently spoke to Eugene Yan who's an Applied Scientist at Amazon. Thought I'd share here in case you guys find it helpful.

\------

**Could you introduce yourself?**

Hi, I'm Eugene Yan. I work at the intersection of consumer data &amp; tech to build machine learning systems to help customers. I also write about how to be effective in data science, learning, and career.

Currently, I’m an Applied Scientist at Amazon helping users read more, and get more out of reading. We build book recommendation systems and contribute to efforts in discovery (e.g., search). Previously, I led the data science team at Lazada (acquired by Alibaba in 2016) and worked on e-commerce ML systems (e.g., ranking, automation, fraud detection).

**What does an average day look like?**

First, a disclaimer: Even for people with the *same* title (i.e., applied scientist), the average day will look different. It will also vary with the project’s lifecycle, such as research, prototyping, development, and maintenance. My role mostly involves prototyping and development.

My day usually has these buckets of activities:

* [**Stand-up**](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups): The team checks in on what’s being worked on, blocked, or needs help.
* **Data science/coding**: This includes (i) literature research, (ii) exploring and preparing data, (iii) running offline experiments, (iv) building prototypes (and giving demos), (v) writing and reviewing production code, and (vi) launching A/B tests.
* **Writing**: I write documents (e.g., one-pagers, design docs) to share ideas and get feedback. I also document my methodology, decisions, and experiment results for future reference. Writing my ideas and findings in documents makes them more scalable.
* **Reading**:[ Reading papers](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/why-read-papers/) helps me to be a more effective data scientist. Thus, I try to read at least an hour a day. The content includes internal/external articles and papers. (I have a bias towards papers on[ applied machine learning](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml).)
* **Meetings**: Not the most enjoyable activity for me. Nonetheless, meetings are essential for coordination and communication. A 30-min meeting beats days (or weeks) of email back and forth.

**What does a non-average day look like?**

I’m struggling with this question as most days don’t seem average. Nonetheless, here are some *exceptional* events that may come up:

* **High severity incidents**: This includes critical system failures, sometimes with customer-facing impact. Fortunately, this seldom happens for our team (i.e., less than a handful of times a year).
* **Migrating legacy systems**: All code eventually becomes legacy code. In a previous role, I was involved in a[ massive migration](https://eugeneyan.com/speaking/datacast-eugeneyan/#what-were-the-challenges-faced-during-the-alibaba-acquisition-of-lazada) (migrating cloud providers, data and machine learning systems) that required us to drop everything and solely focus on migration.
* **Attending conferences**: Many great conferences are online now which is great. Attending them requires having to balance between work and the conference.

**What’s your favourite part about the job?**

I *really* enjoy **working with data**. Through data (e.g., search logs, clickstreams, transactions), we understand our customers and how they interact with our platform and products. The data reveals interesting patterns in human behaviour. For example, consumption changes due to life-stages (e.g., becoming a parent) and socio-economic events (e.g., COVID-19, work from home). By understanding our customers better, we can serve them better.

I also enjoy **applying machine learning**. While data helps us understand customers, there’s far too much for a person (or even a large team) to process. Machine learning (algorithms) can help with this. For example, machine learning helps (i) automatically classify products and audit product reviews (ii) identify fraudulent sellers and products, (iii) recommend products to customers given their historical preferences, etc. Data and machine learning helps to write[ software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35).

Another aspect I enjoy is the amount of **leverage** working in a consumer tech company (e.g., Lazada, Amazon) provides. Our team can build and deploy machine learning systems to help customers around the world. It scales well too. Most of the system doesn’t need to change from country to country. Some necessary changes include using local data and adapting to local regulations (e.g., privacy). I get a huge kick from seeing customers benefit from our work (we see this through metrics and anecdotes).

**What’s your least favourite part about being an Applied Scientist?**

I’m still learning about how to manage this, but sometimes, I spend more time than I would like **writing documents and in meetings**. Nonetheless, it’s essential for socialising ideas and getting buy-in and feedback. I just wish I was more effective and faster at it.

Occasionally, stakeholders **suggest solutions that are far more complex** than it needs to be. I blame the overhyping of technology and machine learning in the media. When this happens, our team patiently tries to understand their perspective and educate them. Nonetheless, it takes considerable time and effort and distracts us from work that helps customers.

Lastly, because my work revolves around data, I’m also constrained by **access to high-quality data**. Delays happen now and then. Sometimes, it’s a minor lack of permissions which takes a few hours to a few days to resolve. Other times, we find that our system isn’t tracking a specific field and we need to update our trackers and wait a few months, or backfill the data.

**Do you think more people in tech would benefit from having a humanities background? You studied Psychology as an undergrad. What are some ways in which that has helped you in Data Science?**

Having a humanities background is associated with certain traits: Being more open-minded, critical thinking, better problem framing, research skills, and the ability to communicate with laymen. I think such traits would benefit everyone, not just tech folks. While a humanities degree helps with cultivating these traits, there are plenty of other ways—it can also come from having the opportunity to work on diverse, challenging problems, good role models, and work experience.

Other than the traits mentioned above, my Psychology degree taught me how to analyse qualitative and quantitative data. It also taught me about statistics (and how to be skeptical of it). In addition, I learned about how people perceive, think, and behave; this helps when I’m building customer-facing machine learning features.

**How is working at a big company like Amazon different to working at a startup like Lazada? Do you enjoy one more than the other?**

I’m still fairly new in Amazon. Nonetheless, I think Amazon’s more like a group of start-ups (rather than a big company). For example, each AWS service seems to operate like a start-up. In that sense, my experience so far has been similar to working in Lazada. We’re constantly experimenting, shipping, and getting feedback from customers. Nonetheless, being a global company, Amazon does provide slightly more leverage (see “What’s your favourite part about the job”).

I enjoy—and work best in—a role that’s between[ commando and soldier](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/commando-soldier-police-and-your-career/). Both my experience in Lazada and Amazon allow me to do this which plays to my strengths.

**Something I’ve noticed is that you’ve given a few talks and like to speak at meetups. How much do you think strong communication plays a role in being a successful data scientist? How can younger professionals cultivate that skill?**

Communication is one of the most important—if not *the* most important—skill for an effective data scientist. Initially, I didn’t think this way. But I reached out to several mentors asking what the most important skill for a data scientist was and guess what—it was communication. Thus, I focused on improving my communication and saw gains in my effectiveness within a year. (Ahmed wrote a great[ thread](https://twitter.com/AhmedTaiyeBnali/status/1302618264065908737) summarising my views.)

I think the best way to improve communication is through practice. At the start, it’s useful to read about the fundamentals of good[ writing](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-did-not-learn-about-writing-in-school/#my-writing-curriculum-suggestions-welcome) and[ speaking](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/how-to-give-a-kick-ass-data-science-talk/)—this arms us with knowledge from the experts. But to really get better, we need to practice.

How can we practice? Offer to write documents at work. This can be in the form of proposals, design documents, or internal newsletters. Or write about personal projects or what we learn on a blog. To practice speaking, offer to share at meet-ups or conferences about work-related or personal projects. With everything online now, it’s much easier.

What's the policy for studying in lecture halls after hours?,"If a lecture hall is unlocked, and I want to study in there after all lectures are done (such as after 6:00 PM), am I allowed to do so, as long as I clean up and don't break anything?

the amount of professors that are still planning exams on Monday/Tuesday really shows that our “off days” in spring won’t mean shit,"We’re not supposed to have exams due Monday/Tuesday and not supposed to have homework due after that, right?

And yet I (and plenty of people I know) have exams then and have homework assignments due afterwards. Yeah we can email the professors and the provost but that’s not the point of this post.

03/16 and 03/24 are supposed to be “No classes, assignments, or assessments” but if some of our professors won’t even follow the rules for the week of thanksgiving/week before finals, why would they follow them for two random spring days? There’s a fair chance they won’t based on how it’s going right now.

I have a feeling our “off days” are going to be pretty meaningless. Which is disappointing as all hell, because having breaks really helps. I understand why they got rid of our spring break, but I don’t think this replacement is going to work...",1606064332,1,0

As a result, I was wondering if it would be a good idea to work for a couple of years, save some money, then come back and try to get my master's.

FASET Feels Like a Cash Grab.,"I have been deciding whether to attend FASET or not. If FASET was in person I think that I would have attended with no qualms. However, FASET being held online at the cost of $115 seems a little ridiculous to me. I asked a friend who transferred last semester and they said that FASET was essentially a waste of time and money.

The problem with FASET is that participants have an advantage over non-participants when it comes to registering for classes. According to the registrar's office:

 "" Students who are not enrolled in FASET will receive a time ticket the same day as those enrolled, but the time ticket will open later in the day. 

There is no way to request an earlier time ticket.""

So seeing all the commotion on the subreddit about classes being filled and people struggling to even get on waitlists, I will attend FASET for the sole purpose of making sure I am competitive when it comes to registering for classes. I am rather bitter, I would have preferred to do the ""work"" of deciding which classes to take my self and save $115.

I am deeply disappointed, transferring from GSU (GPC), I would not have expected such unfairness from such a prestigious institution.",1605908890,1,0

Letters of recommendation issues,"I graduated in the Spring of 2019 and after working for a while decided I wanted to go to grad school.

It's been more than a month now and it's already so late that I don't think I'll even be able to apply this cycle. If the professors were unwilling to write the letter I would understand that but none of them even replied to tell me no. Could my emails have gotten filtered out since I had to send them via my personal email or something?

To all my male professors (even the ones that made my life hell), thank you for providing an experience like no other. Thank you for challenging me, and thank you for giving me the ability to learn and excel.

To all the male staff that I interact with whether it be groundskeepers, janitorial staff, library staff, etc, that keep this school clean and running like a machine, thank you for all of your hard work and creating a space that I like to call home.

This post is to give praise to the hardworking men that keep Tech alive and running and great. This does not discredit all of the hard work that the great women of Tech do. This is just to stop and say thank you. 

International Men's day is not really recognized and I find it a shame. This society is carried on the backs of women AND men. This post is not and will not be politicized.

HOPE/Zell Miller Eligibility Check,"I am worried about losing HOPE or Zell after this semester. I know I can get my GPA back up in the Spring, but I did really badly this semseter and my GPA will be low until I can correct it wil Freshman Forgiveness. 

I am trying to figure out when they will check my eligibility. If they don't check it until the end of next semester (Spring 2020), I will be able to get my GPA above 3.3, but if they check it now, I might lose the scholarship. 

My transcript currently says I have 31 Attempt Hours, 27 Passed Hours, 27 Earned Hours, and 27 GPA Hours. I believe the additional 4 hours in Attempt Hours comes from a 3-hour research assistantship and a 1-hour recitation, niether of which affected my GPA. 

So the question is this: under the Zell/HOPE system, do I currently have 31 attempted hours or 27? If I have 31, then they won't check me until the end of next semester, so I will have time to get my GPA up. If I have 27, then this current semester will push me over the 30 hour mark, and I will likely lose at least Zell, if not HOPE also.",1607211763,1,0

Why the CoC email is bigger than you realize - this needs to be a separate post,"Numbers were sent out as a justification of their xenophobia. Here’s why the numbers are lens on one aspect and a filter on the other. 
International students had to go back home after being kicked off campus cuz most of them had nowhere to go. Then, since you legally cannot work for a company when not living in the US, they had to cancel. Therefore reneging the offer. 
After that, just generalizing F1 students is bad. It’s like saying Americans are bad at &lt;insert things Americans are statistically bad at like international affairs, world geography, etc&gt; and that they not to be better and are a burden. Some of the best in the world are Americans. I personally had to turn down working on the PS5 cuz their offer came in the day after I accepted a different one for last summer. You’re also ignoring the fact that the stats vary by country and degree level. GT taught me in freshman year that stereotyping and categorization is wrong. I guess do what the say and not as they do.

Bonus: the punishment for reneging at GT for international students without a valid reason- you will never be able to intern again cuz you’ll be barred from the careers office which you need for work authorization.
Lastly, the wording was horrible. 
This is not Ok. I was defending her the last time it happened but this is a public figure that is giving GT a bad rep.

Canary is almost at 500 internship reviews! A huge Thank You from the Canary team,"Virtually all of y'all have probably gotten an email from me at some point recently telling you about the internship review platform called [Canary](https://canarystudent.com/) that my team and I are building. We just wanted to say **thank you all so much for the support**

We have gotten a ton of reviews and are almost at 500 on the site overall! And so many of you have emailed us with encouraging words and super helpful feedback, from UI bugs to feature requests. We read everything and will be taking it all into account as we work hard to make updates over the next few months! And we've also had the pleasure of sending out Amazon gift cards to the few lucky winners.

And another pretty cool announcement - we just got accepted into Create-X Startup Launch for Summer 2021!

Thank you all again - we want Canary to be valuable to the GT community and schools beyond, and we couldn't do it without you. We will continuously be working to improve the platform and help our fellow jackets avoid bad internships and find the good ones! And please never hesitate to reach out with ideas/suggestions/etc. Feel free to send me an email at [sims@canarystudent.com](mailto:sims@canarystudent.com).

If you want to follow our progress, follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/canary-internship-reviews/?viewAsMember=true) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/canary_internship_reviews/)!

Y'all are awesome! Merry Christmas!

Volunteers to lead English as a Second Language Virtual Groups,"Hey everyone, the International &amp; American Student Alliance (IASA) is a new student organization and one of our big programs is English Clusters. This program provides free, non-credit English as a Second Language (ESL) workshops &amp; conversation hours to international students who want to practice/improve their English skills in a casual environment. These are typically led by students who are native (or at least near-fluent) English speakers and interested in volunteering to assist international students and/or gaining teaching experience.

Cluster topics can range anywhere from skill-based (i.e. pronunciation) to topic-based (i.e. American movies) to casual conversation-based (i.e. discussion of current events, practicing English by playing games). While the teaching opportunities in this program are great for those studying to become English/ESL teachers or wanting to teach abroad, we still welcome those who are not. The type of Cluster that you would be able to lead (a more casual conversation hour format vs. one on pronunciation) will depend on your background, knowledge, and experience, but anyone from freshmen to graduate students can participate.

For the Spring, all of these Clusters will primarily be virtual and will go from mid-January through April. Clusters typically meet once a week for around an hour and there's a lot of flexibility for the day/time that they can be taught. In addition to these Clusters being open to all international students at GT, we're combining the English Clusters across all of the universities that our organization is at (i.e. UGA, GSU, Auburn, etc.) this Spring since most things are virtual anyway. This means that an international student here can participate in a class led by someone at a different university, and vice-versa.

If leading one of the Clusters for this program sounds like something you might be interested in, visit uiasaa.com or dm me for more information!",1607118568,1,0

Building a team for a great I2P opportunity!,"I am building a team to work on a startup run by some really cool people - Dr. Timothy Moon, Jacob Johnson (GT BME alum), and Dr. Cat Wallace (GT BME alum). 

It will be mostly prototyping and testing, but the students will have a lot of autonomy. This is for an I2P project in the spring of 2021. BME, MSE preferred, but all GT students may apply, just explain what makes you a good fit.

I have mentored many I2P and Inventure Prize teams, and will be involved as well. I have no stake in the project. I'm just doing it to give you all an awesome opportunity to do an advised project collaborating with clinicians.

The device is a novel form of nephrostomy catheter with some unique features to prevent infection and clogging. The idea is patented by the inventors, and now they need help designing the final solution, prototyping, and iteratively refining it.

Think of this as the prototyping and testing part of a Capstone project. If you enjoy that part of the process, this may be a good fit for you.

I2P counts as a 3-credit-hour undergraduate research class. The team members will be selected by the advisors from among the applicants, and the whole team will be reviewed by the I2P committee before it is official. 

Here's a link with more information about the project and application details.

Job Advice for an Off-Campus Fourth Year with Little/No Networking,"While going to Georgia Tech I never really participated much on Campus - I came to classes, studied independently, and worked in a restaurant between 30-40 hours a week to pay my rent/bills. I am a BMED Student with a minor in MSE, and a 3.34 GPA. Now that I am entering into my fifth year with one semester left to graduate, I'm trying to shift towards focusing on getting an internship/Co-Op either in the Spring/Summer so that I don't graduate without any industry experience. However, two months have gone by with zero interviews/call backs even though I have been sending cover letters/resumes to about two internship/Co-op/fellowships a week. I am fully aware that my lack of experience in my industry and involvement in school networking activities is partly to blame for this failure to launch, but what's next? Is there any advice from r/gatech on different ways to enter into the workforce in this weird limbo period between being too far along in college to have a reason for this lack of internship experience and graduating with absolutely no experience. I have never been a lazy individual, and often overwork myself to a fault (words from my ex gf's) , but there is no way of showing this drive on my resume because I focused too much on non-industry jobs.

Really feeling hopeless,"Hey

Freshman here. I started over the summer and got all As which was ok. I didn't feel bad but I was ready for fall since the summer made me realize that I learn best in-person, not online. I'm a BME major with a ID minor (just switched). I was going to do French as a minor but the intro class quickly made me realize it was not for me.

 Fall has been such a depressive amount of pain and tears that I'm just struggling to think, breathe, or relax right now in winter break. I don't know how you guys do it. I struggled through all of Chem 1211K and got a D. I failed French 1001(it really hurts and I regret not withdrawing) and my GPA is severely hurting to the point where I got an email of academic warning. The thing I'm most afraid of is losing Zell when they check at 30 credit hours. I was working a part-time job in the beginning of the semester working 30+ a week just to pay for housing, dining, etc. Now, I'm just looking for an on-campus job that's less demanding and nothing has worked.

From financial &amp; family issues to my GPA, I really feel like I'm spiralling from being a salutatorian to just really sucking and I literally just got here. I really wanna be here and I really need this degree as I'll be the first in my family to get a bachelor's degree but it's been such a struggle in just this semester.

My main question is how/when I should ask him (obviously email). I plan on sending an email after the new year, but before the next semester starts. I don't really have a deadline since I'm not taking grad courses for a while. I was also going to include my resume and my statement of purpose for the MS program as additional information.

Any advice would be helpful including whether or not it is even a good idea to ask this professor and if I should ask someone else. Unfortunately the only professor I've had for more than one semester is my English professor, who I also plan on asking for a letter. Thanks.",1608232977,2,0

Fall 2020 Master's - Mechanical Engineering Chance?,"\&gt;&gt; Title should be Fall 2021 Masters\*\*\* lol &lt;&lt;

Hey everyone,

A lil backstory - I'm from GA and went to GSMST for HS but ended up going out-of-state for undergrad. However, I want to come back to GT for my masters in Mech Eng w/ a heat transfer, combustion, and fluids concentration. I am finishing up my application now.

\[Edit: Effectively, I am considered an In-State student for tuition purposes. May affect admissions?\]

Does anybody know the average incoming GPA for masters? I have a major GPA of 3.73, work at a well-known energy company for an internship, and have been a resident assistant for 2 years. I also have other extra-curriculars, but I did not take the GRE due to it been waived. Chances?",1608227341,1,0

The final exam grade wasn’t posted on canvas so I emailed my professor earlier this week about it hoping I could argue for some points and didn’t get a response. I emailed her again yesterday (in case my email got lost) and still no response.

Public Apology for Driving a Car Into Nave Dining,"As a condition of my plea bargain and 12 step plan, I must make amends to those I have wronged. I am taking this moment to turn my life around and to admit my mistakes in order to rectify them before God and all others. I have been on a long binge to harm GT, and it stops here. Here goes:

1. I drove a car into Nave dining (I am sorry. This one might have actually GT a little. IDK)
2. I systematically campaigned, voted for, and aided anti-GT politicians. Brian Kemp, you are welcome for the governorship!
3. Since 2014, I have been on a relentless campaign to slowly weaken GT's football prospects including telling Paul Johnson the Option could still work in 2017.
4. I contributed large sums in lobbying for the creation of engineering programs at other Universities in Georgia and ran attack ads opposing the creation of new degrees at GT that might lure new talent.
5. I convinced GT that grade inflation was a myth and students would love harder classes with harsher grades.
6. I ghost-wrote the AJC story accusing GTRI of misuse of government funds.
7. I served as James Maloney's character reference on his job application.
8. I arranged for a series of gifts for mental health to be rerouted for bizarre statues near the student center
9. I fudged DM Smith's inspection report to keep it open.
10. In a long-run plan, I spent years maneuvering the right people in positions to create an easily hacked database with student materials.
11. Through a series of bold moves too complex to explain, I had the Auntie Anne's Man taken away from GT.
12. I worked to undermine important institutions at GT such as the Farmer's Market, Engineer's Bookstore, and Under the Couch.
13. I stepped in at a Board of Regents meeting demanding that pass/fail not be implemented in Spring. And I worked tirelessly after to force in-person components to classes.
14. I invited Pompeo to speak at Georgia Tech very recently.
15. I negotiated the contract with Sodexo and forced Taco Bell out the door.
16. I told Geoff Collins that 404 the culture was a great slogan.
17. I made sure the elimination of converse was a condition of the contract with Adidas.
18. I sold drugs to homeless people under the bridge that collapsed resulting in major traffic delays for students. Even worse, I defeated multiple MARTA expansion initiatives. 

I want to acknowledge that this is a non-exhaustive list, and that I don't deserve your forgiveness, but I hope eventually, the student body of GT can forgive me for this campaign of terror. I promise it ends now.",1608167907,15,0

AE Limerick study abroad program and some related questions,"Hi yall, just a freshman looking for some advice. Let me know if even considering this is a bad idea.

My friend and I were planning to do study abroad this summer. We are both AEs, and are deciding between the AE Limerick program, doing Lorraine, or just a basic summer semester. 

Limerick is possible for both of us with the credits we have done and got before coming here (taking AE 2010 this upcoming semester), but it would require us to take more advanced AE classes during the study abroad program of which we have just the bare prereqs. We'd have to take 2 AE classes for 5 weeks at a time over the 10 weeks, or take one fewer class and do research. This would involve taking a 4xxx level class.

So, is this worth trying this summer, or would Lorraine, with its greater flexibility of classes, be a safer choice? It feels like a high-risk high-reward situation, since doing Limerick would get us quite a bit ahead and give us great experience.",1607924536,1,0
Would you recommend GT premed/BME w/deflation?,"Hi!

2. Does GT's focus as a non premed school hurt premeds? (Less opportunities etc. compared to more premed focused schools like UW or UNC)? 
3. Do you think GT's reputation (ranked \~35 on US news and \~70 by WSJ including LAC's, much lower w/o) helps with medical school apps/future life? Is it worth enduring the grade deflation at GT?

2. I'm taking CS 2110 in the spring, but I was thinking about also taking ECE 2020 to test whether CompE would be a better fit for me. Is there a different class I should take that would give me a better understanding of the CompE major?

3. Basically anything that's not an application of some math/algo/data science concept I find pretty tedious/boring to program. I think I'd be much more interested in something that uses more math/science concepts how do CS and CompE compare or is it more about the job rather than the field?

4. I've heard the CompE curriculum at GT is just straight-up worse than the CS curriculum. I don't really judge based on school curriculum and focus more on my job after college, but is there merit to the complaints about CompE here?

5. After taking 1332/2110, I feel like I have a solid enough understanding of programming, but I am thinking that if I enjoy hardware stuff then there is almost no reason to not do CompE over CS since I will still have those software skills. How valid is this belief?",1609230751,1,0

Is 15 credit hrs a semster normal for upperclassmen?,"I'm a first year whose trying to make a 4 year plan. I know that 15 credit hours a semster is normal for freshmen, but is it still normal to do 15 creds a semster when you in your 3rd and 4th year and the classes get alot harder? Here's what my schedule is going to look like in my 5th semster:

PHYS 3123 - Electrodynamics (3hrs)
PHYS 4143 - Quantum Mechanics II (3hrs)
MATH 4107 - Abstract Algebra I (3hrs)
MATH 4022 - Intro to Graph Theory (3hrs)

Niche Question for Recent Grads Seeking Housing,"TLDR- can you ask your future employer to verify income/employment for the purpose of finding housing (i.e. when you've signed your offer letter but haven't started or gotten a paycheck)?

I tried to Google this one but it's a bit specific. I know it's not directly GT-related, but I figured there have been past GT grads in very similar situations.

 I've signed an offer letter for a job here in Atlanta (yay!), but my start date isn't until mid-February. Unfortunately, my lease is up on January 31st, so I'm in an awkward position where I intend to pay for my next place with savings until my income starts rolling in (i.e. pay first month plus security deposit with savings).

I'm being asked to give a contact at this future employer to verify my ""employment"" (I've only accepted the offer and as of now, the background check is complete). Is it within etiquette to email the ""new hires"" inbox and ask if someone is available to verify to a landlord that I've signed the letter and am set to begin in about a month? I wouldn't want to offend my future employer if this is an unreasonable request. Maybe it's totally common, who knows. Unfortunately the web form/application is inflexible and requires at least one phone number and email of a person that can verify my income (or future income). To be clear- it is insufficient to only provide my signed offer letter and there is no checkbox for ""I can afford a couple of months through my savings.""

If all else fails, I can stay with family until I get a couple of pay stubs, but I'd prefer to avoid that.",1609121225,1,0

1. About how rigorous are the Electrical Engineering classes at GaTech?

2. Will I have to dedicate most to all of my time studying (people have told me that it is very likely that I will have to do this) or will I generally spend a normal amount of time studying?

To GaTech CS Grads: Please help a student in mental breakdown,"Hi all, I am a CS major at GT, and I am questioning some life decisions. I have been debating between medicine and CS, and I am equally interested in both but don't have a burning passion for either, but I don't want to do anything other than these two things. 

The things that are important to me are as follows, and I was hoping from some encouragement from CS grads as to whether this is achievable at a high probability: 

\- A nice like 700k-800k house in the suburbs by the time I'm 31-32

\- Enough time and money to travel the world with my family

\- A fun challenging interesting work environment where I can collaborate with a team on cool projects/work

\- Job stability

\- Ability to work if I want even after I'm 60

\- Good work/life balance and happiness overall

I don't want to live in a huge city in a small apartment for most of my life...will getting a CS career hold me to this? I also don't want to be earning less than 130k...

Sorry if I sound materialistic, but these things are important to me. 

Is what was on my list in reach for a gatech cs grad? Or if not should I be switching to premed?

Questions about Ignite Summer Program from a Tech Junior,"Hello All. A few questions about the ignite program as my younger sibling has been accepted and wants a few answers I do not have. 

1) Is ignite a mini-mestser or a full summer of classes
2) if I accept, is it on ca.ous housing? And if so, will she have to swap rooms for fall semester?
3) If you went to ignite how many students in classrooms and what classes were available? 
3a) did you pick the classes yourself or were they somewhat generally given like many intro core classes?
4) In your opinion, is it worth it? She has a job and wants to know if losing a summer of income is worth the trade for the ignite program as an early start to her collegiate education.
5) Do sororities/clubs recruit during the summer? (I know some clubs do and some done but I don't engage in greek life)
6) Where can she view the costs of the ignite program? Is it the same as the normal costs for a summer semester?

How hard is it to keep Zell Miller?,"I got accepted to Tech a couple of weeks ago and I am so excited for the opportunity I have to go there, but there are many factors making me question if GT is really the right choice for me.

The issue is the fact that I want to have a fun college experience - I definitely plan to rush, I want to go out, attend all the football games, be involved in clubs, etc. Obviously, academics are the primary reason I am going to college but I feel a little burnt out from working so hard in high school and I'd like to be able to enjoy these four years and make amazing friends and memories. 

So, given my want to socialize and have fun as well as my major, how hard is it to keep a 3.3 at Georgia Tech? Obviously, I would prefer to keep as high a GPA as possible, but I definitely need at least a 3.3 to afford Tech.",1609003776,1,0

POV- Georgia Tech

I walk to the closest coffee shop eager to meet my teammate for the upcoming Physics semester final project.I didn't know who they were yet as I had not been present in class when the teams were announced.  Agnes Scott rang me up at the moment I entered the shop. My teammate,who was supposedly dressed in a black shirt with a red hat, was nowhere to be seen. “What is it, Agnes?” I asked. This was the tenth time she called me this morning, still stuck over the fact that I broke up with her last week. “What did I do wrong, GT? What did I do that you had to break up with me in front of everyone and humiliate me? I was the best girlfriend a guy would ever wish for.” she wailed over the phone. I sighed giving her the answer I had been giving since the moment we broke up “It just was not meant to be, we are better off as friends and I want to be single right now”. Little did she know that I was crushing on someone else, someone who was taking my attention away from her and someone she wouldn’t like. He was a breath of fresh air compared to Agnes. My knees turn into Jell-O every time he smiles at me. He was someone out of my league but he was still the one I wanted. 

“Hey, Georgia Tech right?” someone asked from behind me, in a gruff sexy voice. I looked back and gasped. There he was my team mate, dressed in black and red like he told he would be, my crush, University of Georgia.

POV- UGA

I sat at the table, sipping on my iced coffee. I had been waiting for 15 minutes now and Georgia Tech was nowhere to be seen. My phone buzzed and I saw I had received a message. It was my ex-boyfriend, Emory. Emory and I had been dating for a long time, after all we were high school sweethearts. We were a gay couple in all of Georgia, we thought it would bring up unwanted rumors and insults but instead, all we got was love. But once we broke up one month ago, everyone ran after Emory because he was more liked, more popular than me. Even my own so-called best friend, GSU left me to become Emory’s new best friend, I was all alone and all I had been doing for the last month was putting all my attention into academics. Junior year is not easy and I was grabbing it by its horns.

“Come by and fetch your belongings from my dorm room” he messaged me and I groaned in agony. I had been avoiding his dorm hall from since we were broken up and now I had to go back after this meeting. I looked around for Georgia Tech and found him and man, was he so cute. Tall with brown hair and hazel eyes, he was the cutest guy ever next to Emory. My gay-dar wasn’t picking up a lot and I didn’t know what to make up by him. “Hey, Georgia Tech right?? I asked and he looked at me and I was taken.",1608992025,1,0

Track Your Homework Using My iOS App,"Hey there, I am the owner of B4Grad, a mobile app I started developing while I was doing my undergrad.

[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/b4grad-your-student-agenda/id1352751059?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/b4grad-your-student-agenda/id1352751059?mt=8)

B4Grad has since grown and we got a major boost by the pandemic that the world has been facing.

We are looking for students to test the product as we launch several new features this upcoming semester including our note editor. You can send us the feedback via email or write a review on the App Store. That’s it. 

And in exchange, we’ll give you the premium version of the app for free. It’s that simple. Just email us on the App Store page or you could message me here on reddit. An exclusive for /r/GATech. :)

So a little more background here- I actually built B4Grad with the intention of making school simple to organize. I always felt like every professor in my program had a different style of doing things, and I thought an agenda wasn’t good enough of a tool.

I hope that B4Grad can serve as a good solution to that problem for some of you. Let me know if it has. I greatly appreciate it.

Thank you 🙏

CS or Med - Student going crazy please help,"I am a freshman at Tech who is literally going crazy to the point of depression debating between CS and Medicine for what I do for thee rest of my life. I just want to be happy and have a work life balance, live in a nice house with a base of 200k or more, have interesting and not-lonely work, a stable career, and intellectually stimulating but not too stressful work. 

**For those of you who are CS majors, I would really appreciate insight on some or all the following questions:** 

1) I know the starting salary is around 90 to 100k, but by the time you are 29 or 30, how likely is it that I could make a base of 200k or more without living in a really big city with a high cost of living? 

2) Is your work sitting at your desk alone coding 24/7, or is it intellectually stimulating with a good amount of healthy teamwork? 

3) Do you feel like you know what you are doing most of the time? Or confused? Because I am having imposter syndrome, I feel like everyone else knows more than me. **I am scared I won't be able to successfully navigate the corporate world....did this come naturally to you once you started working?** 

4) If I don't feel super passionate about CS at this point, will I get depressed in this field? 

5) To get promotions and advance your career, **do you have to be super savvy to not get stuck as a 100k coder? Or as a Tech grad would advancing likely come naturally to me?** 

6) Do you ever regret your choice or wish you were somewhere else? 

7) Is ageism a concern? Or could I do interesting work even in my 60s if I wanted to? 

&amp;#x200B;

To pre-meds:

1) If I choose to switch to a pre-med track now, is it doable to get into med school from Tech? Or is it more likely than not that I will not get in? I am willing to work hard but I also want a goof amount of fun/free time in college. 

2) **Any GT alumns out there who got into med school? Do you regret your choice?**

Question regarding transferring from GSU to Tech,"So, I've been at GSU perimeter college for the past year and a half as a CS Major with the end goal to transfer to tech. I know the requirements needed for CS transfer and I have them all done except for Physics 2 and the lab, which I'm taking this upcoming semester. My question is, can I apply to transfer during this semester, or do I have to wait to officially complete physics 2 and the lab? 

Also out of curiosity, what would my chances be of getting accepted? I know admissions is whole lotta luck, but currently, my overall GPA at GSU is 3.93, it was 4.0 but physics 1 kind of kicked my ass and I got my first B. I've gotten As in all my math classes so far, calc 1 and calc 2 are done, and I also planned on taking linear algebra next semester just to have more rigorous classes on my transcript. After next semester, I'll have 60 credits, would that be an ideal amount of credits?

I know Tech is very competitive, so I've already research other universities to attend in case Tech doesn't work out.
