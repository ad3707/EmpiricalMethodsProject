You can take CLEPs whenever you want. You can take a CLEP for classes you already got credit for as well (if you just wanna collect all the CLEP scores) 

The grade for CLEP, DSST, EM, and Departmental Tests is “EM” on your transcript. This won’t factor into your gpa at all. I’m not an advisor but I think it would work something like this:

Say you fail MATH 1131 and are trying to get into the college of business. You’ve got two options for testing: take the Calculus EM test, or take the Calculus CLEP test. If you were to pass either of them, it would show that you have received credit for MATH 1151.

I started as a freshman at OSU in 2012. I didn’t even bother applying to UofI. A major reason for that was because in-state tuition at UofI was actually more expensive than my out of state tuition at OSU. Seriously. 

Illinois is ridiculous. Chicago is a great city sure and I miss it sometimes and am still a Chicago sports fan but there’s a reason I moved out almost a decade ago and still live and work here in Columbus and literally my entire extended family except my parents and sister have moved out of Illinois over the last decade. My parents are retiring in the next few years and they aren’t discussing whether or not they’re also going to move out but rather where to. 

IL pension crisis just keeps getting kicked down the road. Not too long ago they were on the brink of shutting down state universities like Northern/Southern/Eastern Illinois and that got staved off last minute AFAIK. The Chicago “political machine” is real. It’s a national joke but people who live there know it’s 100% a serious and real thing. Blagojevich, the former Governor who’s been in the news recently for having his sentence commuted by Trump, went to prison for literally trying to sell the appointment to Obama’s old senate seat. The kicker? The current IL Governor Pritzker is literally the guy who was on the other end of that call from the FBI tapes that took him down (to his credit Pritzker turned him down but it’s possible he just couldn’t believe Rod was a big enough idiot to discuss something like that over the phone).

"&gt;I’ve always wanted to learn how to cook properly not just follow recipes.

From a somewhat seasoned home cook, I'd say you should start off with recipes. Then, you redo recipes without looking at it and make a minor variation (switch up an ingredient, cook something for different time, etc) to see how it tastes. You'll slowly learn how cooking works and why you do/don't each kind of procedure, the taste and texture that each ingredient brings, etc.",1583329447,1,0

"[Picture of my scores for reference](https://imgur.com/a/ZHnBuX4) 


So most of my tests I was hitting around 50’s on with literally no studying. I would just show up to the testing center and take the test. Looking back I realize I was an absolute idiot because with just a touch more effort, I could’ve been out of another 3-12 credit hours easily. 

The college math test was the easiest test I’ve ever taken in my life. You are given a calculator and asked simple questions, which you can literally punch into the calculator. 

Bio was easy, analyzing lit was easy, macro and management were easy. 

Business law, human growth and development, and psych were all very tough tests. I should’ve studied. Even then I doubt I would’ve passed. I just don’t know those topics. 

Both western civs, American gov, and American lit were all rough tests. However, if I would’ve studied, I probably would’ve passed most of those. I don’t know a lot about those subjects, but the CLEP test is a very broad overview.

"I’d say CLEP Biology was fairly easy (but long). Counts for 1101 with lab. Took a bio for non bio majors class two years ago that didn’t transfer in. Never took a lab, this test awards on credit. 

Macroeconomics was an easy CLEP as well. I took a microeconomics class two years ago. From what little knowledge I retained I was able to test out of macro here. (ECON 2002.01)

Analyzing and Interpreting Literature was a very easy CLEP test. I had no preparation for it and I was able to test out of my GE Literature. COMPSTD 2101

The information technology test gave me 3 credit hours of gen ed accounting, I’ll take what I can get. Test was basically “summarize what the Microsoft office suite does and explain how computers work to your great grandma”

Also got three credit hours for BUSMHR, I think from the management test. Again, fairly easy. 

I have the official study guides for nearly all the CLEP tests. Basically they are just a practice test that covers exam material. I’d say the practice ones are a little harder than the real exam. I’ve taken 22 of the 33 CLEP tests. 

I studied for marketing, business law, and college math/algebra/pre calc. I failed law, passed marketing (but not high enough for OSU’s liking), and all my math credit transferred in to OSU, so I didn’t even need to take the math tests.

I left behind my fam, my childhood friends, and even my girlfriend at the time (we’d said we try to make LDR work, but we were young and dumb and u know how it goes). I remember the cold snowy nights that I wasn’t prepared for. I remember the homesickness and feeling like a stranger around everyone. I remember the stress and the sleep deprivation and the lonely 2am walks back home from SEL and the constant feeling of being in over my head.

But I didn’t give in. My family and I had sacrificed so much for this opportunity, and I promised myself that it wouldn’t be for nothing. So I kept at it. I found classmates that I could connect with, slowly over time. I still did just okay-ish in my science classes, but I found a passion in applying what I learned in the student engineering clubs. I joined Greek life, found a second family, and made unforgettable memories with them on dumb adventures all over the East Coast. I nabbed internships and became more confident in myself. And when I finally graduated, I was the first son in a family of first generation immigrants to do so. 

Hang in there, my dude. Take it one day at a time, and don’t give up. I think someday when you look back on all this, you’ll remember some of the bad memories graced with some of the best moments of your life, and you’ll be amazed at how far you’ve come.",1582268236,1,0

"It’s the whole idea that every field of study should have an adequate representation of types of people “at the table”. So in an extremely important field like engineering which is a huge part of our future, it’s good to have many women in it so that their point of views and concerns are taken into consideration and advocated for. Systems contribute to the patriarchy. It’s what it is. Women see issues that pertain only to women, men normally will overlook them because it doesn’t effect them/they do not experience the issue. So if no women are present to speak for women as a whole, patriarchy runs rampant. 

I understand what you are saying though, I would love to get to a point where a woman in engineering is just totally normal. However women have to be in it enough for that to be normal 😊",1582255819,1,0

"I really like what you said. Part of Perry’s argument/data he stated was that women have received more Doctorate degrees lately. But he was arguing about the STEM field, yet his statistic was about all majors in general, not specifying engineering. Even in engineering student organizations like Society of Women Engineers (SWE), all genders are welcomed and can apply to the scholarships. People tend to judge it too quickly based on the name of the org.

I also found some data online that “In the US, about 18-20% of engineering students are women”. It’s not like women in engineering are even close to the number that men pull. I personally think if he wants to complain about certain groups/summer camps, then he should come up with a better argument. These camps are there to try to pull more women into engineering since the number for women is a lot lower than men. Engineering is male-dominated, and it should be equal. The camps are trying to make the field more equal! think by having a summer camp or two for women, won’t hurt the industry or the school but will help it. 

I even went to a school my freshman year where the ratio of men to women in my electrical engineering grade was 17:1, trying to get more women in this industry is a plus to me. 

As for scholarships, whoever donated the money typically gets to choose the scholarship winner by their own accord. If it is the university specifically choosing women over men, than that is a problem.",1582236036,2,0

"Personally as a woman in the engineering program, I find the ""promoting women/minority in STEM"" thing to be condescending, misguided at best. 

While I love the idea of encouraging the younger generation to have a curiousity in science/engineering, what is the point of ""achieving equal representation"" in these male-dominated fields? Like actually what does this do? I don't care how many other females are in my engineering program or in my work place, literally makes 0% difference in what I want to learn. 

How does pushing women in STEM programs ""defeat"" the argument about pay inequality? The truth is women DO prefer low-paying professions like teaching and social work. And there shouldn't be anything wrong with that if that's what most women find satisfaction doing. Just tbh I'm tired of being preached about how more females / minorities need to be in STEM when the reality is, STEM is open to anyone and everyone who has the curiousity for it. I don't understand why extra programs or extra money needs to be put into programs only for specific people that fit a certain race or gender. 

Sorry for the rant, I guess I'm just tired of being called a woman in engineering rather than, you know, an engineer.",1582235724,2,0
"I agree with this statement. As someone who's seen the disparities that have resulted in death in some cases of women not being in engineering (i.e. so many safety things are made based on the average male: [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/23/truth-world-built-for-men-car-crashes](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/23/truth-world-built-for-men-car-crashes)), I definitely think there should be programs for women. Legally, men can't be excluded of course, but getting rid of these programs is detrimental to a lot of different aspects in our lives. Also, there are definitely spaces for men in other majors that have less men (I know people who worked in the nursing diversity office and they worked a lot with increasing their male numbers here). They just may not be as established as these programs are.

I really wish this guy looked into the COE diversity numbers to see why these programs exist (found here: [https://engineering.osu.edu/about/report](https://engineering.osu.edu/about/report)). For example, women made up 16.2% of the CSE major last year, which is horribly low. He clearly halfway did his research before raising all of these complaints.

I would also like to add that I still don't even think all women support women half the time in engineering, so a lot could be done about that as well. That attitude comes from not being many women, so they go into an attitude where they want to ensure they're the one woman succeeding.",1582235424,2,0

"I got deferred to Marion (1 hr drive one-way), and chose to go to another college and live in a dorm (really a suite).

Cons of a regional campus:
Living in a dorm can help socially, but if you’re socially healthy, it isn’t worth the $ imo. Your courses are just as big of a factor in development of mental health. If you really wanted to, there are probably apartments near Newark that would give you more independence. 

Newark can put you behind on ARCH 1100, 2300, and 2310. 

Pros:
You’d save money in Newark, and you may be able to catch up with summer courses, and more money. Plus, I wouldn’t rush to graduate in our job market.

It’s a good idea to take STEM courses at regional campuses. The STEM majors I’ve talked to at Marion all agree it’s worth it, even with an hr drive there. Looks like you’d have to take Math 1148 and Physics 1200. Be sure they offer these courses at Newark though.",1589764647,1,0

What are you studying? Let's say if you want to go into business, you'd definitely want to take the Fisher route vs Kent state's business college... the number of opportunities coming into college and coming out of college will definitely be worth it to suck it up and commute to Newark since you're practically guaranteed admission to main and will be provided what Fisher has to offer. If you want to get into let's say nursing, OSU's nursing school is very competitive to get into but is a great program, but from what I hear Kent's nursing program isn't too shabby. 

But also if you want the ""freshman experience,"" and want to get out of the house, you could do your first year at Kent and transfer to OSU your second year. I actually have quite a few sophomore friends who are transfers out of Kent. I'm assuming it'd be harder to get in vs. Newark, but if you keep a good GPA it won't be hard to transfer. This would probably be ideal, but there's always a chance you might really like the people you meet at Kent and not want to transfer out or you might be too lazy to do the application process again, if that makes sense.",1589760827,4,0
"Moving out does really helps you grow. I did not particularly enjoy dorm life and it was a bit hard for me because I came from abroad and felt really lost and did not have much in common with Americans (rural/suburban folk in particular since I come from a big city, but you learn to adapt).  

The mental health part depends on what your issues are, sometimes moving out help, sometimes only time can help, sometimes therapy is necessary.

But I cannot deny that it is an important experience. I like living off campus (in my own place) a lot better, so if you can petition to not live in dorms if your family is near by and just rent out a place I personally recommend it (it is also cheaper than dorm + meal plan). 

  
Also, keep in mind that dorms might not reopen (as you mentioned). But nobody really knows what is going to happen yet. Even if classes are online you could rent a room and live with other students.

Most cops wouldn’t bother you and you would be able to check out all of the cool hidden areas and what’s left of the juvenile detention center. If you even go further north long the river there is a small peninsula which is called The Point( it’s on google maps FYI). The area is a great place in my opinion for scenery and photography. Just don’t fly your drone over the zoo as it’s prohibited since they use their own drones. (https://www.columbuszoo.org/home/about/media-tools),1589752528,1,0

There are definitely those who won’t care or won’t notice if you do attend, and you might hear some instructors giving you this same advice — to attend class until you’re off the waitlist — but they’re being both unethical (for asking you to come to class despite there being no assurances you’ll get a spot off the waitlist and for not respecting your time with regards to your other classes and responsibilities) and violating safety procedures.

"hey! first of all, hello fellow cosplayer, I appreciate your interests.
I know you said in here that you don't want to live in the towers, but I lived in em last year, so I just wanted to throw my two cents in on them. first of all, the distance REALLY isn't as bad as people make you think it is (fire drills are the real evil). But more importantly, if you get a double in the towers, you have way more space than if youd have a double anywhere else. You get two closets (cosplay storage!), two desks, and the study room and bedroom have a door between them, so if you're up until ungodly hours working on stuff, you don't have to worry about disrupting your roomie. So yeah. Normally the towers don't fill up fast because everyone (unjustifiably!) hates them, so if whatever other plans you come up with don't work out, there's a decent backup plan for ya at least.

definitely request a room change to a single regardless though. it's always worth a shot. Good luck!!",1583295761,2,0

"# Quick Shameless Plug:

While I am not a recruiter, I strongly support military involvement. Ohio has a lot of great programs for part time Airmen/Soldiers. The Ohio National Guard Scholarship program pays for full tuition at an unlimited amount of state schools, for an unlimited amount of credit hours, limited to eight total semesters. This is the only reason I was able to attend college. 

[Air National Guard (The one you want to join)](https://www.goang.com/)

[Army National Guard (I mean if you really wanted to, it's there)](https://www.nationalguard.com/)

**But HiPigdom, I got disqualified from service.** 

There's no need to fear! Ohio Military Reserves is here!

[Ohio Military Reserve FAQ](http://www.ohiomilitaryreserve.com/FAQ)

The Ohio Military Reserve is Ohio's (And Ohio's only) militia. They do not carry weapons, they support the national guard during disaster relief missions across the state. You might be asking yourself:

*What kind of disasters happen in Ohio?*

Exactly. Next to none. 

This is a volunteer, unpaid, militia. Basic training is right here in Columbus Ohio. You do not go on overseas deployments, or leave the state for that matter. I will admit, I know nothing more about this organization other than what their website offers. With that said, it appears as though benefits are limited. It looks like you pay for your own uniform, and your only compensation for your one weekend a month of drill time is the fact that you get a military ID. 

So why do it? 

A military ID is all you need in order to get the Ohio State testing facility usage fee waived.

&amp;#x200B;

While I am not in the OHMR, I will say that I have probably saved close to $3,000 from the testing center alone thanks to my ID. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, when I was approved it showed up in my buckeyelink as pending. That was like Tuesday.

If you go to Account Inquiry you should be able to see it listed as a refund in the activity list. That happens and then it sits there for a few days until the day they bulk process them. If you see it in the Account Inquiry page, expect it any day now. Which for me and all my financial aid is almost always Wednesday. It usually lists as refund on the activity page on Monday-ish and then deposits to my account Wednesday. I don't know if everybody is different but my emergency grant money followed the same pattern as financial aid.

"Very interesting. There is something to be said about the lack of tests regarding the confirmed cases number, however that does not really impact the number of deaths that you bring up. Personally I think that opening back up soon or making decisions now on what to do 3+ months from now would be shortsighted precisely because we do not know about many factors of this virus. Yes, it might not be as deadly, but it might also spread much quicker than we thought previously too.

Look at prison populations: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/01/a-state-by-state-look-at-coronavirus-in-prisons

If we look at the states that are testing prisoners in mass, we see that the per capital rate is in the thousands per 100,000 (Ohio is the highest with 7,977 per 100,000). If anything, these numbers might be a more accurate that the statewide numbers because of more testing. Additionally, while not high, the deaths are beginning to exponentially increase in prison populations. So even if the virus has a lower mortality rate than previously thought, if we open up too fast and it spreads everywhere we still overload the hospital systems with Corona cases.

Additionally, we have no evidence that people who contract the virus once and have antibodies are actually immune from contracting it again: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/who-issues-warning-on-coronavirus-testing-theres-no-evidence-antibody-tests-show-immunity.html

So with all this in mind deciding to open things like colleges in the fall now in May when we don't have a good clue of how this virus really operates would be a mistake.",1588695367,1,0

" [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) 

While comparing states, comparing the pure numbers of states isn't the best reflection of impact because each state has a different population. The best comparison is per capita. If you scroll down on the link to cases and deaths by state and county. Florida (one of the last states to shutdown) has 172 cases per 100,000 and 7 deaths per 100,000. Ohio (one of the earliest states to shutdown) has 175 cases per 100,000 and 9 deaths per 100,000.

Each state case is different and I'm not trying to say that Florida is in the best possible shape, but Florida is looking pretty good when you think about all of the tourism through at least the middle of March. Beaches were packed for spring break and theme parks like Disney World were packed up until the dates that they shutdown.

Here is the unmitigated projection from the Ohio Department of Health.

Oh believe me I know. I've tutored calc for half my time at OSU. If I had a penny for everytime someone in calc II did (a+b)^2=a^2+b^2 , I'd be a billionaire. And the same problems exist for people who took the placement test and even took the algebra course at OSU.

&gt;As OSUs calculus courses do not permit calculators, it is imperative students can do the precalc concepts. The placement test (D test) focuses on just these precalc skills. A lot of students will complain that the material was ""way back in precalc so they forgot"", but that excuse is crap as the precalc skills are crucial in calculus.

It's imperative regardless of calculators. That's why it's called pre-calc. 

The problem I have with placement test is that it's multiple choice and that doesn't really gauge math ability cause people just guess on it. The placement test also allows calculators.

The problem in general is that American schools have reduced their math expectations, practically made math optional and inflated grades. There's also the schools that teach to the test and make students overly dependent on calculators. You don't have the same problems in schools in Europe and even a lot of Asia where math is treated as an essential class and they don't soften expectations to protect people's feelings.

"I was taking my final semester entirely online before the pandemic hit, took my entire sophomore year online due to an intensive surgery, and took many other online classes in between. Many students are understandably frustrated with their online experience because the delivery of their classes changed abruptly and no one was prepared, which created a mess. But in my opinion, online classes are great when they’re designed to be that way in the first place. You generally need to be very organized and self-motivated to succeed, but they provide so much flexibility that you can’t get from in-person courses. For example, I had a desk job at OSU, and was able to work 28 hours per week, didn’t have to schedule my hours around lectures, essentially got paid to do homework, and rarely had to think about school while I was off the clock. I‘d recommend only taking a couple online courses your freshman year if you have a choice to get the in-person experience, as online learning will require a lot of self-discipline that might be difficult while juggling your freshman year. However, I wouldn’t worry about fall semester. If it comes down to that, all freshman will be in the same position as you, and I’m sure OSU will have resources in place to get you guys through it. I’ve heard that they’ve already been telling professors to plan for fall potentially being online, so the online experience will have months of preparation and should be a lot smoother than this semester was.

"A little late to the party here but the nurses who work at the OSU hospital have a very bad reputation among university leadership. Not necessarily because of their job performance, but because they're rude, needy/demanding (and I'm not talking about basic health and safety needs), and self-important. They think that everyone at OSU should bend over backwards for them because they're ""saving lives"" yet you'll find nurses regularly smoking in stairwells in parking garages.

This is just one example, but a nurse literally walked into a university department and told a customer service person that they would not treat them if they had cancer. 

What would normally be something that isn't a big deal to the rest of the university community has to be treated very delicately with nurses because of how they blow so many things out of proportion that they perceive to be even the tiniest inconvenience or slight to them.",1589211879,1,0

"I’m going to get downvoted to hell for this, BUT...

If you think OSU’s application and acceptance process, much less its campus culture and student resources, aren’t influenced by or a product of racial discrimination... you are willfully ignorant.

Columbus is and has been, since its founding, a racially segregated city. We’re literally ranked the second highest city in the nation for economic segregation. OSU hasn’t been immune to that. University application processes systemically disadvantage black people (especially poor black people), and OSU doesn’t do anything special to stand out on that front. OSU doesn’t provide any real institutional assistance (not talking money) to first generation college students, of which many are people of color. 

OSU had racially segregated dorms and an official “separate but equal” policy until the late 1940s. Hell, in 1991 Gordon Gee banned *all* black student events from the student union because someone who didn’t even go to OSU shot another person at an event.

I’ve faced discrimination using the roommate finder when I use my full non American name. I was getting very low response rate and when I did it fell out.
I confirmed my theory it using my full name and I used an abbreviation that’s a popular nick name (for example: if I was Asian and my name was Chen, I’d use Chandler or something)

When I use the abbreviation, the same people who either ignored my initial message responded. I tried it on over 20 students.

I’ve been class rooms where I heard white students complain about being partners with international students because of their accents.

I’ve heard many stories from friends and other students.

As for OSU as a facility? I’ve had microagressive comments and treatment from a certain staff member. She assumed something and tried to tell me to go to a cc and leave osu until she saw my gpa and accolades. I called her out and she changed her mind and apologized.

I don’t need to explain to you what institutional racism is and this history behind racism in public schools (k-12 and higher education) you can google that yourself.

"Yes! Prejudice is an unconscious bias against a group of people. Discrimination are actions based on prejudice (treating certain people differently because of their group membership). Prejudice and discrimination are carried out by individuals. Racism, on the other hand, is systemic. Everyone in the majority group (white people) participates in it and perpetuates white norms. A lot of the time white people don't mean to do this. It's just that white people are advantaged by systems of racism and often don't even realize that they are perpetuating racism. Their privilege allows them to not have to think about racism. People of color, on the other hand, are very aware of how society treats them as ""others"" because that is their lived experience every day. 

For anyone interested in learning more about the differences between prejudice, discrimination, and racism, check out the book White Fragility by Robin DiAngelo. It's super enlightening and clarifies a lot of things.",1581196155,2,0

"To be fair, USG is a great introduction to the inner workings of government and politics. For example, they spent $5k on a personal, catered retreat using student funds, so they could get to know one another before planning challenging events like passing out pocket constitutions and buying $7,800 worth of cups. USG really teaches you how to mismanage public dollars like a true politician from the getgo.

Jokes aside, I’m appalled. Spending $150 on wall plaques to pat themselves on the back? A $1,370 subscription to an email service? Paying $1,000 to bus members around? 

$86,000 worth of these types of charges is just insane. I haven’t even heard of half of their events. What a waste.",1581195895,63,0
"This is a good point, but I just have one clarification. When the term Predominantly White Institution is used, it's referring not to the fact that the university is composed of mostly white students. Instead it refers to the fact that the university advantages white students and puts students of color at a disadvantage.  For instance, if you are a white person, who are more likely to have attended a well-funded school throughout K-12 and to have received a decent education. You would have been more likely to be academically prepared for a school such as OSU, would have been more likely to be admitted, and once you got to the school would have been considered the ""norm"" (as far as your upbringing, culture, heritage goes). Flip all that around for people of color. If you happened to be born in a lower-SES school district, then the schools you attended would have been underresourced and you would not have been able to receive as good as a K-12 education, which would have made you less likely to be admitted to a school such as OSU. Once you get to OSU, you're still seen as the ""other"" -- the minority. This is why students of color find community with each other -- because they are more likely to have a shared history and lived experiences. They are the victims of systems of oppression (racism, classism, etc.). This shouldn't be generalized to say that all white people are rich and well educated and all people of color are poor and uneducated. Not the case at all. But systemically in this country, this is the reality. Long-winded reply (sorry), but just wanted to point out that in general, the term ""majority"" doesn't refer to the actual numbers--just the power dynamics. So if in the future at OSU, even if white people are no longer the majority in terms of numbers, white people will still be advantaged because of our country's history, and this is systemic racism. Hopefully educators can consistently work to disrupt societal norms and disrupt racism, but it has a deeep history and will take a looong time to correct.",1581195779,3,0

As an organization that is allotted thousands of dollars ([budget examples](https://usg.osu.edu/finances/quarterly_budgets)), USG not only is a waste of campus resources but also seeks no input from students or faculty members as to how that money should be spent. I can think of other orgs (most notably OUAB) that would be much better suited to be in charge of the money that USG gets, and would do a better job of actually being subject to oversight from the student body at large.

I should also mention that any organization that claims to represent the students at OSU while also claiming that OSU is an ""inherently racist institution"" ([USG's Tweet](https://twitter.com/usgosu/status/1225646102986162176?s=20)), should not be an organization that is given any power whatsoever.

I am in no way making excuses, as you should not feel uncomfortable in your living situation and this needs to be addressed. But perhaps your hall director could offer some helpful context that may put you at ease. I've worked with a number of housekeeping/maintenance staff who don't always understand social ques. They get treated poorly a lot, so sometimes when they meet a student who is nice and wiling to listen, they often linger and don't take a hint that they need to move on. Hopefully your hall director can get this addressed, and also let you know if there is any additional context around this individual that may provide some insight. Or maybe they are a total creep - either way, I think this is the quickest way to getting it addressed. They will likely follow-up with a maintenance supervisor to investigate, and potentially move this individual if warranted (they're unionized, so let's be real, it is hard for them to get fired).

Good for you for taking the step to speak with your RA.

I also def waste a ton of time. But taking most of the weekend off is super nice, I'd recommend",1580074888,1,0

I don't think you have to submit &lt;something&gt;.out. This whole process is just to make sure your program works,1580070607,1,0

"Sounds like it's C++? And you're asked to use g++ to compile?  
  
If I'm correct, then you'll want to do ""g++ -c &lt;your_file_name.cpp&gt; ""  
  
If you get no errors, then your program compiles. Next, you'll have a new file called ""&lt;something&gt;.out""  
  
To run your compiled program, do ""./&lt;something&gt;.out""",1580070107,3,0

"No. Report that immediately. In the meantime, do not stay in the room when he is there. Tell him you'll wait in the hall. Call someone, even if it's your RA, dad, friend, classmate, and stay on the phone with them until he leaves. Pretend to be on the phone if you have to.

I'd also keep something on my person that could at least disable or distract him long enough for you to get away. I'm not saying to get a gun or break the rules, but something that would be sufficiently *off-putting* should this person decide to forget themselves. 

Highlight specifically that you feel unsafe when you put in the report. Follow up on that last part. That's stalking and fabricating work orders.

"I always started with the material Marc goes over in class. I made sure I mastered that, then moved on to the recitation stuff.

"1) rewatch lecture videos for concepts you aren’t comfortable with

"Theres been a lot thats gone down since school started in Fall, but most recently it was a struggle to get him to leave my room. He knocked on my door like he does most of the time when hes in the building, and started talking about something to do with plumbing. In the middle of talking he was like ""actually let me check...."" and just kinda came in my room to check something, again like he had multiple times before and I didnt think to tell him no because hes maintenance lol. Well this most recent time I was getting ready to leave campus to go home, and I told him that multiple times and he just kept talking. My dad called to let me know he was outside, and maintenace looked annoyed as fuck that I took the call and just kind of glared. It was another 10 minutes of him complaining about his coworkers and stuff he had to do in another dorm before I was like, okay I really have to go &amp; I put my shoes on and grabbed my stuff to go home. He didnt get the picture until my dad called again and I was like ""yeah be down in a second."" This whole time he was blocking my access to the door.
I'm sorry this is so long 😂 Or sounds like I'm overreacting but this was kinda just the last straw in a series of events. When I got back from winter break he told me that he knew I wasnt home because he had been in my room twice to check the sink, I guess because my neighbor was having sink problems and they're connected. I thought it was odd because the stuff I had in my sink wasnt moved, but I brushed it off. Come to find out, there was no work order put in for my neighbor that involved her sink.",1580059179,2,0

"&gt;I can promise you that it took a lot more than a firm handshake.

Fair enough. I was basically mocking the ""firm handshake"" crowd.

&gt;That said, in the long run the GPA is not that important. It matters for job #1. It doesn't matter for jobs 2 through n.

I agree. But if you do want to work for someone like NASA at entry-level (as the image says), your GPA does matter. Federal STEM jobs are very competitive, and getting a low GPA will ensure you don't even get an interview.",1580051952,1,0
