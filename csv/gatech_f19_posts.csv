Career Fairs,"Anyone else starting to feel helpless?

&amp;#x200B;

Went to resume workshops, career fair preps, and mock interviews at C2D2 and through my majors professional organization. 

Went to 3 days of career fair (All-Majors and IISE) and talked to over 40 companies in about 9 hours total. 

&amp;#x200B;

Felt I had some strong conversations and even sent thank-you letters.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't gotten any interviews yet while I see people with tons of interviews at C2D2 already. I spent a significant time preparing for this coupled with tons of homework, orgs, studying, midterms, etc.

How many W's is too many? Advice needed,"For some context, I had a medical problem that required surgery at the begging of the semester. I feel all better now but I'm currently failing so many courses due to the circumstances that I think I need to take a W in my math course to allow myself more room to try and dig myself out of all the other holes I'm currently in. Math builds on itself so much I'm not sure I have the time to try and get caught up. The W would also drop me to below full-time hours. 

This would be my third W though as I took 2 at a previous school. One was 1st year spring for a semester with 17 credits with 2 Lab Science courses during which my pet dog got cancer and died. I dropped an unneeded for my major Bio class. The other was 2nd year spring I dropped Multi because while I was doing fine it was an hour and in traffic hour and a half commute one way and I also had Chem, Phys 2, and Linear last Spring. I made an A on Multi on the retake. 

Am I screwing myself for job applications or grad school applications (MBA or Law) later down the line even with a 4 or hopefully still close to 4 G.P.A. ? Only this W I'm contemplating would show up on my GT transcript as the other 2 were at another school. Thanks for any advice?",1568316589,4,0

Looking for a photographer willing to take a cosplay photoshoot,"Hiyo! I enjoy cosplaying a lot and plan to see myself competing in many competitions and conventions in the area. I'm a freshman CompE major. Most of my cosplay revolves around armor and weapons, as well as other props. However, I didn't have much room in my car to bring much cosplay, so now I'm excited to build a whole new collection here at GA Tech.

The year-long project I'm currently working on is Bondrewd, the Lord of Dawn from the popular anime and manga, Made in Abyss. It's even my first time using 3D printers instead of Pepakura, which is like a kind of origami printing thing. I've even been printing 2 12 hour prints each weekday between the Invention Studio and the HIVE, mainly in preparation for the upcoming Anime Weekend Atlanta. 

However, I've run into quite a problem. I suck at taking photos, and I don't own any fancy cameras. I would like to run several photoshoots throughout the year to detail the progress I make in the cosplay (cuz it's going to evolve). I might even be able to pay (depends on the circumstances). So yeah, looking for a photographer.

Sahaj Patel BSAE 2020, Accion Systems ( [https://www.matthewisakowitzfellowship.org/sahaj-patel](https://www.matthewisakowitzfellowship.org/sahaj-patel) )

The application is quite extensive but if you or anyone you know meets the following requirements please send the application form their way! The MIFP is major agnostic so even if you are not AE please consider applying! If you have any questions feel free to comment before and I'll do my best to answer them or pass them along to the rest of the fellows! Also, be sure to [attend our info session next week in Guggenheim 442](https://ae.gatech.edu/event/info-session-brooke-owens-and-matthew-isakowitz-fellowship) where last year's fellows will go over the program in more detail and give advice on how to put together a stellar application!

Requirements:

* At the time of application, is a **college junior, college senior, or graduate student** who intends to pursue a **full-time career in the commercial spaceflight industry**. 
   * *Commercial space* is broadly defined as activities in entrepreneurship, intrapreneurship, and innovation that will enable new or dramatically improved products or services that do not depend solely on government cost-plus contracting to prove viable. In its most aspiring terms, commercial space promises to alter the space industry through new business models that will open up the space frontier.
* Has earned an **engineering or science degree**, or is working towards one at the time the Fellowship begins. 
* Has a diversity in experience and academic interests such as in engineering, science, management, business, and other related fields that can be related to commercial space.

"Tired, unmotivated, and in need of advice","Hi, I'm a first year HTS student. Aside from that, I've had an ongoing issue of being unmotivated and finding or doing schoolwork or studying pointless. I can even remember doing this in elementary school with the easiest of projects, and procrastinating on a small 3 sentence summary on a book chapter until the day it was due. I just didn't see why I should care other than needing to get good grades to eventually make good money. I am relatively smart. When I study, I usually understand things pretty easily. But, for years I have only really joined harder programs and courses or pushed myself to be academically ""successful"" or try to be the top percent in anything I do because I feel that if I don't I'm a failure. I don't know what I want to do and feel lost. I feel like if I don't find a career I want to go towards soon, I will have no opportunity to feel motivated based off of enjoying my future. I'm afraid that I will continue to live like this, working hard to be the best or trying to survive vs doing it because I like it. I have learned to be a Jack of all trades, but lover of none. Even when I do find something I might enjoy, I think to myself ""can I actually make money off of this? Will I be struggling financially like my parents and the people around me forever?"" I can most definitely blame this stupid school system in the US and that's likely found globally, but I think it's best to conform for now as I always have. I just want to know for sure that I'll have stability, but that desire for stability and success is being driven without an actual road to drive on. I've been free falling off a cliff with no bottom I feel like for years now. No, I'm not suicidal. I'm stuck in that annoying ""I don't want to be here in this state anymore, but I don't want to die either"". I just want to be a better me at least if I can't find a better setting. I should just go see my therapist again. I feel like I'll soon relapse into that state of utter uck. I just want a sense of direction and motivation. What should I do?

TLDR What can I do to stop being a lazy mofo and achieve a sense of direction and motivation to do my work and figure out what to do with my life?

Come Shoot with the Marksmanship Club!,"Hello Everyone!

We will be holding a pistol fundamentals workshop on **Saturday, September 28th. We will be meeting at the Student Center Parking Lot at 11:30 AM. We will be leaving the parking lot promptly at 12:00 PM.** It is a ~40 minute trip from Georgia Tech to our shooting range, and we typically shoot for 2-2.5 hours; we will most likely  be back on campus around 4:30 PM.

This workshop will be most useful to people who are novice/beginner pistol shooters or who want to learn/reinforce  the many fundamentals of pistol shooting in a small group, hands-on, range environment. The workshop will focus on fundamentals, with a good amount of dry fire practice before doing live fire with rimfire and centerfire handguns. **In order to make sure all participants receive focused instruction, we will be limiting this this outing to 7 people only.** We will be holding additional instructional outings throughout the semester, if you signed up for this outing but were not selected you will get top priority for the next one.

This class WON'T cover more complex topics such as drawing from holster, fast mag changes, etc. **The end goal of this class is for you to be able to effectively put rounds on target during slow fire, with a decent grouping.**

If you need a centerfire gun, we can loan you a gun to train on (indicate caliber preference in the Google Form, subject to availability).

If you have one, you should bring your own centerfire pistol and magazines (and a rimfire if you would like, please let us know). In any case, we will provide the ammo (common service calibers including: 9mm, .40, and .45). 

 

**If you are interested in attending this workshop, please fill out the following Google Form:**

ME classes on the side as an ID major?,"I'm currently an undergrad studying Industrial Design, but Tech has some of the best engineering programs in the country.

Are there any ME classes that would potentially help me in the future (i.e. in communicating with engineers, design for manufacturing/assembly, a better understanding of technology/innovation, etc.), or would focusing on ID be more beneficial? I'm potentially interested in innovative design along the likes of Dyson, both design and mechanical-tech heavy. Tech does not offer an ME minor; the closest would be AE, Physics, or Robotics. But would taking some classes potentially help me enter a more tech heavy field while job searching?

In memoriam: James Strock,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:

I want to bring you an update to last night’s message. It is with a heavy heart that I share with you that James Strock, a second-year student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, passed away after a swimming accident yesterday.

James, who was originally from Uganda, moved to the United States at age 16. He worked hard to adapt and excelled academically, according to his parents. James was a computer engineering major and an active member of our campus community. He was an avid user of the Campus Recreational Center and attended campus ministry. He completed a co-op program with DataPath in Lawrenceville this past summer.

On behalf of Georgia Tech, we offer our deepest condolences to James’ family and friends during this difficult time. I have been in constant contact with his family and will continue to be there to support them.

This is a tragic loss, and I urge you take advantage of the counseling services that are available on campus. Grief counseling is available through the Counseling Center (counseling.gatech.edu) in the Student Services (Flag) Building from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. throughout the week and after-hours by calling 404-894-2575. Staff and faculty may find support through the Employee Assistance Program at hwb.gatech.edu/eap.

📷

5

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 6 of 12

28. Schultz’s appearance corresponded to the description he provided to the 911 dispatcher – he was a white male with long blonde hair dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans.

29. Each of the officers saw that Schultz was walking slowly. 30. Each of the officers saw that Schultz was alone.  
31. Each of the officers saw that Schultz’ arms were at his side. 32. Officers drew their handguns and pointed them at Schultz. 33. Schultz was barefoot.

34. Schultz was verbally calm.  
35. Schultz did not state any threat to either of the officers.  
36. Schultz did not move his arms in a violent or aggressive manner. 37. One officer shouted at Schultz, “Speak.”  
38. Schultz did not immediately respond.  
39. One officer yelled at Schultz, asking for his name,  
40. Schultz did not immediately respond.  
41. Each of the officers was twenty or more feet in distance from

Schultz’s position. As Schultz moved slowly, officers adjusted their position to keep a safe distance from Schultz.

42. Schultz paused and turned the position of his body so that he was facing several of the officers.

6

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 7 of 12

43. Schultz slowly walked a few steps in the direction of the three officers.

44. One of the three officers told Schultz not to move.

45. At the time that he was told not to move, Schultz’ arms remained at his side.

46. At the time that he was told not to move, Schultz was facing in the direction of the three officers.

47. Each of the officers observed that Schultz was not acting rationally and was not responding rationally to officer commands.

48. Schultz’s actions as of the time that he was told not to move were consistent with a person who is experiencing a mental health crisis and were actions which a reasonably trained law enforcement officer would recognize as such.

49. One or more of the four officers had received training designed to equip police officers with the observational skills to judge when a subject whom they are confronting is undergoing a mental health crisis or is otherwise engaging in behavior reflective of mental illness.

50. The specialized training, Crisis Intervention Techniques, trains an officer in methods to de-escalate a potentially dangerous situation when

7

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 8 of 12

dealing with a person undergoing a mental health crisis or engaging in behavior reflective of mental illness.

51. Officer Beck was not one of those officers.

52. Several of the officers at the scene remained calm and followed standard de-escalation techniques without initiating physical force directed at Scott Schultz.

53. Unlike the other officers, Officer Beck did not de-escalate and instead used physical force.

54. Immediately after Schultz was told not to move by one of his fellow officers, Beck shot Schultz – firing his weapon one time.

55. Beck was the only officer to fire his weapon at Schultz.

56. At the time that Beck fired his weapon, Schultz had taken no physical or verbal action which constituted a threat to the physical safety of Beck or the other officers.

57. At the time that Beck fired his weapon, Schultz had taken no physical or verbal action which constituted a threat to the physical safety of another person.

58. At the time that Beck fired his weapon, according to news reporting at the time, the majority of Georgia Tech’s police officers had not completed the Crisis Intervention training.

8

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 9 of 12

59. The steps taken by Georgia Tech to train its officers in Crisis Intervention Techniques were clearly insufficient to prevent Schultz’s death.

60. The failure to properly train its police officers in Crisis Intervention Techniques was the result of inaction and decisional failures which occurred well in advance of Schultz’ death.

61. The need for such training was well known within the law enforcement community.

62. Studies published years in advance of Schultz’s death estimated that “at least half” of all fatal police encounters involve persons with psychiatric disorders. Kelley Bouchard, “*Across Nation, Unsettling Acceptance When Mentally Ill in Crisis are Killed*,” Portland Press Herald, Dec. 9, 2012.

63. Once he was shot, Schultz did not die immediately.

64. Schultz endured pain and emotional harm in anticipation of his own death.

65. The death certificate declared, correctly, that Schultz’s death was caused by a gunshot wound to his torso.

66. Schultz was pronounced dead just after midnight on the morning of September 17, 2017.

9

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 10 of 12

67. Schultz’s death was the result of Georgia Tech’s and the State of Georgia’s failure over time to properly train their personnel to act in such a way as to prevent the exclusion of persons such as Scott Schultz from the safety to which all students were entitled on the campus of Georgia Tech.

68. As of the preparation of this Complaint, Plaintiffs have, through their counsel, repeatedly sought, without success, to obtain the investiga- tive records of Georgia Tech, of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, of the City of Atlanta, and the Office of the District Attorney of Fulton County, Georgia. The records sought include, but are not limited to, witness statements, photographic and auditory recordings, still photos, ballistics evidence, and physical evidence. None of those records have been produced.

69. As a result of the denial of access to the information contained within those files, Plaintiffs anticipate that an Amendment to this Complaint may be appropriate in the future.

CAUSES OF ACTION  
70. The actions of Tyler Austin Beck violated the constitutional right

of Scott Schultz to be free from unreasonable seizures as established by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Beck’s actions not only caused physical harm to Scott Schultz, they killed him.

10

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 11 of 12

71. The Board Of Regents Of The University System Of Georgia By And On Behalf Of Georgia Institute Of Technology is and has been at all relevant times the recipient of federal financial assistance. Part of that financial assistance has been used to fund the operations, construction and/or maintenance of Georgia Tech.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
For and upon the foregoing, Plaintiffs pray that this Court:

a. Afford them a trial by jury as to all claims and issues for which a jury is available.

b. Award them all damages available to the Estate of Scott Schultz which are permitted by the laws of the State of Georgia and the laws of the United States – damages from each of the Defendants.

d. Award the Plaintiffs such costs and attorneys’ fees as are available by operation of the laws of the State of Georgia and of the United States.

So submitted on this the 11th day of September, 2019.

I was definitely there a year ago, and I've spent 2019 getting deeper into open source, and would love to have a place to share this really awesome aspect of the software world with others! As far as structure goes, we'd probably have some open coding times weekly/biweekly for people to work on their projects, and maybe host a technical talk every month or so covering some aspect of open source software, either from a student or a local professional.

In Memoriam: Vamsi Konjeti,"Dear students, faculty and staff,


It is with great sadness that I write today to inform you of the passing of Vamsi Konjeti. a second-year student in Mechanical Engineering from Brentwood, Tennessee.


I met with Vamsi’s family earlier today to express our deepest condolences on behalf of the entire Tech community. The loss of a classmate and fellow member of our community is difficult for all of us, but especially for the students and faculty that knew Vamsi best. 


Counseling services have been offered to Vamsi’s roommates and close friends. Please remember that Georgia Tech offers multiple services and resources in support of the community, and I urge you to take advantage of the counseling services that are available. Grief counseling and mental health support for students is available through the Center for Assessment, Referral and Education (care.gatech.edu) on the first floor of the Smithgall Student Services (Flag) building from 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. throughout the week and after-hours by calling 404-894-2575. Staff and faculty may find support through the Employee Assistance Program at hwb.gatech.edu/eap. 


If you are in need of immediate assistance, you can also contact the Georgia Crisis &amp; Access Line at 1-800-715-4225 which is staffed with professional counselors 24 hours per day, every day, to assist those with urgent and emergency needs. 


Please take care of yourselves and each other and keep Vamsi's family in your thoughts.

What the hell do I do about PTS?,"I received a hundred dollars in tickets for parking in my assigned parking space, W30 (and was notified of each ticket at the same time). I parked on the top deck. Allegedly that is a ""visitors only"" parking space, though no sign in the vicinity affirms this at all. Additionally, the parking map shows the entire structure as available for my parking with no distinction between top or bottom and no indication of meter pay. Nothing in the documents I signed say that either.

THAT NONSENSE ASIDE: one of the parking tickets given to me alleges I parked in a completely different location, w29, more than a hundred meters from where I actually was. They included helpful photos of my car's position a football field away from where they said it was. Obviously I can't be charged for that, right? It didn't happen.

Wrong, the appealed got denied. Allegedly, by a ""jury of my peers"", heavily implied by PTS to me to be fellow students, but I sincerely doubt one of our own would fuck us over like that. Additionally, PTS told me that if my appeal got denied, I would have the option to plead my case to them in person. I see no such option for appeal online. How do I do this? Did they lie to me? Can I sue them for this lie? I'm super pissed off about dealing with this shit. They tried to charge me three times the price of my already absurdly expensive parking pass when I got it due to their own sheer incompetence. What the hell do I do.",1570226348,54,0

Yo my name ain’t Will but I see all 1100 got this email lmao,"Dear Will,
 
We apologize that an inadvertent mistake like this has negatively impacted you and other students and the broader community at Georgian Tech. We also want to assure you that Georgia Tech takes the security of our students’ information seriously and have convened an emergency response team to implement immediate corrective action and explore additional steps for student impacted by the data disclosure.
 
A staff member in our unit was attempting to send an invitation to approximately 1100 undergraduates to attend a lunch and learn event with one of our corporate partners who provide internships/coops/employment opportunities to our students. The staff member inadvertently/mistakenly attached the data file to the mass email invitation instead of the PDF flyer that provided the actual invitation to the event with date/time/location information.
 
President Cabrera has appointed Professor Raheem Beyah, Vice President of Interdisciplinary Research and expert in cybersecurity, to lead an effort to investigate existing vulnerabilities in data access across the Institute and implement whatever changes are necessary to deal with the most critical of them. Dr. Beyah will coordinate the work of the Office of Information Technology (OIT) and other administrative and academic units and will engage internal and external consultants as needed. He will report directly to the president. 
 
We have communicated information about this incident to affected students, faculty and staff via direct email and Daily Digest updates and we will continue to do so. To view our communications, visit https://news.gatech.edu/2019/11/07/tech-responds-student-data-disclosure .\
 
We will keep you informed about what we learn from our investigation of this incident and inform as to what additional improvements we intend to make to ensure student rights protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) are protected. In addition to notifying those impacted in the disclosure, Georgia Tech immediately reported the matter to the University System of Georgia and U.S. Department of Education. For more information, please visit https://legal.gatech.edu/ferpa .

Tips for Dealing with Long Tests?,"I do... ok in my classes and will score at or slightly above the average on most tests at Tech; in these situations, I usually take almost all the test time. However, every semester I have one or two tests in classes that tank my average due to their length.

 I am slow and methodical with my math, else I oft make mistakes confusing numbers. (For whatever reason, I will confuse 1-7, 3-9-8 a lot and will swap numbers 54 = 45). For example, I had a Simulation test that was long I did not finish. The average was a 70, but I scored a 50 on it! I also notice whenever tests are curved I do worse than when they are not compared to the average. I know it's my last year here and you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but are there any methods to use on my crib sheets or to speed up my mathematical work?

Locked classroom policy?,"Just wondering the rationale of why classrooms and meeting rooms are always locked when not in use, or at least on the weekends and hours outside of normal class times. I'm questioning this because on numerous occasions, I would have liked a nice study space, with normal chairs and tables at a usable height. However, there are not many great places to plop down and do a lot of work by yourself. A lot of would-be perfect places to study at Tech are ""collaborative spaces"" or locked without reservation. 

Living on West, I feel that half the space in willage is inconvenient for studying, whether it's because it's loud, there aren't good tables with the chairs, or because it's just designed to be a common space rather than having dedicated silent study space. The next closest options are Kendeda (which is BEAUTIFUL) or the student center. But once you go inside Kendeda you quickly realize study space is almost non-existent. There's a ton of potential space to be used, but the huge classrooms are locked when not in use, and the tiny student space is filled with fancy chairs and stools. The student center faces the same problems as willage, yet arguably worse.

I fear that, as Georgia Tech constructs new buildings and renovates old ones, they're putting too much of a focus on 'collaborative' spaces and making things appear modern and attractive. I'm hopeful for the new library renewal to provide a large amount of student space. (look at this!  [https://www.bnim.com/project/price-gilbert-and-crosland-tower-library-renewal](https://www.bnim.com/project/price-gilbert-and-crosland-tower-library-renewal) ). Honestly, I want something that resembles even one floor of Crosland, on West, that I can just grind out math at 11:58 p.m. without having to walk 15 minutes.

Anyone who lives in Modera Midtown or any apartment near campus?,"I am an OOS transfer and looking for a rental right now. Because my current school ends around on Dec 20th-ish, and considering that the first day of the class of GaTech is on Jan 6th (and FASET orientation is on Jan 3rd), I really have little time for a house hunting. It is nearly impossible for me to look at houses in person because it is 10+ hr driving from here. Also, I need to move everything with my two dogs, so I need an address to move stuff before I hire a mover.

So, I've been browsing Zillow and Trulia for rentals, and I narrrowed down to a few apartments, and then I checked reviews of each one of them on Yelp and I had to cross out everything because the reviews were so bad and it seemed like they were no place for living. But after crossing out those apts, I can't really find any other options :( 

So, I am trying to reconsider my lists... and if anyone is living near campus, any recommendation would be appreciated.

My budget is less than 2k/month, and what I am looking for is safe, quiet, smoke-free enivronment.

So my list included (No offense to anyone who lives here. I only know about these places from what I read online. they all have bad reviews on Yelp but I commented for those who have extremely bad reviews),
 
1. Baltimore at midtown(Yelp reviews were too horrible so I am not considering here at all)
2.  Modera midtown
3. Skyhouse midtown
4. Hanover west peachtree

College Republicans President just resigned over the impeachment inquiry,"Got this email:

Hello friends.

A week ago, the House of Representatives voted to formalize the process of impeaching the President. I was disappointed to see that not a single Republican voted in favor. While the Democrats’ approach to this process has been far from perfect, it has becomeabundantly clear that our President has unlawfully abused the trust placed in him via the office that he holds. His actions with respect to the ongoing scandal regarding his communications with the President of Ukraine are without explanation or excuse. An ever-increasing body of evidence indicates that our President has broken the law, and if someone claims to uphold the constitution, then the appropriate response is clear: these actions must be investigated, and the President must be held responsible.

I have always considered myself a Republican. My views on policy and governing principles have not changed during the course of this administration, even while the national party has contorted itself and abandoned some of its longest-standing principles toplacate its current leader in the White House. In fact, these principles – respect for our constitution, rule of law, and the belief that the President should be held to the highest ethical standards – are what led me to conclude that I must separate myself from the GOP and support the ongoing impeachment inquiry. It brings me no joy to break with a party that, for years, I have seen as holding the best solutions to so many political questions. It is clear, however, that the present-day national Republican Party, with few exceptions, cares more about defending the indefensible in an attempt to cling to their own power than pursuing truth and justice. This party has lost sight of the values that made it unique and has fallen into the trap of chasing the whims of one man who constantly lies, brings shame to our country, and defies our constitution. This is the same man who, when speaking of John McCain, said he prefers those who ""weren't captured"" despite his several deferments from duty. While Senator McCain sat in aVietcong prison cell, the President described avoiding contracting STDs as ""his own personal Vietnam."" The President’s term will come to an end – his leadership is temporary. However, the stains he has placed on the party he represents and the conservativemovement will be recorded forever in history. I sincerely hope that the mantle of Republican leadership one day returns to those who value honor, dignity, and conservative principles, but those currently at the helm of the Party seem to be charting a course towards a much darker future for the GOP.

Many people who share my views have stayed silent, hoping that soon enough the embarrassment of the current administration will blow over and we can pretend this presidency never happened. That is simply not possible – it is increasingly clear that continued silence is tantamount to complicity. Those of us who cannot abide by this President’s actions must make clear where we stand. The reluctance of the party to separate itself from its leader, or even to criticize him on his worst mistakes, shows that change from the inside is not currently possible. As such, I will be stepping down as Chairman of the College Republicans at Georgia Tech, effective immediately. If there is no tolerance for dissent and no appetite for following the law in the national GOP, I must respectfully part ways. I believe there is much good to be recovered from this political organization, but that is all it is – a political organization. It does not, and should not, dominate our lives. I, for one cannot support the actions of the current leaders of the party, and so I will be, for the time being, separating myself from their leadership.

The last two years we shared as a chapter were extraordinary in so many ways - no doubt in large part because of the many incredible people I’ve had the privilege of meeting through this organization. We more than doubled our membership and hosted many great leaders whom I still respect, including then-Secretary Brian Kemp. It is regrettable that my service must end in this way, but I simply could not allow the current leadership of the national party to speak for me anymore. I hope that in my time leading our chapter I have represented our shared principles and Georgia Tech well.

All the best and Go Jackets,
Jacob Chambers",1573259140,1,0

GT Gender Critical Society,"Hello, I am a first year GT student and I want to create a club for gender critical feminists. For the uninitiated, gender critical feminism is a brand of feminism that recognizes that womanhood is defined by certain lived experiences, and not something that anyone can just identify with. I am making this post in order to gauge interest in a club dedicated Gender Critical Feminism. Our mission for creating this club is to educate students about the realities of trans ideology and create an environment where actual women's concerns are taken seriously and proper solutions can be discussed. I have already met with some people who are interested and we have already come up with some demands for GT:    

* We demand that the Women's Resource Center be made available only to biological women.   
* We demand that GT block all sites that host pornographic or otherwise sexually explicit content. Additionally, all sexually explicit material e.g. movies, books, magazines, video games, etc. must be banned from campus, even electronic content. A community that normalizes porn is a community that disrespects women.    
* We demand that GT strictly enforce gender separation in campus restrooms and locker rooms. Men do not belong in women's restrooms, regardless of how they identify.   
* We demand that the CRC designate at least 4 hours a day as women-only hours (no TIMs). The CRC must take steps to ensure women's safety while working out.  
* We demand that GT scrub any pro-trans content on its website.  
* We demand that any planned or future drag/crossdressing shows be banned. These shows make a mockery out of femininity and encourage gender deviancy.   

These are just the demands that we have thought of so far. I hope we can have more discussions once this club starts.",1571264979,0,0

The myth called achievement,"A significant percentage of the students at this school are truly struggling. It's not new and I'm glad people now feel safe enough to reach out to the community about it. I want to help, and this might be a message you **need** to hear.

If you're reading this as a fellow student, there's a good chance you've got a million things occupying your head at this very moment. Enough things to cloud judgement and distort thought. I'm asking you take a break from inside your head and zoom out to view your life from above.

What you might see is that you look like a point on a plane of the cartesian persuasion, located at what we call the present moment. It's got an infinite number of bumpy paths extending in all directions. Like... really bumpy--keep your arms and legs in the car at all times.

Every hill is a high in your life. Every valley is a low.

At our altitude, these might look small (not necessarily--I'm not trying to make light of tragedy). That embarrassing thing you did last week? Approximately every person except you forgot about it not even 10 seconds following. Got a job offer? You are a MF'ing G (I cannot emphasize this more, getting employed is the reason you *willingly* came to Tech!!). Same thing, though.

If you're like me, you have at *least* a few crippling insecurities. Times I've failed to perform. Making below average grades in my classes. Bombed every single one of my two phone screens this semester. I'm extremely into that girl, better play it cool and pretend like she doesn't exist (works every\* time). Is there a job ~~beyond retail~~ I'm... actually qualified for?

If you're like me, you probably want to change too. We all have an ideal image of ourselves we can visualize. Mine goes to sleep every night at a reasonable time, excited for the next day. Puts forth his best effort, in all things, irrespective of his emotional state. Has a 10.75 inch jimmy john... You get what I'm saying.

Let's call this ideal version of yourself Big-Dick-Energy-Chad-You (BDECY).

Why in the world do we all feel so rushed to reach this ideal? BDECY is mostly achievable. Look, I know 'Biggest-Dick-Icarus' (BDI) did it in 2 years while volunteering in Africa, but what does that have to do with you? It's possible you're a late bloomer and it'll be another 5 years? 10 years? 20? Who knows and who cares. It's entirely possible BDI had a helping hand, arm, *and* leg, or maybe not; It truly does not matter.

So your work hasn't impacted the lives of strangers yet. So not everyone likes you. So you've got noticeable flaws. So you've fallen way (waaaaaaaay) short of where you thought you'd be at this point in your life.

So... wait, why do we care about these things again?

If you're like me, your younger, ignorant self, often lauded as a (future) world-impactor, set up some self-expectations that don't make a whole lot of sense under closer scrutiny. 

**You've put all your self-worth eggs in the achievement basket.**

The truth is, it's an anomaly to drive up a steep mountain in the plane of reality and make it to the top without falling off and sustaining major trauma. Besides, once your altitude gets high, you have no choice but to keep moving up. *To stop is to fall all the way back down*. BDI is the one who's actually out of place. He will have to bust ass for the rest of his life just to *maintain* his position.

I'm going to challenge you to stop looking at paths leading up mountains and aim for something flatter. Look for a wide path rising slowly and steadily. Give yourself permission to fuck up. And be there to support yourself when it inevitably happens.

Don't totally let go of BDECY, but rather realize you may never reach that ideal, nor should you feel pressured to. Realize that BDI is exposing himself to a *dangerous* way of life. A way of life taking him to a summit, alone. **Any path that puts you above everyone else, by definition, leaves you there on your own.**

Now zoom back into the close view of your life. Take stock of your surroundings. Stop looking directly down or directly up. Instead look at the horizon and find a gentle slope leading up, but advance slowly, deliberately. You've got plenty of time to gain momentum before hitting the gas.

Determine your success, not based off of where you are, but based off of any small thing you did this day/week/month/year that moved you ever so slightly towards your ideal self. **Something that's trivial to everyone else might be huge for you.** And give yourself a pat on the back. You've made it this far.

**tl;dr: Stop focusing on who you think you should have been by now. Instead, pay attention to whether or not you're moving in a positive direction. Achievement is not a sustainable source of self-worth. When you let go of the need to be special, it will free you.**",1571197555,160,0

I am disappointed in myself.,"I am a freshman cs major. I only barely got into this school (waitlisted) and I am very happy that I made it in. This is my second semester. I did fine over the summer but I'm finding fall semester so much more difficult. High school barely took any effort for me. I did study and do all my homework, but nothing in high school was ever hard. Now that I'm halfway through my second semester I feel like I've lost all my drive and I'm just a below average student who shouldn't even be here. I'm taking 4 classes and doing fine in three of them, but I got a 40 my first calculus test a few weeks ago and I feel like such an idiot. I understood the concepts, I just was too anxious to study. I don't even know how to study, because I've never taken a hard class before. I don't know what to do, I don't have any self-discipline left because I'm always exhausted and I've skipped class many times. I need some kind of structure to follow, but I know I'm an adult now who's expected to be able to take care of myself. I keep slipping into depression and wanting to give up. I feel like this situation isn't uncommon for students but I still feel so alone when everyone around me seems to already be so skilled at working hard studying and resisting distractions. I'm so disappointed that I went from the top of my class in my tiny high school to someone who's struggling to manage with only 12 credit hours. I went to the counseling center and they told me to leave and go find help somewhere else. I don't know where else to go. Was anyone else in a similar situation freshman year? What did you do? I don't want to sound so dramatic over one bad test, by feel like I'm already so deep in mediocrity it's impossible to improve myself. I really don't want to give up though, I love computer science and I'm proud to be a tech student. Where can I find help? What can I do?

Here at cyber we want to relay,

Some password tips to keep the spooks away!

&amp;#x200B;

\- Use a password manager application. You only need to remember one password and the application will create unique, complex and long passwords for every website.

\- Never use the same password on multiple sites, a password manager will help you with this!

\- Avoid passwords based on a dictionary word or something about you. A password manager will ALSO help you with this, awesome!

\- Enable multi-factor authentication on any site that has it available.

Tech Campus is about to become a Surveillance Valley,"Our professor just got done talking about what his research is about and where its headed. One of the things that's part of his research is helping GTPD turn all the cameras on campus into a mesh network, so that they can track all the cars.

The camera network will be able to log the precise time and location a vehicle was spotted *(as their police cruisers already do, those are the camera looking things on the back of their cars)*, how long before they map every face to a time and location on campus?

* If the same module has multiple sessions, each with different exam date on the matrix, does it mean that this module has different groups of people sitting for the same paper at different dates and times?
* How do I tell which module has/doesn't have an exam? e.g. ECE 2045 doesn't have exam while ECE 2035 have even though both are quite similar(?) in nature. The course catalogue doesn't always explicitly state whether the module has a final and how the weights are like for the assessments.

international student confused about CPT,"I really wanna get an internship over the next summer and I was planning on applying to as many companies I could find online. I was told by several different people that I should try to use CPT as it’d be good to have all of OPT left when I graduate in 2022. The thing is I did a lot of research and I’m still confused af on how they work especially here at Tech.

First of all, is it actually true that I should go for CPT? I read that the internship would need to count towards my degree, so I should register it through C2D2. But what does that even mean?? So do I get credit counted as electives or something? Does that imply I couldn’t get paid? Also, about the whole process: do I just apply to companies and then after I get an offer I apply for CPT at Tech? Is that how it works?

Another thing: I was told that the companies wouldn’t need to sponsor me since I’m a sophomore and it would be just an internship with extremely low chances of them offering me a full job after I graduate. Is that true? If anyone can answer any of the questions that’d be great! Also any advice you have on what I should do (like CPT or OPT) would be greatly appreciated... thanks!!

Stressed? Brain feels like mush from studying? The idea of spending 5 days with your family a bit daunting? Try LARPing!,"LARPing is Live Action Play Playing - like any RPG, except instead of sitting in a dark room lit only by your 30"" monitor, you play outside and hit nerds with sticks. Its an incredibly cathartic release, not to mention all the benefits of physical exercise on your brain and grades and the like.  

[Xadune](https://xadune.com/) is a Victorian Gaslamp LARP centered in Atlanta.  It is lightest-touch combat, roleplay heavy, and extremely new-player and new-LARPer friendly.  We are hosting their next game November 29th - December 1st at Indian Springs State Park.  Just an hour south of Tech on 75, it provides the perfect (temporary) escape from finals, essays, and overbearing family members who insist that you are *so smart,* so you'll be just fine on your finals. You can come by for the whole event, or part of it, or whatever you like, but I assure you you'll have a great time. 

Best of all? Trying the game out is free! If you come out to be a 'Monster' - where you get to play the various villains, antagonists, and crunchies the players are pitted against, admission is free! We will provide you with all the costuming and weapons needed to play, as well as run you through the rules and safety instructions.  Just bring comfy shoes and warm clothes. 

If you really like the idea of LARPing and want to play as a Player Character, show your Buzzcard at Check-In to get $10 off admission.  

Xadune really helped me when I was at Tech.  I was, as many are, overwhelmed by the workload and I would get caught in a spiral of *I have to do more*. Taking a break from academic things, getting some fresh air and exercise, and making friends outside of Tech really helped me be able to focus on my schoolwork when I got back.  I probably wouldn't have graduated if I hadn't have found LARPing, just because having a not-Tech-focused hobby kept me sane.

Exempt CS 1331 if you did well in CS 1316?,"Title. I'm a CompE transfer student looking to declare a CS minor. My previous institution offered a 4 hour CS 1302, which transferred to Tech as CS 1316 + a spare credit hour elective. While looking into exactly what CS 1316 satisfies I stumbled across [this PowerPoint](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2009/cs1316_summer/presentations/CS1316-where_it_fits.pdf) claiming that ""A student with strong performance in CS 1316
can jump directly to CS 1332."" I passed my CS 1302 with a (high) A.

&amp;nbsp;

The PowerPoint is apparently quite old and I can't find that info corroborated anywhere else. I'm not certain if this is still valid (or that it ever was). I'm emailing the CS minor advisors tonight to ask for certain, but I figure I might as well check here as well since the advisors will likely be out of the office for the weekend already.

&amp;nbsp;

If a high grade in 1316 _doesn't_ let you exempt 1331, would it be worth it to try to get my transfer credit re-evaluated?",1574459563,1,0

* Do not plan on buying any meal plan next year, so will likely need to cook in some in kitchen
   * Can you even do this in Harris? And if so, how inconvenient is it?
* How much can I realistically expect to spend on a room in Home Park?
   * I was estimating $600-700 including utilities. Is this realistic?
   * Could I potentially sublease during the summer if I intern elsewhere for 80% or so, or is that too optimistic?
* How do the communities compare?

Transfer question,"So I am looking to apply to transfer to tech for summer. Right now I am a computer engineering major at UGA. To transfer as a computer engineering major to tech, I need chem 1, which I never took, so I am applying as a CS major. For the CS major, I need 2 consecutive lab science electives, ex. Phys 1 with lab and Phys 2 with lab. I took Phys 1 with lab, but due to scheduling conflicts, I had to take a different version of physics 2 at UGA which didn’t have a dedicated lab section, and was only 3 hours as opposed to 4. Technically, it doesn’t count as physics 2 at tech, it counts as a physics elective. My question is, should I still apply, as they might take this into consideration and still give me a chance? The application has a section which allows you to explain certain course selections and why you took them. Would they offer conditional acceptances also? I was thinking about just applying for the computer engineering major but thought I might have a better chance at the CS major. Please only legitimate and serious answers, thanks.",1577648505,1,0
Is it worth it to pursue a minor or double-major?,"Hello! I'm currently a third-year CS major and have lately been thinking about pursuing a minor or double major. I was thinking about doing another hard science like Chemistry or BME(leaning more on BME). The thing is that I have almost no clue on the difficulty of these programs but more importantly, don't even know if it would be worth pursuing. I've had a few internships that were all in enterprise or business software and have been feeling sick of it so I thought that minoring or double majoring in one of these would allow me to specialize in software tailored to biotech or maybe even try and do something completely different like premed or research. I think I've just been in a very doubtful phase in regards to my future.

I'm also worried about my graduation time. As of now, I am due to already graduate a semester late and since I haven't even started the BME track, I'd have to start with GenChem and GenBio. This means that my graduation time would be pushed back a full year or even more. At this point, is it even worth it for me to try this? How difficult would it be and would it be? Would the end result be worth it on my diploma?

Transferring into Georgia Tech,"Hi! 

I'm a freshman in another university (not going to say unless it's important which it may very well be) and I've been thinking about transferring into Georgia Tech.

I saw on the website that applications open January 15th, and that historically the acceptance rate isn't that high for transfer students. 

People in gatech that have transferred into this school, is there anything special I should know? What is the application like? Are there any important people I can talk to? Or is it just another high school to college application? 

I'm also interested in how good of a chance I have at transferring but I don't feel like spewing my stats here as of yet. If there's any kind soul in this subreddit that has enough spare time to PM me about the process I'd greatly appreciate it.

Georgia Tech was my dream school in high school, and it is still my dream school; any help would be greatly appreciated.

Immunizations question for a transfer to ATL from GTL,"If anyone has any experience with this recently or currently and can answer these questions, I would be so so grateful! I have called multiple numbers and left multiple voicemails, and have emailed and got an unhelpful auto reply. I just got back from GTL in France, and tbe transfer was late notice so it's been a bit of a rush. I only saw the immunizations come up on my housing contract and realized I needed to do this to be in Atlanta. 

My immunizations are incomplete only for the varicella and meningococcal vaccines. The first I have History (not accepted) and the second was apparently waived when I went to my undergrad school. I don't know why I never got this one. 

My questions are (based on what I can accomplish without having to spend $300 to get these vaccines):

1. GT accepts a titer for varicella, but it might be as late as January 10th when I get the results . Does anyone know if they let someone start on campus conditionally until their record is complete?

2. On the form it says that the meningococcal vaccines is required for all students under 22. It doesn't say ""only"" though, making me wonder if it is okay to not have this vaccine, as I am over 22.

A PSA about tomorrow's Syracuse game,"GT MBB plays Syracuse tomorrow at noon, and playing Syracuse at home comes with slightly different expectations than other games. Namely, airball.

If you're not familiar with the chant, when you're in the crowd and the opposing player completely misses the rim/backboard with a shot, that's an airball, and you're supposed to remind him of it every single time he has the ball defensively, by chanting ""Airball"" at him. 

We did this to Syracuse about two years ago and it completely shut down one of their starters - John Gillon went 2-10 from the field and 1-7 from three and finished the game with just 7 points. [Some Syracuse fan got so fed up with the airball chants that he called Josh Pastner to complain.](https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/cuse-fan-complains-about-air-ball-chant-georgia-tech-coach-phones-him-back/) Pastner's response was to have [Air-ball t-shirts](https://twitter.com/GTAthletics/status/958469608826179584?s=19) in advance of their next home game against the Orange.

Can we have a lab due during finals?,"One of my professors made our last lab due on December 12th, right at the end of finals, I believe.  Some students have complained about it being due during finals.  The professor wrote:                     

&gt; There has been a concern raised about the fact that the final assignment (Lab 10) is due during the final exam period.  I just wanted to reassure everyone that this is clearly within the rules because it is given in lieu of a final exam.  The GT rules state ""No assessment other than a final examination or its replacement may be due during the Final Examination Period.""  This assignment is considered as a replacement for the final exam.

Students supporting students -- A message from Undergraduate and Graduate SGA,"Hello, Yellow Jackets! 

We hope you all had an exciting Thanksgiving break and are gearing up for the final stretch of the semester! 

As the semester comes to a close, it can be overwhelming to say the least. In studying for multiple final exams, finishing up group projects, and late night study sessions, it is a time where we may feel immense stress. With balancing everything as Yellow Jackets, it is alright to feel this way. 

Take care of yourself, your roommates and your friends during these last two weeks of the semester. If you or a friend needs someone to talk to, remember that we are here for you. If you wish to seek professional help after hours, please dial 404-894-2575 to reach a counselor. 

 
The two of us will be available if you ever feel the need to talk in person. 

 
Yours in White and Gold,

No I can’t go to a restaurant and bartending because it’s illegal and I must be focusing on my work.

HELP! Made bad choices and might be kicked out,"I desperately would like some advice as a grad student.

Besides these two subjects I'm getting an A in the other subject.

I'm counting these two subjects as Cs since I'm a bit below average. Thus my GPA becomes 4+2+2/3 = 2.66. Gatech's academic probation warning is 2.7 for masters students.

Now's a good time to review Institute exam and reading day policies.,"If something feels unfair about any outstanding class assignments or your final exams, now's a great time to familiarize yourself with the Institute Exam and Reading Day policies. The policies apply to both undergrad and grad classes and are taken seriously by administration.  If, after reading them, you believe there is a serious violation, talk to the professor and/or submit a grievance. Response times for end-of-semester grievances are typically very fast. Ask specifically for anonymity if it's important to you. 

I don't want to encourage complaining for the sake of complaining, but if you are truly being treated unfairly and in a manner inconsistent with these policies, know that there are people dedicated to making things right for you and your classmates. Instructors need to play by the rules as well.

Find the new Under the Couch and I'll give you money,"Hello! It's me, your friendly university Musician's Network president (until spring semester at least)!

Under the Couch is a student run arts space and music venue. It is the home of Musician's Network and its shows, and MN helps put on shows and events for many other organizations and departments within the space. During the daytime it serves as a relaxing public lounge with music and ~atmosphere~. There are also practice spaces and a studio. 

I don't know how many of you remember or were previously informed, but Under the Couch will be going down with the upcoming Student Center demolition in May 2020, and there are no plans for a new one to be built when the new Campus Center is constructed. Only the Musician's Network practice spaces and studio will remain. 

This, however, does not have to be the end of student-run arts space on campus.

After a meeting with VP of Campus Services Kasey Helton,  Senior Director of the Student Center Lindsay Bryant, and Undergraduate Student Body President Pooja Juvekar, Musician's Network is now looking for alternative locations around campus to serve as a location for a new Under the Couch.

There are a few wants/needs that would make a location suitable:

* Ability to accommodate 50+ persons at capacity
* Ability to install a sound system (big speakers/equipment and sound booth)
* Ability to be loud and play amplified music
* Space to install a stage and lighting
* Space to store equipment
* Easy access for patrons and load-in
* Bathroom Access
* Space to function as a daytime lounge
* Visibility 

Not all of these necessarily need to be met, but the more the better


We have a few ideas so far. Some are just shots in the dark/completely off the wall, and that's fine. We're brainstorming now and we'll look into further feasibility in the future.

* Living Learning Communities room near the wing zone
* Woody's Food Court
* Second Floor of Barnes and Noble
* Rec Tech space on East Campus
* Rent a storefront in Tech Square 
* Somewhere near the football stadium??
* Somewhere around the biotech quad??
* Somewhere at the Bill Moore Student Success Center??
* Biltmore Building Basement?? 
* Dalney Parking Deck??

So not all of these are overseen by Campus Services. The easiest solution would likely be under them but starting a conversation with a different department could also be possible.


ANYHOW

If you have any good ideas about underused spaces on campus that could suit our needs, I want to hear them!! I'll venmo $5 for every good, unique suggestion (this is me personally, not the club or any other gt organization). Thank you for your help!

Instead of paying for the Spring/Summer semester combo AND paying for another plan (international coverage). I'm currently on the Fall plan with UHC.

Also If I did decide to buy a plan on marketplace would I have to have the school's health plan fee waived? I'm sure I would have to provide proof of coverage so I don't have that fee tacked on my bursar page",1576613357,1,0

An open letter to the Georgia Tech Marching Band,"Dear friends:
As you know, this was my last season with the Yellow Jacket Marching Band.  But as I leave, here are some final remarks for the rest of y'all.

This season definitely was not the most ideal on many fronts.  Losing the right to play chords for a good portion of the home schedule.  Losing to an FCS school.  More frustrating losses.  And of course, the band's ongoing struggle with marketing.  But despite that, y'all still did a great job this season!  Y'all brought the energy every game from kickoff to the last whistle regardless of the score.  You supported the team through thick and thin with passion, honor, grace, and valor.  And you performed a kick-ass halftime show that paid tribute to the music of this great city!  And through it all, I was proud to serve alongside you one last time!

Which is why I implore you: never let that spirit die!  This season's team was young and scrappy, but raw and unrefined.  And despite the talent on the roster there was a lot of unrefined, raw, and at times undisciplined football.  But there was also a team that kept fighting and never gave in regardless of the score.  To me, what I saw was a team that had bought into Geoff Collins's effort-based culture: the first step in a deep rebuild.  And it is my belief that eventually that effort and grit and tenacity is going to translate into winning seasons.  Perhaps sooner than anyone anticipates.

That aside, there is one critical reason you cannot let that spirit die.  Together, the Georgia Tech Band, Goldrush, Color Guard, and Cheer, represent the loudest, proudest, and most passionate group in the entire Georgia Tech fanbase.  You are at the front lines of cheering for this team and you have to shoulder that responsibility every game.  Whether that's on the field, in the stands, or outside the stadium before games, you have one responsibility on game days: to lead and to set the example.
May that be your cry.  And may you all do it together as a family week in and week out.
Empower those men on the football team to do what they came here to do.  And that wasn't to play around.  It was to take care of business.  And fight.  And win!

WE GONNA FIGHT
TILL WE CAN'T FIGHT NO MORE!!
GONNA LIE DOWN AND BLEED AWHILE,

GT undergraduate applicant query,"Dear Yellow Jackets,

Congrats on the finish of the finals. Merry Christmas and happy break.

Need advice for two of my ""potential freshman"" friends

Background

Both of them have visited GT and love the ambiance and students body. Both of them have excellent standardized testing  scores, will be their class's valedictorian or salutatorian, have decent ECs and both of them are OOS (full fees).

Candidate A

Wants to definitely become a Doctor so Med school it is. He is super keen to come to GT but parents and friends are warning about grade deflation and high pressure at GT. The general advice given to him is to land up at one of the smaller Ivys, relatively chill, collect the 4.0/4.0 and move on to Med school. So the question is whether Med schools/Grad schools recognize that GT is much more harder than your typical Ivy in terms of grade deflation and rigor of curriculum. Other things being equal(hard work motivation etc.), Will a say 3.6 at GT be ranked superior than say a 3.9 from Brown. 

Please, the aim is not to disparage GT or Ivys but realistically figure out the trade offs. ( [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/20/why-grade-inflation-even-at-harvard-is-a-big-problem/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/20/why-grade-inflation-even-at-harvard-is-a-big-problem/)  or   [https://www.studentsreview.com/viewprofile.php3?k=1230783522&amp;u=331](https://www.studentsreview.com/viewprofile.php3?k=1230783522&amp;u=331) ).  

&amp;#x200B;

Candidate B 

Is super keen to  join GT. She is from Florida, has a number of relatives and friends in Georgia. She has allergy issues in minus zero weather (realizes that she will be miserable in cold weather Ivys) and loves hot and humid Hotlanta. Candidate has \~&gt; 75% percentile credentials.  Off-late GT has started deferring over qualified candidates in order to yield protect. Early application is already done. Candidate B wants your advice on what to do from now till Jan 18 (results date) to tell the admissions team that she is super keen and will definitely join if given a chance (please please), please don't deffer or reject thinking that the candidate will go off to Ivys instead of coming to GT.

The 2004 Humanitarian Bowl (Georgia Tech vs. Tulsa): The largest weight disparity between school mascots,"At first glance, the [2004 Humanitarian Bowl](https://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=240030202), a relatively obscure bowl game in Boise, was a fairly uninteresting, lopsided game between two wholly average programs. The Yellow Jackets took an early lead in the first quarter and enjoyed a 10-3 lead at halftime; the second half was a perfect storm of explosive offense and unforgiving defense in which Tech scored 42 points while only allowing the Golden Hurricane a single touchdown. Tech stymied Tulsa's run game, holding them to -56 (*yes, that's a negative*) yards--Tulsa's worst-ever rushing performance in the 125-year history of their football program. 

This matchup was the most recent of the [three](http://www.winsipedia.com/tulsa/vs/georgia-tech) between the two storied institutions (the previous two occurred in 1944 and 1945, with a Tech and Tulsa win, respectively). These programs have only met at bowl games and have no particular bad blood between one another off the field; however, these three games were the only occasion in which the **heaviest mascot in FBS football (the Golden Hurricane) competed against the lightest (the Yellow Jacket**).

An [SBNation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obtRtrk42a8) places the weight of a single yellow jacket at 0.0001 lbs and (perhaps very unscientifically) estimates the weight of an entire hurricane made of gold to be 1,182,000,000,000 lbs. This mascot weight differential of 1,181,999,999,999.9999 pounds is the largest that has and will ever occur in an FBS football game until a university with a lighter or heavier mascot joins the division or until an existing school adopts a new, unconventional mascot. 

I don't know when Georgia Tech will play Tulsa again. Perhaps there will be another 65-year hiatus. But I hope not. Personally, I would love to cheer on our tiny mascot against its behemoth counterparts and will be watching intently next time Tech's and Tulsa's paths cross.",1576385889,1,0

Dual Degree + Co-op ???,"I am a tech legacy (both my parents went), so I'm planning on taking advantage of the conditional transfer pathway to transfer fall 2020 as an AE and am interested in doubling that with business administration and a minor in Physics. After I get there, in order to ease the financial burden, I was planning on co-oping as soon as I could (spring or summer semester). *I'm aware this path is a long and bumpy road...* Luckily I am able to fulfill all of the conditional transfer requirements at my local community college.

Anyway, today I found out about the Dual Degree program that has a partnership with Emory (among other schools). I think a business degree from Emory would be extremely valuable so that made the Dual Degree path interesting to me. A few questions:

1. How does a business degree from Emory stack up to a business degree from Tech (if I was to try and double major)? Emory is ranked 15 on US News and Reporting while Tech is ranked 21. Is is worth it to pursue Emory?
2. Is it possible to co-op after transferring from Emory as a part of the dual degree? I'm sure it's uncommon since you're already doing so much with the getting a second degree from a second institution but do they let you?
3. Is it ever ""too late"" to co-op? If I decide to transfer to Tech next fall, I'll be a sophomore and if I don't land a job that year, I'll be stuck as a Junior trying to co-op. 
4. Are you able to add a minor at Tech with the dual degree as well?

I'm going to do some more reading and call an adviser at Tech tomorrow but any insight is welcome.

Tovey or not Tovey: Struggling ISyE student needs advice,"I am just coming off a rough semester where despite studying my ass of I will probably get at the very most a low C in Math 2551 and 2027.

Next semester I plan to take Math 2603 with Jing Hao and ISyE 3232 with Craig Tovey.


The issue is that Jing Hao is fairly new and from what I have heard about her she is terrible and her class is very hard.
I think my Multivariable Calculus class this semester was bullshit and the final was unnecessarily hard and I am tired of taking bullshit math classes that profesors make unneccessarily hard. Since this is her first semester at Tech I don't know if she curves grades or if the majority of students get terrible grades.

For anyone who took Jing this semester, should I drop or is a B possible with decent effort ?


Now onto Craig Tovey. Reading his rate my professor makes it seem like he is a nightmare professor.  He has been at Tech for over 20 years and on course critique some of his classes have extremely low GPA's( as low 1.83). However for 3232 his GPA seems kind of decent but has up to 20% of students withdraw from the class possibly inflating the GPA.



I have had a rough semester and I want some kind of relief. I am willing to work hard but I don't want a class where I have to give an A level effort and just spend the entire semester stressing just to pass.

I don't need to take either class next semester but in doing so I would be progressing in my degree. Tovey is not the only professor teaching 3232 but all the other ones are full and the waitlist are also almost full. Apparently Jing Hao is the only one teaching 2603 next semesrer.


Anyone who just took Jing Hao for 2603 or Tovey for 3232 should I drop either of these classes and wait a semester to hopefully take it with a better professor ?

Tax time coming up: Important things to remember,"As an American citizen, I love paying taxes, but as a person who requires money, I love tax refunds even more. Here's some quick reminders for college students:

1. If you receive a W-2, you MUST fill out a tax form. Generally go to Turbotax or H&amp;R Block online unless you have a very special situation
2. If you worked in multiple states, you must pay taxes based on where you worked. In RARE occasions, you may also have to pay taxes based on where you lived.
3. You may only claim yourself as a dependent if no one else can. Figure this out with your parents.
4. If you are an immigrant and by some miracle (praise God) got a job in the US, you must pay US taxes.
5. Room and Board are generally not eligible for deductions and credits like Tuition and Fees.
6. The American Opportunity Tax Credit is a Godsend. Claim it if you can, and make sure you are eligible. It goes up to 2500 dollars in tax credits.
7. You can only receive the American Opportunity Tax Credit for four years of post-high school. It is a credit not a deduction meaning that it reduces tax burden, not taxable income.
8. As a Graduate student, you may be eligible for the Lifetime Opportunity Tax Credit. If you started Grad school in the fall of your fourth year, you may still be eligible for the American Opportunity Tax Credit. The American Opportunity Tax Credit can provide a refund of up to 1000 in some circumstances and is usually the better bet if you can take it if you don't earn much income.
9. Keep your T1098. Forward to your parents if necessary.
10. Keep track of unreimbursed Medical expenses and be sure to deduct them if they are eligible.
11. Fellowships are income if they surpass eligible expenses. Make sure to keep tabs on Fellowships earned and have enough to potentially pay taxes on them.
12. You may be required to fill out a paper form for special tax purposes (Like working in multiple states.)
13. The American Opportunity Tax credit cannot be used for expenses not required by the institute, but the Lifetime Opportunity Tax Credit can. Keep track of books you buy even if not for school.
14. Georgia Tech REQUIRES a computer as a condition of enrollment according to the student handbook. This means that a computer does qualify as an expense for the purposes of the American Opportunity Tax Credit as the university require it.
15. If you worked as a waitress, waiter, or contractor, your tips or payments ARE income and you may have to pay taxes based on what you earned. You likely won't get a refund in this situation and may end up owing.
16. If you have any investments or a interest bearing money market or sweep accounts, you may be required to pay taxes on capital gains or dividends regardless of whether you took money out. In the future, consider a Roth IRA.

W's Effect on PhD Admissions?,"Hey guys! So in the Spring, I took a W in a class that's somewhat related to my major, but not a requirement. I originally took the class since it was a prerequisite for a major I was originally thinking of switching into. I was doing well in the class, but I realized I wasn't really interested in the subject and wanted to focus on my newfound passion for my original major. Fast forward seven months and I'm thinking of dropping another class this semester that's completely unrelated to my major. Due to scheduling conflict in Phase II, I didn't end up with all the classes I wanted and had to take a humanities course that I expected to be not too difficult and somewhat fun. However, two weeks into the class I realized it has a very heavy workload (essays every week - I didn't know this since I wasn't even registered for the class on syllabus day) and the subject is so boring to the point that I fall asleep every other class. I would much rather spend my time with major classes, research, or just getting exercise hours in.

Problem is it's always a dream of mine to be a professor and going into academia. How much will PhD programs here at Tech (or similar schools) care if I have these two W's on my transcript? I've been reading posts about this and I'm getting mixed results; some say they won't care at all and others say it may hurt. I know graduate schools care more about experience, recommendation letters, GPA, and GRE, but it seems like with the exception of a high GPA, I don't have a particularly strong application compared with other students here. Will having two W's hurt my chances even more in this case and destroy my dreams? Any input is much appreciated, thanks in advance!",1568996918,4,0
