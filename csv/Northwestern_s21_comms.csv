"There are a lot of apartments at the intersection of ridge and noyes which is like a 8-10 minute walk from tech. That’s a great option if you’re also on a budget. If you’re willing to spend more, there are some nice apartment complexes in downtown Evanston (I.e. park Evanston, the link, and Evanston place). Although Evanston place tends to have a more dorm feel as it is mostly students. If you specify more I can give better advice, but hope this helps as a first step.",1611479847,12,0
"Yup. I got a single in freshman year (well, and every other year) and I was so happy to have my own space that was properly mine. Like, I would not have been able to adapt to living away from home if I had someone sharing a bedroom with me - it's almost like a measure of safety thing for me that I still had a space that was properly *mine*, and I had privacy and so on and so forth. And I'm way too introverted to look forward to meeting someone new, much less to walk into a room and meet someone I'm going to be trapped with for the next year.

Honestly, there was a short time when I was reading about housing selection, and what I heard was that freshmen should have roommates and will basically get a double unless they have a great priority number and I, uh didn't.... And I was seriously considering, from that irrational emotional part of my brain, dropping northwestern and going to a lesser school for that.

It worked out in the end (I didn't enter a selection, figuring I'd rather roll the dice than pick from things that I didn't want, and I got thrown in a hall in Plex that was for the freshmen they ran out of room to have elsewhere - ah, house seven first floor memories....), but I think it's kind of a problem how the narrative is always so aggressively focused around roommates. I recognize that probably most people that should have roommates wouldn't *try* to live with a stranger, just because that's generally scary, but there's a nonzero population of people who shouldn't have a roommate.

And I'm going to be honest, I lived near my best friend all four years and we got along great, but if we lived in the same room things would not have gone well...",1611459094,3,0

"Your comment is what we call a lack of understanding of how endowments work and the fiduciary duties that the board has to the university. Endowments aren't a rainy day fund to dip into just for the sake of equity, even though it's a noble goal. The board's fiduciary duty is almost always going to lead to austerity measures 99/100 times, as that is almost always a considerably better way to provide stability. Dipping into the unrestricted cash in the general treasury of the endowment seems like a brilliant idea in retrospect when you know everything has turned out okay. It's an incredibly awful idea when you don't know what the future holds and it is seemingly impossible to get any accurate model of it. How do you completely cripple NU's standing among its peers? They take austerity while we increase the endowment draw significantly, and then we end up in a crisis that is indeed not short-term. All of a sudden, we have a $1B+ downward swing in endowment resources, which materially affects our ability to compensate staff, provide financial aid to students, maintain facilities, etc.",1611439574,1,0

"Re ppl who r gonna say you should have a roommate: I personally think it’s more of a personal preference. I think that at a school like NU, on average your roommate will probably be “neutral,” but the possibilities definitely 100% range from “incredible person who you’re best friends with until you die” to “actively malicious and/or actively works against your ability to make friends.”

In retrospect, I would have gone w a single if I could have. I already knew that I’m more of a like introverted person who can appreciate alone time, but what I learned at school is that I *NEED* that alone time, like a lot of it. I honestly don’t know what I would have done if my roommate had been there more often. Bc yeah, if ur friends w ur roommate then it can like make things better when you’re really sad or freaking out, but if you have an awkward dynamic then it kinda just like forces you to keep bottling it up even in the place that’s like supposed to be your private quarters :/.

"Pros -

 location is okay 

Rent price is okay 

Maintenance requests can be quick to be addressed especially if it's something urgent like a leak.


Cons - 

Buildings are pretty old 
-check for mold, check the noises in the floor. If you can, live in the highest apartment for more sun and so that you don't hear your neighbors. Sound insulation isn't high

Utilities aren't included in rent price

Pet fee is $250 + $25/month 

There's another fee ($35/month) not included that deals with 
the trash/snow plowing + you need renter's insurance.

Foster property had wasps nests in the walls, fake walls, ridiculously small rooms, and damaged windows that took 6 months after reporting to repair. Back deck stairs collapsed in the winter. Property manager routinely scheduled tours with 1-2 days notice, which was against our contract.

Noyes property was unpainted, dirty day of move in. Work continued for the first week of our lease. Peak Properties had us sign the lease for the garden apartment, then after we signed, told us the garden apartment wasn’t available, and that we’d be renting another, more expensive apartment elsewhere in the same building. When we complained, they only lowered the price a fraction of the way, rather than to the price we paid.

"I know of maybe half a dozen people in my Pritzker class who went to NU for undergrad. It won't hurt you, but the only tangible benefit you get is better academic preparation.

It's also worth noting that pritzker places a heavy emphasis on work experience. Most students don't go straight from undergrad to law. Almost everyone in my class has at least a couple years of full time work experience. By the time you go to law school, you may be a few years removed from undergrad anyway. 

Law schools typically have a more holistic process, so things like your essays and your resume will matter a lot more than the prestige of your undergraduate degree.

however, grades often aren't reflective of ability in a class; i've had multiple classes where i was &lt;25 percentile on the midterm and &gt;75 percentile on the final; there's honestly too much variability, i think, to correlate understanding of material with test grade, and changing how you approach studying might help make it feel more valuable.",1615956415,1,0

As for studying, I usually spent a lot of time rewriting notes and doing practice problems. Studying with groups was only effective when reviewing for me -- I wanted to be able to know the content really well and be the one helping others if we ever did study in groups.

"I mean it really depends on you and your abilities. I know kids who drink on weekdays and maintain a 4.0 and other kids who struggle to scrape by with a 3.0 and dedicate literally all their time to coursework. Also Engineering is broad, and there are easier engineering majors than others. That being said, I will say that the Engineering Analysis sequence/some eng courses required for all majors can be a huge time suck. 

In other words, your GPA is kind of a function of your intelligence, your commitment/how much time your willing to put in, and the difficulty of your courses. Engineering courses are bound to be difficult, so thats kind of fixed, but you could probably do some smart planning --- especially if you have AP credits --- to minimize your load. I'd say many engineering courses are designed to make you ""work"" more than ""think"", and so intelligence can sometimes have less of an impact then time commitment --- to a degree. 

Otherwise, expect to put more time in the lower intelligence you have, (which is only somewhat fixed) to maintain the same GPA as someone with higher intelligence. If we assume  putting more time towards classes is a more reliable method for boosting GPA than raising your intelligence (which I believe will come if you truly apply yourself, but that can be a large time commitment), then your GPA kind of becomes just a function of time commitment with the other two variables fixed.  

*So roughly* speaking, the more time you put in the higher your GPA will be, and the less social life you will have. I think a 3.5 GPA is achievable with enough time for an ok social life and good enough for grad school, but nothing spectacular, so you'll probably need something more to make your application stand out, which will possibly mean less social life.",1615924977,1,0

"Engineering will be difficult anywhere, but especially at northwestern. There are about 8 classes that I would consider moderately difficult to very difficult which are required for all engineering majors. Other than those, I would say it depends on your major. BME and ChemE are naturally gonna be difficult, IE and Civil not quite as much. It is possible to get a good GPA, but a strong programming background (especially in MATLAB) would be very useful, at least for me since I never coded in my life before here. And even for the difficult courses, I think with enough hard work you can manage a B+ in the courses. Now is a 3.3 GPA good for med school? Not really, but in general a 3.6 GPA for engineering is great and you should have essentially every internship as a possibility assuming good ECs. If you are trying to go to professional school after (Med, dental, pharmacy, law, etc) I think I would be wise to not do engineering, otherwise you should be good!

"Definitely do not need a strong background in engineering but it sure helps to have a strong background in your basic sciences and math as others definitely will. Programming is fairly light in the general engineering curriculum too so I wouldn’t stress that in any way. I would definitely say the atmosphere is not toxic but it is competitive (especially in engineering). The main reason it’s competitive is because a lot of professors will make their content difficult enough to where only a few get As or they will intentionally make it extremely difficult (i.e exam with an average of 50%) and just correct grades at the end via a curve (again, so only a select few get As). I would say you definitely have to work fairly hard to maintain anything beyond a 3.0 and anything beyond that gets increasingly more difficult because of the way the curves work. You can definitely maintain a 3.5+ (for grad school) but you will have your work cut out for you. The difficulty depends a lot on the major within engineering you will be going into though so I could definitely be biased (I actually ended up switching majors because it ended up being too much).

There are a few non-systems courses that still list 211 as a prereq, but they'll get updated to require either 150 or more likely 214.

I don't know how often the narrative course will be taught, but I've told Theatre I'd try to teach it at least once more for their MFA students.  It's my primary research area at the moment, so I have an incentive to keep teaching it.",1614829125,2,0

"Yeah, so you're taking the wrong approach. They ""don't match"" financial aid \*wink wink\*. Basically, just fill out a financial aid form appeal and include whatever information you see fit. Your reason that you need more financial aid shouldn't be that WashU is giving you more financial aid, but you should include it in your documents showing why you deserve more financial aid. Also if the number northwestern is asking is a lot higher than your fafsa EFC that's another thing you should include as well.

For the record, I never did this because I transferred into Northwestern, and NU's financial aid was very generous to me. I had to go through this process at my old school though.

Edit: Important clarification. Is WashU cheaper because of merit scholarship or financial aid? If it's the latter you have a chance, if it's the former northwestern's not gonna help you there.",1619110449,3,0

i’m a senior now, on track to graduate at the end of this quarter. winter of my freshman year, i hated my major so much i had to drop classes, all the way down to a part time student status. my sophomore year, i took the entire winter off due to a major depressive episode - without a global pandemic going on. all of this to say, basically, that everyone has their own self-reckoning to deal with college. the only real certainty is that you’ll come out of it a stronger person.

i know it’s easy to say, but the sooner you realize this decision is about “making life easier for yourself” rather than being forced to “give up” on something, the better you’ll feel about it. there’s nothing more important to prioritize than your own health. 

feel free to DM me if you ever need advice on the leave of absence process or similar questions, hope you’re doing alright",1619106400,3,0

You might have to pay a $300 cancellation fee, but at least you'll get the rest of this quarter's housing fee. 

IMO, you wouldn't be giving up on much because there isn't a lot going on on campus. Lots of freshmen never even moved on to campus, so it's not like you'd be the only one not in Evanston. If you would have better support at home, that's where you should be. Your wellbeing is #1.",1619070742,6,0

Also, I wouldn't be too worried about wasting/giving up on freshman year. Covid has restricted a lot of campus life as it is (although that isn't to say that people can't enjoy living on campus rn by any means) and more importantly, the idea that you have to make all your friends/find your people/get in a social group by the end of your freshman year is highkey a myth. My advice is to take things one day at a time!

If you decide you want to try and stick it out, there are a lot of student orgs, IM teams, and just general things people like to be a part of and do together, and I'm pretty confident that there are plenty out there that won't be cliquish and would be happy to have you!

I have no problem imagining EPD or CPD committing such actions, but have a harder time imagining NUPD doing such. 

I also have a hard time getting behind the idea abolishing NUPD because then northwestern would have to accept policing by EPD which is SO MUCH WORSE. We OWN NUPD. They are completely beholden to the University and are already subject to most of the requirements other places want for policing. Namely completely separate oversight board.

"Medill will help you be a cleaner, more concise, effective writer, but for the first year and a half, it won't itch the part of you that wants to be more creative. This is by design; you'll get a chance to spread your wing as you get into the upper levels, and you'll of course be taking the majority of your classes outside of Medill, so you can definitely choose more ""creative"" classes if you'd so like.

Anecdotally, I actually think the complete opposite of the advice you've gotten (""If you know that you want to pursue journalism/be a journalist 100% then go to Northwestern""). I actually think Northwestern is the best option if you *aren't* sure, because it's so easy to transfer out to different majors or schools within the school, and you'd be damned sure you're still getting a top-notch education wherever you land. A journalism degree from Medill also has more legs than a journalism degree from most other schools.

"I was only in journalism for a year and a half as well and then I kind of just lost interest in it. The odd thing about Medill, especially considering some of the people are coming from no journalism background, is they kind of just expect you to be a journalist right away. It's not like the high school newspaper where you just talk to people you know and a couple of teachers and then you have your article. They expect you to be traveling about and interviewing real people and developing high-quality multimedia skills right away. Often times, those people have absolutely zero interest in someone contacting them about ""this project for class"". This can take over your life at times, which is good if you are into that kind of thing, not fun if you like your school work to be fairly predictable. There is very little learning curve, and as you mentioned, very little instruction on how to actually do those things. The classes that are less field-based tend to be full of nonsense. The flip side of this is that the requirements for Medill classes are very loose, which makes it very easy to double major if you want to. 

I can't speak to anything with the school papers as I never got involved with them.",1617982196,2,0
"Imo, you shouldn't be 100% committed to medill unless you are 100% committed to journalism (which it sounds like you aren't), but even if you aren't, that doesn't necessarily foreclose on the possibility that you might still prefer NU for some other reason.

I was in medill for a yr, and I think most medill students would agree with me when I say that medill doesn't help you *get better* at the job of a journalist, it just helps you *get* the job of a journalist - i.e. medill classes don't rly teach you much and the real benefits of medill are just in networking and career advancement opportunities. And if you have the stomach to let your entire college selection process ride on those sorta terms for reasons other then necessity (and if it is out of necessity then you definitely shudn't be majoring in journalism and probably shudn't be wasting money on NU at all), then more power to you I guess.

And even if you are interested in journalism, imo (in my very unqualified opinion) journalism school really is not the be all end all of well positioning yourself in the industry. Many, many journalists do not go to journalism school. We had so many guest speakers come in who were like ""oh yeah I got my undergrad in econ and my masters in public health administration and now I report on the healthcare industry and the fda."" Personally I would kinda think that rather then focus your undergrad on journalism, it'd be better to just like get rly smart and knowledgeable about the shit u'd be reporting on, like major in poli sci or social policy or econ or wutevr xyz thing, and then join journalism extracurriculars outside of class but also just focus on improving your writing skills in your classes. It's true that double majoring in journalism and something else is suuper easy at NU, but what's also easily do-able would be just going to berkeley and majoring in something other then journalism there.

And on top of all of that, the last argument I'd make against medill is just that it's totally like a skill-based curriculum rather than one that'll like actually teach you information and/or how to make use of that information. Like I feel like medill most of all just teaches you (if it teaches anything) like how to read/write/communicate clearly/effectively/concisely. While that all is definitely a good skill to have, it is also a skill that you a. can develop without explicitly focusing your studies on a journalism curriculum, and b. wud have needed to continue to develop anyway (and will continue to develop) during your professional life no matter wut field u end up in and no matter how good you get at it during ur undergrad.

So like overall, I guess i'd argue that the idea of majoring in something more specialized like journalism is that it gives you a like, vertical boost within the professional field of journalism at the cost of a sorta, stronger horizontal de-buff to everything else. Personally I'm kinda skeptical that vertical boost is really worth the cost, esp since it doesn't seem like the only possible way to obtain it, or at least parts of it, is by going to NU and majoring in medill.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay but that all being said, there might be other reasons why you'd like NU, so yeah, it's still worth looking into probably. Like I said, I was in Medill for year (actually probably my second largest regret in life) bc long story short at the end of my sr yr of hs I got really into the idea that i was gonna be journalist for some reason. I strongly veered away from journalism, but like now I've pivoted to being computer science and also international studies major so yeah the quarter system really lets you reinvent yourself even if you waste 5 classes fr yr thinking ur gonna be a journalism+econ double major.

Honestly, I've never been like super hot on NU, but lots of ppl do like NU a lot so maybe u would too idk. I really, really did not enjoy the atmosphere in student publications \*at all\*, but everybody else there seemed to be having a good time soooooo... Honestly pretty much the only good thing I can say about my experience at NU is that I really like the CS professors I've had here (and a few of my other profs), but other than that nothing rly likes... jumps to the forefront of my mind.

I don't bring this up to suggest that you'll be like me and not like NU (and I'm definitely in the minority when it comes to really regretting coming here), but rather just to further affirm that, as I think you were already aware of, it's totally possible to like NU and/or to be happier at another school despite NU being a Good School ^(TM). I also feel like, although I'm like the opposite of knowledgeable on different colleges, that if you feel interested in the vibe of uc berkeley then u rly wud not enjoy NU's very pre-professional, kinda uptight (imo, at least south campus) sorta vibe.

Finally, just like it's definitely good that you're thinking about this carefully instead of just being like ""nu ranked higher - auto-commit activate."" Nowadays I always tell high schoolers ""Choosing which college to go to isn't as difficult as getting in, but it is just as important."" Like I said I have no knowledge on different colleges and that's because I had never rly thought much about college and then once I got my good score on the ACT was like ""oh cool so I can just go pretty much wherever I want now,"" but then never like...actually thought about where I wanted to go...and then 2 months before ED applications were due when I was just like near Evanston (cuz I live around here) I was like ""well this one seems like a Good School ^(TM) and it's close and the buildings seem nice so I guess I'll just go w this one.""",1617980438,1,0

A group called NU World Cup puts on a yearly indoor futsal tournament in the winter and a yearly small sided outdoor tournament in the spring. Both are super fun and highly recommended. When the weather is nice, it's pretty easy to find pick up games on the lakefront.

Wind is not my favorite either... and weather wasn't really one of my factors I thought about but Chicago and that area has strong winds.

If you have any tips on the following it would be useful for me when I move:

1) how cold is it in winter on average, the high, and the low? I visited in mid March and the weather wasn't the best but I thought it was ok. I like the cooler side anyways.

2) what do you wear or recommend you NEED? Gloves? Layered or insulated pants? Scarves? Winter coat? Or would it be worthwhile to have some earmuffs/masks?

3) can you bike/skateboard/scooter in winter or still play any outdoor sports? Here many people go skiing in winter. What do people do there outdoors/indoors in winter if anything? I know there aren't mountains... 

4) what are seasonal activities people do in Evanston and Chicago? In MD people may go to the beach and swim in summer, hike in fall or spring, ski or snowboard winters.

5) You mention it is sleepier but when I visited it seemed like a cute suburb that was more urban-like. Do you get sick of the area or usually go out of the area to other nearby cities or parks?

6) what are the safest (nearby, walkable) locations to live? Or honestly, best for grad students? Could you give me a brief run down? I think the train is too loud so are there areas where you aren't near the train? Usually do you know anyone who has a pet or if there are cat/pet friendly places (I don't have a pet but I am contemplating on adopting a cat).

7) best shops? Best grocery stores? Restaurants? Are there multicultural grocery stores? 

8) typical price range of apts, groceries (like how much you buy on average), gas/car/parking (if you know)?

"Every course I had transferred as something, at least general credit. As a CS major, things didn’t map 1-1 very well, so two of the classes I took at my old school are kinda worthless. Which means I have to take 2 classes per quarter to graduate in CS. 
Transferring credit will be different depending on what school you’re in. When I transferred to Weinberg, some of the credits I had had evaluated in McCormick became valuable and I had to submit petitions to get them evaluated. It was kind of a hassle. 
Also, the unfortunate thing is that most of my first year classes were worthless honestly. My Korean classes transferred, one social science class transferred, my two math classes transferred, and a CS course transferred. But 2 CS courses didn’t transfer and both writing classes I took count for nothing, because my old school counted writing as a distribution requirement and NU doesn’t.

I had to take an extra quarter because of bum input my advisor gave me about my transfer report...)

Not of that is to dissuade you from NU, of course; it's my understanding that dealing with transfer credits is a major pain at any institution, and your time may be easier than mine was going quarter system-to-quarter system (the semester-quarter transition + a very specialized double major accounted for most of the issues I hit).

"I did MENU in McCormick (the 290 sequence), and I'd say its only worth it if you are considering becoming a math major like I was (and even then, I'd say just take math 300). Otherwise, it is just a brutal amount of work on top of your already demanding course load. You will be able to replace your calculus sequence with Menu with a petition, but all other classes (i.e. EA) you will still need to take. 

The 291 sequence, which is more heavily proofs based and less about calculations, is even more punishing. I had a friend who was doing undergrad math in high school and said he spent over 20 hours a week on the 291 sequence. 

So for an engineer, unless you are the next Gauss (in which case, why are you doing engineering?) then I would encourage to reconsider MENU.

If you want to do MENU math and CS, I would highly consider switching to Weinberg and doing it there. If you are interested in proofs but not sure if you want to commit to Math/Weinberg yet, take Math 300.",1621198045,2,0

&amp;#x200B;

""It is possible for students in McCormick to take MATH 290 or MATH 291.  You \*must\* take EA1 (or honors EA1).  Here are three possible options:  
  
1.  Complete EA1 in Fall, then take MATH 290-2,3 in Winter and Spring.  
\- There are a few topics covered in MATH 290-1 that you will not have seen in EA1, and you would need to study those on your own to make sure that you are ready for MATH 290-2.  
  
2.  Complete EA1 and MATH 290-1 in Fall, then take MATH 290-2,3 in Winter and Spring.  
\- Here there would be no self-studying, but you would not earn credit for MATH 290-1.  This would prepare you better for MATH 290-2 than the first option, but it would also burn a course.  
  
3.  Complete EA1 and MATH 291-1 in Fall, then take MATH 291-2,3 in Winter and Spring.  
\- MATH 291 trains you to write mathematical proofs.  If you are interested in MATH 291, then this is the option you should choose.  It is not possible to take MATH 291-2 without first completing MATH 291-1.

This means if you were a performance student, you would fulfill all your music requirements as a performance major, and only take the classes required for the Weinberg major.

At a deeper level, it’s my opinion that it’s worth trying. Sounds like you have plans to go to grad school but do you want to go right after college? Do you want to get work experience in-between? An internship might be more useful to you, especially if you haven’t worked in a traditional role (or whatever that looks like for your field) because it might tell you more about what you like or dislike. Lab experience can’t hurt you, but as you say, you’re already heavily involved, so you’re likely to gain more new knowledge in an internship. It also never hurts to diversify your resume with new, strong opportunities.

He didn’t really show any interest in teaching orgo, his slides were usually just screenshots of textbook pages and he tends to just plow through the content. He was also pretty rude (even in office hours, where he is supposedly nicer) and wasn’t that transparent about the class. The instruction in his section was supposed to be the same as it was in Kalow’s section so the exams were the same, but he had a tendency to focus on what he thought was important instead of what was tested. Because of this, our exam averages were always 5-10 points lower than they were in Kalow’s section, but the curve was the same, so the final grades in Nelson’s section were much lower (I was around 10 points above average on each exam, but came out with a B). Maybe my expectations were set high by Dichtel, who was fantastic, but Nelson doesn’t do much to make orgo more bearable.",1616997422,1,0

"I wish I could upvote this a gazillion times!!!

DSSL2 has its quirks, but what languages don't? 

Plus, just having an instruction language dedicated to CS 214 has made things a lot more educational for me and a lot of other students. I'm sure some people were frustrated at first, but looking back, CS 214 has taught me to pick up a new language and how to implement data structures from scratch - something I'm very proud of!

In other words, thank you for your work!",1616965964,1,0
"Omg don't get me wrong though, I'm with u/dabberoni1234 \- I hope that didn't come off too harshly! Honestly, the big thing I like about dssl2 is just that you made it lol. In a world where too many profs act as if they're like, allergic to helping students learn, it makes me suuuuper glad to see a prof go so far as to create their own language just for the purposes of instruction. Plus, just given that I feel like most CS classes are in large part about learning how to create/design things, seeing the prof integrate something of their own creation into the course adds like flavor and atmosphere lol.

I feel like I'm having trouble putting this into words, but it kinda pains me to see you apologizing for that I guess because 1. it isn't that big of an issue (w programming assignments that basic, vague error statements can mostly be overcome by just thinking harder about how your program works and being more scientific in your bugfixing processes, which isn't exactly the end of the world given that we're all students) and 2. I can tell you put a ton of work into creating DSSL2, which I (and I think most other students) still greatly appreciate even if it has some kinks in it. I guess it just feels unjustly ironic that the profs who put the most effort into teaching are the ones apologizing for inconveniencing students. Yeah I guess basically I'm just trying really hard to not outright say that you put in more work than other profs I have had at NU because I know that would be inappropriate, so if anybody asks, that's not what I'm saying. 

Honestly, the note you posted on campuswire at the end of the quarter made me sad when you were like ""I know this was a difficult quarter, I apologize if I've done anything to make it harder,"" bc from my perspective at least, you did like, the opposite of making it harder. For most of 2020, I was pretty dead-set on transferring out of NU. My time on campus went really, really poorly for me - like REALLY poorly. Switching from journalism to CS at the start of this year was a pretty profound change, but, as I expected and hoped, it's been pretty good so far. Point of this all being, I feel like you to some extent were validation for me ultimately deciding against transferring. Interacting with you during office hours was like pretty much the most I've ever felt like I really had a place or hope for a future at NU, if not just the only time I've felt that way at all lol. 

So, yeah. I hope I didn't make you uncomfortable by gushing too much, but yeah that's how I feel so yeah I guess.",1616963041,1,0

"Not sure if you're in Weinberg/McCormick but one program that McCormick students can take is the [Farley NUVention course](https://www.farley.northwestern.edu/programs-and-support/nuvention/medical.html). Typically undergrad students are paired up with business students in Kellogg and med students in Feinberg to identify problems and develop new medical devices to solve it. The program also involves shadowing medical faculty at Feinberg so that may be more in depth than your typical shadowing (but I left pre-med years ago so I'm not completely sure). There's no commitment to the program after it ends but there have been a few startups that have gone on to continue and raise funding.

Obviously if you're not an engineering student it may be somewhat harder to get in to the program, but it wouldn't hurt to email Farley and ask. I'm sure there are some Weinberg/ non-McCormick students with prior experience/skills in things like programming/hardware engineering/3D printing prototyping, etc that NUVention looks for.

NUVention therapeutics has also been a program in the past that's been open to all schools but I'm not sure if it also involves shadowing Feinberg faculty or if it's open next year.

Other than that, I'd guess another alternative is doing research with a Feinberg medical faculty who is also an MD or practicing clinician and then asking them later if you can shadow with them. I know there's a decent amount of Feinberg MD's who operate as wet lab PIs but I'm not sure if there are any researching physicians who solely do clinical research like psychiatrists.",1616961049,1,0

Someone told me just to trust the process and that I’d get in off the waitlist if I really wanted it, and it worked out, at least for me.

You can still apply for SIGP and the McCormick Summer Research Awards. (The latter only if you are in McCormick.) But the deadlines for both are literally days away. SIGP does not require that you know who you are working with when you apply.,1616945421,1,0
"Okay so somewhat different type of answer. As someone who doesn't drink, I don't really mind the lack of night life, and I kinda like studying (as in I don't think I study enough), so those are things I don't really mind. I kinda have a lot of qualms with just how the campus is set up.

Once you get on campus, you'll realize just how much of the shoreline potential is squandered. Of the common buildings that every student can access and just chill in, there are like 2 that give you a good view of the lake: Norris and Mudd Library (which is not really a library, it's just a small-ish study space with like more tables than books). What are the other buildings along the shore? There's like a frickn utility building lmao, a bunch of sports fields, Kellogg, Bienen, etc. These buildings are all school specific and aren't really designed to have study spaces for everyone. Like I actually don't think the Main Library is THAT bad, but how tf did you manage to mess it up so bad that there are like 5 seats in the entire thing that look out on the lake???? I'm exaggerating but it's low-key kinda ridiculous. It's literally like trying to throw a ball into the ocean and missing. Northwestern just kinda sucks at using space. Is old Kellogg being used yet?? We're like years out since that place has stopped being used and I still don't know if anything goes on in there lol. Also some of the dorms could use upgrades lol.

This is also a small one but practice rooms aren't open to the general student body. Kinda really annoying. I lived in PLEX and there was one shabby piano in the basement that barely worked.",1616943428,1,0
