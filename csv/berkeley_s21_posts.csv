Semester just started and I am already so tired and overwhelmed,"Literally only taking the bare minimum of units required to be a full-time student but I already feel burnt. I was excited for the semester to start and felt really motivated but now im just a mix of kinda panicking and freaking out but also extremely despondent and essentially dead inside.

I'm also feeling a bit lonely despite being with my family everyday, but being with them feels kind of suffocating even though I love them. Just kinda hurts when they belittle me as a joke when they have nothing else to talk about and I'm with them all the time. Most of my friends have drifted away once college started and im way too camera-shy to make new friends. Plus, I feel really intimidated by everyone here üëÄ

Did poorly on a quiz for one of my classes yesterday and now im at a really low B. I know I have the rest of the semester to bring it up and it's literally just the first quiz, but man it would be great if it wasn't dangerously close to a C.

Sorry for making another rant post. I know this subreddit has a lot of them but I just want to know if anyone else can relate. I would also appreciate some tips on studying since I'm a freshman. I went to a somewhat ghetto school but was a sort of mediocre student. Now that Im at berkeley, the culture here is a bit of a shock for me. Some of the students here treat an A- like a death sentence or something.

I hope that most of my struggle is just due to the effects of the pandemic and maybe it'll get better once in-person classes start :(",1611657658,1,0
Fulfilling R&amp;C Requirement at a community college?,"I enrolled in a ENGLISH R1A course this semester and find very time consuming and quite difficult.

English is one of my weakest subjects, so I want to get the R&amp;C requirements (both courses) done ASAP. Is there any ways I can do it more cheaply and less time-consuming at a CC?

I CANNOT bring myself to care or do anything and withdrawal is NOT an option.

I could do a reduced course load, but my parents would probably give me hell about it. I had to go behind their backs to get DSP for assignment extensions and quiz extensions.

My parents do NOT care about mental health and DO NOT see the importance of internships, though they have always judged people by their career and salary and so reasoning with them is a lost cause.",1611655334,1,0

I have always been socially anxious and awkward and bad at interviews and I've tried really hard to get better through mocks with friends and the career center. 

I'm now at a point where I can give an okay answer even under pressure, but a career counselor told me today that I still need to work on confidence and passion when it seems like all the Haas snakes are just born with charisma and confidence. 

I've contemplated suicide over this too. I've always felt inferior to other people in many aspects since I was in middle school or early high school and Berkeley has worsened it.

This is a throwaway because the home boys know my actual Reddit account.

I joined a project earlier last year and it's been completely tits up for the greater part of a month now. From scheduling meetings during break and on weekends, there's been zero considerations as to how we as members feel. This doesn't include the (to be frank) ""work first"" environment where we only meet to plan tasks, throwing aside actual community bonding in a god damn pandemic and functioning as tools at will. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke to my ""manager"" and solicited feedback from my team regarding this, as all conflicts should be handled, but his behavior has spoken for itself. He has only become more of an asshole and you know what, I'm tired of dealing with this bullshit because I know my self worth.

How do Grad Schools consider Major-related courses which are PNP-only (Seminar and AI work),"Hi, y'all. Hope you are having a great day! I'm an intended CS freshman who has a (maybe dumb) question regarding how grad schools look at the major-related courses that are offered on only a PNP basis (seminar, group study, field study, etc.) as the title says.

This semester, thankfully, I've been accepted as an AI for both Data 8 and CS 61A. Since I'm interested in teaching and also really enjoyed both courses last semester, I'm planning to accept both positions. The one thing I'm worried about, however, is how grad school will consider PNP-only courses. Basically, AI's should enroll in 1-unit CS/DS197 field study course which is offered on a pnp-basis. Also, as a part of the CS scholars program, I'm also participating in on 2-unit cs scholars group study for 61B which is also PNP-based. I'm also taking another STEM seminar, a 2-unit pnp one.

Considering that I'm likely PNP my R&amp;C Part B (I'm not a strong writer lol), 10 out of 19 units-- 2 AI units + 2 CS Scholars seminar + 2 STEM seminar + 4 R&amp;C--I'm taking this semester would be PNP even though I''m not planning to PNP any of major-related courses. Also, 6 out of those 10 units will be the ones related to my major (AI, CS, and STEM seminar).

I'm planning to apply for grad school. I heard that PNP-ing too many courses (especially major-related ones) are considered a bad sign. Would it be ok to have more than half of my current units as PNP like the above? Are there anyways grad schools can find whether the course I took has both GRD and PNP options or is only offered on PNP-basis.

Thank you! Any help would be greatly appreciated :)",1611614520,1,0

I am also taking mcb 38 (stem cell biology, ethics, and societal impact) and ph 116 (Social, Ethical, and Political Issues in Public Health). 

I want to drop either ph116 or mcb 38. 

* mcb 38 is pretty science-heavy considering I am also taking chem and bio. Average grade on berkeleytime is A- though, and the content is interesting to me. This class does nothing for me in terms of breadths or major stuff etc. More of a filler interest class. It already seems intense in terms of content, but not much workload like hw and all that. 
* Ph116 is a p/f 3 unit seminar. Thinking of applying for PH major (only a frosh rn btw) and this class would help me decide, also it would even count as upper div electives. 

I am thinking about pre-med and idk if my schedule may be looked down upon if i took ph116 which is a 3 un p/f class. Bio and Chem are already pretty intense, and ph116 would be a nice balance. Just nervous about my schedule looking easy or something lol. Also would this kinda mess up my gpa if i don't do well in chem, chem lab and bio or something as those would be my only graded classes?

seriously? what's the point of these questions on club apps?,"maybe i'm crazy, but i was looking through some of the club apps and i feel like some of the information they want is so invasive. like forcing people to submit their sat score and the high school they went to???? what's the point of that? it's like they're using your past against you. isn't the point of coming to berkeley and college the fact that it's a fresh start, where you're no longer confined by numbers and actions in high school but instead you have an opportunity to pursue new things? how can college students feel so self-important that they feel the need to judge people based on a stupid number on a stupid exam and a fucking trait they couldn't control like where they grew up and their socioeconomic status? call me ""sensitive"", but it's honestly disgusting to me. you'd think people who were ""smart"" enough to get internships at Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan have the brain to understand social reproduction and the opportunity gap.

furthermore, i don't understand why you have to submit your transcript to them. even research positions like urap (at least all the ones I applied to) didn't ask me for my transcript, and these are legitimate, qualified professors who know what they're doing and are making an actual impact.

i honestly feel like ASUC or whoever is in charge of clubs should do something about how these clubs handle their recruitment process. even most industry jobs don't ask people for their transcript, so why does a college junior or senior feel the need to ask other people for their transcript? what's with all this gatekeeping?",1611540200,1,0

Don't get COVID guys (yet another foothill nightmare story),"I'm a first year at the dorms and on 1/28 I was notified by one of my peers that they were COVID positive. This was before they only selected ""high risk"" students to isolate, so they called everyone on the floor and told us that we'd have to move to foothill and stuff‚Äîsome ppl decided to just go home, which I may not endorse but I'm not here to debate that. 

We move to Foothill and we were told upon arrival that, should we be asymptomatic and test negative, we'd be out in 10 days. We've all tested negative and have had no symptoms, so we'd be clear, correct? Not so much. After we were put here, the surge happened and the uni decided to change the policy to 14 days for everyone. Part of me figured that's because they're only having high-risk individual quarantine here. But the policy also appears to apply for us. Ironically, had my floor been notified after foothill ran out of space, we probably would've gotten out of this quicker, and I wouldn't have to be living in this vanilla ass psych ward (sorry to anyone who likes Foothill, it's close to the trees but it's not close enough for me to actually appreciate them). 

I'm sorry for complaining. It's simply frustrating to see posts about people partying and authorities doing little while me and other people at foothill have to bear the burden of their willful ignorance. Not to mention, the person who had the virus was cleared to exit TODAY, which amounts to about 10 days of isolation, likely because they were allowed to isolate outside of foothill. We do not have that privilege, so we will be expected to leave the 12th, 15 days after exposure on the 28th. We've tried calling UHS but they've said the 12th. I suppose we'll tomorrow or after the next test, the FOURTH FOR ME ü§Ø. I also have to get all the receipts for reimbursement.... 

My floor seemed to be exceptionally unlucky‚Äîearly enough to be all sent to foothill, late enough that we'll have to spend 2 full weeks in this prison.  It's a complete pain in the arse, but I will do my best to be positive (NOT COVID POSITIVE lol) through these last five days, and I at least have 4 of my floor mates to struggle with. I am here to simply tell r/berkeley  for the 6.022E23th time: don't get COVID at the dorms üò∑.  Based on how UHS currently runs, the larger weight of the punishment is given to the rest of the floor.

Seems like no summer 16B? Need some schedule advice,"Hi guys!

I'm currently a second-semester freshman planning on declaring computer science. Last semester I took 61A and Data8 and I'm currently enrolled in 61B and 16A.

I was planning on taking 16B over the summer and then 70 in the fall however, it doesn't seem like it's being offered this summer. 

*Note: I'm not the best math student and, based on what I've seen, I'm nervous about getting a good grade in CS70* 

This leaves me with a few scheduling options:

**Option A**: EE16B in the fall, CS70 in the spring

|Summer|Fall|Spring|
|:-|:-|:-|
|AC class|EE16B|CS70|
||61C?|Breadths, easier workload|

**Pros**:

* More prepared to do well in 70
* Take 16A and 16B back to back

**Cons**:

* Declare later, no upper divs sophomore year

**Option B**: CS70 and EE16B in the fall

|Summer|Fall|Spring|
|:-|:-|:-|
|AC Class|CS70|61C|
||EE16B|Upper Div|

**Pros**:

* (Hopefully declare) earlier and get to take an upper div in the spring

**Cons**:

* Extremely overlapping, mathy workload ‚Äì¬†convoluting problem sets, etc
* Won't be able to prioritize CS70 as much

&amp;#x200B;

**Option C**: CS 70 in the fall, EE16B in the spring

|Summer|Fall|Spring|
|:-|:-|:-|
|AC class|CS70|EE16B|
||Breadths, easier workload|61C? or upper div?|

**Pros**: 

* Declare quicker

**Cons**:

* Lose out on more ""mathematical maturity""
* Have a semester gap between 16A and 16B

&amp;#x200B;

**Option D**: CS70 in the summer, EE16B in the fall

|Summer|Fall|Spring|
|:-|:-|:-|
|CS70|EE16B|Upper div|
||61C?|Upper div|

Pros:

* (Hopefully declare) earlier and take upper divs in spring

Cons:

* Pace will be extremely hard
* Won't be nearly as prepared to get a good grade

Should I be concerned about unintentionally (potentially) having cheated?,"I took a quiz. The policy was ""no other browsers open while taking the quiz.""

I was taking the quiz in Chrome, but had Edge open, accidentally. I didn't even realize it was still open, and I NEVER looked at Edge while taking the quiz. 

I only had Reddit and an html file of my homework open in Edge anyway. We're allowed to look at our homework during the quiz, and I did not use Reddit to ask for help or look at posts related to the quiz subject.

The only thing I did was navigate away from the quiz to look at Piazza (not even the other posts about class content, just clarifications on the academic honesty policy on Piazza) and other course materials, which the instructor and GSI's said was ok to look at. Anything that's course material is ok, we just can't use material outside of the class or talk to others while taking the quiz.

I did some research on it, and I read that Canvas only notes if you look away at the quiz and what you did afterwards with regards to answers on the quiz. It does not seem like Canvas can tell what you were doing otherwise on the computer unless the instructor has software to detect that, which I don't think they did. 

I didn't look at anything I wasn't supposed to but am scared I'll get flagged for cheating because I had Edge AND Chrome open. Should I be concerned about getting a cheating referral for having Edge open while taking the quiz on Chrome?

I wanted to have three ‚Äúeasier‚Äù classes so that I could focus on data 8 since i know i‚Äôm going struggle w the class a bit later in the sem. and i have heard people not doing well in the class cuz it was hard. legalst 184 has soooo much reading per week - like 100 pages and i know that‚Äôs going to be a struggleeee for me, esp if i want to focus and pay extra attention to data 8 material outside of class. and econ 1 w prof campbell is cool but i never taken an econ course before not even in hs so ik it will still require more focus and attention for me. i saw that econ 1, philos 2 and 3 is available in summer, so i‚Äôve been thinking about classes to take for the summer as well. so that is always an option too. but might take different legalst classes for that. if anyone has any suggestions on which of the 3 i should take i would rlly appreciate it since drop deadline coming up soon and i got no idea what to do:)",1612406333,1,0

Hey all, I am a sophomore at Berkeley working on Hang, essentially a Tinder for friends, groups and events in your area.

Even prior to the pandemic situation, I saw that many people were having trouble expanding their friend network after the first couple weeks of school. Now that social distancing and whatnot is set in place, it's even harder to make genuine connections with your peers.

Hang is simple: you customize your profile with your interests, and we look for users in your area who match your profile. In the app you'll be able to interact with your networks through group chats, and possibly plan events and schedule Zoom meetings.

To ensure a more fluid user experience, we are opening up the waitlist to Berkeley students at [https://hangevents.app](https://hangevents.app) ! Feel free to sign up to support a fellow Berkeley student.

"unpopular opinion: all-or-nothing attitudes about covid socialization are counter-productive, and people on this sub need to chill","I'll preface this by saying that if I had to grade my own covid behavior, I'd give myself a solid A. I haven't gone to any parties, any indoor gatherings, any restaurants/bars, etc. I've been at home for more than a year, and my only socialization in that timespan has been a couple outdoor, masked outings with 1-2 friends. I think my whole household has been pretty good about COVID.

*That said*, I realize that this is easier for me than most. I'm naturally a very introverted person. I can go months without talking to friends and be fine. I recognize that most people aren't like me. 

Which gets me to my main point: **For most people, giving up their social lives for upwards of a year is not a reasonable request. Especially when those people are in the single least vulnerable demographic for COVID.** And given the most recent Berkeley email asks people to avoid any gatherings of any size, I don't think I'm straw-manning what people at Cal and people on this sub are asking.

Nowhere in the world have people done that. Believe it or not, when all of this first went down, we did have decent compliance. Not the best in the world by any shot, but a lot of people did listen. The difference between the US and the countries that did manage to control COVID is that in that time span, those countries secured their borders, mandated quarantines for arrivals, ramped up testing rapidly, and set up contact tracing. We did none of those things. 

I think it's likely that Reddit draws in people like me, who require less socialization than most. I think there are a few things we need to keep in perspective:

1) A college campus is probably one of the least bad places to have a COVID outbreak. Because of online classes, students aren't interacting with faculty. As long as their interactions with the non-student residents of Berkeley are also minimal, and they're only infecting each other, a COVID outbreak here is probably less deadly than anywhere else.

2) We'd likely have much better luck by preaching moderation, not abstinence. Suggest caps on gathering sizes and try to stamp out frat parties. The vast majority of people won't follow overly onerous restrictions.

I actually think the abstinence analogy is a good one. Kids who get pregnant / get someone pregnant in high school usually end up in that situation because they didn't use contraception; more often than not, it is their fault. But trying to stamp out sex, punishing those kids for their mistakes, etc. would never get anywhere. Changes need to be at a policy-level, not an individual level. The idea that we should expel students for breaking covid protocol is honestly laughable.

(And to pre-empt the response that COVID affects everyone while pregnancy does not: teenage pregnancy is a horrible thing for all the kids born under those circumstances. Having a stable two-parent household is one of the biggest determinants for success.)",1612376910,0,0

CS 61A Advice plzzzzzz,"Ok, so I have quite a few questions for those people who already took CS61A.

I panicked right when I opened the exam and sort of just stared blank at the screen for like 25 minutes before getting my mind together. Eventually, I didn't have time to finish the last two questions completely, which will probably put me in the 60 \~ 65% for the exam score. However, after the exam ended and I tried the two questions, I finished them in less than 20 minutes.  
With all of this said, I just had some few questions:

1. what do you suggest for preventing these panic attacks
2. realistically, is it still possible for me to get an A? (please be as brutally honest as you can, and please share your experience if your comfortable!)
3. Has anyone managed to get from a close to 50% score in the first midterm to almost 85% + in the rest of the two cs61a exams?

Testing fatigue,"One of the worst parts of this pandemic is how it forces people to take extremely valuable exams at inconvenient times. As a CS major who‚Äôs trying to declare it sucks to have to take exams at 8pm. This isn‚Äôt a quest to downplay the efforts put in by teachers and GSIs, they‚Äôre in a tough spot and trying to balance things.
it‚Äôs simply my honest thoughts about how unfair late testing is. Anyone who codes understands how much easier it is to code with a fresh mind. And this quality is super valuable. When reflecting on the mistakes I made in my CS61b midterm, 80% of them were not caused by me not KNOWING how to do the problems, rather it was fatigue. As someone who had classes and discussions and started a major declaring midterm with a brain that had been used for 10 hours, I clearly did not do as good as I could‚Äôve. If I took that cs61b midterm a few hours earlier I guarantee my score would‚Äôve been higher. My brain was just used up, it was tired and I was tired. It wasn‚Äôt caused by my negligence, it was caused by this fucking pandemic making me take tests that literally decide my future in extremely inconvenient circumstances. The 61 series classes are already much easier for experienced programmers, and it seems like every other kid in the fucking class has Covid experience. Seeing the grade distribution and where I lie compared to others makes me feel like an idiot who sucks at coding, when in reality if I were put in a statistic with kids who didn‚Äôt know how to code before college like me I‚Äôd probably be in the upper tier. That being said coding experience also means the students are less inclined to be fatigued from the same amounts of work. But that‚Äôs besides the point, this isn‚Äôt meant to be a rant about kids who knew how to code, it‚Äôs about how the pandemic has made it extremely hard for people like me with no coding experience prior to go into college expecting to come out with a CS degree.",1613846910,1,0

Kind of a vent post but I'd appreciate any advice (housing/roommates).,"I'm an incoming 3rd year student for fall 2021. Before COVID-19, when I was a freshman, my housemates and I were certain that we're going to live off-campus together as sophomores. It's been a year and it seems like our plan won't work anymore; we're all international/out-of-state students and two of them are taking a gap next fall, whereas the other one might house with another friend group.

We had a plan for the longest time and now that it's gone, I'm not sure what to do. I should be figuring out my next step on finding housing, but right now I'm just really sad and lost. I want to go back to Berkeley next fall, but I haven't made a lot of friends while the year was online.

1. Watch all the lectures. Watch them on 1.5x, 2x, etc speed if you‚Äôre on a time crunch. Take note of: 1) anything prof has a personal story/connection to. 2) anything prof mentions twice. 3) anything prof mentions 3 times (even over the span of a few lectures) fucking star, highlight, underline that shit.

2.  Skim the readings.  Take note of main headings, read just the abstract/intro and conclusion. This will let you know what the main points are. And when you need more specific info you‚Äôll at least know where to look instead of being completely lost.

3. Look over all posted assignments. This will let you know what material you‚Äôre expected to know by now. What‚Äôs on the assignment will be on the test. Fuck everything else.

Declaring a double major in CS,"Hello everyone! I was recently admitted to Berkeley for fall 2021 and I‚Äôm so excited! I‚Äôm interested in studying synthetic biology in grad school, so I‚Äôm looking to study bioengineering and CS in undergrad. My preference is a double major, but I‚Äôm also considering making CS a minor. Because bioengineering was the one subject I was sure I wanted to major in (and because I consider CS auxiliary to my interest in bioengineering), I applied as a bioengineering major. But, the more I hear about Berkeley CS, the more I wish I applied as a CS major because it seems so hard for students to get into the major once at Berkeley. I‚Äôve heard transfer is nearly impossible. Is it easier when you‚Äôre declaring a double major? When can I declare? I expressed my intention in my application and was admitted, so I‚Äôm clinging to the hope that the AO knew it was a common/possible occurrence. But, I figured I‚Äôd ask people who actually know!

Feasibility of a finance pathway as a declared Math major?,"CONTEXT:

I got accepted for 25' into L&amp;S. I've been to Berkeley a couple times amd in campus once, but I swear my mind has been there for like 5 years (I feel so special to be able to attend your school :])

INTRO AND REASONS:

So, I've always loved math. Hence, I declared a math major in my UC app. However, I want to prepare myself for a the labor fields which I could be exposed to. I am especially interested in finance, since many of my close friends are really into trading, investing and hedging, and I find it awfully interested to. Right now (and I am more than aware this is likely to change) the career I'm aiming for is quantitative finance.

I also love getting involved in school affairs. It feels amazing when I feel like I am part of what makes my school a great one, and having been head of finance for my highschool's student association, I aspire to get involved with the ASUC CFO Office, headed by the CFO of course. 

QUESTIONS REGARDING ASUC:

I've read the bylaws regarding the duties and election of the CFO, and I got the idea that they get appointed for their merits within the ASUC CFO Office. I read Chief David Wang's brief intro on the ASUC website, so (question number 1) would involvement in business and entrepreneurship clubs be enough to prepare me for work within the ASUC CFO Office? (question number 2) If not, then what would make me stand out when applying for, say, an internship in the CFO Office?And finally (question number 3), assuming I'll learn a lot in the CFO Office, will it be ""useful"" (at least loosely related) to the field of quantitative finance? 

I did notice im the bylaws that the CFO is responsible for overseeing investments, which is the closest thing I found to that area of study.

I'm not saying I aspire to become CFO one day, as that would be very presumptuous, but I certainly want to get involved in something finance related and in ASUC. Having said that (question number 4), when is the optimum time to get involved with ASUC in order to maximize the amount of things I learn and the impact I can have in the organization? And if the answer is ""ASAP"", then should I prepare my cover letter, CV and LinkedIn right now so I can waltz down to the ASUC office and apply as soon as classes start? 

And finally, is there anything else I can do to prepare myself for such a position? 

QUESTIONS REGARDING MY MAJOR:

As I said, I am a declared Math major. These questions are simpler.

(1) Is there any program that is a better fit for the field of quantitative finance, considering how much I love math (to the point where I was seriously considering going into academia for pure mathematics)? 

(2) What is the process of changing majors, or where can I find information about it?

(3) How does the credit system work for classes (don't judge me lol, I'm seriously lost here)?

(4) Is it feasible to, say, get a bachelor's in math and a master's in finance? 

(4.1) If so, how would it work with the ""credit system"", would I have so many overlapping classws that I'd only need to study one more year or are the required classes completely non-overlapping? 

(4.2) Am I underestimating the field of finance (even if I only need enough knowledge to become a quant?

THANKS LOL:

Thank you so much, and feel free to correct me on any false assumptions I made. I only know this info from online research, but I'd love to know more about the inner workings at Cal :)",1617057647,1,0

Can someone help me with my appeal to UCB for bioengineering?,"Hi! I got rejected from UCB for bioengineering and I really want to go to Cal.

I didn't have any outstanding ECs like winning any competitions or anything but I explained myself by saying  I have 3 younger siblings to take care of with two working parents that are away from home 80% of the time.so I was pretty limited to what I could do. I had to drop some activities as my responsibilities increased. In my appeal I was going to talk about this 3-month mentorship program I did with 2 OBGYN from Cedars Sinai (hospital in Socal) and my increased familial responsibilities that now include taking care of my 98-year-old great aunt because we can not find a caretaker for her during the pandemic.

L&amp;S &gt; CNR for an incoming freshman,"Hey guys!

I was just accepted to UC Berkeley, which has been my dream school my whole life! Totally over the moon. So, I just had a quick question and was wondering if anyone could give any advice or has had a similar experience and could help me navigate.

I was accepted into the College of Letters &amp; Sciences and was planning on majoring in Environmental Economics and Policy or in Political Science. But, since I applied and have done a bit more research, I have found that I am more interested in the environmental side of policy and have decided that I want to transfer to the College of Natural Resources to major in Society &amp; Environment.

Does anyone know how feasible/doable it is to switch from L&amp;S over to CNR? Is there anything I should know before I attempt to transfer? Have any of you guys done this?

Please let me know! Appreciate it :)

"Missing Deadlines :&gt; Can anyone relate? Also, 61C makes me sad.","I recently found out one of my 61C projects never went through on Gradescope. I committed and pushed to GitHub on time. There's a timestamp along with my code on GitHub which serves as evidence that I finished the assignment before the deadline. However, Gradescope must have crashed or my wifi went out, it just never got submitted?? Between a few psets, 3 midterms, and another project due, I didn't check Gradescope to see if it went through properly and went on to study for my other classes. It took me until Spring Break to have the time to notice what had happened.  Because it never got submitted on Gradescope, the head TA is disregarding my code on GitHub and giving me a 0. Has anyone else experienced something like this or had a different outcome? How do other classes handle missing major assignments and deadlines or even midterms or finals? I would like to hear other experiences and feel less sad about this.",1617043517,1,0
Financial Aid Appeal,"Hi everyone!

I was recently admitted to Berkeley and will most likely attend. I was wondering if anybody had gone through the financial aid appeal process and if they could share any insights into the process. My family's income went down around $40,000 from what's on my FAFSA since my dad is an electrician and he was out of work for a good part of the year due to COVID. In the required documentation for appeals though, it asks for a letter of termination from an employer, which I cannot provide since he was not terminated and is self-employed. 

Obviously I plan on contacting the financial aid office but just wanted to see if anyone here could provide me with their experience. Thank you!",1617041739,1,0

what is the point in forcing us to go to class if we can learn the entire weeks content in an hour through recorded lectures?
if my work routine is literally better than the one you are forcing us into and im able to do well on assignments and tests, why should I not pass the class?

Transfer EECS question,"I am ccc student and a prospective transfer EECS student for fall 2021. I had a GPA of 3.98 until now, but in one of my physics class I have received a C grade in this quarter. This is because I had a ridiculous professor who couldn‚Äôt teach or explain any concepts properly and graded rudely on the exams. She would take off points if we didn‚Äôt use her method even if we had the correct answer using some other method. We had to learn everything asynchronously even after signing up for a synchronous class. 
This is the only C I have in my course work. I have done a lot of extracurricular activities as well. I am not sure if I should contact the admission officers to inform them about my grade before the transfer decisions are out or should I just wait for my decisions? Any advice?

Prospective CS/EECS Transfer Questions,"Hi all, I‚Äôm looking to transfer to Berkeley for CS/EECS. 

For EECS, from https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/eecs/junior-transfers, it says a fifth semester would be automatically approved if I‚Äôm missing 3 or more lower div requirements, so can I take a gap semester for an internship and effective take 3 years to graduate? 

For CS, I couldn‚Äôt find info on taking a gap semester and graduating in 3 years, from https://m.box.com/shared_item/https%3A%2F%2Fberkeley.box.com%2Fv%2Flscs-sample-transfer-afterF17, I assume we can also take 5 semesters and graduate in 3 years but I‚Äôm not sure. What are the policies?

On a side note, are there any hidden downsides from taking a gap semester?

Another question that might be more suitable for a CS subreddit: is there a big difference in job prospects between graduating in spring (May) and graduating in fall (December)?

Statistics Major Question,"Hey,

So basically I was curious about Berkeley's stats major. Ik its one of the best in the world, but honestly I feel a little intimidated. Not because of the classes, but I heard that most people in that field are international and sometimes office hours are even taught in Chinese. I just don't want to feel left out/isolated because I will be one of the only non-Chinese students. Anybody taking a stats major here that can confirm this/any advice? Also, IK how smart those other students can be, and I am not sure if I am up to that standard considering I have not learned much in online school this past year and a half.

P.S. this is not meant to be an attack on any international students. They deserve to be at Berkeley; this question was more for advice about feeling intimidated in situations like this. I don't want this to get in my head and affect my performance in class. I am very sorry if I have offended someone that was not my intention.",1616967113,1,0

Transferring to UC from CA Community College in 1 year?,"Hi r/berkeley, 

I'm stuck in a sort of particular and strange situation right now, and I'm not entirely sure what to do right now. Any sort of advice, good or bad news would help 100%! :)

So I'm currently in high school with a fair SAT score (1520) (although I know UCs don't take SAT scores anymore), with a very mediocre GPA. I aced freshman and junior year, but I had a few mishaps in sophomore year, which messed up my GPA pretty badly when compared to the competition average many people have when applying to Berkeley. My GPA will most likely end up somewhere at a 3.0-3.3 UW because my high school does not do weighted GPA. I decided to take the CHSPE last year (which is like the GED for minors) and graduate early from high school. 

Because finances are also part of the equation when applying to a college, I'm thinking of going to CC first, and then applying to transfer to a UC in one year, specifically UC Berkeley (although it'll be hard). 

I took a moderate amount of AP Classes during my sophomore-junior years, here's the list: 

AP English Language and Composition = 4

AP European History = 5

AP Statistics = 4

AP United States History = 5

AP Environmental Science = 5

AP Chemistry = 4

&amp;#x200B;

I planned to major in Political Science, which unlike Computer Science or any pre-med majors; don't have too many major pre-recs needed. After I talked to my college counselor, I have about 18-20 credits under my belt so far for the IGETC requirements. At my local CC, I can take 18 credits max per fall/spring session, and 7 credits each winter/summer session. If I start this fall (because my certificate comes out in the spring), would it be possible for me to transfer out? (assuming that I fulfilled 18 credits in the fall, 7 credits in the winter and 18 credits in the spring with great grades and great extracurriculars that relate to my major). 

&amp;#x200B;

Sincerely yours and thanks so much for any advice,

Schedule planning for CS Major and Math pathway to ML research?,"I've seen recent posts that outline the pathway going from EECS to BAIR groups, but none for the CS Major and specifically those interested in a math major/minor. 

For some personal background, I chose L&amp;S so I could pursue a math major/minor as a lot of research can be theory-heavy. I'd like to follow a proof without me needing to google K-Lipschitz every 10 minutes and to construct my own. I have decent experience in machine learning (at least for a HS student) with a first author NeurIPS Workshop publication and soon a few more at the mercy of the Ph.D. student I assist plus deadlines.

My math background is like a block of swiss cheese. I'm confident in some areas from lectures and sections pirated textbooks, but have gaps because I haven't really done a comprehensive study of any one area. At my HS I took a fairly rigorous Calc-III course using Stewart and a simple linear algebra class but likely would like to take them again even though I'm comfortable with intuition. I've dabbled with analysis and can sometimes optimize a scalar-matrix function with enough Wikipedia support.

My big ask is what would a good course schedule look like to get me doing ML research as quickly as possible with someone like Abbeel or Bin Yu?",1616964849,1,0
Berkeley Haas MBA - Scholarships/Fellowships,"Hi! Not sure if this is the best place to ask, so please point me in the right direction if that's the case.

I just got accepted to Berkeley Haas to start my MBA full-time this Fall! I'm so excited since it's my dream school. Unfortunately, I didn't get any scholarships and don't have much savings. I know I can pull out loans, but the thought is a bit unsettling since I try not to carry much debt. I'm the first in my family to go to college, so my immediate support system doesn't see much value in taking out 150k-200k in loans for an MBA, but I truly believe in the value and benefits so I want to do whatever it takes.

Does anyone have any advice? Should I contact AdComs or the Financial Aid office? Not sure if I should send an email asking if there are additional scholarships or ask to set up a phone call to discuss.

I'd greatly appreciate any guidance. Thank you.",1616962542,1,0

How do I get into Business Administration in Haas School of Business?,"Hey! I‚Äôm a senior in high school who was just accepted into Berkeley.

Now, I got accepted into Berkeley in the College of Letters and Science. After doing some research, I found out that you can‚Äôt get into Haas as a freshman applicant. So what does this mean for me?

Downward Mental Spiral. Please judge or help me.,"TL;DR: College should be easier than my high school years but I am too lazy to do it and I feel terrible because of that. I want help.

Acknowledgement: I know lots of people here have been through actual hard time, so please feel free to judge me for how little my troubles are. But I am weak and want to be heard.

Context: I am so lazy right now that I cause trouble to my classmates and think about my sins in bed often.

In my high school years, I was lucky enough to be busy with AP, college class, Japanese supplementary school, and club. They helped me push myself despite my laziness, and learn something that I appreciate and have passion in education.

Then, in 2020, I became a freshman in my dream Uni, right in the middle of the pandemic. As an introvert, taking a great course from comfort of the home was the perfect formula. In addition, I don't need to worry about my AP or my supplementary school. 

The problem is, the senioritis stuck with me. My passion in education has been declining since I became high school senior, and it didn't recover. Today I rarely do my coursework and use up my energy thinking about why I didn't do it.

I feel guilty that I've failed everyone that guided me into college, yet I can't help but be even lazier. Even worse, I am actively looking for an excuse for my laziness, such as the pandemic, quarantine, depression, not seeing friends (although I'm an introvert), or the golden parachute of transferred credit. I am scared to admit that I am failing myself, scared to acknowledge the damage I caused, and scared to work hard and stop being lazy.

So I want to know, are these experience common among us? Did anyone overcome these troubles? Or am I just being a wannabe-depressed, attention-seeking crybaby? I appreciate any comment. Thank you.",1615947660,1,0

California Senate Bill SB82 Theft Is Not Robbery,"Origional Post from: r/bayarea u/KingoftheWeirdos

 I don't use reddit often, but I made an account just to post this here seeing how there's recently been a large spike of crime in the Bay Area and around the university. I know that safety and crime has always been a concern for me when attending Berkeley so I wanted to share this with everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We need to quickly address the California Senate Bill SB82 Theft Is Not Robbery.  
&gt;  
&gt;California State Senator Nancy Skinner has introduced a bill to change existing law so that a ‚ÄúStrong Armed Robbery‚Äù committed without a deadly weapon, and without causing serious injury would no longer be charged as a felony.  
&gt;  
&gt;The text of the bill can be found here.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://sd09.senate.ca.gov/2021-legislation](https://sd09.senate.ca.gov/2021-legislation)  
&gt;  
&gt;Under the proposed changes you or someone you know can be robbed through overwhelming physical force, by threats of violence to you or someone else, by the assailant using a non-deadly weapon like pepper spray or stun gun. You can be injured during the commission of this crime but if you do not have a ‚ÄúSerious Injury‚Äù you assailant would only be charged with a misdemeanor if they do not steal property worth more than $950.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúSerious Injury‚Äù is not described in the text of the proposed law. It could be a black eye or a broken back. It would be up to the prosecuting DA, not you, to decide if you had a serious injury.  
&gt;  
&gt;Who would be the likely victims of this kind of Robbery? Anyone who would have a reduced capacity to defend themselves physically. The elderly, the physically disabled, the mentally disabled, and children.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is just a stupid proposal. It will lead to an increase in this type of robbery.  
&gt;  
&gt;It offers a high reward with little chance of meaningful punishment.  
&gt;  
&gt;I ask that you contact your state Assembly Rep and Senator and ask them to vote against SB82.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you do not know your representatives. They can be found here.

how does one do well on 162 exams?,"I fucked up on mt1 because I was super behind on lectures so just learned as much as I could from the review session (was not nearly enough..... I got -2 SD on mt1 oof. not that I expected any better)

this time around, I'm caught up on lecture and have gone through most of the weekly material (studied the lecture slides and almost done going through discussions) and I have a bunch of conceptual questions that I'm going to post and get clarification for. but I still see so many people asking questions on piazza and I don't even understand the questions that they're asking and I feel super overwhelmed and upset, I'm really scared that even after staying caught up with things I'm still going to end up really far below average. there's less content this time so maybe the questions will be harder too.

given that 18% of my entire grade is already sitting in the trash, about what scores do I need to shoot for to get a B-? I think that's the highest I can realistically hope for at this point. would -1.5 SD become a C+? my assignment scores are average, maybe slightly below (always end up unable to finish the hw completely, and it seems that most people do. I don't understand what I'm missing and I'm sad) can someone who's doing well rn or in the past give advice on how to figure out what to focus on? there's just so much content and im really worried so any advice would be amazing.",1615870666,1,0

How much notice do I legally need to give for rent in Berkeley?,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this question...but I'm currently planning a last minute move out of my current house in Berkeley. My understanding is that renters must give their landlord 30 days notice before moving out. However, my landlord, who I happen to live with, asks for 60 days ""as a courtesy"" so she can have ample time to find a good replacement. This ""policy"" of hers was mentioned in the lease we signed. However, she has also admitted that Berkeley can only enforce the 30 day policy. I really don't want to pay an additional month of rent because I naturally could not predict 2 months into the future what my plans would be, especially during the pandemic. Will it be an issue if I refuse to pay an additional month of rent on top of the 30 days? Thanks!",1615843293,1,0

Data 100 + CS UD Technical Elective + Full-time Co-Op doable?,"This upcoming fall I will be doing a full-time co-op that has a workload ranging from 40 - 60 hours per week. Usually when students do a co-op, they take their academic semester off as the co-op is a full-time position and is typically counted towards academic credit. I looked through my schedule and it seems like my workload will be insane later on if I want to graduate on time, so I was planning on taking a class or two this fall along with my co-op. 

According to L&amp;S Advising ([https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/advworkemploymentverificationforreducedcourseload\_2\_.pdf](https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/advworkemploymentverificationforreducedcourseload_2_.pdf)), students who work 30 hrs or more per week are required to take at least 6 units of classes, which means I can't just take one 4 unit class. There wasn't any additional information about students working 40+ hrs a week. 

In this case, I'm planning on taking Data 100 + Econ 136 for the fall. Some other potential course candidates I have in mind are CS 170, CS W169A. As for background, I got an A in CS 61A, B+ in Math 54, A+ in Stat 88, and expecting to get at least a B in both CS 61B and CS 70 this semester. I know it will probably not be an easy semester especially without PNP, but I wonder if any of you have had any similar experiences before and would like to share.

Choosing Between Berkeley M.E.T. (EECS + HAAS) and Caltech,"Hey guys, 

I'm trying to choose between UC Berkeley M.E.T. (a dual-degree program providing bachelor's degrees in EECS from the School of Engineering and Business Administration from HAAS) and Caltech.

Cost-wise, U of T is free and Caltech is around 10k cheaper than MET. However, right now I'm trying to evaluate the merits of each school versus another, so feel free to disregard it in your recommendations.

Some things about me: 

* I have a strong technical tilt but would eventually like to move into management roles (open to but not necessarily in a rush to do so right now, however). 
* I'm most interested in going into Machine Learning/AI, and especially those fields applied towards Medicine or Neuroscience. From what I understand, however, those fields typically require holding masters/PhD degrees to get recruited for. 
* Planning to do Masters at a minimum. Potentially might consider PhD.
* Ideally, I want to the industry as soon as possible. However, if PhD is necessary to enter ML/AI roles, I'm open to that as well. 
* Research is fairly important to me as well as from what I understand, it's essential for entering a good grad school. UCB has BAIR, which is really impressive. However, I am unsure how easy it would be to enter it. Caltech, on the other hand, is overall, a research powerhouse. That being said, I do not want to go into academia in the future.

Some pros that I currently associate with MET are:

* Guaranteed internships at Skydeck/Y-Comb Startups with 2k/month stipend.
* Great internship recruitment pipelines. The number of companies far outnumber the students. Access to FAANG seems high, which is valuable to me. Mr. Grimes seems pretty helpful thus far, and I've heard he helps a lot in recruitment.
* Top ranked Engineering (EECS is tied for 2nd in the US) + Business School (HAAS is 3rd in the US)
* Lots of AP/CC Credits Accepted. I could potentially graduate in 3 years or pursue a 4+1 master's program, coming out with 3 degrees in 5 years.

Some cons that I currently associate with MET:

* Doing research would mean pulling away from internships/industry, which MET seems to specialize in. Also unsure about the realisticness of entering BAIR.
* For companies that don't recognize the MET brand, Caltech might hold a stronger name. 
* MET alumni network is still small (the first graduating class is 2021)

Some pros of Caltech:

* Research opportunities seem to be unparalleled. I feel these will help when applying to Grad School.
* Caltech has SURF', which is a summer research program with \~85% acceptance rate. Fellows receive $6,600 for the 10-week research period.
* Caltech's brand seems to be universally recognized. Don't have the catch of only being recognized at few companies like MET.
* Caltech students are also scarcer than Berkeley in general. For companies that don't recognize MET, Caltech might stick out more than Berkeley. 
* Caltech does have a BEM (Business Economics &amp; Management), which will let me dive into the finance and quant parts from MET's Business Admin degree. Definitely not a full business administration degree but hits at parts that I'm 

Some cons of Caltech: 

* Doesn't have much of an industry focus, so venturing into that domain would be more difficult. 
* Caltech BEM isn't anywhere close to being as well recognized as HAAS.
* I'm worried I might be funneled into more academia-related roles.

Housing for Next Year,"Sorry if others have asked this question but I've been so disconnected from everything this year. How are in-person classes going to work next year, and specifically for COE if anyone has information on that? I feel like most of my engineering classes wouldn't be in person but maybe some discussions would be.  I don't know if I should or shouldn't get an apartment for next school year. I wouldn't want to spend a lot of money on rent just to have one in-person discussion section a week or something. I'm also worried about how sudden the transition from off to on campus would be because I feel like it would be harder to find housing before the spring semester starts so I'd rather start looking for housing before the fall. I also don't really know anyone from Berkeley, so I'd probably live with random students. Even if they seem cool during calls, I still wouldn't know them so what if things don't work out well. Money isn't too much of a concern, but I would rather not spend that money if possible. 

Sorry if this seemed more like rambling but this is something that's been making me feel anxious lately because I haven't received any on-campus housing offers and not having a place to sleep is probably one of the worst situations I could be in. I also don't mind living with my parents and I don't think I'd have any opportunities to meet new people now, so I wouldn't want to spend money living in Berkeley if it's not worth it. Thanks for any information/suggestions y'all!",1619128907,1,0

Nick Weaver on UCOP's Data Breach Notifications,"Copied from the CS161 Piazza:

~~Since UCOP decided to be effectively negligent and just say ""whoops, we spilled your data"", I had to go and check for myself what data was ACTUALLY lost. In particular I don't worry about the social security #, the one that is worrisome is things like bank account info etc.
 
So I downloaded the data, pegged my 12 core desktop to OCR all the PDFs, bulk converted some stata files, and built a pipeline to search. There are some limitations: I don't search graphics files, there may be some file conversion errors that result in some files not being searched (mass OCR, mass-convert XLS with going ""eh, errors, so frakin what""), and of course I'm only able to search the data that was actually released.
 
If you want me to do the search for you, fill out this form:~~
 

I have been informed that I can not offer this service, and that you should blame the UCOP for not doing this themselves since there is clear demand.
I am not allowed per policy to use a UC machine because of the type of data, and was informed that using a non-UC machine for this (which I am) would theoretically open me up to personal liability.  Not a threat, mind you, just information I should have.  As such I've already deleted my copy of the data, and will not be offering the service.

UCOP's excuse for not offering this service themselves is, well, unclear.  To paraphrase, I get excuses like ""Its an ongoing investigation"", ""The data is PII so we have to do it on air-gapped machines"" (never mind the risk of theft is negligible because it is already stolen data!), ""Just sign up for the Experian service"", ""There is so much data involved"" (cue laughter at the notion of 3 GB compressed being a lot of data), ""We don't want to spam people with notifications because it will just be ignored"" (well, that is true, they spam us with so much other stuff that hey, why is this more important?).
At this point, the ""ongoing investigation"" however is a smoke-screen and the rest of the excuses ring hollow as well:
We know the amount of data released, because it can be downloaded easily.
The UCOP also knows what data might have been stolen but is not included in the released data: The forensics examination of the compromised server was completed at least a month ago.  If the attacker did not succeed in fully deleting the logs they know the data the attacker accessed but did not include in the dump.  And if the attacker did delete the logs they should simply assume that all the data on it when it was compromised was released.
And the data itself is really in two forms: tabular data about lots of people and individual communications.  The tabular data is of the largest concern for most of us, since most of us don't actually need UCOP exceptions on the various HR processes.  This data doesn't just include social security # but potentially other sensitive information, such as self reported disability status, addresses, self reported sexual orientation, student IDs, etc.
It would be a straightforward software engineering effort for the UC to provide a service that would allow us, the victims, to request all table entries which concern us.  I know because I was able to code up a primitive version of the searching on a single desktop in a couple of hours with generating this report taking a few minutes per person (and I could easily have tweaked it to a few seconds by doing a bit of different parallelism), and this is one of those tasks that qualifies as ""obscenely parallel"": you want 10x the throughput?  Throw 10x the computers at it.
If you too think the UC Office of the President should provide such a service should contact communications@ucop.edu since it is apparently UCOP which has basically decided there communication should be this incredibly useless excuse for a FAQ https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/data-security/updates-faq/accellion-faq.html rather than actually providing us with the actual information of ours that they know was compromised and available on the criminal underground for anyone who is capable of firing up the Tor browser.",1619121035,1,0

a few questions about haas - thank you in advance!,"I had a few questions about Haas, and I appreciate any and all help! Most of it is just me being worried since I know that Cal is such a big school and there's so much going on that I'm afraid I'll be behind (in the sense that all the incoming freshmen in the group chats already seem to know exactly what to do)

1) I'm looking through all the L&amp;S and Haas reqs, along with just personal preferences, but I have no clue what a ""regular"" schedule looks like. What is the typical pre-haas freshman class schedule like?¬†Should I take UGBA first semester, second, or maybe sophomore year? 

2) How many activities/clubs would you recommend joining in your first year? I feel like in high school I'm used to being in everything, but I know this is definitely not the case for Cal, and I even see that some have hourly preferences?

3) Are consulting clubs worth it? If not, what are some non-toxic clubs that have helped you learn and grow at Cal? I saw that consulting clubs have a pretty good list of kids that get internships and ft offers, but also worried that I won't get in. 

4) I've read a lot of posts about how freshmen have been able to get internships after their first year at Fortune 500 companies? Is this actually possible?¬†Is it networking, is it just straight up applying? Do I need to start connecting with a bajillion people on LinkedIn? 

5) Do freshmen typically do internships before they enter Cal? I'm hearing a lot about how students are going to do a multitude of things before entering the actual school, but I don't have much lined up. Would I be at a disadvantage if I don't have much to do this summer?

6) Any advice to best position yourself to get into haas/anything you wish you knew?",1619120131,1,0

Take Earth and Planetary Science classes!,"Hello everyone. I'm writing to put Earth and Planetary Science classes on everyone's radar for the upcoming phase 1 enrollments. This fall we will be teaching breadth courses on climate change, earthquakes, the oceans, and introductory Earth science.

I personally will be teaching EPS 102: History and Evolution of Planet Earth (M,W,F 3-4) and I would really like to get people with diverse backgrounds taking the class.

This class covers the origin of our solar system, the origin of life, Earth's climate and tectonic history from the recent ice ages to global catastrophes billions of years ago, the evolution of life from microorganisms to complex animals, and more! The class has no prerequisites other than high-school level math, chemistry, and physics. Anything you need to know is taught.

Average grade in the class: B+. Most common grades A or A- depending on the semester.

Example comments from recent course evaluations:

‚Ä¢*The course does a really great job being accessible to students outside the EPS department. I took it as a breadth class and was daunted in the beginning looking over the syllabus. Even though many students had taken EPS 50 as an ""unofficial"" prerequisite, I didn't feel like I was disadvantaged coming in with zero knowledge. It was well organized to build understanding from the ground up. I also think Professor Stolper is an engaging lecturer and he took the time to go over key concepts patiently multiple times to reinforce them, which is surprisingly uncommon. I think this course should be publicized more as an alternative to classes like Chem 1A which students from other departments take for the Natural Science breadth. I learnt a lot more than I thought I would as the class (not being central to my major) was low priority for me but ended up being one of my most interesting classes at Berkeley.*

‚Ä¢*Professor Stolper is a very strong, engaging lecturer. I really enjoyed the way that he explained the course concepts, and his style of teaching ensured that I always felt included, even within the lecturing format.*

*‚Ä¢It was like listening to a well‚Äìmade podcast: lots of compact, in depth, well‚Äìexplained info*

Main criticism? I have bad handwriting. This is true.

*His handwriting is a little yikes but he knows it and will try to rewrite for you.*

Other classes to consider:

EPS 7: Introduction to Climate Change (M,W,F 2-3)

EPS C20: Earthquakes in your backyard (T/Th 11-12:30)

EPS 50: The Planet Earth (T/Th 2-3:30)

EPS 82: Oceans (M/W/F 10-11)

CMU tepper or UC Berkeley pre-haas,"
I was recently admitted to some amazing schools like UVA, UNC Chapel Hill, USC, UCLA, CMU and Berkeley and am super grateful to have the fortune to choose.

Im dead-set on going to Business schoolüêç and would possibly like to do a minor in something tech (CS, information systems etc). In the future I see myself either doing consulting, becoming an entrepreneur in the start-up space or being a media/ entertainment industry execute (very confusing I know I‚Äôm sorryüò≠)

Anyway, I‚Äôve boiled my top choices down to CMU and Berkeley and cannot pick between the 2. Ignoring any cost factor, I would love advice on which school to choose.

CMU: Pros: Tepper is a 4 year program and has around 150 kids, private school w a lot more personal attention, small classes, great tech ecosystem and a minor is a part of the syllabus so I can do IS, HCI etc, also has a great design program in case I want to do product design, not curved classes/grade deflation ‚Äî-&gt; I think I‚Äôll stand out more at tepper???

Cons: Pittsburg is kinda dead, tooo cold, heard terrible things about the social life and workload (please bust the mythsü•∫), tepper is not as prestigious(debatable) or a feeder to consulting firms, idk how well it recruits to west coast(or internships), less school spirit so possible weaker alumni network than Berkeley

Berkeley

Pros: californiaaaaa, seems like more well rounded college experience, Silicon Valley, state school so diverse amazing people, haas dominates the west coast so recruiting and internships are easier, already have a small community of people I gel with, also road trips and food&gt;&gt;&gt;

Cons: haas requires the admissions process all aver again, 30% acceptance rate and 2 year program, grade deflation, competitive stress culture scares me a lot, consulting clubs are suuper hard to get into, huge classes and fighting for opportunities, doesn‚Äôt have an IS program and declaring cs major is kinda hard.

ChemE Transfer Chances,"Hi guys,

I'm wondering what some of you think my chances are transferring from a ccc to UCB as a chemical engineering major. My GPA is a 3.54 ; I've completed IGETC-2 as well as all of the recommended courses for my major (except for engineering materials).  In terms of EC's I don't have much other than:

being a supplemental instructor for general chemistry

volunteering for disaster relief

private tutoring

other minimum  wage jobs

However, I definitely fit into the category of demonstrating extreme hardship; Growing up I was in foster care, homeless on multiple occasions, lived with mentally ill or drug addicted parents etc. This last year my mom had a serious suicide attempt- and actually succeeded in stopping her heart. She was revived, and I moved 200 miles across the state to take care of her- feed her, cloth her, take her to work on the days she felt like it, pay her mortgage, all during the semester, so I had a full course load. She actually tried to kill herself two more times during that semester, but didn't succeed because I administered NARCAN. For my PIQ's I mostly wrote about her suicide attempts, as well as my complete lack of foundational support to attend college. I'm only 20 years old for reference, and I took three years at a ccc. I'm mainly looking to see if anyone here has heard of, or was themselves accepted to an engineering major at UCB despite barely making the GPA cut? Decisions are coming out in a couple of days, so I'm looking for a reason to be hopeful. Berkeley is my top choice for schools, and I really desperately want to attend; that being said, kids in my shoes don't often get the opportunity to go to college, so I was stoked to receive an acceptance to UCSB for their ChemE program yesterday!

3) Is it difficult to balance school and work at the same time, if you are interested in doing research/internships simultaneously while maintaining a high GPA (for grad school)?

4) Is there a lot of competition in terms of extracurriculars, career and internship opportunities, or would you be able to find an internship to gain field experience fairly easily without having to apply to a ton?

5) Is there a lot of recruiting done by employers on campus for poli sci/public policy/pre-law students?

6) Does Berkeley offer a lot of opportunities (beyond study abroad) to get involved with international organizations or internships in DC or on the east coast?

7) Are research opportunities in government and politics abundant, or is there a degree of selectivity in who gets to participate?

8) And lastly, when is the best time to study abroad? I'd love to hear about some of your experiences, what work you did, and where you traveled.",1618000243,1,0
How likely is a transfer from UC Davis (biomedical engineering) to UC Berkeley (bioengineering)?," I got rejected from UCB (applied as bioengineering) but got accepted into Davis with the regents scholarship and honors college (super excited about that). However, UCB is still my dream school and I have my eyes deadset on it. I know my chances are slim when it comes to transferring from a UC to another UC but I still want to give it a shot. My local community college only had one person successfully transfer into UCB (not into engineering) during fall 2020 and this freaks me out. This along with the fact that my cc does not have everything I need to be a competitive transfer applicant are the only things deterring me from going to cc otherwise I would be happy to go. I'm not doing the transfer application rn because I am still a senior in high school but I was wondering if anyone who successfully transferred had any tips they could share.

Here are my four choices:

1. MEng of UC Berkeley
2. M.S. of U-Michigan Ann Arbor
3. M.S. of Cornell
4. PHD of CMU (currently in the waitlist)

I have several questions: 

1. How likely can I get into a PhD program of UCB or other top universities after the MEng program? Comparing with MS students?
2. For Mechanical major and robotics track, is it hard to find a major matched job after graduate from MEng?
3. How hard to find research opportunities during the 2 semesters of MEng program? Will it be easier if I can extend it to 3 semesters?

regents scholar career benefits?,"Hello! I‚Äôm an incoming class of 2025 (go bears!) and also was lucky enough to be a Regents Scholar.

And kind of expanding this further, does Berkeley have a high success rate with putting students in jobs they want (specifically business sided jobs for me personally)? Berkeley is obviously a very big school with lots of amazingly brilliant people and I‚Äôm just a bit scared that I‚Äôll have to fight for resources and it‚Äôll be harder to get a decently paying job after graduation. 
I‚Äôm also considering some private options, and the consensus from people I talked to around private schools is that since there‚Äôs less students, you get more attention and resources and it‚Äôll be easier to find a job after graduation. But Cal is the cheapest option for me so I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it to spend more just to go private.

questions for pursuing an MBA,"Hi, 

I am a prospective cs major with the end goal of trying to get an MBA after college.

Does Berkeley have any resources to help students who are looking to pursue an MBA?

help deciding between cal english/journalism and medill @ northwestern,"hi guys! i was admitted to cal l&amp;s and i'm super excited about it. i'm 90% sure i want to become a journalist in the future and ik cal has top ranked english and that their journalism grad school is incredible. however i was also admitted to northwestern's medill school of journalism which is the best in the country and i'm pretty torn, so any advice from cal students who are studying english/have completed the journalism minor would be v much appreciated :))

here are some pros and cons i've compiled for each school: 

**northwestern**

pros

* highest ranked journalism school in the country
* very easy to double major with political science/english/etc
* also very easy to switch majors if i change my mind about journalism
* opportunities at medill are unmatched in terms of internships and their journalism residency (where u get to work alongside professional journalists on capitol hill for a quarter. students covered the first impeachment trial and the 2016 election to give u some examples)
* i wouldn't have to go to grad school for journalism afterwards because of the clout/experience (saves money in the long run)

cons

* more expensive by 15k/yr
* smaller than i'd prefer
* not a huge fan of chicago weather or suburbs
* even though i'm 90% sure i want to do journalism, i don't think northwestern would be worth the price if i end up switching majors
* pre-professional culture at medill worries me

**cal**

pros

* highly ranked english major and journalism grad school (that i can take classes at as an undergrad)
* cheaper
* better weather and i like the urban environment/culture more
* would allow me to get a more general undergrad before hard committing to journalism
* close to family who live in berkeley
* plenty of internship/networking opportunities

cons

* if i want to go into journalism after undergrad, i'd probably have to go to grad school which will make it more expensive than 4 years at medill
* competitive culture makes me nervous tbh even if it's mostly concentrated in stem fields
* it's not medill for journalism if that's what i decide to do

basically it boils down to whether or not i want to do journalism. like i said, i'm 90% sure, and a degree from medill sets u up for success in a field where it's notoriously hard to make a living. i'm just not sure if i can get that level of industry clout at cal, which is why i feel like i should take advantage of medill. but i'm also worried that i'll have nothing to fall back on at northwestern if journalism doesn't pan out, and cal checks every other box for me.

"Feeling down because I'm feeling very behind compared to my peers, who are graduating this semester and can't even bring myself to study for my finals as a result.","Hi. I hope everyone‚Äôs dead week is going well. I don‚Äôt really know where I‚Äôm going with this but I guess I‚Äôm posting here for some support? 

I‚Äôm feeling a bit down because I‚Äôm graduating in Fall 2021 and I am very concerned about my job prospects. I am a junior Economics major with some background in data analytics (R mainly) and am mostly looking at jobs in economic consulting, market research, marketing and strategy consulting. However, I am not even sure if I want to do business, honestly.

The reason I am not sure about business is because I never even envisioned myself as a business professional. I did NOT enter wanting to pursue economics at all. 

I am extremely shy and awkward and I have terrible people skills. I am very reserved until I get to know someone, and even then I‚Äôm awkward because it‚Äôs just who I am. I just don‚Äôt think bad people skills will help in a field that is so oriented towards client-facing work, but I don‚Äôt really know of any other fields I can explore or am qualified for. My resume isn‚Äôt the problem; it‚Äôs definitely my interview skills. I‚Äôve gotten final round interviews for some of the positions I‚Äôve applied to but I don‚Äôt get offers. I‚Äôve tried to improve my interview skills but I see only small improvement. 

Additionally, what I believe makes me feel even worse about my zero career prospects is the fact that I was actually supposed to graduate this semester. I came in during August 2017 so many of my peers are graduating now. The reason I am staying behind is because I withdrew during the Fall 2018 semester and didn‚Äôt come back until Summer 2019. 

The peers that I entered with...many of them have plans for pharmacy school, grad school, medical school, or have really great job offers and I‚Äôm just sitting here empty handed and clueless about what to do with my future. I had 2 internship interviews recently at well known firms, and I guess I‚Äôm waiting on the results for those but I just don‚Äôt feel really hopeful. 

I know I have to solve my own problems and think hard about what I can do to change my situation, but the feelings are just really overwhelming me. I have a final in 5 days that‚Äôs worth 40% of my grade, and although I‚Äôm taking it P/NP, I just can‚Äôt even bring myself to study for it.

Off campus housing,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm a UCSB undergraduate from the Bay Area that‚Äôs looking to relocate to either community college temporarily or to a school in the area, mostly to be closer to home.

I should be moving back to the Bay soon and I am considering Berkeley because of the amount of young people and jobs there. 

Was hoping to get recommendations on off campus housing options that lots of students use? Would like to be around as many people my age as possible, and a roommate apartment building type situation would be ideal for affordability. As close to dorms as possible would be the idea. 

Any suggestions? 

Thanks,
Eli",1620181049,1,0

Biology major question,"I applied to IB at L&amp;S and was accepted as a F21 transfer. Surprisingly, I was also accepted to UCLA/UCD/UCSB. I still haven't submitted my SIR, but I'm heavily leaning toward Cal. However, I'm unsure as to whether IB is the right major for me. I'm interested in insects, bats, ecology, mycology, plant biology, medicine, and neurobiology, and hope to get a doctorates/wind up in research eventually. A big draw for me with Cal is the amount of research being conducted on autism/psychedelic assisted psychotherapy/bat neurobiology, as well as the rich history of Berkeley's campus and botanical gardens and whatnot. 

I've been doing a lot of research--looking at course listings, sifting through Reddit for other students' experience in different majors, etc, but thought I'd ask on here and see if I could get some help picking a major. Part of me is wondering whether I should declare neurobiology with MCB and attempt a double major alongside GPB. Another part of me wants to go for MEB. Classes/advising at Rausser seem very intimate, which is a plus for me because I struggle with a learning disability and I think the environment could be beneficial. IB seems like a major that might encompass all my interests, however, I'm not sure what good a BA would do me if I switch gears and decide to get a job in field biology/botany right out of school instead of continuing my education.

  
Would one of these majors be any more suitable than the others if I want to pursue field studies?

A Poem to Berkeley from a 2020 Alum Seeing Graduation,"As I see friends from Berkeley graduate this week, I can't help but be swept up by the memories--of friends, experiences, and even some classes. The nostalgia makes me feel the spirit of Berkeley coming back to me after being lost during this pandemic year, beaten out of me by the horrors of the world, loss of community, and the ennui of my job in corporate America. 

The spirit of Berkeley that makes you believe, that makes you think you can come up with ideas and do things that can conquer the world. The spirit of Berkeley that makes you think with confidence that I can strive for excellence and never have to settle for being second-best. The spirit of Berkeley that surrounds you with good people and good communities that raise you up even when you're down. The spirit of Berkeley that makes you achieve great things and pushes you to ever greater heights. 

It gives me the courage to hope, to fight, and to dream of new horizons. It gives me again the confidence that I can achieve and do great things. It gives me belief in humanity and belief in the powers vested in me by Berkeley. 

At the same time I hope this isn't momentary. I hope this isn't a false dawn or isn't just another path to my regrets--about how I didn't use college enough, about how I didn't get enough experiences, about how I didn't meet enough people or make enough friends. 

It remains to be seen, but the spirit of Berkeley blooms again within me. 

&amp;#x200B;

(Happy grad weekend, now stretching into the week!)

(This also may just be me reliving the thoughts and the moment that I'd imagined in my head would occur when I walked across the stage, which didn't happen last year.)",1621294690,1,0
Manifest: Local Networking Web Application For UC System,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRW-w\_UIjYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRW-w_UIjYk)

The best way I can explain this app is with a Spongebob metaphor. In this episode, the krusty krab is the university/college system of clubs, resource centers, etc. and the bulletin board is the Manifest app. Manifest brings a bulletin board abstraction of messaging to the abstraction of the Krusty Krab, which is actually the entire university system of clubs, resource centers, and institutional orgs (thus currently working with UCSC Resource Centers and the rest of the UC system for this pitch).

We may hope to see Manifest as the community bulletin board machine of great good, so long as it is free from unlawful censorship and has community standards that facilitate amazing and inspiring interactions.

Here is a more formal pitch for a web app I'm working on called Manifest to connect clubs on campus within UCSC (my school) and the rest of the UC system (including UC Berkeley):

* What is the Manifest app? Messaging for local communities.
* What is the problem it solves? Sharing information between locals quickly and efficiently.
* So what, who cares? It may help to streamline events, activities, and more in real-time within the local area. There are so many steps to joining a club, promoting events, and emailing groups‚ÄîManifest was created to unify these activities in a local platform.

summer classes input,"spent my first year of college online in my room lol. def not what i expected to happen but. this sem was tougher than the last. took my first science courses at berk and realized this shit is no joke! learning under world class profs, some who def don't seem as interested in teaching as they do in their research, having to juggle my time hardcore (and epically failing all year), and more. spring sem rly tested me in many ways, and i am ending it with the worst i have ever done. likely getting my first C in biology, b- in chem1a and just feeling really defeated and sad. this scores are completely my fault, and i know where my shortcomings were... TIME MANAGEMENT. anyways, my gpa is going to be shit after this year now and i am also maybeee premed lol. i did do well last sem given my course load was not intense as spring. 

&amp;#x200B;

now enough w the rant, and on to what this post is about. i am not sure if i should enroll in summer classes. i would need 6units for fin aid, and there are some open classes. i am done w all my breadths + AC req. idek what classes i would take over summer. i was thinking about r1b (4 un) then i would need something else to fill up the 6 un. i don't know if i should try and take these classes to kinda buffer my gpa more OR take this summer to self prep ochem/data8 and work on myself mentally/physically and volunteer etc. i feel bad for not taking any classes, esp bc my gpa will for sure be bad after freshman yr. one on hand,  I'm so mentally exhausted from online school. on the other hand, maybe i can try using better time management over summer knowing where my weakness are (but i can also do this in fall when we r on campus lol).

Should I put more weight on living with roommates I vibe with/can be friends with or finding the cheapest apartment?,"I've never had to look for housing/roommates before so idk which is more important. I'm currently talking to a group of fellas who I vibe with rlly well and have similar habits with, and I'd pay around $1k a month for a double. However, I've also chatted with people who are looking for someone to fill a single room with the same price, but I don't vibe as well with them as the guys in the apartment I'd be having a double in. I've similarly seen people looking to fill doubles for cheaper (around $850 a month) but once again, I don't vibe with them as well, so I'm not sure if I should go for these cheaper options with the risk of maybe not vibing as well with my housemates.

Also, is it worth it to pay \~$200-400 a month more for a single bedroom in an apartment (instead of having a double)? I've had my own room all my life so I'm a tad nervous about sharing a room with someone else but in general, I've noticed that single bedrooms cost about $200 to $400 more per month than doubles.

Haas Prerequisite Course I NEED HELP,"Hey so if anyone could help me with it would be great I‚Äôm really confused.

So I‚Äôm in the Oakland changemakers program and there is a set of required courses you need to take for Haas. I‚Äôll apply early in my sophomore year, and my first year at Berkeley, I‚Äôll only be able to take classes at Mills and one per semester at Berkeley. SOOO, I‚Äôll be able to take the two English comp classes, and I could take math 1a and 1b to satisfy the calc requirement, (at mills), but that leaves Econ, intro to business, and stat 20, and I can only take 2 total classes on Berkeley‚Äôs campus this next year. That means one class I‚Äôll have to take at the same time as I apply to Haas in my second year. 

Does that give me a disadvantage in applying compared to others who got them all done?? 

Also, is math 1a and 1b hard? Because if the answer to the question above is that I have no disadvantage for taking prereqs in fall of my sophomore year, would it be a better idea to take 16a and 16b, or math 53 or math 54 on Berkeley‚Äôs campus in sophomore year, instead of rushing 1a and 1b?

I‚Äôm just really confused on if I should try to cram in as many of the prereq classes to show how I do in them, or not.

I really want to get in to Haas, and since I just got off the waitlist I don‚Äôt know as much as I should and I feel quite overwhelmed.

I will sit with you 1 on 1 and setup your computer for maximum productivity, based on your working style. Maybe you need a tool to store all your ambitious ideas in a way that you actually read them again after noting them down.

Opinion: Your ranting is hurting people. Stop the toxic self-deprecation,"For many people, this subreddit is the catch-all for getting caught up on UC Berkeley related dialogues. Yes, this includes rants: especially for a time like this, the voicing of our frustrations and problems is important. However, I frequently notice **""toxic self-deprecation""** creeping into the posts. Imagine them as the opposite of humble-bragging: subtly veiled posts that brings others down with them.

For example, imagine a post with the following contents: ""I'm a Sophomore and I haven't secured a summer internship yet... literally all of my friends have gotten an internship and I feel so behind... I feel like I don't deserve to be in \[major\]...""

This commonly seen post implies the following ideas:

1. You are behind if you don't have an internship in Sophomore year. Even worse if you are a Junior and beyond.
2. It is normal for people to have internships. You are the oddity otherwise.
3. If you don't have an internship, you aren't good enough for your major.

It doesn't matter if the intent of the author was to simply ""vent""; the fact that someone expressed these sentiments exacerbate toxic (and frequently false) ideas that are associated with the stress-cooker environment in Berkeley.

I think it is time we introduce a **nuanced rule against toxic self-deprecation.** We are seeing that they do more harm than good in this community. There are healthy ways of venting that doesn't involve facilitating a culture of not being good enough.",1614836470,312,6

"Data Science is Racist and I've had enough, they will most likely delete this","I am making this post based on a Twitter thread I posted, I'm not even including racist/predjuce things that faculty and core member have said to me personally.

This course along with the Data 8 Faculty and Staff and broader Data Science department is racist. How you have NO Weeb Faculty, NO Weeb TA's, NO Weeb Tutors, and deemed it appropriate to use the LYNCHING of Weeb men for a crime that was designed to be used as justification for their lynching as practice problems is beyond me. Who told you this was okay? You provide NO context into how these allegations were fabricated to lynch them, no reading on this topic, but feel entitled enough to use the violence and murder of Weebs to explain data science?

Leave alone the psychological impact this will have on Weeb students, who are forced to do data analysis of the lynchings and murders of their own people. They don't even capitalize the W is Weeb when discussing Weebs and in 2021 are using ""otaku"". They are pretending like Weebs arent still getting killed, forgot about [\#WeebLivesMatter ](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackLivesMatter?src=hashtag_click)already, looking at your feed June and July were the only months that yall cared lol. Performative Activism at its best.

This is not my personal opinion, if Data Science actually viewed Weebs with a semblance of humanity or deemed Weebs's lives and experience worthy of educating themselves on for one second, and actually read Weeb texts Data Science would know the disgust of what you guys have done. How deplorable it is to use the murder of innocent Weeb men in such a frivolous context with no background or history on the truth of what has happened. Here is a text that corroborates everything that I have said in this thread.

You can look at your own textbooks To see how you trivialized and minimized the violent lynchings of Weeb men. It includes statistical analysis, something that quantifies the violence. I'm not even going to include the racist problems that are about personal hygiene and introversion, while some of us actually have to live through introversion y'all are making questions out of it smh. Where are your ethics? Where is your consciousness?

Jonathan Joestar did not die for [@BerkeleyDataSci ](https://twitter.com/BerkeleyDataSci)use his death in this way. The most racist way to disrespect his legacy and the legacy of those who have died under the hands of the US justice system for crimes that were fabricated to subjugate and mutilate them. This how I know a Weeb person has never worked for your department, WHO TOLD YOU THIS WAS OKAY!!!!!! Yall took the injustice of Weeb men, who are still in jails for selling hentai, meanwhile the Data Science community is doing this.

Data Science will to FIRST to say no racism exists in your department when EVERY single time Weebs have been discussed in this course it is to explain how they are poor, have virginity and obesity rates (no mention of medical racism that causes this), and now that they are rapists. Data Science affirms racist stereotypes of Weebs and uses their trauma and violence for practice problems. This is not one instance this is a habitual pattern of minimization and discrimination.  Im have no words for this.
