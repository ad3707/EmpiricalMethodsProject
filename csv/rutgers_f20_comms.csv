Large intro classes are common across nearly every public university in America and even across a lot of privates. I believe Berkeley has 2000 person sections for their intro CS classes. If we have a lot of students in a course they‚Äôre typically broken down into smaller sections and at minimum made more personal through the use of smaller recitations/labs.,1599955093,6,0

Rutgers is located in New Brunswick, the hub city of New Jersey. We have two medical schools with 3+4 programs and plenty of clinical opportunities at RWJ Hospital. UMD‚Äôs only medical school is located in Baltimore. 

There‚Äôs no one ‚Äòcurriculum‚Äô for pre med. You need only fulfill the necessary requirements for admittance into your med school of choice. The most popular pre med major is kinesiology/exercise science because it provides more versatility for taking courses otherwise blocked behind lockstep sequences.

"

Class sizes vary depending on a number of factors, including: How far they are along a major, how many prerequisites are needed, how popular they are, how many majors require them, etc. I've had classes that are full auditoriums (only intro classes, such as Intro to Computer Science or Intro to International Relations). Other classes are a more medium size, with 25-50 people. Some have been small, with 10-24 people. I wouldn't say Rutgers is overcrowded; this seems to be the norm for big schools.

What is it about larger classes that concerns you? If it's asking questions, then I wouldn't worry too much - in my experience, people are always able to ask questions, even during huge lectures (unless you have a fear of speaking in front of so many others). Huge lectures will also usually have recitations, where the huge class is divided into small groups (15-30 people), where they discuss course topics, do some practice problems, can ask more questions and receive more attention, etc. Recitations are also more useful for getting to know classmates, too. Finally, all classes have office hours, which are scheduled times when you can meet with the professor 1-on-1, and ask any questions you have (or just talk to them, ask for advice, help, etc, if you want).

If there something else about larger classes that concerns you in particular, let me know, I can give my opinion on it.

Also, one thing that I wish I knew before I came to Rutgers that I didn't hear about beforehand - there are 5 campuses on Rutgers, and they are connected via a bus system. It [takes time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/gckhi4/how_bad_is_the_bus_system_at_rutgers/fpc8cq6/) to get from one campus to another. Unfortunately, I got placed into a dorm on the one campus that is further away from all the others (~20 min, ~45 in rush hour), and had to spend a lot of time my freshman year commuting, especially since all my classes were on other campuses. It made it a lot harder to garner motivation to go to clubs, office hours, or even classes when they required so much energy drained on a bus. Just be aware of this, and try to get a dorm near your classes if you come here (if you're doing some form of engineering, that'd probably be Busch campus).",1599952950,1,0

Yes, two letter grade difference for 10 points can happen. The ‚Äúaverage‚Äù of class averages for 3 midterms and the final was the final C+.
The A mark being lowered to an 80 would probably means giving more A‚Äôs to students who might have gotten B+‚Äôs rather than shifting the entire curve down, especially if the class average is set to a C+, unless extreme circumstances happen.

"Yeah. I got to agree with the other posts here. It would be very rough trying to get into SOE (School of Engineering) or SAS (School of Arts and Sciences) with a 2.5 GPA. 

Go to community college first. Do at least your first year there. The first year of engineering (which computer engineering is a part of) isn't really major specific. You take basic courses that are taught at a lot of community colleges. Here is a link to the electrical and computer engineering (ECE) handbook, which tells you all of the courses ECE majors take:

[https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/handbook/ECE-UG-Handbook-September-2019\_Class2022\_v2.pdf](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/handbook/ECE-UG-Handbook-September-2019_Class2022_v2.pdf)

Go to page 10. Look at the freshmen year courses (17 credits in the fall, 15 credits in the spring).

You just have to take these courses. Make sure that the course you take at CC can be transferred to Rutgers. Sometimes, the courses at CC might look the same as the ones at Rutgers, but Rutgers will refuse to accept the credits. You will have to reach out to SOE for more information about what classes/credits will or will not transfer.

Now I will echo the advice from other posts. A GPA of 2.5 is not good at all. This means that you need to change your approach towards academics and studying. Please take your CC education seriously. Rutgers SOE will not admit you if you get a bunch of C(s) in your CC courses. By getting good grades in CC, you can demonstrate to Rutgers and the admissions team that you have changed your mindset towards your academics and that you are ready. 

At the end of the day, your success rests in your hands. 

I wish you the best of luck!",1603085254,1,0

"Here is my advice if I were in your position, first make sure these first three steps are completed. 

1) Send your email via your school email account, not a personal one.

2) Put your section number, RUID, name, and subject matter into the subject line

3) Read the syllabus and make sure you are sending it to the correct email address and see if there are any email rules you are violating that are listed in the syllabus.

If you have done the three steps above, then here is my opinion/advice:

If I sent a professor 3 (three!!!!) emails to their listed email (on the syllabus, class website, or department directory) and I didn't even get so much as a response or an ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, I would assume that they are ignoring me or they aren't checking their emails. Either is unacceptable considering that I am paying thousands of dollars for an education.

 I understand if a professor needs a couple of days or a week (and that is very lenient) to respond to all the emails they may get in an online format. It would be fine even if a professor replies with a message stating that they are swamped with emails and they need an additional day to reply.  But, not replying at all is unprofessional at best, and laziness at worst.

My resolution would be:

1) Forward the original email to the professor and write a small message that states that you are following up on trying to get an answer to your question/request that was asked on this date (write down the date the original email was asked). CC the dean in that forwarding email. Give the professor a couple of days to reply. If he/she doesn't, then write a direct email to the deans office (that usually puts your situation on the fast-track) describing the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Most professors are great and reply to emails very quickly. Some even reply to emails within minutes or within the hour.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck resolving the situation!",1603071794,1,0

There's no such thing as sin, the gods don't give a shit, and patriarchy has no place in a religion that has at the very least a god and a goddess as equals. We're also very LGBTQIA+ friendly, are happy to accept people of any culture or race. Sex isn't taboo, provided everyone's consenting adults. We celebrate 8 major holidays, including Samhain (pronouced Sow-en), which is the source of the word and a lot of traditions in Halloween.

Which school does your sister want to enter (School of Engineering, School of Business, School of Arts and Sciences)? If you know, directly contact the deans there and explain the situation.

I will disagree with u/ReadingIsBeneficial. If you are not an engineering or math major or someone who will **genuinely** benefit from Cal 1 and 2 material, then I would simply skip over Cal 1 and 2 with the AP credits and call it a day.

"Its fine, a very diverse campus. Rutgers is not boring if you go out to any of the events happening. If you stay inside your dorm and play video games it can be very boring (not shitting on playing video games, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like a good way to meet other students). There is always something fun to do at Rutgers. Parties usually happen on the weekends at night. If you are a guy good luck getting into them though. Students here are pretty friendly if you reach out to them. Some majors/students in general are not as social as others. Since the school is so big and diverse you can find all sorts of people who are friendly and studious. Pre-covid it was really fun",1609381711,13,0
"I feel like the math major is very much like this. 

Negative judgements were cast on people who weren't doing mathematically ""rigorous"" enough majors, even things like economics or physics. 

There was a lot of insecurity among math majors regarding capability and intelligence (I even witnessed one particularly bad interaction where one student called another ""dumb"" for not understanding their explanation of a problem- he apologized after being called out for it by another student, but I think it's still symptomatic of the kinds of mentalities that pervade the major). 

My possibly unpopular opinion is that the math major is possibly the worst major for anyone who doesn't already have a solid bedrock of self-esteem. The environment seems friendly enough until you realize just how much ""pure math"" is put on a pedestal above all other disciplines and how intelligence-obsessed many folks are within the major. The environment can be so toxic and pretentious and... just useless. 

The best thing you can do is focus on the intrinsic reasons why you're studying what you're studying and avoid caring about how you ""stack up."" It really doesn't matter. I used to think that it did for graduate schools, but honestly, if you have a genuine curiosity for your subject and focus intently on pursuing that curiosity and learning as much as you can, then if you still don't get into a graduate school, it probably just wasn't meant to be. And that's okay. There's no cosmic superiority hierarchy where people with PhDs are just intrinsically better than everyone else. And in general, your worth as a person does not and should not hinge on your intelligence. 

There's no point in killing yourself trying to ""beat"" other students. That mentality is so toxic and useless. Focus on enjoying yourself and finding meaning in what you're studying. The rest can go to hell.",1609381678,1,0

"I'm a senior and I've failed two classes, I'll be honest it probably isn't the best look for grad school but to employers if you can explain your situation, what you've learned from it then it won't matter all that much. 

1. employers look for character more than skill or grades most of the time so one class will absolutely not break any chances of anything. Also it's covid time and school is online people will be understanding about that.

2. you're a freshman and it's one course, unless you're double majoring it probably won't put you back at all to graduate on time and you'll have another 3 years to boost your GPA, and since you can take a NP then it won't even effect your GPA. 

My suggestion is if you're really like SUPER behind then just take the NP, focus on your other classes and end strong in those.

"generally they curve the average to be a C+ (whether the low or high end or middle they've never said) so typically in the past the range for a C has been pretty massive so people who are below average still pass. So if you've been above average, you're not failing and likely have a  C+/B depending on how they finalize the curve. They always said the final was a big deal and if you got an 80+ on the final that was an A regardless of your other grades because you eventually learned it, but i'm not sure if that's still the case. I found the finals difficult, but all of orgo was difficult for me and i had given up by the time the finals hit so i can't truly accurately judge their difficulty.

"It does sound like you're doing all the right things before the interview. Are you asking questions back to the person performing the interview? Not just at the end, but as part of the process? I think some people forget that as much as they're interviewing you, you should also be interviewing them - trying to get a feel as to whether or not you want to work for this manager or the organization. I've gone against my own gut a few times during an interview because I was desperate for work and in both cases they turned out to be horrible jobs that I never should have taken. This would be where all that research comes in - asking about things you've seen on a company website or how a particular program/project works. A really good interview should be a two-way street. It sounds like you have awareness of that from what you wrote, but I'm just adding it to make sure. 

In truth good interviews are about trying to get a feel for a person's soft-skills and whether or not they are a good match for that organization's culture. They have your resume - they can see what you've done. Just telling them about your experience isn't helpful then - tell them about how you figured something out or a team-based interaction that revealed something bigger. How did you solve a problem or what's your approach to dealing with difficult issues?

It's definitely a skill to develop (going on interviews) and really the only way to practice is to keep going on them. The rejection is tough, but it's all part of the process. It's also hard to not compare yourself to others, but try to avoid it. Don't settle for any job - know your value and take an offer from a potential employer that sees it. 

Good luck.",1605197328,1,0

SAY THAT SHIT TO ME ONLINE AGAIN AND I WILL FIND YOUR ASS AND MAKE SWEET LOVE TO IT, YOU FUCKING COCK IN A SOCK

jokes aside, i fucking love my major. even if it gives me cyclical ulcers from stress. If you feel like you're not doing as well, even with the assumable ""free time"" of staying at home, do not fret, for you are not alone. Unlike my other semesters, I am just flat out doing nothing besides my college courses. No socializing, no clubs, no part time jobs, no research. Im even doing a lower course load than usual. Yet this semester feels like competing at a hot dog eating contest but being held at gunpoint to finish first. As I am sure most have experienced already, its as if professors only fall into two camps of teaching. Its either you have your grade depend only on 3 exams and just let students learn 300/400 level material on their own or assign a lab, hw, quiz, a recitation, and 3 hours of poorly made lecture videos every week (dont forget the biweekly exam). Its like they looked at two camps of thought, ""with everything online we might as well just give a few assignments and let them learn at their own pace"" or ""we should give smaller, less time consuming, less grade heavy assignments at more frequent intervals to ensure students aren't trying to cram so much material at the last minute"", and decided to go to the bastardized polar extremes of the two. Rutgers should seriously make all students take a survey on how they would like courses to be structured (within reason of course) because I'm sure a good amount of people will not be able to endure another semester of, well, whatever this is. Current SIRS surverys need to be add a couple of questions regarding whether some parts of the course were too overwhelming, or just completely lacking, instead of the vague and meaningless ""is this (course/Prof) good on scale of 1-5"". Things might not change, but at least I'll know that the professor and department will have a good general student consensus on the course and why. anyways if you're still reading, get off reddit you ding dong. we both know that report aint gonna finish itself.",1605196958,1,0

Orgo lab is a different story. Im in it right now. Its a lot of work, but DOABLE WORK. It is not crazy hard. You have to do all prelabs and postlabs on time and just follow her specific instructions (she tells you everything that you need). As for quizzes, use her outlines, OWL Homeworks, and look up the questions she tells you to look up in the textbook. There are also quizlets out there of the outlines that are nice and easy to read. I think its a lot more doable than it would be in person since all the quizzes are multiple choice. In person you had to write out your answers.

"Some notes, from a current CS Senior:  
 1. I'd take Physics over Chem. My impression of Chem is a whole lot of memorization. Physics is a lot of math, but you'll be used to that (especially the calculus) and should have an easier time keeping up.

 2. Taking 344 (design and analysis of algorithms) will probably help you in just about every other CS course going forward, and is also good practice for coding interviews you may take. Taking it before PrinProg is smart.

 3. I'd definitely keep an eye out for the CS 442-443-444 course lineup. They're taught by professors about something they're passionate in/know a lot about. They often actually have really lax requirements, like much lower than the other 400-levels.

 4. I'd also recommend looking into courses in other departments which classify as electives, if you want some diversity.

 5. Finally, and I can't stress this enough, *overapply to classes, then drop aggressively*. Courses fill up quickly, and SPNs can be brutal to get. See if you can get 3+ possible courses on your schedule going into the semester, show up to the first few lectures, then cut one or two you don't like. The last thing you want is to be stuck in an elective course you're bombing because you didn't apply to any other options.",1605164642,1,0

I could see them waiting to give a refund, but to charge you? no, they would have charged much faster than that.

One of the things I tell my current (h.s.) advisees, is to put a calendar up on the wall (where you will see it every day) and mark off how many days you have until the end of the year. (Or, semester if that helps you.) As each day passes, cross it off the calendar. Each day you cross off, tell yourself: ""I've got this. I can do this. I will do this."" Find others in your social network with whom you can study. Study buddies (either F2F or virtual) are very important, esp now, with so much distancing going on.

"""admitting that most people survive.""

With any conclusion you make, you have to realize that there are asterisks and conditions to that conclusion. 

People survive because they can get the care and treatment they need, however, like I stated in my post above, hospitals are approaching maximum capacity again. When the hospitals are full or too many healthcare workers get sick or tired, then people will not be able to get the care they need. Very, very bad things will occur as a result. The only way to prevent hospitals from reaching maximum capacity is to prevent people from needing to go to the hospital. That means we need to reduce the number of COVID cases by wearing masks and social distancing.

I choose not to look at numbers as simply a statistical percentage. Let me just also remind you that we have lost over 250,000 people to this virus already. We don't need to lose more. 

Also, I will choose to trust these official figures. COVID seems to attack the neurological system (brain fog), cardiovascular system (clots), and obviously the respiratory system (lung scars). 

When the World Trade Center went down back on 9/11, sadly, it killed a lot of people on that day. Over the last decade, we lost countless police officers, firefighters, and EMS personnel who responded, inhaled shit like asbestos, developed illnesses like cancer, and sadly lost their lives. Those countless lives who were lost were caused by the events that occurred that day.

Also, I would like to remind you that the economics professor is going down a different road from you. He is basically going down the road of pretending that COVID doesn't really exist (because he believes that it will go away after the election, thus suggesting that it is a hoax). Not only does he look like an idiot right now (there were record numbers after the election), but he really comes across as an inconsiderate jerk. I wouldn't really try and defend his credentials because clearly, he has no idea what he is talking about. I hope he is a better economics professor because...yikes....",1606248949,1,0
