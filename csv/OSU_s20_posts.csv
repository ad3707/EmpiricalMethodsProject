Curry Chicken Nuggets Review,"Hey all, Meat Science major here.

I just read the post about a chicken nugget addiction and it reminded me of the new Curry Chicken Nuggets at Scott, so I thought I'd give a review since I am, as a Meat Science Major, *completely* qualified to do so:

**1. The Meat**

As a Meat Science major, this is an analysis of the kinds of chicken used for the Curry Chicken Nuggets. They are obviously made out of higher grade chickens (if I had to guess they are probably Wyandotte or Orpington Chickens, I am not 100% sure though because it has been a while since I compared at home) and its eather breasts or high-quality thighs. This makes the meat nice and juicy and also not as fatty as the regular Breakfast Nuggets (I think I looked it up and the supplier produces the nuggets out of Polish Chickens, a subpar breast). The Curry Nuggets also therefore have better consistency from nugget to nugget. So with no downsides, I'm giving this a 9/10 in the meat category.

**2. The taste**

The seasoning on the nuggets is fantastic. I am not 100% familiar with homemade curries or anything like that, so having no other curry experience I can wholeheartedly say that the taste blows anything else at Scott out of the water. I can put any condiment (shoutout to my mayo kings) on these nuggets and they taste fantastic. I wish they were a tad bit spicier but pairing a teeny bit of siracha sauce gives the nuggets a fantastic kick. I give the taste an 8/10.

**3. The Outside**

I'm just gonna come out and say it, the Curry Nuggets look like shit. I was skeptical about trying them because of how awful they looked but after taking the leap I can say that the breading is fantastic. It is fried but not too thick and it doesn't take away from the chicken's flavor. They remind me of Chick-Fil-A's nuggets, probably a bit worse for you but nevertheless really good. I'll give it a 6/10 just because they don't look pretty.

**Recap**

The Curry Chicken Nuggets at Scott are made out of high-quality chicken and taste fantastic, even though they do not please the eye. I now eat them every day and beg the managers to keep them and add them to the Mongolian station upstairs. Fuck it, they are better than the General Tsou's chicken. I said it.

Should I bother appealing,"TL:DR; I have 33 ACT but I’m 6th decile, accepted EA PoliSci, should I bother appealing not getting any scholarships


I got admitted EA out of state (NY) for PoliSci, and I really want to go to a big school because clubs, extracurriculars, social scene etc, but I got no merit or financial aid. I want to consider appealing for a scholarship, but I technically don’t apply for them, and it’s not why you would think.

My ACT is 33, 36 on both science and reading, so that qualifies me for every scholarship. 

Last year 95% of accepted students were in the top 25% of their class, I’m in the 5%. I wasn’t even in the top half, I was 6th Decile. It’s a long story (I swear I studied for the ACT on my own, I probably should have a lot more I only did for like 2 weeks, I’m not Olivia jade tho) and my school is competitive but it isn’t *known* for being competitive. 

The criteria for the National Buckeye Scholarship, which I what I plan to ~~beg~~ appeal for is ACT 29 and to be in the top 25% of your class. I surpass the ACT criteria but I obviously don’t make the class rank criteria.

I think I could make a strong argument, my act is very good, my school is competitive, almost everyone meets this requirement according to your student profile, why should you exclude the very few “holistic” students who don’t make it, and, I was accepted into SUNY Binghamton, which is the best state school in NY which could give me much cheaper tuition, but if I got enough aid I could basically guarantee I would be going to Ohio. 

Ohio was my second top choice (GWU is #1 but we do not stan 55k tuition and 15k other expenses) and if my appeal was successful I would without a doubt confirm for Ohio State, but back to the title, should I even bother. Will they really smudge it for me? I’d appreciate any tips (also I’m just sending it to the admissions office email and just hoping it is the right one), and thanks for reading my diatribe.",1582197020,1,0
Double major questions about accounting,"Hi, I’m a freshman and majoring in mathematics major now. I will change my major to accounting in sophomore. However, I’m a little bit worried about what I should double with accounting(150 credit hrs required for CPA exam).

Is that a good idea to double accounting and actuarial science or accounting and management information system with Business analytics minor?

I remember why I chose The Ohio State University: Family,"I remember why I chose to go to Ohio State. As cheesy as it sounds, the 48,000 undergrad students here care about each other. It’s the biggest family I’ve ever been apart of.

The other night, I posted trying to figure out where free food was available around campus. See, I am very short on money ($9 to be exact) until I get paid next Friday and was trying to get by until my next paycheck by hitting up some events that offered free food. Without even asking for help from other students I had multiple students telling me they would let me use their swipes, where to go, and even had someone reach out and eventually donate money to me via Venmo. Thinks about it, strangers I’ve never met before willing to help out a fellow buckeye. 

There is not another campus in the world like Ohio State. Now, I know I get tired of my fellow peers from time to tone too, but think about it, we’re a family, as cheesy as it sounds, we help each other and you all helped me. When I graduate in a few months I will never forget this place, this campus, my classmates, the football games, the oval... I will never forget Ohio State and the people who have helped me out here. I love you all who helped me. I cannot describe how much stress has been relieved from your simple acts of kindness. I went to the store today and was able to buy food because of you all. This was honestly a life changing moment. I love you buckeye nation. Thank you.",1582171243,1,0

Networking w/ Jim Vickroy Advice?,"Much of the reviews about Jim Vickroy's class state that he was incredibly easy, class was simple, super fair, and all of that, but his section this semester is hardly that.  He's a fantastic lecturer and super open to questions, but his quizzes are, quite frankly, unreasonable and blatantly unfair.

This week's quiz was the second one in a row that asked some questions that were nowhere to be found in the material we covered.  The *only* place you might be able to find some of the information - emphasis on might - is by meticulously reading all 100+ pages of the incredibly dense networking book and remembering every last detail.  It's insanely difficult to do well at all when every quiz has questions that just flat out shouldn't be on there.

So I guess for anyone who's had him before or even those who have him now, what's the best way to proceed in the class and not do horribly?  I've studied more for this guy's quizzes than my systems II midterm and do significantly worse even still.

How hard is OSU to get in as a transfer?,"I am unlikely to be admitted to OSU as a freshman so my plan is to go to a local university in January 2021 and try to transfer to OSU for fall 2021.

Meanwhile they've sent numerous mass emails to me/ other students about things such as the P/NP situation, and one where he/she even told us to contact them by email if we have questions about anything.

I understand that advisers are especially busy right now but it's been a very long time, I've followed up, and they've also been sending me emails since then. What should I do?

How do you access academic articles/papers now?,"This is just a general question regarding access to academic papers and research. Usually, when I would be doing research for an assignment I would have access to almost all papers/articles online because the sites would recognize that I was on OSU's wifi. 

However, now I am not granted access to these articles and cant figure out how to ""log-in"" to see them. I understand that I can use the OSU library website but that is an absolute hot mess (at least in my experience). 

In short, my problem is...I cited a paper for a rough draft about 1.5 months ago. I went back to the article and was not granted access to it. When I hit ""log-in through institution"" OSU was nowhere to be found. I went to the library website and was unable to find the article. This goes for all my other papers I cited as well.

Thanks to anyone who can help!",1586538956,1,0

You can find and share notes for your classes online,"I've been working on [Beastnotes](http://www.beastnotes.com/) to help create a seamless method for capturing notes in-browser while participating in lectures or courses online, but beyond that, have built a platform for a note sharing community to blossom:

* Sharing your notes ensures you revise your learnings.
* Finding notes enables you to compare your notes with others taking the same course. Or, if you miss a lecture, see what others may have taken down.
* Upvoting or downvoting the notes you like or dislike not only allows your peers to find the highest quality notes, it offers feedback to the original note-taker.

I'd love to hear what you guys think! See the new platform here: [https://medium.com/@beastnotes/beastnotes-note-exchange-2305a4d600cd](https://medium.com/@beastnotes/beastnotes-note-exchange-2305a4d600cd)",1586537709,1,0

OSU v Emory," 

Hi everyone! I'm currently deciding between Fisher and Goizueta (I am going into Business, obviously). My main questions are:

What are the internships like at OSU? What companies offer internships, and if you had one, where was it at? And this question is probably hard to answer lol - but how would you compare this internship with Goizueta? Do you think better companies offer internships at Goizueta than Fisher (because of Atlanta), or no?

For BBA grads, what was the post-grad job experience like? What are the most common companies hiring at Fisher, and how would they compare to Goizueta? Was it easy to get a job afterwards?

Sorry about all the questions lol!!! It's hard to find recent responses to these questions from Goizueta students. I found all the statistics, but I was wondering about personal experience as well. Thanks so much!",1586441557,1,0

Should I still consider Biochem for a major even if my chemistry foundations aren't all that good?,"So I am going to be a student this coming fall and I am really excited, but I am worried a bit about grades. I wasn't really an over achiever as the high school I went to made even regular classes a lot of work to handle. I goofed off in freshman year and I didn't know the honors courses were that hard because in middle school they felt hella easy(sorry if I am going too far back), but they were extremely difficult and considering I was just getting used to high school I couldn't keep up. My overall unweighted GPA from 9-12 grade semester 1 is a 3.45. From these years I have figured I would pursue a major in the Biology field and thought I would likely get farther if I took something like Biochemistry. I like bio a lot and I know my strengths and want to improve on my weaknesses. The problem I have is chemistry. I don't hate chem I think its pretty interesting, but my foundations are not good at all. I had to take it in sophomore year and my teacher was totally useless and never taught. She just gave us worksheets to do and labs, but I never learned anything as it all just felt like busy work. With this quarantine I thought I would take time to maybe self-study some chemistry to get some things down but beyond the really basic shit I can't remember anything at all. Its not that its hard which makes it even more annoying. The websites I use explain everything simply and are to the point. Overall, Im also quite worried about my grades because Ive heard people with 3.8s getting lower than 2.0s which scares the living crap out of me. 

So my question is: Should I still take Biochem as a major or reconsider if self-studying isn't working out(but still keep to the bio field)?",1586411887,2,0

"Can’t reach professor, mistake on exam submission","For my microeconomics course, the final exam answer sheet was an excel file that we submitted through email. My dumbass accidentally submitted the answer sheet for one of our midterms instead of for the final exam. My professor emailed me about an hour after I submitted and asked for the correct file. I did not receive the email right away and by the time I checked my emails (about an hour later) he had sent another saying that it was too late to turn in my exam.

I immediately sent an apology as well as the correct answer sheet to the email, as well as sent an email to his osu email address explaining what happened (he created a special email for exam submission), as well as a message on Carmen. This was Thursday morning and I have yet to receive a response. I have no idea if he recieved my correct exam, or if he will accept it. 

I sent an additional email last night (he is in South Korea currently so it was Monday morning for him). I attached the exam file again, as well as a screenshot detailing that the file has not been edited since the given time period.

I still have no response, and I am looking for any advice. If he doesn’t accept my exam and I fail can I reach out the dean? Is there any way to contact professors other than email during this pandemic? Will my advisor be able to reach him? 

Tl;dr: Accidentally submitted the wrong exam file, and now I can’t reach the professor to find out if he will accept the correct one.",1588588995,1,0

Transfer dilemma - OSU vs UVA: Stay or go?,"I'm currently a rising Sophomore with Business IS Major at Fisher. I applied for transfer to UVA and got accepted to the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. I want to apply to McIntyre College (business) my 3rd year - but that's super competitive and pretty good chance that I may not make it. If I don't get in, then chances are that I will be an Econ major.

I am super confused in deciding if I should stay or transfer out. I am from NoVA and have a lot of friends going there. I don't have any issues at OSU and definitely love here - so it was not a transfer out of distress. With my National Buckeye scholarship, fees are the same between the two. It comes down to business vs non-business, UVA brand vs OSU, being in the top 10% at OSU vs below that at UVA (possibly), etc. My future plans are - job first and then possibly MBA later.

Please thank your TAs,"I’m a TA for a STEM department and I spent all day applying for minimum wage jobs and the OSU emergency fund. The University has put summer research pay for most TAs on hold... our last paycheck comes on the 15th and it looks like that’s all we’re going to get until the end of August. Even though we research and teach 40+ hours per week, OSU has classified us as students rather than regular employees (to reduce the unemployment insurance the university has to pay) so TAs and RAs aren’t eligible for unemployment. Many of us have student loans and families, and many of us don’t get help from our parents. 

My department hasn’t announced fall pay yet, so there’s a likely chance we’ll also see a pay cut. 

I’m not asking for pity, but if you have a TA who went the extra mile for you - even if it was years ago - please thank them.

Just another rant,I'm a full-time OSU employee in dining services.I am lucky enough to benefit from their generous tuition assistance program. The current disaster leave ends today. And we have heard no further announcements. I understand that this is a unprecedented situation. But I'm not sure the University appreciates that some of its buckeye family  rely on OSU not just for full-time employment but to further their own education. leaving full-time staff members in the dark about possible layoff decisions seems extremely cruel especially since some of these students might be forced to pay for classes they were expecting to be covered by OSU tuition assistantI and and currently bin class. I am now left in the unevitable position of possibly losing my job and being removed tuition assistance from school with a $3500 bill on the way due to revoked employee tuition assistance. I understand The complication of the situation the world is in right now but but it doesn't reduce the amount of extreme stress that I'm under with the possibility of losing both employment health insurance and school.

I've talked to my advisor a couple times and apparently there is a petition process that I could try by writing basically a plea to let me waive the math and foreign language, but I would still have to pass a data analysis class, which frankly if that was all I had to worry about I could definitely try and scrape by, but she says the petition is a hard thing to have pass.

Should I do p/f or take a letter grade?,"Hi! I’m sorry, I know these types of questions may be annoying by now, but I’m currently a high school senior taking classes at OSU. I’m thinking about whether I should take a p/f grade instead of a letter grade in my English 1101 class. I know that it’s an easy class, but my professor grades pretty randomly and the grading criteria is pretty confusing, and I would often ask her how to improve my work. The assignments also take a while to grade, which is why I’m thinking about about taking the p/f in the case that  the grades aren’t updated by April 17. The reason I’m asking is because I’m going into tOSU as a premed student, and I’m not sure of the implications that it may have on my grad school applications.

My cases for doing so:
- It takes up 50% of my week and stress. I could be making $200+ more per week at work (fast food, assuming it doesn’t shut down), while honing my other skills/hobbies. 
- I’m not good at Calc, even with university online. I had to go to MSLC every weekday it was open, and I’m at a 85%. 
- It would bring my GPA up. 
- I’m 90% sure it isn’t required for my future courses.
- I’m 90% sure I’m not getting financial aid anyway. 
- Otherwise, I have a pretty good work ethic, and wouldn’t drop more than one more class in my undergrad (I’m a sophomore now). 

My cases against it:
- If my job (fast food) does get shut down, I might as well do Calc. 
- Without it, I’d only be doing 10 credit hours this semester. Still, I’d have 80.5 total (of AP classes, completed courses, other current courses, and possible summer courses)

Accused for Academic Misconduct on Ecampus Final Exam- How to best handle allegations,"I'm an Ecampus Post Bac CS student. I received an email from one of my professors that they found a case of potential academic misconduct on the final exam and you would have an incomplete/(letter grade) on your transcript. 

I absolutely did not think I would be one of these students, but looked and saw I had an I/(letter grade) for the course. 

Due to Covid the exam was unproctored and I got a letter yesterday saying I was one of 15 students that all wrote the same incorrect code on one of the questions. 

I have to meet with an academic Hearing Officer in two weeks to discuss and find out if I'll be found guilty or not. The professor said they found the question online and is assuming all the students looked it up. While I was studying I used a Quizlet list that had the function included with other functions I thought were just from the course material. 

The professor said if we are found guilty we will most likely receive the letter grade on our current transcript, which is one full letter grade lower than what I earned in the course. This seems odd to me because it seems like the professor has already decided what punishment the students will receive if found guilty, in this case a lower grade but not a 0 on the exam or failing the course. 

Does anyone have any advice or how this process works for Ecampus students? I already scheduled a meeting with the Student Advocacy office to help me. I feel like it'll be hard to defend myself since I unintentionally used code I had studied for a question on the final someone submitted online to get an answer for.",1585340415,1,0

My cousin received an email from his professor from fall 2019 semester saying he messed up on his grades. He already graduated,"Professor apologized and told him that his final two exams were graded incorrectly by a TA. He will receive an A- instead of a C+. Since he graduated he really didn't care but got an email from his Professor to go to Academic records to finalize the who situation. 

Professor submitted a grade change and the college of arts and sciences isn't replying, I'm assuming because nobody is there due to Coronavirus. 

He instructed him to contact the Academic records and some lady over there said she will make a quick grade change with professor approval when she returns in April (Idk why in april). 

Is it really that simple? Academic records can just make changes just like that with professor approval. This whole situation made me realize how weird the whole university bureaucracy operates lmao. Just let the professor change the transcript for his course.",1585292660,1,0
An other out of state student still in Ohio trying to decide whether to stay or leave?,"I’m an out of state senior from California. I’m currently debating whether or not to go there.

Thoughts/advice on fear of teachers?,"INteresting title I know but what can ya do

So, you think that I'd know how to deal with this being in my fifth fucking year but part of the reason I'm in my FIFTH YEAR is I'm terrified of teachers hating me.

I am, to put it nicely, disabled and I still am not great at dealing with it but I'm getting better. However it causes me to miss class, miss assignments, and generally not be a great student. I have disability accommodations that I either forget to send until the middle of the semester, or I send and then not really do anything with because again I'm terrified in general.

Because of this, I am convinced all the time that my teachers hate me, and that they think I'm simply trying to find an excuse to slack off. That if I tell them something's up and ask for assistance/time/make up they'll basically say 'fuck u be a better student' so I end up doing nothing at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, also making it even MORE difficult to go to class which makes things worse and it's a huge ass snowball.

Get out of Classes (for Almost Free) Card,"What's boppin Buckeyes? It's ya boi HiPigdom here bringing you the down and dirty on how to get out of all those boring classes that you learned in 10th grade in between your teacher ranting about her divorce. If you've seen half of my posts on this Reddit page, you will know what I'm about to talk about. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Credit by Exam

**HiPigdom, what the hell is that?**

Good question. After talking with multiple departments at **The Ohio State University** **^(TM)**  who say they offer credit by exam, I can tell you that you know about as much as any staff member at this university. 

[For a quick reference, click here.](https://registrar.osu.edu/priorlearning/examination-credit.html)

Credit by exam is a way to shorten your time towards a degree here at OSU, but nobody does it. Tests are through various companies/departments and cost varying amounts. The three I will talk about most are **College Level Examination Program (CLEP), EM Tests, and Departmental Exams.** 

&amp;#x200B;

# CLEP Tests

*AKA half my courses completed here at OSU*

[CLEP's Site](https://clep.collegeboard.org/register)

[Here's all the juicy shit you won't have to do, if you look closely, you'll see MATH1151](https://registrar.osu.edu/priorlearning/clep-tests.html)

First and foremost: **CLEPS Cost around $119 per test, unless you are military affiliated.** 

&amp;#x200B;

CLEPS are multiple choice tests that are produced by the same company as your AP high school tests. For some reason, the college level tests for these classes are much, much easier. I've casually walked in, taken a test, then walked out with +3 credit hours to my transcript in under a half an hour. The College Board charges you a fee to register for the test, then OSU charges you a fee to take the test, because they've ~~gotta siphon money off broke college students~~ support operations somehow. **CLEP Tests are 90 minutes long, and can be anywhere from 44 questions to 150 some questions.**  Longest one I've taken was the biology test, I think it was 141 questions. **Your raw test score is converted to a score between 20 and 80, 50 being the equivalent of passing the test with a C. Ohio State doesn't care if you passed the test, they care about if you passed with a score acceptable enough for their liking.** For instance, the Calculus CLEP test, Ohio State sets the minimum passing score to 64 instead of 50. Don't hate the OSU Testing Center for this stuff. The math department sets this requirement, not the nice people at OSU Testing. **Failing a CLEP Test will not hurt your GPA or affect you in any way, aside from losing your money.** So far, these tests have been the easiest for me to pass by far. 

If you fail a CLEP test, you can still retake the CLEP test at a later date. You can also try and take the EM test or Departmental Exam for that topic. Likewise, if you fail a CLEP test, you can still take the EM/Departmental Exam.

&amp;#x200B;

# DSST

[Their Site](https://www.getcollegecredit.com/exam_fact_sheets/) 

[See what the Ohio State Testing Center has to say about DSST](https://registrar.osu.edu/priorlearning/dsst-tests.html)

I have yet to take a DSST, only putting it here because someone may want to take one. Again, free for military. **Civilians have to pay DSST $85 for a test, then OSU another $30 ish. Please note that Ohio State only awards credit for three DSST tests.** Failing this test will not affect your grade or transcript in any way.

If you fail a DSST, you can pay to retake it. You can also take the CLEP, EM Test, or Departmental Exam on the subject if you don't want to take the DSST again. 

&amp;#x200B;

# EM Tests

*A New Hope*

[What the Ohio State Testing Center has to say about EM tests.](https://registrar.osu.edu/priorlearning/em-tests.html)

EM Tests are basically the **Ohio State equivalent of CLEP tests**. ~~Less effort put into actually making the test as every one I've taken is filled with typos and grammatical errors~~ Efficiently made and ~~more likely to fuck you over for no reason~~ academically rigorous. **They are $60, and you get one go at it. Military get it for free.** Some are on Carmen, you go to the testing center, log in, take a 100 question test, and suddenly you don't have to take BIO 1113. Although they are cheaper, I would recommend taking the CLEP test first. Only use EM tests if you failed the CLEP, or if CLEP doesn't offer a test in that subject. **Some tests, like Physics and Chemistry, provide formula sheets to use. Some tests, like chemistry or earth science, require permission from the department before you are allowed to take it.**  Some tests are entirely multiple choice, some are entirely essay based. Some are designed to ~~fuck you over~~ remind you collegiate calculus is different than high school calculus. **Failing an EM Test will not impact your GPA or leave any negative mark on your record, you simply fed Ohio State $60 and are barred from taking the test again.** 

If you fail an EM test, you can still take the CLEP test. Likewise, if you fail a CLEP test, you can still take the EM/Departmental Exam.

&amp;#x200B;

# Departmental Exams

*""I've been teaching ENR2100 for 12 years now and you are the first person to make this request so its very rare.""- Professor Brian Lower*

*""What?""- Fisher College of Business*

*""What are you talking about test?"" -College of Education and Human Ecology*

*""It has been a few years since anyone has requested this so the test will need to be reviewed by the course coordinator""-Random Point of Contact for BUSMGT 2320*

*"".....""-Nearly every other damn department.*  

[See what the Ohio State Testing Center has to say about departmental tests.](https://registrar.osu.edu/priorlearning/departmental-exams.html)

&amp;#x200B;

**Same as EM Tests, just taken at the college/department rather than the OSU Testing Center.** I have yet to take a departmental test, but I'm scheduled to take a bunch of them for shits and giggles. **(Military affiliated, again the test is free. Civilians pay $60.)** Many departments have no clue what the hell you are talking about when you talk to them about the test. Others are skeptical, some flat out won't return your phone calls or emails. (Looking at you Professor Slater and Professor Bomser). These tests are even more varied than the EM tests offered by the testing center. **Power move: Most Departmental Exams are either the same final the professor is giving everyone else that semester, or it is a generic final for the class. Taking the test is $60, and if you fail, at least you will know exactly what to study in order to pass the final when you have to take the class.** 

If you fail a departmental exam, you can still take the CLEP test. Likewise, if you fail a CLEP test, you can still take the EM/Departmental Exam.

# A Very, Very, Very Important Note on Departmental Testing

[Easter Egg Generator](https://classes.osu.edu/class-search/#/)

**The Ohio State Testing Center does not list all Departmental tests on their site.** The College/Department has to notify the testing center to tell them to update their site. Due to the fact that Ohio State ~~is hell bent on collecting the most money for the least amount of effort~~ there is no streamlined method that I know of to have these colleges communicate with the testing center (Aside from calling the center or emailing them, but who does that?), you may have to search for EM tests on your own. This is how I found out ENR 2100 and ENR 3300 had EM tests, along with what appears to be all CONSYSM/AGSYSM courses and a lot of medical major stuff. There is another reason why these departmental exams aren't posted on the Testing Centers website. Staff come and go. Very few people utilize these tests, despite the massive cost savings they can provide you. The lady at the front desk might only be a work studies student, and nobody told her about Departmental Testing. A professor may leave and never tell people that they had a test in place. As such, you may have to contact the department. Use the link above to see what classes there is a test for. I liked to show them screenshots from the Easter egg generator to prove my point. The general reaction seemed to be ""Oh wow, I didn't know my department even offered that, I guess I'll just give you the final for the course."" **The testing center doesn't know these tests exist, the departments don't know these tests exist, the the professors that teach the class don't know these tests exist, and Ohio State doesn't advertise these tests** **~~(Because why would they? The test is $60 and the class is what? $900, plus a book deal?)~~****. It is up to you to contact them and see if they will honor a commitment they made many moons ago.** I've had more professors contact me saying they will make a test just for me (or just hand me their pre made final) than I have go cold on me or say that test is no longer offered. **The more people that call and ask, the more likely this program is to expand.**   


# TL;DR

Tests are cheap. College is expensive. Taking these tests can help you graduate early, free up time during hectic semesters, and/or allow you to get a minor more easily. Not being required to take a stressful (or boring class) is a great feeling.

Snow Wars,"Ladies and Gentlemen,

As luck would have it, we have ourselves what  seems to be what I fondly remember as “packing snow.”

This got the snowball rolling, and here I am wondering if anyone else would be interested in “Snow Wars” (SW, pronounced S-dub, trademark pending)?

In short, SW would consist of the Physics department faculty and students against the Math department faculty and students, leading legions in good sport for fitness, fun and maybe a little bonding as a happy byproduct, bc we all know we all love to hate overtly mentioning prosocials as perks for attendance when we all secretly love prosocials. Maybe inter team hot cocoa to diffuse remaining hostilities after, idk. 

These would be *NONVIOLENT (ex. snowballs are fine, ice balls are not; snowball throwing is fine, taking out your latent resentment of your father is not) and MERITOCRATIC (the more esteemed the faculty member, or bigger the ego of the student in question, the more they would have to prove their worth to the Order) wars of however many independent Orders self-organize.

*for Insurance purposes, everyone involved would have to Accept that, should they die, or worse yet be vegetabilized in the Heat of Battle, the onus would be on them and their social support system to take care of their carcass, lest we catapult what was once ‘them’ into the sun in the name of science.

Taking Foundations 2 without credit for stat 3470,"I’m an Honors Math and CIS double major. I will be a second year during AU20 and SP21. Now, for AU20, my schedule is as follows:
Math 5520H (5CH), Math 5529H (5CH), 
CSE 2231 (4CH), and CSE 2321 (3CH). Total: 17CH

Similarly, for SP21:
Math 5530 (5CH), Math 5522H (5CH), 
CSE 2331 (3CH), and CSE 2421 (4CH). Total: 17CH

I am also taking courses during SU20, and am unable to take stat 3470 because it conflicts with CSE 2221.

Basically, my question is, is there any way the CSE department would make an exception and let me take foundations 2 without having credit for stat 3470? I have credit for stat 2450 if that is at all relevant, and I would be taking Math 5530H concurrently with foundations 2, which is an honors probability course. 

I’ve already emailed the CSE department about my current situation. I’m just curious if anyone has been in a similar position or has any knowledge pertaining to this matter.

Telecommuting requirement for employees who can,"Daddy Drake sent an email tonight mentioning if you can work remote, do so. I don't see it up on the website yet but here's the copy/paste from that section:

Teleworking requirements

We require all employees who can do so to work from home.

Across all campuses, only critical services will be maintained on university property. These include law enforcement and public safety; hospitals and health services; child care; limited meal preparation and service; facility utilities; residential support; and others determined to be essential by the university. Senior vice presidents and deans will make determinations related to working on campus in these areas.

If employees, including student employees, have questions about whether to telework or come to campus to work, please reach out to your college or unit leader for clarification.

If it is not essential for you to be on campus but your duties can’t be completed through teleworking, or if you don’t have the resources to telework, your Human Resources Business Professionals will work with you to determine next steps.

Graduate associates who have questions relating to their duties, or their ability to perform their duties away from campus, should consult directly with their supervising unit.",1584412044,1,0
"The economic crisis is coming, maybe is the best time for us?","We're in a tough economic climate and the dream job you want might not be available for the next few years. I am currently developing an alternative economic system and would love to know how you think about it. 

The idea was to provide an ecosystem where economic activity can happen in it, without being interfered with /regulated by the current capitalism+nation setting. A system that part of it will rely on peer-to-peer technology for censorship-resistance other crucial deliverables needed for the project, such as programmable contract and inherent currency. I am also thinking about an ID system supporting a higher level of cooperation and weighted democracy, and other performance enhancement, such as privacy protection using zero-knowledge proofs.

In short, its current form is an online software (it's in beta). The infrastructure of the transaction and most of the scripting was provided by a blockchain-based platform called Ethereum. Now it can: create financial services such as banks, investment services and set the rules by themselves. I have designed a visual programming language to make it easy for people that don't code. The system can also generate a mechanism on demand that might provide job opportunities. Currently, I only have enough time to develop an agent-based sales system. There is also a mechanism that allows people to make derivatives and other financial instruments, but it's not completely done yet.

I am looking forward to discussing the idea with people that would be interested in what this system stands for, and coming up with more idea and feature to put in there.

Just like how Wei Dai put it in his famous b-money essay: ""A community is defined by the cooperation of its participants, and efficient cooperation requires a medium of exchange (money) and a way to enforce contracts.""

Let me know if you are interested.",1584410968,1,0

I have a dark confession that's been weighing on me. I'm sorry to dampen the mood but I need to get this off my chest.,"No way to say this without sounding like a total pos but:

We were at a typical drug-filled frat party. The girl wasn't the brightest so we got her faded with a drink/drug mix and threw her in a bathroom. She was passing out so my friend's first idea was to give her some of his clothes to make everything look like it was consensual (his logic not mine). All I did was keep lookout and helped change her clothes some. He sent us videos of what happened the next day and we never told a soul.

We were made to feel this sort of behavior was okay. It was even encouraged during my time there. Brothers don't snitch so I was never caught in any of this (used gloves to avoid fingerprints). But looking back I regret it everyday. I feel I'll never be able to reconcile this in my head...I can't imagine how she feels.

After we graduate I'll send an apology letter to her family. I want to be sure I have my diploma first because I don't want to risk expulsion. I'm not giving anymore details because it's not worth the risk.

If she ever does see this, *I'm sorry*. There's nothing else I can say. I feel like shit whenever I think about it and yeah...I'm deeply sorry for this whole situation.

To the guy at Wendy's last night with the camo cargo pants who's hand I shook- You inspired me and I'd like to actually meet you.,"Last night I was at Wendy's around 11pm last night, and went up to a kiosk next to 2 guys who were wearing ""Rambo-esque"", I'd guess for a party. The guy with camo cargo pants was shorter than the friend, and was talking to him about some pretty personal stuff and went on about some of the hardships he's faced lately/is still facing. Then he talked about how he was turning all of those things into positives and using them as motivation to keep work hard here. I'm leaving out a lot of details for the sake of privacy, but I think this gets the idea across. 

I admittedly was drunk and couldn't help but listen in and feel inspired. I've had a very hard time so far here at college and felt like I could relate to so much of what you had been saying. My dad was diagnosed with cancer 3 weeks into my first year here, and died on Reading Day of the following semester. I had to do a retroactive withdraw from all of my courses because I ended up missing all of my finals and turned a decent semester useless after working so hard to get through. Last semester I had more disaster and fell into even more hard times and have been struggling to find the drive or motivation to keep going as this semester rolls on. 

You inspired me through your words and your ability to just keep going. The things you were saying gave me a whole different outlook on my situation, something I've been searching for for a long time. I wanted to talk to you, but in my drunken state I couldn't manage much more than coming over, apologizing for tuning into the conversation, but thanking him for the wisdom I've been needing for far too long before shaking his hand. 

If you're out there, or might know this guy, please get in contact with me. I'd really like to properly meet you and get a chance to talk about life a little. You genuinely made a difference in my life in one of the places and times I least expected, and I appreciate that to no end.",1579976274,1,0

My Off-Campus Roommate Almost Burned The Apartment Down (and Other Fun Tales About My Personal Living Hell),"Gather round, Buckeyes, because I’ve got some fucked up shit to tell you. 

This semester, I wound up with a random roommate in a two bedroom off campus apartment because my previous roommate (who I adored) faced an unexpected personal tragedy and had to drop out and move out. We scrambled to find a replacement and this random replacement from Facebook is very, very difficult. I was a fool for thinking “it will only be four months. How bad can it be?”

It has only been 3 weeks but I am not sure if I can last the whole semester. 

To start, we have your average, run of the mill, annoying but BEARABLE issues:

-not doing dishes
-letting food rot in the fridge
-weird smell in her room/when she leaves the bathroom
-not taking out trash or replacing items she uses (such as chipping in for paper towels, dish soap, etc.)
-stealing my food and laundry detergent
-leaving clothes in the dryer
-leaving hair on the shower walls
-leaving junk around the house 

And I KNOW, r/OSU— I know what you’re thinking. “Just talk to her! Have a good long talk! Be honest! Be gentle but firm!”

We have had three of these already, each lasting approximately an hour. We tried a written roommate agreement (that lasted all of three days), I offered to have her friend mediate, and I really, really tried explaining the things she does that upset me and how it makes me feel. Here’s the worst part — she is SUPER sweet and takes it super well, crying and apologizing because she feels bad and promising to do better — before continuing to do it 5 minutes later. It feels like I’m babysitting and I can’t keep harping on her. I can’t just constantly tell her to do her dishes, clean up, etc. It’s not good for either of us. I think she genuinely means well but she lacks mindfulness and it’s become unbearable.

But that was alllllll before this week. This week? Buckle in Buckeyes because this shit gets even crazier.

This past week, things became particularly miserable and terrible and vile. 

Her room and belongings have always sort of smelled, but this week it was STRONG. I’ve started picking my battles with her and decided that I could put up with dirty dishes and rotting salad if I knew what was going on. 

I confronted her. 

Homegirl said she has an STI. Which like, happens. That’s fine. I attend sex week events. I’m not gonna ostracize honey for contracting something.

But.

This bitch brought back TWO SEPARATE GUYS on TWO SEPARATE DAYS to FUCK WHILE I WAS HOME after I SPECIFICALLY ASKED HER NOT TO DO FUCK DUDES WHILE I WAS HOME.

SHE KEPT. THE DOOR. OPEN.

(I didn’t see dick, I did see one (1) nipple :/)

And I know I know I know this sounds like a shit post but I swear to god I’m living in actual hell. I have LIVED in the library and at my office this week because every time I come home there’s another problem.

But it gets WORSE!

So now the house smells like rank cooch. Okay. Fine. Whatever.  Homegirl is potentially breaking the law by not disclosing her STI to her partners. I’m just trying to survive. Just trying to ignore her.

But she has a DOG and this DOG has left four big ass turds in the kitchen! It’s been THREE WEEKS!!!!!! It’s a good dog. Great dog. Fantastic dog. I don’t blame the dog. I love dogs. But my roommate is NEVER home and can’t take the dog out. It just sits in her room alone most of the day. I mentioned this to her once and she became extremely confrontational and said that I could “walk the dog if I was worried about her shitting in the house.” 

Again, I swear to god, this isn’t a shitpost. Apart from the part of the post that involves LITERAL SHIT!!!!!!! IN MY HOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Tonight, though, was the tipping point. 

She started a fire. She was microwaving something dry with a paper towel on top for like 5 minutes (not the brightest Buckeye in the box I know) and it caught fire. She wouldn’t even have noticed if I didn’t go in the kitchen to find a ball of flames and the unforgiving face of satan himself peering out of our magical black box that turns cold pasta into mostly warm pasta with a weird cold spot in the middle no matter how much you stir and how long you cook it. She turned the microwave black and filled the house with smoke, and although she promised to pay whatever that takes out of the security deposit, I’m worried because she estranged from her family, completely on her own financially, and I don’t know if she has the money. I don’t even care about the money necessarily. This whole place REEKS of smoke and I feel like I’m going insane. I just want out.

I have until April 31st — then I get to move in with some of my good friends. I genuinely don’t know if I can last that long. My house is filled with smoke and dog shit and pussy stink and I’m up to my eyeballs in worry about dealing with our shitty landlords about fighting for every cent of our security deposit that we can still claim. 

I want to move out like TOMORROW but she doesn’t really have anybody and I’d feel personally responsible because she’s mentioned being at risk of being homeless before.

I can’t take this. I might have to move out. This feels like a bad dream.

Alright that’s it (I fucking hope.)",1579845636,1,0

Have we all lost respect for each other? People have been crashing down the hallway at 1 in the morning, drunkenly shouting and laughing way too loudly for a Tuesday night. The bathrooms are so horrible—last semester at least people bothered to throw paper towels in trash, now they litter the floor and hang from the walls. What looks like shaved pubic hair covers the toilet seat and shower floor. Music is always blasted from at least three different rooms at all times, doors are slammed with passion and last night some asshole started pounding on our door and then ran away. The room next to us has been banging on the wall and despite us asking them to be a little quieter multiple times, show no signs of stopping.

What to do about a poor TA?,"I want to be clear that 'poor' means ""shitty"" and not ""financially destitute"".

My TA for my chem 1220 recitation is honestly on my last nerve. She flies through explanations of things even when we ask her to slow down, then she takes that as a ""oh I'm not going fast enough"" and straight up puts Sonic to shame. If she asks us questions and doesn't get an immediate answer, she say something along the lines of ""Oh, so I guess no one did this question? That means all of you get partial credit \[for the activity graded on completion\] then. That's fine, makes my job easier. Someone give me an answer or you all get half-credit.""

Today, she asked if we would be interested in a study session before the next exam, and when a couple people nodded, she said ""Fine but if I have one and no one shows up I'll give you all zeroes on the next quiz and tell the prof to make all future quizzes impossibly hard, I'm a student here too and my time is valuable so don't waste it.""

Maybe I'm just being sensitive, but all of the other TAs I've had for other classes have all been pretty chill, kind of easy-going, acknowledge when we don't know something or take a non-answer as not knowing something, and then backtracking to explain and making sure we know it. If I'm just being a snowflake please call me out, but I don't think I am. I feel like she's just doing this because she has to and doesn't really give a shit about recitation. Is there anything to do about this, any way to go over her head, even? I've reached just about my last nerve with her.",1581962378,1,0

I'm an out of stater who just got accepted to a doctor of nursing practice program at OSU.  Now, I'm not from Ohio but I've heard and read this is a pretty good school and program (thus why I applied to the program!).  I also applied to some other schools in Illinois and Alabama.    Problem is-- those schools' decisions come out AFTER  OSU's deadline date that I am required to accept or decline my offer! The sticker price for OSU is 98k.  I was a bit shocked.  They must of raised tuition.   Can anyone tell me if it's worth it for the buckeye doctorate on the wall at the end?  To be fair, the Illinois school is also 100k, and I think the Alabama one is about 60k?  DNP programs around the country seem to be between 50-100k for public and 150-200k+ for private (no way in hell).

Looking for off campus roommates.,"I'm planning to rent a house off campus for 2020 fall to 2021 spring semester. I have found some nice houses. Close to north campus, about 10 min walk, 600-700 dollars per month, but are not furnished. I haven't made decision on which one to rent for now. Is there anyone who wants to be roommates with me?

y'all complain too much,"If you google search ""osu reddit"" the top results are ""is osu really that bad?"", ""osu really pisses me off"", ""am i really the only one getting a bad taste for osu"". The problems are universal to almost all major schools. Just cause you bombed your midterm after procrastinating the past 4 weeks and avoiding office hours is not proof the university is out to get you. You are not required to live in luxury apartments. The clocktower was not osu using your tuition money to buy a landmark for a local businessman. Just because the university looks different from back in your time (the jurassic period) does not mean the university went to shit",1581787699,1,0

SEXUAL ASSAULT ADVICE,"I was called tonight and a friend of a friend was sexually assaulted and most likely drugged. She is sluggish but still slightly coherent, and is rejecting all attempts asking her to go to the hospital to get checked up (If not the trauma kit, getting looked at for whatever is in her system). 

She was assaulted before in the past, and the last hospital made things extremely hard for her so she is hesitant to go. 

Besides contacting RA/RM and maybe OSU PD, how should one go about this situation?

Would it be terrible to call OSU PD to do a “wellness check” on her?

Please leave advice below! Conflicted on next steps.",1581752238,1,0

CSE 2321 Foundations Help,"I am taking 2321 this semester and am utterly lost. My professor offers no underlying theory of anything we are doing and just flies through problems. The homeworks are extremely difficult variations of the problems he went over on the board. Their are no other problems to learn from other than these. The answers to said problems are only posted weeks after we have moved on from the material. 

We are currently doing asymptotic analysis of for/while loops but are beginning to transition into recursion analysis. I need some place that offers solid explanations on this stuff. I have searched youtube which offers plenty of videos, but I don't know if this stuff is what the professor intends to test us on. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",1581727487,1,0

Complaining ahead:

I just failed his midterm and I'm feeling angry as fuck right now. It's obviously my fault that I failed but I really do feel that he did not prepare us well enough for that exam. His lectures feel absolutely irrelevant and a complete fucking drift. The practice exam didn't help or prepare me one bit. He said the exam would only take 60 / 90 minutes but no one finished on time. I hope I'm not the only one that feels this way.  Please share your thoughts on this persons of 3202.",1581709325,1,0
PSA for off-campus students. There are door to door scammers going around.,"A guy knocked on my door and said he was with some energy company. He showed me a id card and then started to say how there was some new law and that our electricity/gas bills could be lowered if we qualify and that he needed to see my gas and electricity bills. He tried to make it seem like he was associated wit AEP. When I told him my roommates pays for those utilities he said he would come back tomorrow. It seemed fishy so I looked it up and its a scam called ""slamming"" where they use your account number that they see on your bill, and use it to sign you up for a long term contract with high rates. I'll put some links, it looks like this has happened to other college areas.

Different size housing with 4 people,"So we have to duo groups that are interested in getting double rooms. However, if we can't secure double rooms we were interested in doing a quad instead. Is there any way to ensure both possibilities? I theorized that we should just use the same housing preference ranking, keep a quad group, and hope for the best though I wasn't sure if there was another way.",1588009152,0,0
