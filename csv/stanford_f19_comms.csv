"Would probably be pretty tricky because you’d have to:
1) Convince the administration to let you take the core and capstone project at the same time;
2) Block off at least 17 units a quarter to complete the ~50 total units in one year, alongside whichever classes you need to finish undergrad;
3) Choose a specialization whose required courses don’t conflict with core classes. 

I recommend talking to Jonathan and/or Meghan about your questions (their emails should be here somewhere: https://fsi.stanford.edu/masters-degree/content/ips-home ). 

As for selectivity, I can’t really speak to specific numbers but I’d say it helps to have an academic mentor in FSI, which you may already have if you’re studying IR, PoliSci, Econ, etc. 

Hope this helps.

"This is the real answer. Your tire is probably fine. Other than a bad tube, it's most likely that if a tire was punctured, whatever went in could still be sticking out on the inside of the tire. Feel along the inside of the tire and make sure there are no sharp little bits. Whenever you get a flat, make sure you clean the inside of the tire and inspect it. Takes about a minute, and will save you having to replace all over again five minutes later.


Another possibility is the inside of the rim on the wheel. If the tube/tire weren't installed properly, it can cause the tube to get kinked/pinched which can cause issues. Make sure the tube and tire are lined up nicely as you install.

Related to the rim, make sure the rim tape is covering the spoke holes. If the tape is worn down/missing/misaligned, the tube can rub along the sharper edge of the hole and puncture. The bike shop can sell/install fresh rim tape for you if you wish.

Lastly, make sure you have enough air in the tires. If the pressure is too low, you can get pinch flats.

"Context:

I took CME 100 with Vadim last fall and MATH 51 with Lucianovic last winter. I got an A in both. 

Executive summary:

Math 51 was easier to get an A in. Why? MATH 51 has a better curriculum, and better teaching strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Vadim’s a good teacher, I would go for him 

So is Lucianovic. In terms of the quality of teaching, I choose Lucianovic over Vadim. Vadim is still a great guy.

&gt; Take CME instead. Vadim is amazing. 

Students think Vadim's amazing because maybe 1 or 2 lectures out of the quarter some kid asks a question which Vadim deems worth his sass. Outside of that, he's a normal teacher.

&gt; It's a Stanford tradition to get sassed by Vadim. 

You'll have plenty of Stanford traditions. As of reading that comment, you now know about the tradition. You shouldn't drag yourself through CME100, becoming frustrated with the class, for the ability to tell people that you saw someone get sasses by Vadim.

He's fun to listen to only when someone asks a question that warrants his sass. When he's not, he's literally racing through the material. He doesn't like to stop because there is too much material for him to cover at a reasonable pace.

Meanwhile, the students are struggling to keep up with his pace of teaching. Since the *average CME 100 student* is lagging behind the material, it's hard to actually understand the tested material. 

Given that context, your ability to get an A in the class could be left up to a few factors: the difficulty of the exams (changes per year), your ability to truly digest the curriculum (harder to do than Math 51), and your performance relative to the rest of the class (changes per year and is a function of your understanding of the material).

I say digesting the curriculum of CME 100 is harder than it is with MATH 51 because MATH 51 has a better structure. The material naturally progresses from one topic to the next. Also, each topic in MATH 51 is given ample time to digest and for the student to ask questions in lecture / office hours **before** psets and exams. This *luxury* is not present in the CME 100 structure because the class moves too quickly.

I want to echo moxqianty's comment on how MATH 51 is a newly redesigned class. The old *stories* about MATH 51 are obsolete as of now.

**Knowing what I know now, if I were entering Stanford, I would take MATH 51 over CME 100.**

The “basis for the assertion” is just my thoughts on what I’ve observed in office hours.

As for coterming, I don't think it's nearly as competitive as if you're applying to the masters from outside Stanford. A *lot* of people coterm, and I'm struggling to think of anyone I know that had good undergrad grades, applied, and got rejected (although there's definitely sampling bias). As I understand it, the two primary factors, in order, are your undergrad grades in CS classes (which will be seen as a predictor of grades for the masters) and faculty recommendations.

I spent the first 2 months on a cleanup project, basically just deleting unused A/B tests from the codebase, which was really hard (I basically had to touch every part of the codebase, since there were A/B tests in so many places) and not very rewarding. The last month I spent trying to improve an old legacy content publishing system, and by the time I started understanding the code well enough to make significant changes, my internship was over. However, I think a smaller reason for the disappointment is I didn't vibe very well with their engineering culture and I didn't really *get* what they were trying to do as a company. I think Khan Academy makes *incredible* videos that change lives, and I love all of the content folk there (I didn't interact with Ben Eater much, but Grant Sanderson is as wonderful of a person in person as he is online). But I felt like their engineering product is kind of just a very overengineered YouTube player with gamification and quiz questions. I didn't understand the audience we were trying to build this thing for, and it sometimes felt to me as if we were making the product experience *worse* for users.

Again, this is likely specific to my experience; I've read so many blog posts about people who had amazing internship experiences there, and I know several people from my cohort who went back to become full-time employees.",1568306996,1,0
You're welcome! That's a good part of why I wanted to do this :) Happy to answer any other questions.,1568306322,1,0
"1. There are incredible people that will go on to do incredible things in both places. That depends more on how you interact with them. A strong network is not so often built with a ""I am going to meet these people so I can netwerk and get jobs in the future"" -- please don't be that person that meets someone at a party, then messages them after 3 years of never speaking to awkwardly ask for a referral. Relationships take investment, and the network you end up with often is a product of the quality of interactions you had, not necessarily just the people that were around. I think the networking potential is so strong in both places that it doesn't really matter which one is better, but you will probably form friendships that last decades at Stanford, whereas the network you could build from an internship depends on how you approach internships, since it's a more formal setting. Personally, I only have a handful of people I still talk to years after internships ended, but that's because I didn't spend tons of time with those people during my internships.
2. Oh gosh, so much. The biggest thing is probably teaching opportunities; I got the opportunity to *lecture* a class here, and I don't think I could have gotten that in many other places. But there are many smaller things, too, and many random classes I have gotten a lot out of, such as ear training (MUSIC 24A/B/C, which teaches you how to listen to music, recognize notes/chords, and be able to sing just by looking at sheet music).
3. Current goal is to chill out a bit. I feel like I've been sprinting through work the last 2 years without taking many breaks, and it's catching up to me. I'm someone who often signs up for more than I can handle, so ""chilling out"" needs to be made an explicit goal. Besides that, I am really looking forward to CS 106AX and the classes I'm taking this quarter. This may be disappointing, but I don't really have a long term goal; I spent so much time agonizing over whether I wanted to go into software engineering or teaching, and eventually decided that I don't need to decide and I'll just take good opportunities as they present themselves. (My girlfriend will also be going to med school in 2 years and I'll probably move with her, which makes it a little pointless to plan too far into the future.)
4. Definitely study at Stanford. It's not hard to get brand name internships after studying at Stanford, but I have gotten so much out of being here, and getting those internships does not yield a Stanford experience.",1568306275,1,0

"I'm going to offer a slightly different perspective based on already having spent a few years at Stanford, a few internships under my belt, and having been in a similar boat as a prefrosh. For some context, I'm a current senior majoring in CS but my true passions have often been elsewhere besides software engineering. 

In my first year at Stanford, I took mostly CS classes, out of a sense of obligation to do so, and tried as hard as I could to get a prestigious internship at a Big 4 company. Didn't work out, and that was fine! The internship that I did get, through Stanford Global Studies (check them out!) was pretty awesome in its own way, and you really don't need to get a good internship as a freshman to do well later on. 

The second year at Stanford I took a lesson from my first year and decided to explore more. That meant I didn't do the prestigious research or hot CS/AI/MS&amp;E/etc classes that many of my peers were doing, but it did mean that I gained a broader perspective and also had more time to enjoy Stanford and hang out with friends. I took some cool introsems, deepened friendships with people in my dorm, and still managed to get a fine internship for that summer as well as take part in some awesome Stanfordy experiences! 

The third year was probably the toughest, but that was probably because I had decided to major in CS and needed to double down on CS classes on top of interviewing for an internship. I won't lie, getting an internship is a hard struggle for most, and Stanford really sucks at telling you how to balance your workload with ""you"" time. That being said, most people I know (including myself), many of whom didn't start out Stanford with much CS knowledge, ended up being able to put in the time needed and get pretty solid internships for the summer. In fact, because I had done an internship the previous summer, I had some extra spending money this summer to explore things I was probably more passionate about when I wasn't working at my internship--traveling around the world, gigging with local bands, and grabbing food and chatting with newfound friends. 

My point being, in explaining my route through Stanford, is to reassure you that you will be fine. If you decide not to do CS, great! Stanford is a leader in many fields beyond CS, and as long as you are willing to work hard and be savvy about the field/career you ultimately choose (which may well change even after you graduate; majoring in English, for example, is in no way a guarantee that you'll be an English professor) Stanford has a lot of resources for helping you out, and there's likely to be people at Stanford who nerd out in the same ways you do. If you do decide to do CS, you can use it to support things you are much more interested in, and maybe even find that you like the perks of working in tech (good pay, fully funded flights/hotels to onsite interviews, challenging problems) enough to join the dark side. :)

DM me if you want to talk further; I can definitely put you in touch with people who would probably answer your questions even better than I can.",1568297416,1,0

"I went to community college for three reasons: I got rejected from almost every college I applied to; I didn't get much financial aid from the schools I did get into, whereas community college was free; and I went to a boarding school for high school and wanted to be closer to family after that. I wrote about the community college experience here: https://reberhardt.com/blog/2016/09/06/experiences-with-community-college.html

I got really lucky transferring to Stanford. The acceptance rate is quite low, so there's a lot of luck involved even if you have a great application. That said, you'll have the best chances if you can demonstrate you would probably do well at Stanford (i.e. good academic track record in your previous college, good indications for leadership potential, etc, standard stuff) and if you can demonstrate a *need* to transfer. Many people focus on the first part but forget about the second. If you can't articulate why you want to go to Stanford beyond ""Stanford is a great school and I think I would do really well there,"" then I can pretty much guarantee you won't get in, regardless of how strong the rest of your application is. I'm pretty sure this applies to transferring to any top school, so be sure to bring that out if you end up applying. Coming from community college, this was easy for me -- I need to transfer because there are no more classes I can take in CC -- but everyone I know who transferred from a four year school had a great reason (e.g. their university shut down the department they were studying in, or they ran out of classes in their department, or they changed majors and can demonstrate they're very committed to their new major but there isn't much support for it at their school).

I don't know anyone who transferred from a school abroad, but I would try anyways. (I was certain I wasn't going to get in and applied just because why not, and was absolutely shocked when I got accepted.) I do know international students who transferred from other schools in the US.

If you end up applying and have more questions, shoot me an email at rebs@cs.stanford.edu. Best of luck!",1568270576,1,0

"What is interesting/dry is in the eye of the beholder, depending on what a student wants to get out of a given course.  For example, although EE263 covers many applications of varied topics in linear algebra, Math 104 spends more time on various key algorithms; e.g. SVD + applications is discussed in 1 lecture in EE 263 according to its syllabus but is discussed over a period of 4 or 5 lectures in Math 104.  So if one wants to get a deeper fluency with SVD, it may be (depending on one's aims, as always) that Math 104 is a better choice.  

So each course has its own merits, and which is more appropriate to choose to prepare for EE 364A is perhaps best determined by the interests and goals of a given student. For the purpose of EE364A preparedness alone, both seem to be equally appropriate.

We offer a pretty good variety of section times and generally do a good job of accommodating people's schedules.",1568256852,1,0
"Very manageable. The instructors and all the TAs (section leaders, as we call them) put in a ton of effort into making the class accessible to people of all backgrounds.

There is a lot of help available (office hours from 7-11pm every Sunday-Thursday, if I remember correctly), but you need to plan ahead (start assignments early! ideally as soon as they come out) and make time to utilize them.",1568256727,1,0

Yeah, MATH 104 should be okay if you thoroughly understand the material after the course (which... doesn't really seem to be the norm after that class), though 263 is likely to be a much better introduction (as a ton of the assumed knowledge of 364A comes from there) if you're able to make the choice. Plus, it's far more interesting and less dry.

Otoh, if you're thinking about taking EE 103 (e.g., you've only seen very basic linear algebra or maybe some intro course in high school), then I recommend just going with EE 103 (which is a fun course, independent of how much LA you know) and then just doing 263 + 364A+B the year after. After EE 103, EE 263 should be mostly a breeze for the first half.",1568255968,1,0

Thank you for your detailed answer! That indeed is what i was worried about. However I was not worried about professors/faculties, but students' opinions. Since you said other full time students are also eager to switch to HCP, it's a big relief for me now.",1574357319,1,0
"I've only been here for one quarter so I definitely don't have anywhere close to the whole picture, but I can share my impressions as a full-time, on campus Master's student in the CS department.

I have not heard of MLA before, but all of the classes I'm taking this quarter are offered through SCPD (i.e. HCP). As far as I can tell it seems like SCPD students are pretty well taken care of. Professors frequently make announcements about logistics for SCPD students, there are office hours online and in evenings/weekends, and the auditoriums where these classes are held are staffed with A/V personnel who operate the camera equipment so the recordings are reliable and high quality. I am actually planning on switching my own enrollment status to HCP at the end of the year due to a job offer, and so far I haven't seen anything that would make me second guess that decision. Many on-campus Master's students I've met also have expressed willingness to switch to HCP if the right job opportunity were to come along. So overall I think it's pretty cool that SCPD exists and even on campus students are happy that it's an option.

As far as housing is concerned, my understanding is that housing through the school is only available to students taking a full-time course load. So in other words it's not the fact that you're an HCP student that makes you ineligible, but rather the fact that you're part-time. If you can somehow manage a full-time course load as an HCP student while working full time, then on-campus housing would be available to you. (I have actually met someone who does this!) School housing is subsidized and they've always had difficulty meeting demand, so I think it makes sense that this restriction exists.

Realistically, I think there will be some opportunities that are closed off to HCP students simply due to logistical impracticality. For example I think it would be really difficult for someone working full-time to be a Course Assistant, or attend a club that's held in the middle of the day, etc. And of course meeting people will be more difficult if you aren't on campus much. But I haven't seen anything that makes me think Stanford treats HCP students as second-class citizens, if that's what you're worried about.",1574327273,1,0

"I'll just list all row or row equivalent (GovCo, Cowell, Lake houses) places.  Senior so I've spent a decent amount of time in most places at this point.

If I don't know anything I won't say anything.

* Jerry:  Arguably the nicest house, if a little outdated, with a fantastic location and great food.  It also has some of the best common spaces.  Like Narnia and 664, the hill is a killer.  The biggest perk is either convenient parking or the balconies and views.  Not known to be very social.

* 664: Former KA House, might be open for other students as soon as next year.  Has definitely been ""lived in,"" but is pretty nice all around.  I've never eaten here so I can't speak to the food.  Similar hill problem to other lake houses.  

* 550: Former Sig Chi House.  Awesome chef, awesome location, awesome rooms.  However, most rooms are shared, but at the same time, they are also larger than shared rooms anywhere else.  Very social vibe.  People from other houses often come here.  Big perk is the full-size beds in many rooms.

* Mars: Amazing location, but parking is a *****.  Food is decent but nothing special in my experience.  Will forever have the title of best house theme (Mars Tessier-Levigne).  Rooms are all shared, and not overly large.  Relatively social

* Storey:  Don't know much about it, but location is amazing.

* Narnia: Bit far from central campus, but also not as far as you think (the hills skew your impression of the distance).  Nice rooms and great chef, plenty of parking.  The biggest perk is the interior courtyard.  Hosts Bagelmania every quarter, which tends to be the rowdiest of the food events, but otherwise is not known to be super social.

* Bob:  Location, Location, Location.  Tends to be a bit quiet as there are always parties at other houses close by.  Food is decent.  Semi-social.

* Xanadu: Sick location, not so sick parking.  House has kinda an odd layout, but I haven't spent a lot of time here. 

* ZAP:  It's nice,  but the location is a bit meh unless a large percentage of your friend group is in sororities.  Not super social, and the food is mediocre.  Parking is great, however.  Big downside is that many rooms are ""outside"" so you may have to walk outside to go to the bathroom.

* Mirrielees:  Unless you have a good med-draw or an athlete with a BS med-draw, you won't get in.  Seriously.  It has not been open to the draw for 3 years.  Notable in that it is the only apartment-style housing on campus.

* 576:  Never been.  Hear it has a good community.

* Hammarskjold: same as 576

* Grove:  Very homey house.  Small but cozy, with not too many residents.  The food is also pretty good.  Parking is eh.  Biggest perk is that the common area has nice/comfy/new furniture, and the house isn't too social so it doesn't get trashed.  Rooms are small

* Phi Sig:  Odd location, and a REALLY small house (like 26ppl I think).  No clue on food, but rooms are nice (for standard room that is).  

* Synergy: It's synergy

* Kairos: Zero idea on this, don't know anyone there and never been

* Roth: Female only.  Supposedly best dessert chef on the row.  Also, it is  uphill all the way there

* Durand: See Kairos

* Pluto:  SUPER nice but SUPER far.  Food is good and it has a sick backyard, but the name is well-deserved.

* 1047 (returning to non-greek I think):  Currently a greek house, but it is pretty nice and has good parking, common areas, etc.  One of the best locations due to being right by KSig and 680 and TDX.  Obviously social.

* 680:  Nice rooms, nice location.  Tends to be social, both in-house and with other groups using it for events.  Very social part of campus in sping for Darty season.  Good food

* EBF: It's EBF

* Yost: APhi house.  Not overly nice.  The location is good for non-row.  Food is meh.

* Murray:  See Durand, but worse location.

* East: See Murray.

* Suites:  I've written too much, so fuck me if I'm going to explain suites. Ask someone who lives there this year if you want",1574306080,1,0

Theta: Likes to party, competes with Kappa for top, for sure too cool for you

"&gt;  while from high school you have a ton of students who are all exceptional in the exact same way and you end up rolling the dice on admission

No, they are not ""exceptional in the exact same way"", they just **look exceptional** in the same exact way, because the bar to get an A is set way too low, so there is no way to distinguish the merely very good from the exceptional, and a number of the exceptional get lost in the noise of occasional non A grades.

4.0 (unweighted) from high school are a dime a dozen.  But a 4.0 from say UCLA Engineering will be coveted by all the top Engineering schools.

&gt; Grad students are specialized and are likely applying to the few schools that offer the exact fields of research they're interested in and not putting out applications to places that they aren't interested in or aren't going to get into.

Mostly wrong, except for the very last part.  Proper self-selection for grad school applications is a thing.  But it doesn't mean it makes it easier to get into the top schools.  Undergrad grades are just a brutal and effective filter, unlike high school grades.",1575527357,1,0
"&gt; Top schools usually holds a higher bar for undergrads than grad student

They hold a higher bar for undergrad admissions only because of the ridiculous grade inflation.  A high school student who gets a couple of B's for whatever reason suddenly becomes less competitive for the top schools, even if those B's are really just noise in the signal.  With countless 4.0 students, it's incredibly hard to stand out in high school; one tiny misstep and you are out of contention from the top schools.

But if you get a 3.8+ GPA in college, especially in a hard major and in a school that doesn't overdo grade inflation, you stand out far above average and will get into top grad schools.  Many of the top college undergrads don't achieve that and will have no choice but to downgrade for grad/professional school.",1575526760,1,0

But we've had eras of being terrible and eras of being amazing, and I think we'll have to make some hard decisions to get back on track.

"&gt;Do you feel you learned a lot from CS107? 

Yes, but I can't say I remember much from the class. Personally, I would take another class in Autumn that is more around your interests in CS since 107 felt like an upper div course in terms of workload. However, if you specifically want to learn about the inner workings of a computer, how Assembly/memory works, and other systems-based material then the class is absolutely worth taking.

&gt;Would you recommend it if you weren't planning to take any further CS classes?

I personally wouldn't *given my own interests*, since I didn't have to take any other systems classes down the line and I can't say much of the material I do now (other than maybe bit ops) is useful for me. If I were in your position, and had 109 and some proof writing abilities, i'd take something like 221/229 as i'm interested in AI. There's a few other CS courses you could take that are in CS that don't really need 107 (a lot of them assume 107 though just because it's a class that does make your programming more mature, and also helps you understand how to use the terminal).",1569373055,1,0

"Get some clinical shadowing experience in future quarters to see how attracted you are to real medicine. There was a program I joined wherein you, an undergrad, were matched with a med student as well as a practicing physician in one of the Stanford Hospitals and Clinics. You were given (in each pair) money to have lunch and meet casually. It was fairly generous, and a great way to see different aspects of medicine as a career.

Another thing that's awesome about Stanford is that you can actually enroll in certain med school classes as an undergrad. A popular one used to be introduction to emergency medicine.

Finally, try to get a faculty mentor who's a physician. Learn about your professors' careers and how they made their choices to see what resonates with you, or doesn't.

Doing this kind of broad-spectrum observational and investigative work helped me figure out what works for me, and set me down my eventual professional path.

To see what's available now at Stanford, I'd recommend meeting up with one of the dedicated pre-med advisors.",1569369392,1,0
"Yeah, man! My Prof was Hans Christian Andersen. The class was a fairytale.

Joking aside, I do distinctly remember the whole lecture hall meeting outside to explode a pumpkin around Halloween, so taking it Autumn Quarter is a great idea.

I also remember the exams were fairly straightforward except for the last question, which usually asked you to think pretty laterally and consolidate real learning from the class to solve a new style of problem.

It's been several (thousand?) years since I was a student, so clearly the specifics don't stay with you, but what remains in the end are the ways of approaching problems, fascination with physical sciences, and practice in synthesizing different information.",1569368696,1,0

"Many of my friends dropped ITALIC last year because of scheduling conflicts. I think it's a great program to meet people in and it's very easy to find yourself a community in it, but in the end it depends on which classes you want to prioritize. ITALIC is mainly art theory and history, you won't get much time to practice an art form. In contrast, taking an art class will give you that art practice experience. Personally, I enjoyed ITALIC and stayed the full three quarters, but there were classes I sacrificed for it. Also, don't feel bad if you decide to drop it! I agree with the previous person who answered; speak with your AAD and one of the ITALIC professors. They're very friendly and I hope you figure out what's best for you! :)",1569366941,1,0

That being said, you'll still want to be polite, well dressed, real, and honest. This is their chance to see the living, breathing person behind the list of accomplishments on paper. Try your best to treat them like a new friend and allow the enthusiasm and interests you have to come out. The alumni are definitely are rooting for you, and they want to see what passions drive you rather than a student trying to impress them. I recall talking about mountain climbing and my experiences with different cultures (which weren't really present on my application) in the time that I wasn't asking my interviewer questions about Stanford or their Stanford story. It may be good to have a small notepad with any topics you're very comfortable talking about (like an extracurricular that pervades a lot of your life) or some questions about their experience at Stanford. You'll probably be pretty engaged in conversation, so don't worry about taking notes unless there's something you want to look up later. I also think the interview started late and went far longer than the time allotted for it, so the timing may be volatile. I hope these fragments fit together to help paint a general picture of the alumni interview for you, and feel free to pm me any specific questions.",1573538248,1,0

My mom wanted to do something instead of weighing myself on a scale to weigh my body fat.

So my mom told both of us you don't need to take a shower if you don't want to(since I got up at 12pm and she got up at 12:30p.m.). You don't need to shower if you don't want to, it's not necessary for the underwater weight test (I saved time by not showering but my sister got up later than me but still wanted to shower).

"My mom called my doctor and said to him ""What's the most accurate measurement for weighing body fat?"" The doctor said ""An underwater weighing test"" And just like that, my mom said ""Yes. When can my son and my daughter can take it?"" and the doc said ""Today at 2pm in Fremont."" (Kaiser)

So, I didn't bother taking a shower and so did my sister too, so I had to get into a special swimming suit(tight pants...Ugh).

My sister said ""Can I pull my hair down to a ponytail?"" The doctor said ""No."" So my sister with her long, blonde hair went underwater with 8 seconds and had she must enjoyed it..but I didn't.

My sister had to wear pants and a bra, so she enjoyed minutes of going underwater. I didn't take a shower and she didn't too.

Before she got into the tank, you see girls 'pretend' to pull their hair into ponytails, but they don't. That's what she did.

The reason for this topic to not get too confusing is that don't you guys like to see teenage girls in a tank with their hair and their body soaked and wet? That's the reason for this topic.

You want a detailed summary of what happened today? Alright, here goes:

My mom wanted to do something instead of weighing myself on a scale. She heard about a underwater weighing test from my doctor last year and she wanted to give it a try to both, myself and my sister.

She called the doctor and wanted to schedule an appointment for my sister and I and today was the only day they could get us in. So my mom told both of us you don't need to take a shower if you don't want to(since I got up at 12pm and she got up at 12:30p.m.) It goes on from there with the underwater weighing at the doctor's office.

My sister constantly talks about her hair. ""Should I wash it?"" ""Should I pull my hair up or leave it down?"" Stuff like that. It wasn't my idea to take this underwater weighing thing. The doctor puts you in a tank (and I didn't have a shower), makes you do certain things of breathing, and you put your head underwater for a few seconds. Not hard at all.

To answer you question, before my sister and I got into the tank, the doctor did a basic weight test then I got into the tank and did some breathing excerises to see how my lungs would be situated underwater. Then the doctor took the temperature of the water inside the tank. After I taken my underwater tests, I had to stick my head underwater for 8 seconds and it was done. 30 minutes its all it take.",1573495222,1,0

Similarly, you also need to be in a department that is a good fit for you. The above advice to just go for it and be yourself is good.

Did you have any prior contact with the Stanford administration (calling/emailing professors and including that in your application).

"This all happened years ago. Stanford had been my dream school, cemented on a sunny campus visit spent dodging bikes with my Dad and then sitting in a little sub-tropical grove by the oval alone where I had a transcendent moment of imagining my future life on the West Coast, real sound-of-one-hand-clapping enlightenment stuff. I’d also applied to Brown, Swarthmore, Columbia, NYU, Cornell, UC Berkeley, SUNY Binghamton, CalTech, and the University of Chicago, but not the holy trinity of top Ivies, because I had inchoate and frankly dumb ideas about avoiding “pretentiousness”, a.k.a. Richie Rich private school kids (little did I know they’d be everywhere and many would end up being good friends). As you can tell from the spray and biases above, I had no idea what I was looking for in a school.

I didn’t get into Stanford (and wrote an awful angsty metaphorical short story about it), or Berkeley or CalTech, so then I had to choose from the rest. I settled on Brown because UChicago kids seemed sad and 1987 Columbia street hassle freaked me out when I visited alone from upstate on the Amtrak. Then I found out my loathed neocon edgelord cousin was also going to Brown as well, and I tried to get out. I had become fixated on going West, convinced it would make me happy. My academic Mom pulled some strings and got me into Pomona and Reed, but I visited both and didn’t like them.

So I went to Brown, and it was a disaster. My cousin was even worse than I remembered, glomming on to me every weekend while wearing his sad Hudson Valley prep sweater doused with Polo cologne. Everything on campus seemed old and threadbare, I wasn’t ready for the Providence sleet, I hated my roommate and he hated me, I developed feels for a girl from my high school who was there and not into me at all and I kept beclowning myself, my clinically depressed English professor would teach while lying prone on her desk, sometimes with tears in her eyes, and would occasionally fall asleep. I felt adrift and unmoored. I tumbled into a deep funk and regained the 100+ pounds I’d fought through high school to keep off.

Somewhere in there I decided I would transfer. My first application to Stanford had been a rush job: I hadn’t realized the deadline had arrived until it was the day of, and with 2 hours to work on it my essays had been, umm, unpolished. I thought I could do a better job, and I’d also taken a creative writing class with a now-forgotten modernist luminary who had loved my work, so I knew I’d get a special recommendation. I’d kept my grades up despite my life breakdown so I was hopeful.

I got in. I transferred. And, to my surprise, I was still miserable. Stanford was more buttoned up than Brown, and I missed the crazies. Football games were more fun in actual crisp fall weather. Every weekend in Rhode Island had been a different dorm party gathered around a pail of garbage punch with friends: now at Stanford, you had EANABs and Greek gate-keeping on the really fun stuff. The one time I did sneak into a private Greek party, some vat-grown Chad inadvertently smashed my glasses during a “Smells Like Teen Spirit” mosh. I missed “Funk Night”. I missed the record stores and Red Hots along Thayer, right on the walk between my classes and my dorm. I missed my friends: I hadn’t realized how special and tight those freshman friendships would be. I found myself going to the Stanford bookstore, reading college ranking books, trying to convince myself I’d done the right thing.

For about a year I regretted my choice: but then I found closer friends, I got involved at the radio station which made me feel more connected, and I stopped thinking about it. As the years have gone on, I’m content with my choice, and I doubt I would have ended up with the life and career I did if I hadn’t transferred, and yes, it made me happy. But I likely would have ended up just as happy if I’d stayed at Brown.

I transferred because of carrots and sticks. The carrot was that I’d be happy in California in a way I couldn’t be anywhere else. The sticks were all the Brunonian annoyances that I couldn’t see a way out of. What I discovered was the carrot wasn’t real: no matter where you go, you’re still you, and no singular place is going to make you happy, because what makes people happy is connection and community and purpose, and that both takes work and can be crafted anywhere. For the sticks, I’d just traded one set of sticks for another. These were things I couldn’t comprehend as a young man and took me years to learn.

Who knows if you’re in a parallel situation, but that’s my cautionary tale about transferring. Feel free to DM me if you have any other questions I didn’t answer.",1570208143,1,0

"A further comment: Transfer applicants play an important role in curriculum design. I don't have time to go into detail, but I'll just reiterate that the undergrad program chairs and the administration need strong transfer applicants to keep otherwise difficult-to-manage quality aspects up for the whole higher education system. So be courageous: apply early and often, and remember that a 'no' is just information about how to get to 'yes.'

This goes for Stanford undergrads who feel like they're failing or overwhelmed, too: don't be afraid to transfer somewhere you would be more comfortable.",1570127512,2,0
[deleted],1570127285,1,0
"No limit, but you have to do at least two years at Stanford https://admission.stanford.edu/apply/transfer/credit.html

I don't think anyone transfers with less than a year of transcripts, though.

So while the only such bar to transferring in as an undergrad is actually having a bachelors degree, you can take as much undergrad work as you need to perfect the first one to two years of credit to go with your super-stellar essay and personalized petition to specific undergrad program faculty that you need to have a real chance.

For example if you had a mediocre first year but flunked out of anywhere in your teens, but went back to work and then enrolled somewhere else later, doing well enough to have a decent chance at a transfer application, you are not ethically or otherwise obligated to send your first undergrad transcripts, Stanford will very likely never find out about them, and even if they did, it's not difficult to clarify that you would like them disregarded and simply leave it at that.  (I believe -- check with someone about this to be sure -- you can do this with individual classes on a transcript, omitting them completely from consideration, as long as it's to get two years in and not just to pump the GPA number up.)

Again, the personal petition(s) to undergrad degree program faculty are key by far.

"I took a summer class (CS110) before (while working a full-time internship). For the class I took, it was really easy and watered down (the workload was like maybe half of that of the class during the school year), since it was filled with high schoolers and undergrads from other school who, as the other poster mentioned, pay a lot to take classes here. Also, keep in mind that the instructors during the summer are not Stanford professors. My instructor was a master's student who had taken the class a year prior. It became clear that she was just barely enough qualified to teach the (watered-down) course content, but when it came to the finer details or if you're curious about a topic and want to know more, she was totally clueless. Taking a summer class is honestly a doable option if you need to clear a requirement, but obviously not the best choice if you care a lot about learning.

"[Here's a list of the requirements.](https://mcs.stanford.edu/academics/requirements/core-courses)

MCS is a relatively flexible major, and since it's not in the School of Engineering, you're not bogged down by physics classes and E40M etc.

By nature of being an interdisciplinary program, MCS covers a broad range of topics, including math, stats, CS, and MS&amp;E. Obviously you won't go as in depth into any one of these topics as someone studying them as a single major. However, you do get to see how all of the pieces fit together.

I definitely wouldn't say MCS is ""a bunch of intro classes."" In fact, I'd actually like to hear where you heard that from. To get started, MCS requires that you take an intro to probability, an intro to programming, and an intro to linear algebra. However, after that, you actually start getting into some depth. For instance, Stats 200, which is required, is one of the hardest and most in-depth stats classes you can take as an undergraduate. CS 107 and CS 161 are also core MCS classes that I wouldn't consider to be ""intro-level.""

MCS is fewer units than CS, and allows you to get a good view at stats, applied math, and CS. If you're unsure of exactly what you want to pursue, then this is a great choice. It's also a good choice if you know you want to study stats or computational math in the future.

So to answer your questions:

&gt;Are there any reasons to do MCS over Math/CS?

Double majoring would be quite the pain in the ass and would leave you little room for extra classes you're interested in. You might also have to end up taking certain general requirement classes you're not at all interested in just because they're the only ones that fit in your busy schedule. Some people like to brag about this lifestyle, but I think many here will advise you otherwise. It's ultimately your choice though.

&gt;Is it better to major in MCS and then coterm in CS?

Depends what you want to do with CS. If you're interested in AI, then you can't really go wrong with either CS or MCS undergrad. MCS will give you deeper coverage of probability and math, which are central to actually understanding AI. If you want to do systems or CS theory, then there is little value to be gained from MCS.

Thankfully, CS and MCS have a solid amount of overlap, so you'll have time to decide while taking classes.",1572235093,2,0

"There [a diagram](https://imgur.com/a/all3EDo) (forgive the sloppy drawing) that Keith Schwarz likes to use to explain the way we assess our own skills and what we know. In reality, the set of all the things that you know intersects with that of everybody else, and each pair of people intersects in slightly different ways. Everybody overlaps with you a little bit. But it's easy to think that everybody knows *all* the things that you don't know. It starts to feel like you're just a tiny island in this massive sea of things that you're supposed to know or be able to do. In reality, each person's set of skills isn't that much different in size from yours. Person A can do some things that you can't, and so can Person B. But that doesn't mean that Person A and Person B can both do all those things.

Feeling inadequate at Stanford is not unusual. But in my opinion, everybody has to get at least a little lucky to get here. With a &lt; 5% acceptance rate, for each of us to get in, 19 people got denied. And for all I know, my application reviewer just happened to have a particularly tasty BLT right before reading my essays and was in a good mood. It took me a while to come to grips with this. Getting in doesn't mean we're somehow better than the other 19, but that we have a responsibility to do something with the resources that we have. So it's not about what you've done in the past.

Keep taking opportunities until you find some that click and don't measure yourself on others' lives. Success isn't a zero sum game--others succeeding doesn't take away from your success.

There is no ""deserving"" being here. People get in because they were accepted, but that says nothing about their worth as a human being. What matters more is what you do with your time here and what you do after. Focus on the future and setting yourself up to be someone *you* can be proud of being.",1576679099,1,0

A B+ is a fine grade. Some considerations:
1. It’s your first quarter taking courses at Stanford! Give yourself a bit of a break and allow yourself to make a couple mistakes here and there on assignments, tests, etc. Adjusting to a new teaching environment is always a bit of an extra effort.
2. CS236 is a *hard* class. I took it in person this quarter, and despite frequent visits to office hours and a strong study group, I still struggled with the material! I really admire and applaud you doing it through SCPD - if everyone had to do the class via SCPD, I’m sure performance wouldn’t be nearly as high as it is. Cut yourself some slack in knowing that while non-SCPD students can focus solely on this material, you’ve likely got another job and other commitments to focus on as well.
3. A B+ will absolutely not destroy your chances of getting into the MSCS program. The fact that you’re taking the time and effort to take SCPD classes speaks volumes about your dedication and character. Moreover, anecdotally, I have several friends who have been admitted to the MSCS with B’s and even the odd B- on their transcript. You’ll be fine.

"The syllabus .pdf from Fall 2018 (when the instructor was the same as this year) at [https://mpelger.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4571/f/syllabusmse245a.pdf](https://mpelger.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4571/f/syllabusmse245a.pdf) says quite explicitly what is the key concept needed from Math 51: Lagrange multipliers and constrained optimization (this is also the part of Math 51 regarded as most immediately important by the Economics dept. for its majors).  This topic is the focus of  Chapter 12 of the Math 51 book (which you can freely access with an SUNetID at the textbook link on the Math 51 website), and is one of the more challenging topics to learn in Math 51.  So you could try reading ahead to get a sense of what it is about (the book has many worked examples). Or as the syllabus .pdf above suggests in its ""Prerequisites"" section, you could try emailing the course instructor to ask about it.  

Note that the ""Prerequisites"" also mention probability with multiple random variables, which involves multivariable integration (so parts of Math 52). The key things in that relevant to multivariable probability are Fubini's Theorem (to compute things) and the Change of Variables formula (to work out joint density functions among dependent random variables).",1576456367,3,0

If you take a bit of initiative, and research things like equations you might not understand, I expect you’ll be fine. The class likely requires Math 51 as a “we want you to be good at calculus” prerequisite, so I suspect if you’re comfortable with calculus and willing to take initiative to dig deeper on things you may not understand at first glance, you’ll be fine.

Option 1 doesn’t include doing CS161 in Winter. I’d recommend against that. Option 2 is stellar - take CS161, and one of CS103/107. Option 3 is too much work for mortals (if you’re incredible, then take all three! But recognize that it’s a ton of work and I’d advise against that).

Frankly, I’d pick between 109 and 129 this quarter. I found 129 to be the simplest CS course I’ve taken so far (106 aside). Also, if it’s your freshman year (guessing based off the classes you’re considering), it definitely isn’t necessary to finish the core your freshman year.

All it was was ~3-5 hours of watching lectures and doing programming exercises at home each week. I would instead drop 109, as 103 is a fundamental core class that is recommended to take before 109 and both of those are serious time investments. That said, 103 is generally seen as more difficult than 109, so you might drop that instead for now, but YMMV. No harm in shopping all three for syllabus day and seeing which you would want to lose.

"I agree. Like I (crudely) said, Stanford does a good job of weeding out the idiots. And there are probably more geniuses at the very top margins. But those are few and far between. Most are squarely on the bell curve of normalcy. They are hard workers, well read, good test takers, well rounded, etc. but they aren’t super geniuses. They have to study just as hard as the next guy, generally speaking.",1577588705,1,0
There are a lot of “normal” kids at Stanford,1577588408,1,0
"First of all, congratulations! Getting in is a huge achievement, don't forget that by comparing yourself to everyone else.

&gt;I looked at the class of 2024 bios instagram page, and just felt so small

I wouldn't spend a lot of time on this if I were you. Everyone's just trying to sell themselves and look good. I think you'll find that if you actually come to campus and meet people, everyone seems normal, and people often actually hesitate to talk about their accomplishments because it makes it too easy to put them in a box.

&gt;There's nothing special about me

Don't sell yourself short. You got in after all, and the admissions committees don't make those decisions lightly. Lots of people that are new to Stanford feel the same way as you because of all the prestige, but again, I think once you come to campus and make some friends, you'll start to feel like you fit in more.

&gt;One person even 'congratulated' me on my acceptance by telling me 'good thing there's affirmative action' (I'm an URM).

This is incredibly fucked and I'm sorry your school is snake-infested. Try not to let yourself believe any of those lies. I'm sure you're way more talented than you give yourself credit for, and try to surround yourself with people that reaffirm that.

I don't know where you are in the decision process, but if you're still not committed to Stanford, don't let these feelings sway you. Many many people coming into Stanford are experiencing these exact same feelings, and I don't think admin really does enough to address it.",1577588357,1,0
You do. Take lots of different courses and explore your interests.,1571201540,1,0
