Bad high school GPA as somebody trying to transfer into the sophomore class?,"Hello, I wanted to transfer to Northwestern, but I have a couple of issues on my side. I have a good GPA (est. at about 3.8) from the best State School in New York (it's ranked like #80), but I have a pretty bad HS GPA (It's a 3.3). 

My high school was super rigorous and prestigious, it's ranked very highly and all my courses from there count as APs. Even though some people would say that that reflects well on my application, I still consider it a blight on my application. People say that for transfer applicants who have low GPAs on the college side, if they would be competitive applicants during their high school years, they have a decent shot, but I haven't heard much from the converse-- students with low HS GPA and good college GPAs. My extracurriculars are fine, I'm doing an M&amp;A case competition that I'm scoring pretty well in, finance society, and poker club (oddly enough, haha, Poker is just fun).

Parking gates question.,"North campus parking garage. (Evanston)


I sometimes drive to campus.  I have a lot of late classes.  I noticed that if I leave after 6pm, usually the exit gates are open so I dont have to pay for parking (even if I arrived before 4). 

Yesterday though, the gates were still down for entry and exit at 7pm.  So I did have to pay $9 to exit. 

Is this the norm or are the gates usually open and someone just forgot yesterday? Before I've seen the entry gates open at 4, and the exit by 6.

Traffic- Ideally you want to be in a location that isn‚Äôt busy. This means the thrones are likely to be polished and no public poopers anxiety
Cleanliness- Who wants to sit in someone else‚Äôs debauchery? Options should be consistently clean. 
Utility- Is the bathroom laid out in a way that facilitates business conduction? This does not mean the bathroom needs to be easy to access but the internal layout should provide comfort to those doing the deed.

Is it worth switching from McCormick to Weinberg CS at this point?,"I'm currently a second-year in McCormick CS and I was considering transferring to Weinberg solely because I can't handle any more engineering classes (i.e. the classes to fulfill the ""basic engineering"" requirement).

I've already completed the EAs and DTCs, so I've already done most of the classes that are only required for McCormick and not Weinberg. I just have to take two more engineering classes and the public speaking class, then the rest of the classes are the same as if I were in Weinberg.

By this point it seems silly to me to switch to Weinberg since I'm already almost done with the engineering requirements. Maybe I should lighten up my course work a bit, but each quarter it becomes more and more difficult to finish the engineering classes.

Additionally, I just never felt like I fit in with others at my school. It's hard to label myself as an ""engineer."" idk what Weinberg people are labelled as lol but I feel like I'm the person who would rather take various courses in various subjects, which is what Weinberg is about.

Any advice?

They were bad teachers. In 11th grade, I didn't take an English class and got credit by exam instead. Now in 12th grade, I have a good teacher, but the issue is that she's only been at our school for a week now, and doesn't really know who I am.

Question for Cog Sci/Neuro/Psych majors,"I‚Äôm currently a freshman and I came in to NU intending to major in neuroscience.

I‚Äôm more interested in psychological clinical work or research which will require a PhD rather than med school. It seems that the cognitive science major is very interdisciplinary and that many of the grads go on to conduct research, which is more aligned with my goals. I have become interested in CSD and linguistics, so I like that cog sci would allow me to explore these areas as well. However, I‚Äôm not sure about career opportunities with a cog sci degree (since I‚Äôm not totally sure of what i want to do), and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm not understanding what this major is about because I keep hearing it being related to comp sci and programming.

Northwestern University shows precisely how to not be a journalist," 

***Photographs and source-gathering are basic, non-negotiable parts of the job***

It is bad enough when students at an elite university demand the school‚Äôs newspaper stop doings it job, as happened [**at Harvard recently.**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/harvard-immigration-activists-furious-that-student-newspaper-asked-ice-for-comment/)¬†It is worse still when a school‚Äôs newspaper vows to stop doing the job itself, as happened at Northwestern University [**earlier this month.**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/student-journalists-apologize-for-taking-photos-of-protesters-at-a-public-protest/)¬†There, responding to activist outcry over its coverage of a campus protest, the editors of¬†*The Daily Northwestern*¬†apologized for taking photographs of the event and for reaching out to students for comment via the school‚Äôs directory. The paper also apologized for naming the subjects of interviews. ‚ÄúWe will‚Ä¶work to balance the need for information and the potential harm our news coverage may cause,‚Äù the editors wrote.

This is a silly joke. If a newspaper seeks to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù its coverage by taking down photographs and voluntarily making it harder to contact relevant sources, it‚Äôs intentionally hobbling itself, in this case for no other reason than that some students weren‚Äôt happy about being associated with a public newsworthy event. Everyday journalism is apparently now viewed by campus activists as evil and ‚Äúharmful,‚Äù but it‚Äôs another thing entirely that campus journalists actually bought into it.

**Sophomore Year** 3.53 uwGPA, 4.0 wGPA

**Junior Year** 3.9 uwGPA, 4.5 wGPA

**Tests:** 31 ACT, 1400 SAT, 9 AP classes (only scored 5s and 4s)

More info on Northwestern SCS,"Hello,

I have a friend who may not have had the most traditional childhood and was only able to obtain an associates degree between work and other life issues.  Now with stuff under control, my friend is looking to finish undergrad and obtain a Bachelor's degree at the age of 23.  My friend got accepted into Northwestern SPS and I just want to make sure my friend isn't getting taken advantage of as I don't know anything about the program.   My friend will be taking out a loan to go to school.

I have read some yelp reviews and while I understand that the instruction may be of less quality than the regular NU program, does my friend still get to put BS or BA from Northwestern University on the resume?  Or does my friend need to specify it is from the SPS program.  Additionally, I understand how much you get out of the program depends on how much you get in, but is the education (knowledge taught) on par with most undergrad programs around the area like UIC, Loyola, Depaul, etc..  Northwestern was chosen because of the evening classes as my friend needs to continue to work to pay bills and afford school.  Some schools like UIC do not offer evening undergraduate classes.

&amp;#x200B;

My take on the Jeff Sessions protesting controversy,"I posted a version of this as a response in another /r/northwestern thread but I thought it deserved it's own thread since the original thread was based on a faux ""news"" source.  I'm writing this as a far left progressive worried about the future of our cause adopting ""purity tests"".  This is counterproductive, especially in this situation.

Here are some facts:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If you don‚Äôt want to be contacted via the university directory then you can opt out.

&amp;#x200B;

2. If you are in a public space then you have no expectation of privacy.

&amp;#x200B;

3. If you‚Äôre protesting something the point of the protest is to garner attention. Therefore, you should expect attention if you protest. (This is usually how you change opinions.)

&amp;#x200B;

4. A reporters job has two basic functions, observe and report. 

&amp;#x200B;

5. \*\*History has shown that ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù photos can sway public opinion for the better.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

6. Life is messy, protesting is messier. If you protest then be prepared, things may not go as planned. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

IMO, adding intermediate steps to item 4 either turns journalism into propaganda or it makes journalism complicit in censorship.  

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I believe that ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù  photos, such as those of police  brutality should be reported.  \*\*History has shown many times that ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù photos can sway public opinion toward rectifying harmful practices\*\*.  This happened when children laborers were photographed near the turn of the century, it ended the practice of child labor.  Photo and TV images of the Vietnam war helped sway public opinion.  Etc. etc.  I can see the point that rating hungry news agencies have taken the tack of publicizing salacious stories, but that is not the case at all here. Finally, I don‚Äôt understand the statement from the girl who asked to have her photo changed.  It was something along the lines of ‚Äúwe wanted national attention.‚Äù  So b/c the daily NU was not ‚Äúnational‚Äù then it was not ok to photo police brutalizing her and the other protesters?

&amp;#x200B;

For a synopsis event I recommend this \[NYT article\]([https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/college-campus-journalists-newspapers.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/college-campus-journalists-newspapers.html)).",1573742710,1,0

Sororities for A Mixed Girl (non-identity based),"Hi! Class of '24 student here looking for some advice on sororities. 

I'm half black and half Chinese and grew up in a predominantly white and Asian community. I'm from the South where sororities at state schools are synonymous with being air headed and shallow, but a few friends who attend college in T20 schools (UChicago, Harvard, Yale) have told me that sororities at T20s are a lot better. 

Culturally, I wouldn't feel comfortable in a ""black sorority"" just because I have a disconnect with the black identity, so I'm really just looking for a really social and educated group of gals without any racial affiliations. 

My main priority is being social. Continuing some philanthropy from high school (youth + education focused) is also something I'm really interested in, if certain sororities prioritize that. 

Any suggestions, tips, warnings, or concerns would be greatly appreciated!

How is physics 135-3?,"Hey all, I'm signed up for 135-3 (the class covering waves and stuff) next quarter and I'm wondering if anyone who's taken the class would be willing to share their experience.

Will I need to know mechanics and E&amp;M for waves? One more thing, would anyone happen to have the syllabus of topics from any year that I could look at?

I'm wondering if anyone can advise any class of that sort, where it's not hard to get a good grade, but the subject matter is well taught and easy to get interested in. Could be anything from psych to philosophy to music.. anything you really enjoyed! Also, if you know any classes that are just easy and not necessarily interesting, those would be good too :)
