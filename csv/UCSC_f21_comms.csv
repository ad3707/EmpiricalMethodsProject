Despite all schools facing this issue. I feel that the lack of on campus housing is especially tough for students. Off campus rent is pretty pricey and the commute to campus is almost unreasonable without a car. This is my first quarter living off campus and I still have yet to find a place. Also the housing selection off campus is super limited too and unless you plan on rooming with somone in the same room it will be pretty pricey almost to the same cost as on campus housing. You pretty much have to sacrifice comfort for a shorter commute or vice versa. Im probably just better off setting up a tent in the woods at this point.,1638794496,56,0

"Very confused how this can happen when we just finished day 2 of instruction, but a few things 

1. It is actually very irritating when students submit files in the wrong format. I know most people don't think it's a big deal, but jpeg or png files can often appear sized very weird on the canvas grader. They can sometimes appear giant with no ability to zoom out, which can make it a real pain to grade a problem. 

It also takes all of 10 seconds to google ""how to convert x to pdf"" and there are free sites that will convert it for you. At some point, you have to consider why you spent hours waiting on youe TA to respond instead of just doing that. 

2. So what? She doesn't have to. 

3. Three days is a bit long to reply, but definitely not anything extreme. Sometimes emails get lost in an inbox. Sometimes TAs are busy and forget to reply. Often if someone doesn't reply the first time, you can just email again. 

4. I highly doubt your Canvas ""will not work"", and even if it didn't on your computer, you can always submit on your phone. It's probably more likely that Canvas is not letting you submit something that isn't properly formatted. 

Regardless, it seems like your TA is fairly chill about this, even though you've created a bit of a headache for her. It's kinda ridiculous that you are complaining that she's taking a week to grade it, which is super reasonable. 

5. That's exactly what she's supposed to be doing during office hours. Why do you think she'd just give you the answers? 

6. It happens. I've sat in the wrong meeting room for a while before, and I've seen it happens to whole seminars (where half the ppl are in one room and half in the other). Alot of times no one shows up to office hours, so she probably didn't even realize that she was in the wrong link. 

7. I mean, if she's giving you a definition from the textbook, what's the problem exactly? Math definitions are not always things that can/should be described ""in your own words"", the technicalities often matter alot.

8. The quiz is supposed to take one hour and she gave you a 7 hour window. Do you think you are the only one with a class during that time period? Why do you think she gave you that broad of a window?",1632559539,9,0

"Genuine question, how is this happening right now when classes have just started? As far as everything else, i have time so i hope this answers your questions:

2. A lot of tas ive had dont either

3. Again tas are swamped with emails. Three days is not bad its usually expect a response 24-72 hours.

4. A week isnt that bad they have a lot of work to do

5. Yea that‚Äôs literally what theyre supposed to do??? They help you get to the answer not give it out right so you can learn.

6. Being in the wrong link happens although 30 mins is excessive 

7. Probably reading from the manual so you know exactly what the prof wants. Ive had profs only give full credit if u write exactly what they want. If ur still confused maybe ask them to rephrase it.

8. Still the same length bc that‚Äôs probably what the professor wanted. 5 hours to respond to an email is not enough time especially on a friday. Most people wont get back to you until Monday.

"I feel like I managed to burn through my one year of in-person classes without making friends, and didn't make many more after a year online. I'm not sure if I'll be helpful, but all I can really suggest is to keep searching out groups. Maybe keep an eye on events you can attend--you won't fit in with all of them, but you'll pick up a few friends and get a sense of what you *are* looking for. 

Clubs traditionally have made finding things to do/people to meet easier--that'll be different after a year of being online, but I'd still pick a few you're interested in and see when they meet. You might also try study groups (depending on your classes)... really any gathering where you have some common interest/activity will make it easier to interact organically. At that point it's a matter of how well you can keep communicating. It's hard to keep friendships together if you're spread over colleges, and more so if they're off campus; hard, but not impossible.",1632553798,8,0

It kind of seemed like we organically developed a system where the girls went to one side and guys went to the other, sometimes people would deviate since it was an unspoken arrangement but everyone was respectful

There was definitely some luck to it, there‚Äôs no guarantee that your floormates will be good about it, I‚Äôm not trying to diminish your concerns. You‚Äôd hope that people have that common decency, unfortunately not everyone does

I guess all that to say that there really isn‚Äôt a way to *guarantee* that gender separation on a co-ed floor, but it may happen to some extent naturally and worst case scenario your RA can take disciplinary action

The good news is that (at least in my building) some of the shower areas were proper stalls with locks, and the ones without locks were double-curtained

"If you haven't seen the Fear Street movie series yet on Netflix (it's a trilogy of 3 films) there's supernatural elements mix w/ slasher, and I'd HIGHLY recommend the series. I love horror, and it's one of my top 10.

And other than what's been suggested -- some other supernatural horror films that are avail on streaming, that I enjoy, are:

Hulu: Oculus, Let the Right One in (subtitles. Don't watch the ""American"" version, watch the 2008 Swedish verison), The Final Girls (supernatural w/ campy 80s slasher), Paranormal activity series  (1-3 need the Starz add on but 4 is avail for anyone), Children of the Corn

Netflix: His House, Malevolent (I enjoy Florence Pugh in it), Vampires vs the Bronx (has comedic elements but still spooky), Unfriended (tw for suicide though), The Conjuring 1&amp;2, Sinister

Peacock: The Sixth Sense, Nightmare on Elm Street (80s version, not remake), Nightmare on Elm Street: Dream Warriors, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

Amazon Prime: Jennifer's Body, Come Play, Host, Drag me to Hell, The Manor

On HBOmax I'd rec Trick 'r Treat, 28 days later, Freaky, Happy Death Day 1&amp;2, Malignant

Some of these might be on avail across multiple streaming platforms, I just looked at my most recent watch list for horror on all my streaming that I use!!

The original (so not the 2016 remake) Blair Witch is classic too, but it's not streaming anywhere that I know of, so you'd have to use \~other\~ sites lol. Original exorcist is a good one, the original Craft is good, too. As well as the Japanese (or, the original) version of the ring.

The Haunting of Hills House (tw for addiction, suicide), The Haunting of Bly Manor, and Midnight Mass, American Horror Story: Roanoke, American Horror Story: 1984 are shows too that all have supernatural elements I'd highly recommend, plus all of those are streaming on netflix!",1635651923,4,0

No, the campus architect didn't just quit.  The Campus Architect is Julie Hendricks Fahnestock, and she didn't quit.  She supports the plan.  She put the plan forward.   Just as the actual architect on the project, Navy Banvard of VTBS Architects, supports the plan.  VTBS designed the UCLA grad student housing project.  

The guy who quit in the true modern spirit of ""*I didn't get what I want, so I'm going to throw a fit and go home*"" is one member of the 12 person design review committee.

"Hey! So, I took 2 of the 3 series here for physics (the 5 track) and I might suggest first making a zoom OH appointment with your lecture (not lab) TA and explaining your concerns, and if they have any suggestions for how to handle this test going forward. Honestly, I have nothing but good things to say about the people who work as lecture TAs for the physics department. I honestly think the physics department has some of our best and most ethical TAs, who really want you to do well and succeed in their class. They might be able to alleviate some of your worries, too, by letting you know that they've already come to a solution about that question. You can also shoot them an e-mail, but personally I prefer ""face to face"" when it comes to stuff like this -- I find it easier to get across my concerns when it's face to face vs writing an email. 

And, no one has mentioned this yet, but some people have mentioned things like ""youre responsible for your time"" etc etc. Have you ever considered that you might have testing anxiety? When you learned that there was an issue with the exam it sounds like you froze b/c you were dealing with testing anxiety and THEN this happened (issue w/ an exam question) so it was just too much for your brain to process. Whereas a student who doesn't deal with testing anxiety would easily be able to move on from a testing error on the teacher's end (i.e. they'd just be like, ""oh shit thats wrong lol ok lemme fix this real quick and move on) BUT for people like me (and possibly you) who deal with testing anxiety it's impossible to move forward quickly like that -- your brain legit shuts down for a little bit. So, I might suggest reaching out to our schools DRC (just google UCSC DRC and it'll bring you up to the DRC homepage and you can reach out to them) because you could qualify for extra time and some other things that will help you be able to take a test like all your other peers. So, if this does happen again on Dhar's exam, you can take 10 minutes to step back, breathe, walk away (I have in my accommodations that I'm able to leave a zoom proctoring room b/c \*I need a break\*) and then come back and crush it. 

I know for UCSC you get one quarter of self-reporting for DRC -- which is amazing of them b/c it helps students who can't afford to see a psychiatrist ASAP, can't get in b/c of the backlog, or have to go off their parent's healthcare to find one b/c their parents don't support mental health recovery etc etc. So, if you're unable to afford a psychiatrist, right now, you can do the self-reporting and then sign up for CAPS ASAP so they can link you up with a therapist or psychiatrist that can help you with the paperwork. Or if you are able to afford one, then you can still self-report b/c it DOES take a while to find one b/c a lot of them are backed up right now/not taking new clients &lt;3 (but don't let it discourage you, it's still doable to find one, it just takes a little work and time!! DRC can help you too)",1635624766,11,0

"Yeah helping people is great! So it all depends how you want to approach that bc service in human health development is really broad, and there isn't a ""right"" way to do it.

Do you want to do primary research for human disease to look at mechanisms of infection? Can you see yourself working at a drug research company to develop therapeutics for mitigation + cure? Or would you prefer academia and work as a professor with your own lab to have your own investigation in an area of your choosing, as well as teach on the side to inspire future scientists?

Does healthcare interest you? Can you see yourself as a clinician to diagnose and guide people in the recovery of their illnesses? If you're into community work are you looking into underserved areas to improve access, or expand medical education to the general public? Some hospitals also also for doctors to do research on the side.

You also mention mental health. Psychiatry involves a medicinal treatment to mental health, so you'd need to go to medical school. There's also the psychotherapy treatment to mental illness, that work is does by psychologists. You'd need a PhD in clinical psychology to pursue that career, and that's a different discussion. Or are you wanting to do research in mental illness? Again, a PhD is needed, but in what depends on what type of research. Community and social impacts of a mental illness would be in psychology. The biological basis for a mental illness would be in neuroscience.

I realize that was a lot to read through lol. I'm trying to see where you're at with your career goals when you say you want to help people.

"Overall, MCDB and neuroscience are quite similar majors in their requirements- it‚Äôs in the upper division classes that you see the difference. The neuro major requires more neuroscience specific classes, I.e. developmental neuro, cognitive neuro, a neuroscience lab class. It‚Äôs also really geared towards pursuing grad school in a neuroscience field. MCD is a more general molecular biology degree. While you can take some neuro classes, they‚Äôre not required and you‚Äôll have more breadth to take other biology classes, such as evolution, microbiology, etc. MCD is more tailored for medical school and grad school for non-neuroscience biology.

"I'm just pointing out the irony that your opposition to covid protocols is civil liberties based, but then you want to *force* students into in-person classes just because *you* think that the risk is acceptable. 


&gt;The only reason remote should maybe be an option is for people who can't find housing since our school can't figure that out despite having acres upon acres of empty space.

That's the only reason *you* can think of. You have no idea if people have elderly ppl living in their homes, or close contacts that are high risk or immunocompromised. 


&gt;Anyone who doesn't have serious comorbitities has no reason to be scared of covid.

Again, that's may be true for *you*. But if you stop looking at just death as a metric, you have things like long covid, which occur at a much higher rate. Not to mention that there some people might not want to assume a high risk of catching a disease that will make them feel miserable for a week. Some people may not want to risk spreading it to higher risk friends and families. There's tons of reasons for people to be concerned about covid, even if *you* aren't. 


&gt;Especially vaxxed 18-23 year olds lol

The university is not just 18-23 year olds. Who teaches your classes? Who teaches your sections? Who runs the dining halls and other campus facilities? There are alot of people at higher risk in our community and limiting the risk of a major campus outbreak reduces their chances of contracting it. 

You can't seem to look at this from any perspective other than your own. Maybe a 50 year old professor doesn't want to be in a poorly ventilated lecture hall with 200 students 3 times a week. Should they be able to make that choice? Maybe a TA doesn't feel comfortable teaching a section in person. Should they get a say about whether that section is in person or not?

We're in a very different place than a month ago. We're about to see a very high level of community spread and a strained healthcare system. It is perfectly reasonable for some individuals to want to limit their risk, and for the school to take steps to lower rate of community spread.",1640924865,1,0

"I could be wrong b/c this is just my armchair opinion, but tbh I see us going fully remote. 

Only reason, is that I think between Jan3rd-14th some student (or students), living on campus, will show up and not notify their RA or housing office prior to arrival that they were unable to do a rapid COVID test. So, they won't be aware of their COVID status and may be asymptomatic. They will go to their dorms, etc and act like everything is fine while it spreads like wildfire. I just 100% see something like this happening based on a lot of the reddit posts, things I've seen in various discords, and other ucsc specific online spaces. The only way ucsc can combat this is requiring students to show their test while they re-enter their dorms, but I'm unsure of the re-entry process as I live off campus. It sounds like they are going on the honor system, based off the original e-mail, which will be problematic. Also, I think students wont follow the sequester period that is required once they arrive on campus. So, there will be parties, etc that cause spreader events. 

But, hopefully I'm wrong just b/c I don't want to see anyone sick or coming down with COVID. I'm fine with the online courses, it doesn't bother me, but I don't want to see a mass COVID outbreak so hopefully I'm wrong. But, as of now, I'm preparing myself for a quarter online, lol.",1640913940,1,0

"Honestly, it can get loud on pretty much any given night. I remember on Wednesday night during midterm week people were loudly partying until 3 am. Also the separation from the campus community makes UTC feel a bit isolated. The benefit, however, is being down the street from the metro station and being able to hop on a bus and go anywhere in SC county whenever you want, and the people are generally friendly.",1640901411,1,0
"Checking what though? Admin has completely failed to do their job at this point.

All we are told is to test negative PCR or Rapid within some period of time before showing up to Santa Cruz.

I could get a disposable rapid test from XYZ store and show negative on that and what? Take a picture?

Does the test have to be electronic?",1640900939,1,0

"While I want the first option more than anything (I learn JACK SHIT when it's remote), I do think that massively increasing enrollment w/o adding housing then making remote near impossible then backtracking with two weeks remote is...interesting, to say the least. It's not hard to see the frustration of people who prefer remote.",1640899849,1,0

"there should be a bigger push to make more lecture classes have a remote option even if they‚Äôre primarily in person especially when most if not all lecture halls already have built in cameras. 

I am interest to see what happens though, considering that the surge is so large. I think you should have to test more often, and they should promote contact tracing apps. Plus require professors to outline/address plans for if a student cannot come to class. 

And then of course, they should allow violence towards that one person in every lecture that comes dispute having a horrible cough üò∑",1640899366,1,0
I don't think the school has talked about this. I believe the admininstration is planning as we go along a few weeks at a time based on how the situation evolves. I just wanted to find out how other students feel about this.,1640899321,1,0

"And the only possible impact of doctors and nurses being quarantined for 14 days, is profit right?  Sick people will just not spend that money at the hospital and the hospital will lose out?  No additional resulting deaths or complications?  I understand that it's more comfortable to imagine this comes down to nothing but profit and loss, than that it could be actually dangerous to keep professionals at home for two weeks, but maybe instead of insisting that I'm taking big runs at things, you consider that every medical professional, and every truck driver, and every person who runs the local sewage or power plant, being simultaneously on quarantine, might have some serious implications.  You really stick your head in the sand, acknowledging the facts but then refusing to consider the implications.   

I have nurses and an ER doc in my immediate family. I'm very aware of how upset they are by this recommendation, and their discussions about how many of their coworkers are already ill, are part of what led me to the conclusion that we (as a society) probably can't afford to have everyone on two weeks of quarantine.  All those ""essential workers"" we forced back to work, to get us through the first few waves, came down with covid in stages (or not at all) due to the lowered transmissibility.  It's very possible we won't have that luxury this time.",1640898757,1,0

They can‚Äôt arrive by the provided date. They won‚Äôt be the only one with all of the flight cancellations around the country. The school is requiring us to test every 2 weeks.

"While I do agree on the whole people should be responsible adults and take the proper precautions, they definitively did not specify the 48 hour pre-arrival early enough. Maybe you received some emails that I didn't but the earliest email I received that explicitly stated that pre-arrival testing would be necessary was on Dec 27th. Earlier emails had simply stated that 48 hour pre-arrival testing was RECOMMENDED not required for vaccinated students and given that I had already planned to self isolate over winter I didn't stress over acquiring a rapid test.",1640898289,1,0

"I am not arguing that. You really take big runs that are unwarranted. Are you not aware the Airline CEO's pushed for this change and got it 6 days later?

"Depends on where it is hit and what broke. Some dents can be pulled out with a sufficiently strong suction cup. A tail light on a modern car will definitely cost $500 or more.
