"What the...after living in both cities as a biker, I can say, without a doubt, that Davis is universes better/safer for biking than Berkeley. I got severely door-dinged my first couple weeks biking in Berkeley (people love flinging their car doors open here) and know few coworkers who've gotten hit pretty badly. I don't call it Berserk-ely for no reason.",1612811250,3,0
"While it's definitely not conclusive, I went to the original site to check out some of the behind-the-scenes metrics for the bike scores. Davis and Berkeley have a roughly even ridership score and network. Davis is safer for riders, yet Berkeley has a substantially higher ""Reach"" score. [Comparison here](https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/compare/?c=1228)

Don't shoot the messenger, here's what they have to say about Reach:
&gt; The Reach score determines how well a community’s low-stress network serves all members of the community. It uses demographic data to understand differences in access and connectivity for traditionally underserved populations compared to the whole city. Data Sources: ACS, BNA

In short, I feel that it may be a difference in populations and network structure. Because Berkeley is denser, or possibly because they have more dedicated paths, they may have just edged Davis out in the ranks. In all fairness, I wouldn't want to ride on the roads in East Bay like I do in town, lol.",1612811210,3,0

"As a math major, I would warn you that upper division math is very different from lower division math. Lower division math classes are very calculation based and meant for more than just math majors. Upper division math classes are very much proofs based, so if working through the logics of proofs isn't your cup of tea, I would warn against it. But at the same time, if you like to learn more about the why behind math you have been learning, go for it math is great.",1612805524,1,0

"What's your major? Take one upper-division class before you decide. What you learn right now is NOTHING like upper-division math.

"For some reason, a LONG time ago someone decided it would be a good idea to start all calculus 1 classes with epsilon proofs. That's the dumbest thing because when I took calc 1 epsilon proofs caused people to drop out.

"I personally had a really good time taking Chamberlain. In my experience, she’s really clear about grading and what she wants you to know, and she’s overall pretty communicative and responsive to her students. 

I had her in spring 2020 quarter, so some things may have changed, but this was the format as I remember back then: two prerecorded lectures posted every week, each with a few “knowledge check” quizzes that are graded on participation. Every other week was a quiz, and every week without a quiz was a midterm—4 quizzes and 4 midterms total. It may sound stressful, but it never really felt that way because the professor was pretty good at teaching the material in my opinion.",1612745341,1,0
"broooo! You know what I think your feelings are completely validated. I honestly feel like I suck at programming too and tbh I don’t think I’m ever gonna feel any different.

As for the Sean Davis this ahah, yeah I can’t take ecs36c yet bc I haven’t taken ecs20 so I’ll be doing that course and 50 over the spring. I say take your break if you need it but I’d definitely look into a Udemy course to do on the side. I’ve had a hard time learning on my own but I bought this course on Udemy before for app dev and I think I really learned w that. So explore your options!

"I'm not gonna argue that Davis is at UCB/UCLA level (and of course nowhere close to Bama/UT/tOSU level) but at the same time, I'm not going to lump it in with campuses that are actually kinda dead. Maybe I'm dating myself and still kinda riding the nostalgia of the March Madness year, but at the same time, I do think having a college town and a stretch of decent sports did help lift the campus to kinda the middle of the pack of the UCs. I'd be comfortable with an argument that it's UCLA/UCB-gap-UCSB-gap-UCD-everyone else, or something, which would make sense with my observations.

I have actually been quite critical of Davis' spirit on this sub, historically, but that's because my expectation is very high. I'm still going to give a little credit where it's due.

This whole comment chain came about because of of nitpicks on this sentence:

&gt;The three ""big"" UCs (the ones that have football teams and generally  more history and school spirit -- Davis, Berkeley, and UCLA) are  probably all good choices for you because they're decent examples of the  ""traditional"" US college experience while also being very inclusive and  having a substantive international bent.

which I still stand by. I explained my criteria for the word ""big"". I said they're *decent* examples of the ""traditional"" US college experience, and I think you could argue that Davis is a decent example because at least all the elements are there, if not in the desired quantities. OP probably not going to become a top contributor on r/cfb, but they def should check out a homecoming game if one is available during their semester, and Davis can provide that. I also added the explicit value of picking the UCs off the list without suggesting that they're actually more spirited than the others.

I guess you could argue I should have worked in UCSB there, but then I would have probably thrown in a paragraph about the pros and cons of football vs non-football schools and maybe down the rabbit hole of the UCSB/Cal Poly soccer rivalry.",1611456337,2,0

"I was made very aware of that in my time at Davis, yes.

But I think it's appropriate for this discussion for two reasons. First, we're speaking in really broad strokes about things like ""spirit"" and ""traditional college experience"". I chose to weight something that overall is heavily emphasized in the US as being an essential part of that, even if a lot of Davis students don't care as much (which is amplified by Reddit demographics IMO). I think like say a Ohio State grad would be very confused to hear someone argue that UCSC is a more traditional college experience over UCD.

Second, OP is looking at a very narrow window with a single shot at experiencing a US college. They didn't directly mention sports in their post, but then again, I don't expect it to be on prospective international students' radar since it's such a US-specific thing. I think it's important to consider it as a factor for OP's purposes because screaming in the Aggie Pack on ESPN or whatever might be a pretty unique experience for them. So right away it was something on my mind when I thought about how to respond.",1611445549,4,0

"Arlington has been a good experience for me. 

So the pros for me are: amazing customer service/office team and quick maintenance team (I'll put in a request for something at 8AM and it'll be done by the afternoon), quick access to the bus stop, close to Westlake Market for emergency runs (I typically go to Trader Joe's/Target/Safeway though), and wifi + water + sewer/trash included in the rent. 

In terms of the mold, it has been slowly prevalent for our apartment. We noticed that the exhaust fan in the bathroom is in a horrible position (on one of the furthest walls away from the shower instead of the ceiling). So, we'll usually have to open the door to let the air out in addition to letting the fan run for a couple minutes after our showers. 

For insects, I've seen just a couple but not that many to gross me out. I live on the first floor, so you might have better luck with a second/third floor place. We had flies for a while, but no ants/cockroaches. Bug spray will be your quick fix. 

One big con about this place is how the stove hood is a weak fan. It's a pretty shitty fan that doesn't help when you're frying, and it blows air directly towards the fire alarm. I've set off a few fire alarms, but I've been more conscious about opening up the windows before I do heavy-duty cooking. It's just really ill placement of the fire alarm. 

I know I just expanded on the cons more than the pros, but Arlington has one of the lowest rents in West Davis (did my research cause I did consider moving out after August). There aren't many deals going on here in comparison to the downtown places or the places near campus. 

I enjoyed my stay though, so I re-signed my lease for next year too.",1613856685,1,0

"This is my own opinion, but for me, I stay motivated by doing the things I enjoy. I know I should've been majoring in civil engineering because that's what I was originally majoring in at Davis. 

But I also had the realization that I did not enjoy all of the excruciating work and couldn't keep up with it. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. I know I'm not great at math, and though I could've just ""pulled myself up by my bootstraps"", I also recognized that I probably would've taken like 7 years to get a BA in engineering and I would've been doing the major that everyone wanted me to do, the major that was going to pay the most money.

So I switched to design. And I am doing wonderful in all my courses. My professors really like me, have written me recommendation letters, and I've gotten cool opportunities because I'm pursuing something I enjoy. Is this the best financial decision? Nope. Will I get an awesome job afterwards? Probably nope. But am I enjoying learning and being creative? Yup!

You know, not everyone wants to live a domestic life with kids and a wife living in the suburbs. I personally don't. I grew up in a poor neighborhood with my hardworking parents. I've seen what real poverty is like (in the US anyway). When I consider my failures in college, I also understand that I've been through worse. I've grown up not having food on the table, doing really fucked up things for money, seeing really sad things going on in my neighborhood. I've had worse moments; me failing some classes is not the end of the world. 

I am alive, I am healthy, and I am getting by. Life is a mixed bag. We all aren't striving towards the same goals in life. Really, there is no goal in life. There is no meaning to life. All you need to do is live and be happy, however you choose to make that happen. If you want to do something in life because it'll make you happy, then go for it — and do it for yourself. 

We need to stop shaming people for ""lack of motivation"" or ""discipline."" We all have our baggage, our stories, our situations. I don't sit around all day worrying about my student debt or whether I will have a corner office in 10 years time. I have lived through worse, I think I'll be fine as long as I have a place to live and food to eat.",1613769019,1,0

"I've never taken any BIS classes, but I understand the feeling. Really start reaching out to resources on campus, particularly academic advisors for whatever college you're in. They've been helping me figure out what to do academically since I'm having a terrible, terrible quarter. Ask your doctor for a letter and start emailing your TA's/Professors to see if they can offer you flexibility so you can focus on your harder classes. 

But most of all, try to remember that college is just temporary. It sucks to fail academically, especially if all you've ever known is school. A lot of people go on academic probation but don't want to share because they feel embarrassed. They feel like everyone is going to see them as ""lazy"" and ""undisciplined."" 

For me, I'm definitely gonna go on academic probation next quarter which just sucks. But like, students and teachers alike need to realize that we are not living in normal circumstances. People's mental health is crushing them like never before, people are worried about their financial situation, people aren't socializing very much and don't have those crucial support systems, and the future seems bleak for young people right now. So, all things considered — you are completely justified in feeling terrible. We are people first, and students second. Be gentle with yourself. College is hard, but it is temporary. Failing in college is not an indication of your character or your knowledge. 

I actually worry about people in college who don't experience academic failure, because when they inevitably go through failure in the future, they are gonna fall hard. Be gentle with yourself and take this as a moment of learning. I have so much more admiration for educated folks who have failed but persisted, and way less admiration for people who never fail and never stumble.",1613765782,1,0
"Even though I've heard/read that lectures are ineffective teaching methods, I still prefer them to online classes. There's something about in-person classes that makes you feel the need to be engaged. I associate home with rest, so it's hard for me to get into the groove of wanting to learn.

And well personally, I have to take studio classes for my design major which can't happen over zoom because we need to be on campus working with materials and using equipment. I find the online classes really tedious, especially because I sorta need to work with other students on our assignments (like ceramics, textiles, photo developing). I'm kind of concerned about how I'm going to complete my major if we keep pushing towards online.",1613764804,2,0

"It's most likely them, as SCJ members usually never say their groups' names in the beginning when they introduce themselves to people they approach and then ask them for contact info, nor do they tell people who they're really are affiliated with until one has completed their Bible studies.

When I was invited through Instagram last year to some Bible study group by a random person and she never told me the group's name. One of my mistakes was not asking the group's members the name of their Bible study group.

"Not sure if this helps, but here’s a sort of funny story that this reminded me of. My grandma passed away the week of finals when I was in community college a few years ago. It was already stressful enough trying to finish the semester because I knew it was coming, and then when she actually passed it made things even harder. We had a final due the next day, and I didn’t feel like I would get it finished in time. So, a few hours before the final was due, I emailed the professor letting them know what happened, and saying that I could provide a death certificate (since people lie to them all the time about stuff like that). I got an email back the day after the final was due, saying

“I’m sorry to hear about the loss of your grandmother. Unfortunately I think you emailed the wrong professor because I don’t see you in any of my rosters”

I accidentally emailed a professor I had taken the previous semester, and my current professor had no idea what was going on... thankfully I got everything cleared up and my actual professor told me to just turn it in when I can",1615996977,2,0

"I'd say that kinda balance depends on major.  I have a friend who has half their day free as a senior taking like 12-16 units of music classes.  Im taking 16 units of engineering and I had one complete weekend to myself this entire quarter.  I also had midterms weeks 5-10, I really get it. 

Although I never had semesters, I did struggle real hard with school last quarter.  I recommend watching [this lecture](https://youtu.be/IlU-zDU6aQ0) on double speed and take some notes.  Studying for 30 minutes and taking a break for 5, using a study lamp to differentiate study space from eating space from game space (my desk) and making my sleep schedule an absolute priority have all been really helpful.  I failed a class last quarter and now I (currently) have straight A's.  I fear for my thermo final though, she's in 30 minutes.

"You can email and ask the professor of the class that has a time conflict and ask if lectures will be synchronous or asynchronous.

But if there's a lab where you have to be present then you might have to find another class if it's not a requirement. If you need that course for your major or for like a perquisite then email the professor that. They can probably work something out so you're still able to do the lab. I had FST103 last quarter and our lab period required mandatory attendance through zoom and my professor and the TA's were very lenient and understanding.

I have also heard bad things about Irvine, but I was completely stunned by the campus and downtown area. Beautiful campus and a great city life. Irvine itself it more suburban away from everything, but there is very easy access to down with their zipcar service (get a car for 5$ an hour).

"Thinking about my male-seeking friends who found dates (including those that found me lol) there was a pretty wide variety:

* Apps, sure (Tinder's hit or miss and kinda its own deal, but I had friends have good luck with OK Cupid)
* Neighbors in dorms/apartments who you meet just by knocking on the door and introducing yoursef (tread carefully, can get awk)
* Classes
* Making conversation at a sports game
* Friends of friends/acquaintances (like someone I met through a friend at a party reached out a while later)
* Just simply friendship turning into something more (like inviting over for movie nights/go to the DC together for a while, reconnecting with someone from dorms, etc)

I'm gonna be honest, I didn't recall too many people I knew at UCD having problems finding dates or an SO so long as they were reasonably confident and comfortable talking to new people. Yeah not everyone will be single/interested/have free time, but if you get in the habit of introducing yourself, inviting people to things, and being able to move on if someone you liked wasn't interested, it's a pretty decent and stress-free dating scene IMO.

"Basically all new construction over the past decade was in Tercero (except now they're finally adding something to Cuarto I believe). So if you go Tercero I believe you're 100% guaranteed to have something built this century and likely since 2010. From what I've seen, all the new construction has somewhat the same design philosophy where they have a very open feel with central community areas and a lot of natural lighting.

Segundo has had a much slower replacement rate and there are only three new buildings from ""this gen"" which are about the same quality and design as Tercero. However your odds of getting one are simply lower at Segundo for that reason, and if you wind up in an older dorm it might feel a bit more cramped and structured (think longer rectangular hallways).

Honestly, I expect any dorm to be decently maintained and really the people make or break the dorm experience IMO. I personally am a fan of Segundo's location because off-campus food, the ARC, and the basketball arena are right there. But Tercero has benefits as well since it's so close some of the classes.",1619143360,2,0

"And it's not just for a workout. I've biked to Woodland... because I don't have a car. In fact, California law states that a person on a bicycle can ride on any highway (road, freeway, etc.) so long as there isn't a sign when you entering the highway saying bicycles are prohibited. If you look at the on-ramp to the freeway you'll see a sign saying ""Bicycles, Motor-Driven Cycles, Pedestrians Prohibited"" for that very reason. 

Of course, there are exceptions. If there are no reasonable options EXCEPT for the freeway, you won't see those signs and it will be 100% legal to ride on the shoulder of the freeway. 

Ever wanted to ride on the 5 Freeway in Southern California? I've done it! Going south from Orange County into San Diego County is Camp Pendleton. When the path through Camp Pendleton closes for military exercises, so does the path through the camp and there is no other way to ride to San Diego except... on the 5 Freeway. When that happens, Caltrans covers up those prohibition signs and bicyclists can ""Ride the 5"" for that span.

"Lots of good answers here so far, though one thing to maybe help you decide: Davis has a pretty good reputation in the NorCal region, so if you are interested in living/working here, having a degree from here will open doors. If you plan on settling down elsewhere like the East Coast, I'm not sure how employers out there view Davis (or if they are as familiar with it). 

Generally-speaking though, it's fairly common for people to settle down close to where they went to school, so think about where you want to end up geographically if you are deciding between multiple schools. My friends who went out of state to NYU, for example, have settled down in the New York tri-state area permanently, so where you want to live beyond the four or so years is important.",1617996349,2,0

" 2016 Alumni and (pre-pandemic) regular campus visitor here:

&gt;What is the campus like?

Very chill and spread out. A lot of avenues for biking and walking (non-staff cars aren't allowed in the main part of campus). A lot of shade. THey basically expect you to have bikes the first years

Dorms vary a bit depending on which one you're in. I believe most of the people these days are in newer, kinda boxy buildings that are designed to feel a bit spartan and modern. The dorms are clumped in three areas off in the corners of campus with a dining hall attached to each area.

One related thing to note is that architecturally it isn't as pretty as East Coast schools. But a lot of the communal/services buildings are new or renovated with a lot of natural light and open space. So all the new construction on campus gives off a kinda mid/high-end airport hotel and conference center vibe. It's actually very pleasant, just not in a memorable way, if that makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is the food good?

I'd give it a B+ at least. The dining halls are basically what you'd expect from major college dining halls; a fair amount of variety and a step up from generic cafeteria food, but you'll get bored. There are some good food trucks on campus as a change of pace. And then in town there's a fair amount of student-catered restaurants. I know true foodies think Davis food is a bit lacking in selection compared to schools in cities, which makes sense, but there were enough good options that I never got tired of the food there.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What are the most common majors?

Check out the list, it's pretty interesting: [https://www.ucdavis.edu/majors/blog/top-ten-majors](https://www.ucdavis.edu/majors/blog/top-ten-majors)

Looks like it's Psych, followed by the two Econ majors, followed by various pre-med majors.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is it friendly?

In my experience, yes. It's not a true party school but people are pretty chill and open to hanging out. That's just balanced by the fact that there is a LOT of studying going on because it is a pretty big STEM school after all.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why did you decide to go here?

I think it has one of the best campus vibes and college towns in the UC system -- actually really in all of CA. I honestly *love* being a Davis alumni -- more than when I was a student actually -- because the town of Davis is just so pleasant to visit. So it's great having an excuse to hang out there.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How good is it compared to other UC schools?

Really depends on major, and ""good"" is relative anyway. I think it's at about the same level of recognition as UCSB and UCI, but that's different from actual quality which is really hard to measure. If you get a job in CA though, especially Norcal, there will be a general understanding that at minimum you're reasonably hardworking.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What is the financial aid like?

It varies too much to describe. Definitely use the Net Price caluclator for your situation which will be more accurate than anything someone can tell you on here: [https://myawards.ucdavis.edu/AidEstimator/](https://myawards.ucdavis.edu/AidEstimator/)",1617994981,3,0

Even for California cc, some courses are not transferable to UCs, so you should not expect all of your cc courses will transfer to ucd. As an extent of that, I would not recommend taking summer courses from your state's cc since you won't know if they are transferable or not. If you want to take summer courses, you can start taking UCD summer session this summer.

"I'll take a crack at explaining it. You can get a pretty good overview of the campus map at this website: [here](https://campusmap.ucdavis.edu/)

The Segundo residence halls are split into 3 categories: 

**Regan Residence Halls** OLD, decrepit. I know they don't have tours during the pandemic, but I don't think anyone would ever lead a tour group here. ""Regan"" is a cluster of old halls (Campo, Indio, Paloma, etc) that are very stuffy. I think they're all max 3 stories high, and there are only stairs, no elevators. There's AC and windows, but I didn't think the air flow was very good. There isn't a kitchen area in the hall, instead there's ""Regan main"" which is like a rec building that has a kitchen that all the halls share there. There are doubles, triples, and these weird suites? For example, I paid for a double along with my roommate, and instead of a normal room, we got a smaller rectangle of a room attached to a common area that was attached to another small double. The common area had all four of our desks there. I didn't like that at all, and I didn't like living there at all (I moved out as soon as I could). I wouldn't recommend this area at all (I'm sure the people are very nice, sorry to anyone who loved these halls), but you can't choose/avoid these halls if you choose Segundo.

**High Rises** Every room in these ""high rise dorms"" is a double, save for a few singles. They're called high rises because one entire wall is a window (has full curtains as well). The room is big, and easily split into two. Honestly a decent amount of space (I moved here after Regan). Each floor has two bathrooms, a small rec area, a kitchenette, and a laundry room with washers and dryers. No one lives on the first floor, and the highest floor is the 5th (bless, there are elevators). As far as I know, all the high rise dorms (the longer buildings on the map: Gilmore, Bixby, Ryerson, Malcolm, etc.) have the same layout.

**The Newest Halls** A triplet of residence halls: Alder, Thompson, Miller. These most closely resemble the newer Tercero dorms; mostly triple rooms. The buildings are shiny and new*er*, but they wanted to build as many triples as they could, so the rooms are pretty small and cramped with three people. I believe there's 1 bunk, 1 single bed in each triple? It's recommended the person with the single bed props up their bed high so there's space underneath for their dresser. I kinda forget these halls, but they have multiple smaller bathrooms, washers, dryers, kitchenette, big open rec area in the center, oh and an elevator. If you choose a triple in Segundo, you're most likely to be put here.

FYI, you can change your major/college after your first quarter at Davis. It is not too late to take ENG 3 in later quarter, and you can spend your first quarter relaxed with some GE classes.",1621303064,1,0

You’re prob right I just overthought it. That’s what I was thinking of doing too but was like also thinking of leaving it as is without 12 units and wanted to know what would happen.

"Honestly a lot of people gave me their sympathy when they learned our commencement was canceled but I really didn't want to attend in the first place. I think our class was going to be the first to have three mega sized ceremonies instead of per college?? Thats so insane to me, as if these kinds of ceremonies aren't already too long. I think I'm really self-centered, but there aren't enough of my friends/me also graduating there to justify listening to hundreds (? Thousands?) of strangers' names. 

I work with one of my class of 2020 friends (♡) and we both agree it's been too long. Maybe a small graduation party amongst friends/families would be better.",1621295047,2,0

"99% of the criticism of Nitta is related to how poorly his teaching adapted(or more accurately didn't) to an online format. I had heard mostly good things about his ability to teach 150 prior to online. Since fall instruction will be in person, one can imagine that this should mean Nitta should be back to being a good professor. That being said Porquet is pretty great of a professor too, but in the market for seats in 150, a bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush. If you really don't vibe with Nitta, you can always just drop the class.",1621294883,3,0

Also if you are coming from another university it may just be stating the name of a similar/equivalent course at your former school.

You can also take upper div undergrad classes (at least in my program) and they can count for elective units. Lower div classes you can also take but they don't count for anything.",1621288869,2,0
