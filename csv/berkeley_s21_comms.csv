"I took both in the same semester and got a C for EE127 and an A- for CS170. EE127 is a lot of complex math (linear algebra x.x) and was really challenging for me. CS170 felt a lot more intuitive and became really useful in my SWE career.

(whatever I'm saying from here on is based on Fall '19)workload wise, I would say on paper EE127 seems to have lesser work (since it doesn't have a project), but I spent so long on all the homework. The slides are less useful, hence I read a lot of the textbook which was way more time-consuming. CS170's project didn't take much time, and the readings they provided were not as long. CS170 has great materials and great TA support too.

127 is definitely more difficult. I'm really weak at math so I completely flopped at 127, I would say its a lot harder to get an A. It's actually a miracle I got a C because if you ask me to tell you what I learnt from 127, I can't even give you an answer. A few years after I took these courses I realized that data science isn't really for me, so I'm completely biased. Take my opinions with a pinch of salt!",1611485442,1,0

"I am trying to process this rant and here are my thoughts. I don't know why you would feel way ""poor and useless and stupid without getting a CS degree"", but I am sorry for what you went through. However, you don't need to be in conventional major to succeed in life or make money, there are countless examples of this in the workforce. I'm glad you go to therapy because it's a great resource. Personally, I've rarely met anyone toxic as a CS major and most of my interactions with EECS staff and other CS majors have been positive and extremely welcoming. I seriously hope you don't really ""hope everyone in the Bay Area dies of suicide"". Yes, there are toxic environments and needlessly competitive culture and the pay disparity between other jobs are big, which in itself is a problem with society not just Silicon Valley/Bay Area. Aspects like the recruiting process is extremely stressful on applicants and it sucks because it's actually toxic, but you don't give up. If you're in toxic environment, you can persevere or just get the fuck out of there. I don't think Berkeley CS culture is toxic, please meet the right people. :)",1611482785,2,0

"I was thinking about withdrawing this week after already being burned out, but graduating is quite important I guess unless you want to work part-time jobs forever or make your own company. But the part about being able to get a decent job needs more background to be more convincing. I personally don‚Äôt know how a person who didn‚Äôt graduate can get a decent job after a few years of trials and errors. You had your BA alright, but what if you withdraw from college completely and try to land on some decently-paying job. It‚Äôs hard in normal times, and even harder at a time like this.

I‚Äôm gonna force myself to stay in college regardless of how well I do. Having a college degree is so different from just a high school degree from the perspective of almost any employers. It‚Äôs not the most ideal, but it‚Äôs the reality for now. I‚Äôm not even gonna go into how much you need to pay to get that degree, which like OP said, is quite worthless a few years after graduating.

That said, taking deep breaths, remaining focused on your goals and celebrating every single little victory sure as hell helps when your grades don‚Äôt reflect your perceived efforts.

"Well there's 2 parts to this:

Issue 1: Majors/classes will gradually get harder over time. Like classes overtime are just gonna have to learn more/do more, especially considering Data science is a newer major. Like in the first year d100 was offered it was maybe half the difficulty it is now. 

Issue 2: This has less to do with the class and more with EECS budget cuts. We've seen eecs lose funding and seats and currently lots of cs students who couldn't make the 3.3 gpa cut are taking data science and we see lots of econ/haas students double majoring in data science. There's been lots of talks about even raising the GPA requirement from 3.3 to like 3.5 or 3.7. However if data science is available there's still gonna be issues with seats being available. This is gonna sound really bad and honestly probably isn't even right but if everyone sees data science as an easy major and the current pre reqs are just a 2.0 GPA then that will put a lot of pressure on cs classes. Especially just due to the overlap between the 2 majors(and I'm one of those people basically just doing this as a cs major with a dash of statistics and ML). So there's 2 ways to maybe lessen that strain and it's either make the pre req gpa higher or make the data science courses harder to maybe discourage people from just adding it on as a second major. I have a bunch of cs/econ friends who just add data sciene as a second major just cause there's a lot of overlap between the 2 majors but there's only so much funding for these classes and something needs to be done.

Now again these are my own opinions and I could be completely wrong so take it with a grain of salt.",1611472277,2,0

You can either use your Cal GPA or recalculate with Cal and CC (recalculate don‚Äôt average). My understanding is either choice is acceptable.

Also, just be careful about renting units in unfinished buildings and read the lease or get some sort of guarantee.  Some lease clauses benefit the owner / manager and allow them to deliver the unit as late as 1-month and still hold you to the original lease but not charge you rent during the delay.  After a certain time period if the unit is still undeliverable you can get out of it and get your deposit back.",1612802829,1,0

"Get in touch with Berkeley SAO (Student Advocate's Office), they can definitely help you in this case whether it is a accommodations for courses, or a medical withdrawal. I think their user is u/berkeleysao . Also, for what it is worth, given your situation you should apply to DSP (Disabled Student Program) which could be useful for long-term academic accommodations for you, especially given what you have experienced. You should be able to apply for services through the website, and you can ask your doctor/surgeon for the necessary documentation. The next stage will be an interview, not as a screening test, but more so to configure what accommodations you need such as more time on an exam, excused days off, extensions, non-mandatory attendance, etc..

"I think that it's always important that we prioritize our mental health. Your academic career spans over many years and taking the time to sort out your mental health during one semester can set a positive foundation for your future performance (e.g. preventing burnout), especially since you're considering going to graduate school. If p/np'ing your classes would help relieve your struggles, then I do encourage that you be open to doing it. From my impression, graduate schools do have a holistic element to them and there is space in your applications to talk about your academic journey. As long as your overall application is strong, p/np's your classes will not, in itself, prevent schools from accepting you. For reference, I p/np'd all my classes during the first COVID semester, including 2 major classes, and still got into good graduate schools in my field (top 20 if that matters to you).",1612750827,1,0

"1. Don't drink or eat anything with caffeine before or during the test, and time yourself when you are taking practice exams. If the panic attacks are really bad and relate to things like anxiety, you can try to seek help from DSP.
2. I heard people were able to get an A- even they got about 50% on the first midterm, but not As, unfortunately. To get an A, you can only lose \~25 points (inclusive of any non-competition extra credit you can possibly get). Getting 60% on the first midterm means losing 16 points ish. So if you do really well in midterm 2 and final, you still have a shot at an A (though chances are small) or A- (possible and has been done before).
3. I am pretty sure a good number of people were able to do that though I don't happen to know any of them. Just like the earlier example of someone getting an A-, I think you still have a chance of getting a pretty good grade, so don't give up now!

Lastly, I think 61A is going to open advising OHs after midterm grades come out and many people are feeling stressed. You can ask a TA the questions you have above, and they'll be able to provide better answers especially if they've been on course staff for a while.

"Yes and no. Most would disagree, but I'd argue that the activities you do outside of class are what make you marketable. Even though you have two semesters left, consider this: that's two semesters of potential coursework that better aligns with your interests. 

Being a political science major, I often find myself questioning the tangibility of my degree, nonetheless, it's the activities I've done outside of classes (e.g., data science research, independent projects, stuff within different departments) that are what make me a Cal student (this applies anywhere apart from Cal, obviously).

second, I think it's worth isolating evil. intelligence software is not inherently evil; you need a way of tracking legitimate threats to the country. ICE using the software itself is not inherently evil, as you need some way of monitoring who's coming into the country. What is evil is the actions ICE took with this information. 

It's very likely that the family separation policy did not exist when Palantir first entered into its contracts with ICE.

"For UC Berkeley, you can only put one major down on the application.

If you get accepted to one of the other colleges (Engineering, Chemistry, etc), you will be declared in the major that you applied for. Then you could declare a second major later on after you actually start attending the university. 

I believe for most other UCs it‚Äôs similar. You get to put down a primary and secondary major on the application, but you are only accepted for one major. Then you can add a second major later on. The process for declaring the second major will differ depending on the UC though.",1615995324,1,0

"Not a dumb question at all!

Seriously apparently would be turning off your phone, ideally being in a locked room with close to zero distractions if possible (I use a noise machine), watching all the lectures you haven‚Äôt seen at 1.25x and taking notes on what seems important, going back to lectures especially those between mt1 and MT2 and getting some notes on big stuff there, then if you have time after all that doing discussions in order of least comfortable with the topic to most comfortable with the topic (don‚Äôt be afraid to check sols if you‚Äôre stuck for 5m on a question since you‚Äôre under time) and then doing as many practice questions and reading some solns in a similar pattern to the discussions.

FYI I often only get through ‚Äúfinishing the lectures‚Äù and ‚Äúskimming a couple discussions I was the most sketchy on‚Äù and taking notes, and I‚Äôve felt these have brought me up the most to where I basically never have to skip a question outright and I at least have some general ideas of the principles from seeing the lecture big points and some example problems.

Also HKN reviews if available I found better than official ones almost nearly and you could put that as high priority.

Hope this helps! Also getting distracted doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre screwed, or if your setup isn‚Äôt totally pristine, I‚Äôd just shoot for as much focused work without panicking as possible in your shoes

Being 100% honest and upfront with you, I have been in similar situations way too often to count, taken everything from 61 series to 70 to 6 upper divs, and found that by SERIOUSLY applying myself hardcore the last 12 like hours of desperation before reckoning you can truly make a GRADE difference.

But please think of your health and take it seriously. I think let someone know if you are gonna be in this state and to check up on you. And also be realistic with yourself if you think you can mentally handle this or not.  
I want to say that, I genuinely think you can go up WAY MORE than most people give credit for with this approach (especially with meticulous insane cheat sheets and exposure to ALL material you had like no understanding of before). BUT it comes at a cost to your long term health, how you can function on other days, your ability to keep on a good sleep schedule, and ability to translate these types of desperation routines into like corporate life.

I think that online CS classes were much easier during the initial change in spring 2020, which was compounded by the very generous declaration policy for P/NP classes that semester.

Additionally, most the stories I read were just saying he was arrogant and cocky, but never any actual assault with evidence. Plus, why would a Cal student assault 20+ women who all seemingly were connected to each other on purpose, it would make more sense that he wants good reviews since girls like us talk about things like hookup experiences among ourselves, but that's just my own logic.",1615969349,1,0
"The overall experience for CS classes right now is honestly that, if you someone who just can read the book to get the info, understand pretty much everything yourself without needing external help if you put the time into it, and are self reliant / experienced, you will find things easier. A lot of the time that might have been ""wasted"" for you before, jumping around, getting to campus and back physically, and having to add in more human elements that (while valuable) add time to the process, probably means overall you can save time and get a good education right now, cheaper than ever if you live with family.

However, for someone in my shoes, and many like me to varying degrees, I would be wary of the fact that the worst downside BY FAR is the loss of in person office hours. The biggest way I absorbed so much info was by working with people I randomly met there on the same questions, overhearing the TAs helping other people one on one in the same room, and also just having the clarity of actual humans sitting down and working with you. And, the queues were incredibly short in person pretty much always (for 61C it was like I often got instant help in person, and then online had to wait 4+ hours often). Usually office hours require sniping or getting lucky in order to achieve help in right now. Also, exams are generally ""harder"" to force out cheating via doing surface level stuff as easily, but I think that is taken into account for grading. It's also much harder to make friends, make study groups, and replicate the social element that really makes a lot of this work more than just a grind.

So, overall I think the experience is worse for probably near everyone but the strong introvert who is a very strong student (nothing wrong with these people though!). The students most reliant on office hours are the ones really gonna be screwed over and I highly recommend trying to find a GOOD discord group if you can because it is a literal life saver.

"I did the same thing 40 years ago, although it had nothing to do with yield rate or comparing the schools.  It had to do with not being able to afford Stanford (which was just as ridiculously overpriced then as now and offered far short of a reasonable amount of financial aid, even though I was dead broke) and knowing a bargain when I saw it (in Cal, which was much more reasonable then than now).  Either way, I enjoy the fact that got to turn down Stanford in favor of Cal.  

Since then I've gotten to know the culture of both schools.  There are many wonderful kids at Stanford, but as an observer, my take is that the overall culture there is a bad fit for anyone who doesn't come from a certain background.  I think Cal's diverse population is a big plus for anyone who wasn't born with a silver spoon in their mouth.  Stanford is notorious for grade inflation, and an unwritten policy of carrying students along who probably shouldn't be there.  Employers know that, or find that out.  There are plenty of Stanford graduates who live up to the promise that admission to that school implies, no doubt (some of them work at Cal) but I don't know that the ""prestige"" where it counts (when you're trying to get a job) is any better, than what surviving the rigors of Cal gets you.",1617985451,3,0

It is a little far so that meant extra walking for humanity classes but hey, I was part of Freshman minus-15 squad hehe. On a serious note, when starting my freshman year, I had never been anywhere alone, so walking to and fro the dorms at night was really scary, especially because no public transport except the 52 or night safety shuttle go remotely near. I usually made sure to have someone walk most of the way with me and I left many gatherings early because I knew I needed to get home.

I‚Äôve visited blackwell and to me, it feels like a long narrow cell, especially because inly one roommate gets a window whereas at foothill, I had so so so much space- a huge double, a living room for entertaining my friends/studying, a mostly private bathroom, etc. On top of that, Foothill felt like a log cabin in the middle of the woods away from the business of the universityc whereas Blackwell really feels like a college dorm made as an efficient use of space.

"&gt;The time till the stolen data becomes public, may be longer and may be spread out over time.

that doesn't make sense. if you release (sell) the information slowly, then the victims would already have been notified of the breach and taken security precautions like fraud alerts, changing card/account information, making the information ""stale.""  it is better for them to strike quickly and empty accounts and credit limits before victims realize they need to take precautions.

that's not to say someone physically can't release it slowly, just that it's irrational and counterproductive for them.",1619165999,2,0

"There's 3 important things exposed: bank account, credit/debit card, SSN/ITIN. Email, phone, and street address are all somewhat public.

Bank account: open a new one, transfer funds, close old one.

Credit/debit card: get a new one.

SSN: freeze credit. If problems plague you for a long time, go to SSA and ask for number change. That is one of the allowed reasons. You will probably have to submit proof, but you'll have plenty of that. So there is no such thing as ""my SSN will be out there for the rest of my life"" unless you refuse to do something about it.

As you can see, everything boils down to ""get a new one."" Governments and banks aren't going to say ""screw you, i don't want to deal with identity theft.""

go here [https://www.identitytheft.gov/](https://www.identitytheft.gov/) if you need more help.

"Average GPA being the same is a statement about CS students who got past the GPA cap.  Yes, people who get high grades get high grades.  How about those who are excluded because they didn't get high enough grades, but can still do passing work?

I dispute that 80-85% success statistic, but in any case it's only true of students who completed all three courses.  What of the ones who didn't do all three because it was no longer possible to get up to the three-course GPA?  

The statistics I see: Of the L&amp;S cohort who entered and took CS 61A in Fall 2017 (the last pre-COVID two-year lower division cohort), just over half (51%) of those CS61A students took all three courses; just over a third (38%; 74% of those that took all three) met the cap. \_Nobody\_ who got a B- or lower in that CS 61A was able to reach 3.3 and declare. Only 6 students who got a B were able to do it. Students who come in with weak preparation and struggle in that first course are at a huge disadvantage.

Somewhere around 450-500 students who set out to study CS ended up being unable; if you look at a typical Spring you'll find about 300-350 more.

Finally, as to money as a solution:  It seems that people are arguing two ways here.  As you point out, this isn't going to save the University money.  And it doesn't ""save"" EECS money; they're not spending money they don't have.  

Should EECS get additional funds to hire GSIs and therefore raise the size of courses?  That's not the only question:  EECS upper division classes are typically over 500 students.  Is that the right learning environment?  Fixing that requires additional faculty, which requires additional space and research resources, which requires more graduate students, which requires ...  Making a part of the University  several times larger is \_hard\_.  People who argue that serving this huge growth of CS students well just requires some money in a teaching account are not looking at the issue in serious depth.",1614885331,1,0
"Research is what most of the professors are here for. It is where they work on cutting edge stuff and there's tons of it in EECS. You can apply through URAP or reach out to specific labs or grad students if you've taken the right classes or have the right experience to be able to contribute. Since you probably haven't taken a lot of upper divs yet you're best bet is probably URAP

"I love this idea - the minor is enough to get you into a masters program or a PsyD, if research is what you want to do.

"So a few things:

1. Youre 100% not the only one who feels this way. Burn out is a real thing and it‚Äôs rough. And that‚Äôs ok! More likely than not your peers are probably going through something similar but aren‚Äôt showing it. Hell, some of them might be looking at you and feeling inadequate about what they‚Äôre doing. Keep in mind your study ‚Äògoal‚Äô. You only need to pass your class. 5 days is a good amount of time still. Breathe. You will be ok. Set a minimum for yourself (i.e. review 1 practice problem today..no more no less). Ask for some friends to help you out if you need. Change your location. Try not to study in bed. Even if you‚Äôre not trying to study, just go outside, sit on the glade. Even if you get minimal studying done, you may feel better having done something. 

2. You still have so much time to pursue psych. For one, try the berkeley summer minor for developmental psych. You can finish the minor in one summer and get a $2000 scholarship for it. (Also 3.65 is a really great GPA)

3. Take it from an alumni, your undergrad degree really doesn‚Äôt mean all that much. If you have skills in R and stats then you have the skills to potentially get in on some entry level research(if that thing interests you). A gap year spent volunteering and building your resume can be very beneficial if you‚Äôre trying to switch fields!

"I‚Äôm a current freshman, so I can‚Äôt say from personal experience abt the difficulty of later classes, but Ik that it differs for different classes. I‚Äôve heard, just to name a few, that CS188(AI)is not too difficult, but CS189(machine learning) is quite difficult(like, harder than the intro classes I think). So you can def maneuver around some of the hardest classes for upper divs, if you so desire(you have a lot of freedom over which upperdivs you take). And abt the only super top-of-the-line students getting good grades, I don‚Äôt think that is really true. You need a B+ average among the three classes (CS61a/61b/70) to declare, which should translate to top 50ish percent, maybe as low as top 55-60 percent in some cases. So you have to be about average to declare. Altho I think that some people who take these classes aren‚Äôt interested in declaring, so that might skew the statistics and make it a little easier. If you want, you can see the grade distributions on Berkeley time, which is just a website that‚Äôll pop up if you Google. 

Also, you don‚Äôt have to go straight to 61a. I think it‚Äôs somewhat common for people to take like other classes that teach them how to code before going into 61a. Classes like CS10 or CS8 I think?

And abt the good student thing, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a pretty good student, don‚Äôt get intimidated by the kids who‚Äôve published 11 papers and have already completed Real Analysis.

So, if you want to switch majors (e.g. to econ), you don't have to do anything special. Just take the econ prerequisite classes and declare it.

For q3, what do you mean by the credit system? Assuming you mean units, you can generally assume more units = more work and you have to take 13 units a semester minimum. You need 120 units minimum to graduate, and your major will have more specific requirements as to which classes you need.

If you live downtown you'll probably walk in through the roads by the crescent. Other than that, I don't think people really have a preferred entrance, and you'll probably enter and exit campus from different places multiple times a day anyways, so I wouldn't base an apartment decision off of this.

Your peers will motivate you, and you'll meet such impressive people (don't compare yourself to them, but admire and strive to be like them!). You'll develop great habits and get a VERY good education that is well-respected anywhere.

I barely went to SF. In a normal year, there's tons of stuff to do IN BERKELEY without even crossing the bridge. Music, art, food -- it's all here. You will meet allll kinds of different people. Get ready for the best four years of your life üòÖ",1617057458,1,0

"&gt;Math 104 is the hardest upper division class at Berkeley. So yes it‚Äôs hard to get an A+. It‚Äôs hard to get a B in Math 104. If you‚Äôre using Rudin it‚Äôs hard to get a B-. This is because math professors don‚Äôt curve and the average on exams (if you are taking it with Rudin or Pugh) is &lt; 55%. So yes if you are trying to preserve your gpa don‚Äôt take Math 104 unless you have to, but also keep in mind that you won‚Äôt really be able to write a decent proof without it. EECS127 does teach you some basic linear algebra at the beginning but the more advanced topics: Jordan Canonical Form, Dual Spaces, Inner Product Spaces, and Operators are not covered in EECS127. That‚Äôs to be expected because EECS127 is the Optimization Class not the Linear Algebra class. 127 is more about Math for ML + some more ML. If you are rushing to get into Abeel then don‚Äôt take a single math course. If you want some more foundation in proof writing though take 104 and 110 because CS/EECS doesn‚Äôt teach you math that‚Äôs why they are separate degrees.

what about sergey's lab? Is it the same?",1617052182,1,0

"I chose Berkeley over UT for L&amp;S. First off because I didn‚Äôt get into honors at UT. Secondly I was admitted to UT for Computer Science but I also wanted to explore political science. UT doesn‚Äôt have a PS department and being at Berkeley undeclared I was able to freely explore my interests. I‚Äôm now a double major in CS and Political Economy. There are times when I think about how much money I could‚Äôve saved my family by going in state at UT but I feel like being further away from home and in a new environment has allowed me to grow so much as a person. I believe the academics here are on a level above other state schools. I‚Äôve met some awesome people here, and the weather is for the most part nicer. Going back I would 100% make the same decision.",1617052068,1,0
"Political science major here (almost done), so I‚Äôm mainly going to comment on my experience w/ POLSCI. The POLSCI major itself isn‚Äôt very difficult, but getting into particularly high demand classes are tough. Unless you have some sort of advanced standing for enrollment or just have a good enrollment time, you may not get into the interesting classes until you‚Äôre a junior or senior. I think POLECON may have a few classes that require a certain grade in order to get into the major, but POLSCI is more straightforward: pass 2 lower div courses.
