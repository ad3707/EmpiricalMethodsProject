Stern Tech MBA?,"Hi r/nyu,

I'm a PhD student in Tandon CBE and I came across the 1 year Tech MBA offered at Stern. Is there anyone in this program right now that might be able to give me some info?

Specifically, I am wondering if it is at all feasible to manage doing it concurrently with a PhD or if I would have to do it separately. Do you have courses all day or is it a few courses and mostly project-based? I could manage my time around a project, but if I had to be in class 9-5 it would be hard to get lab work done.

Is there anyone in the department that I could contact? I sent an email to Stern MBA admissions to ask about this but in my experience reaching out to individual administrators (especially if you know them to be nice and helpful) tends to yield better results.

Thanks!",1601996855,1,0
"NYU RETURNS The New York State Positive Case Threshold for Colleges, and Continuing on as We Are for Now","In late August, New York State set thresholds for temporary suspension of in-person classes (PDF). For NYU's Washington Square location, that number is 100 within a 14-day period. Even though our case positivity rate remains low ‚Äî roughly 0.5% ‚Äî as you can see from our dashboard, we are approaching that number.  


Accordingly, we have been in touch with NYS authorities. Based on our overall conditions ‚Äî primarily our low positivity rate, which is significantly lower than the area surrounding the school, and the robust program of testing ‚Äî the State has advised that at this point we should continue to carry on as we have been, and do not at this point have to pivot to remote instruction. Schools, units, and individual faculty members should not independently make changes in instruction or other operations.


We will remain closely in touch with the State, and will, of course, follow any guidance and promptly relay directives about any changes from our current course. If there is a change, you will hear from the COVID-19 Prevention &amp; Response Team, the Provost's Office, or your dean's office with specifics about what changes are to be put in place.  


If a transition to remote learning becomes necessary at some point, we want it to be smooth and orderly. So, while we continue to move forward as we have been, it is nonetheless prudent for schools and individual faculty to be thinking ahead about how they would respond to a transition to remote instruction. 


Thanks. Take care. Be well. We will be in touch again soon.",1601991478,1,0
Email today from Provost re: COVID,"""We have been in touch with NYS authorities.

The email goes on to say, of course, that if numbers continue to rise and the state changes their mind, they hope to have an orderly transition to remote learning. 

What are your thoughts on this announcement? Does it ease your mind or does it just make you more anxious? 

Personally I still think it's likely that a directive will be issued eventually which forces at least part of NYU into remote learning, so this just kind of feels like delaying the inevitable. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1601991368,1,0

Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can‚Äôt see everything you submit
* We  don‚Äôt actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the  anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's  applications

Good luck!",1601899217,1,0

"PU letters for NYUSH students to be issued, freeze on student visas has been lifted for NYUSH students","Lehman just sent out the following email:

&gt;Dear Members of the NYU Shanghai Community,  
&gt;  
&gt;We write now to share some good news.  
We have now¬†learned¬†that¬†the approval process has been completed with regard to visa issuances for international students. Thanks to truly extraordinary efforts by the governments of the Pudong District and Shanghai City, as well as the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NYU Shanghai has been given an ‚Äúexemption‚Äù from the prevailing freeze on the issuance of student visas, so that we may bring our international students to China  
We are especially happy to note that this exemption applies to both students in Group 1B and students in Group 2. There will not be any gap between the transition of entering first-year students to Shanghai and the return of upper-year students.  
Now that it has been granted, this exemption must be implemented through a set of procedures that begin with the issuance of Invitation Letters. These procedures will be set in motion by the authorities at the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office once they return from their National Day and Mid-Autumn break, which lasts through October 8. Each of the hundreds of invitation letters must be produced individually in accordance with an exacting process. We expect all the invitation letters to be issued during the week of October 12. We appreciate your continued patience and understanding while these procedures are completed.  
This Friday, October 9th, Dean Pe will be sending our returning international students a full set of instructions on the steps that must be taken to transform Invitation Letters into new visas as smoothly as possible. Even before receiving Dean Pe‚Äôs instructions, returning students can begin to prepare in the following ways:¬†  
  
&gt;  
&gt;1) Identify the location of the Chinese embassy or consulate within your geographical jurisdiction;¬†  
2) Visit your embassy or consulate‚Äôs website and review the requirements for submitting an application for the issuance of a visa;¬†  
3) Identify possible COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing facilities near you that have the capacity to administer a test and provide results within a short window (we expect that you will need to have taken a nucleic acid test within 72 hours before you board your flight and to have had the negative results of that test certified by your embassy or consulate); and  
4) Explore flight options and possible dates of travel.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;By doing this preparatory work, students can help to ensure that their entry into China proceeds in as orderly a manner as possible. (Please note that it is still premature to focus on the topics of quarantine and university housing; those matters can be addressed once a visa is secured.) If you have immediate questions, you can email¬†Dean Pe at \[(his email)\].¬†

There's no sound that's coming out of it, I can't hear any sound on zoom calls and I can't even watch lectures that one professor posted on YouTube, I can't do anything since yesterday and I'm panicking.

I've been told that NYU isn't giving any more laptops to students right now, but I can't afford to pay for repairs or to buy a new laptop. I'm hoping that it will just be magically fixed but until then, does anyone know how to attend zoom calls on their phones? Any advice? Sorry about this rant but I'm really scared. I've been doing terrible so far this semester and I have a midterm on Monday. If my laptop isn't fixed by then idk what to do.",1601656715,1,0

international student,"hello! may i know if i have a chance to be admitted to nyu. i am applying ed1 which is due on nov 1. here are my stats:

gpa: we do not use 4.0 scale in the philippines. i have 92 average from grade9-12. i got a 94 on my senior year. also, the system in our country is different, i took 8 classes per sem since grade 11 so in total, i took 32 classes in just two years with mostly A‚Äôs. by mean of A is at least 90%
i haven‚Äôt known my rank but i think i‚Äôm in top 15%  in 300 students.

sat: nyu is test-optional and the earliest date i can take is in dec.

aid: i‚Äôm an international student, i am not applying for any aid, i‚Äôm set to pay it full if i get accepted, does not applying aid raise my chances of getting admitted?

ecs: 
‚Ä¢ 80 hrs unpaid internship in a real estate company
‚Ä¢ math quiz bee finalist
‚Ä¢ 2x bronze in intramural sports (volleyball )
‚Ä¢cadet certificate (actp)

essay: i‚Äôm good at writing essay and i‚Äôm confident at my grammar too.

i‚Äôm really good at math, i‚Äôm applying to nyu stern and looking forward for their dual degree program in accounting. i also consider liberal arts core just in case nyu put me there if i don‚Äôt get accepted to my primary choice which is  stern.",1601632428,1,0

Stern Transfer Question,"Hello! I am super interested in Stern. 

I currently hate everything about my current school. So, I would like to transfer as early as possible. 

Should I transfer now into the Spring 2021 term and then attempt to internally transfer into Stern for Fall 2021? 

Or, should I stay at my current school during this Spring &amp; attempt to transfer externally/directly into Stern during Fall 2021? 

I know it‚Äôs super hard to get in, I‚Äôm just wondering in advance. Thanks!",1601605679,1,0

Rant about CAS CS and the career fair,"Is it just me or does the CAS CS department does not actually care about its students? 

They seem to have no initiative, especially when it comes to employment opportunities and trying to get employers to come. Meanwhile, the Tandon CS career fair is not open to CAS and they get most of the tech employers. The chair of the department and other top people just don't seem to care. **They should never have allowed this to happen.** 

I do not think Professor Denis Zorin(the chair) nor the chair of the undergraduate dept has the slightest idea as to what happens here. Zorin's office is literally 10 blocks away from warren waver hall at 60 5th ave, away from the ""mess"" so he does not have to see. 

Also, what was that joke of a ""career fair""?  It hardly even qualifies as a joke. I get that this is during COVID and all but how did the Tandon career fair(to which CAS is not allowed in) get so many employers? 

I guess any prospective CS students should just go to Tandon, at least they will get to talk to someone in their fairs.

I was extremely lucky to get a summer internship for this summer, no thanks to NYU. Now I am worried about the next. (I have a return offer but do not really want to go back.) Meanwhile, people at other universities have a leg up because they actually have some competent administrators running things.",1601603581,1,0

When will classes be posted on Albert for next semester?,"im coming up on my final semester, and Im graduating early so my schedule is suuuper strict. normally they have it on the academic calendar when classes will be posted, but they don't have the date anywhere yet. im paranoid and forgot to plan properly this semester so I just wanna know when i can see course options lol

has anyone heard about when courses will be posted?? would it be strange to email a professor and ask if they think a course theyve taught in past spring semesters will be available??",1601589540,1,0

"[RANT] Why the ""step-motherly"" treatment towards grad students?","Why doesn't NYU (and most universities) allow grad students to join clubs and organizations (including greek life) as a **committee member**? 

I am aiming to join student organizations (except the student association) because I want to have something other than just academics on my resume, especially since I will be applying to deferred MBA programs next year. I wanted to join the **Strategic Venture Society's venture team** and was really looking forward to it. But then I got to know that only undergrads can join (scream induced with tremendous rage). 

I am an HBS aspirant and as everyone knows, that school expects the sun and stars from every damn applicant. I highly doubt I will get in solely on my grades, work experience and the GMAT. 

Some people might say, ""that is not the point of the master's program"". Forgive me, but I think that **the students should be the ones to decide what the ""point"" of their own education is**. I know that there are things outside the university's purview that we can do but considering the fact that I am an international student, a lot of limitations exist. Some people have also said that I shouldn't even aim to join these clubs because I will have to answer to undergrads (As if that is even a problem). 

The only genuine argument that I have ever heard is that graduate programs are more intense and thus there are severe time constraints. However, **whether they can or cannot devote time should be left to the students to decide**. Personally, I am able to complete all my assignments and projects ahead of time and yet I can't join which is simply unreasonable. 

I know that NYU isn't the only university that has these rules but hey, nobody forced the univeristy to be like the others and it can always choose to be different than the norm.",1601582470,1,0

NYU Therapy/Psychiatrist ?,"Okay so I was just informed NYU had their own psychiatrists, I had no idea! Does anyone know more about this?

If I do speak to someone and they recommend medication will my parents have to know? I‚Äôm asking because they without a doubt would not want me taking any form of medication.

Undergraduate research opportunities in mathematics,"I'm currently a freshman math major at tandon wanting to quickly jump into math research or any math activities that are part of nyu but I'm having a hard time finding any. I didn't apply to the VIP team because I couldn't see how any of the projects were related to math. I feel like there aren't a lot of math research opportunities for undergrads because you simply need to know a lot of advanced math in order to do any research that's meaningful. That's why I'm planning to take Calc 3 and Discrete Math in the summer, if that's possible, so  that I could then be able take Honors Analysis in my sophomore year.

A short message for CS undergrads from a recent grad,"**Apply for every damn job/internship and do it early and often**, it doesn't matter if you're a Sophomore who just learned how to print 'Hello World' or a freshman who came in with a 5 on the CS AP who thinks they have time to do internships later (this was me). Don't put it off in order to play League or get high with your friends or whatever you do to pass time during COVID. 

I spent three years coasting when it came to internships and side projects because I thought my good grades would get me an internship and a job; when it came time to apply for post-junior year internships I got turned down by every single tech company I applied for and I realized I had completely mis-allocated my effort. I blew off prime recruiting season (around aug‚Äìnov) because I decided I'd rather be at the pub with my friends in London than filling out applications. It was the *worst feeling in the world* realizing that I basically threw away my time and severely harmed my career chances and there was nothing I could do about it. 

I ended up working a shitty internship at a corporate bank that had fuck all to do with coding and I spent all my time making excel macros so I could put on my resume that I coded something. I had a *miserable* full-time recruiting season grinding out applications and watching my peers‚Äîwho were comparable coders to me but had much more experience under their belts‚Äîget job offer after job offer while I got ghosted and rejected. While my story has a happy ending I would never wish anyone to have to go through the stress and uncertainty and despair that I went through last fall. 

I'm not saying everybody should get into Google STEP their first year or be a returning intern at Facebook (but do apply!), just get any kind of experience on your resume starting freshman year so you can build your way up to landing a coveted internship your junior year and an even better full-time job afterwards. Anything that has you working with code is fair game, even if it's just writing CSS for a 3-person Wordpress shop in your hometown or grading for CS101. If you really enjoyed a class and did well then being a grader or TA is a *fantastic* way to load up your resume during the semester and is super easy to get into. Everybody starts somewhere, but it's much easier to work your way up during four years of college than to try to make a 10ft leap at the very end. 

Oh and if that's not motivating enough, many big tech internships pay $40/hr+ so you can finally afford to drink in NYC :)",1600724297,1,0

The Beauty of NYC Restaurants,"NYU alum here. 

I had ramen today. It came neatly packed - noodles and toppings separated, broth sealed tightly in a ziplock bag to prevent spillage. Every single little detail taken care of. 

This was ramen Ippudo, a restaurant that I first came across 7 years ago when I first visited NYC to look at colleges. I was intimidated back then by all the people in that restaurant, how different they were to me and how much more established and proper they seemed in comparison to my teenage self. 

And yet I remember feeling optimistic. That I too one day could be in a restaurant like that talking business with a client, having lunch with a friend, or simply enjoying my own company. I liked being in that restaurant - so full of life and in one of the greatest cities in the world. 

7 years later and I‚Äôm still optimistic. It‚Äôs been 8 months since I‚Äôve been to a restaurant, but I know that beauty is still there in all the great restaurants that I‚Äôve been to. Beauty in the people, in the food, in all the little details that these restaurants take care of so well and so pridefully.

Difference between BPE and normal Stern BS? Applying ED1 to Stern and need Advice,"I'm applying ED1 to Stern but am conflicted whether to apply BPE or the normal BS program. If you're able to answer/elaborate on a couple of my questions below it'll be extremely helpful.

1. \*Do I risk my chance of getting into Stern by applying to BPE?\* IE, do they first accept me to Stern, and then accept me to BPE, or do they straight up reject me from BPE if my application isn't strong enough?
2. \*Is it harder in any way to get finance/wall st jobs if I do BPE compared to not doing BPE?\* Is it harder because I can't have a concentration in finance?
3. \*If I apply to regular Stern, are there some poli sci elective classes I can take that are similar in a way to BPE?\*
4. \*Is there a really heavy finance culture in normal Stern that I can't avoid, or are there a decent amount of people there that are chill (overall)?\*

For some more background information: Stern is 100% been my dream school, as I've become really interested in finance/consulting based jobs this summer. However, the reason I'm conflicted is because I'm heavily interested in politics and international relations as well. I'm not sure if I want to follow a career path in this, but I know for a fact that I would love my classes more if I took BPE. I also would be surrounded by more like minded people, because although I want to go into finance, I don't want to be surrounded by ""finance bros."" I just \*know\* that BPE will be a group of people I can connect with. However, all that being said, I just want to end up at Stern and don't want to risk being rejected because I applied BPE because then I know I'll regret it later.

Bottom line: I want to go into a career in finance, but the group of people in BPE and the classes sound more interesting in BPE. However, I'm sure that I can accommodate these aspects without BPE too, so I'm conflicted.  Help me out.",1600579373,1,0

"How is everyone's experience here so far? Do you foresee it being more ""normal"" by next semester, maybe 2 or more?","Hey guys,

I'm a prospective non-traditional student (took a lot of time off), looking to finish my undergrad degree at NYU. Before COVID or any of this ever happened, this was something I was planning for years and was really looking forward to it. It goes without saying we're living in unprecedented times and no one has a true idea of what the future holds. 

I've heard very mixed reviews - some positive musings about how NYC in general has a better handle on things due to the experience with the initial mania and that lot of people seem to take the social distancing and other safety measures seriously. On the flip side of the coin, I've also heard nasty takes of some students with a IDGAF mentality, how online classes are a pain to deal with, and how it's ""never going to be a true college experience ever again"". I realize, of course, accounts will vary depending on the background and context, but would still be interested if anyone currently attending (whether live or remotely) could shed some light. 

For me personally, I'm someone who's very cautious about the COVID presence but wouldn't consider myself overly paranoid. While I'm excited to get back into academics for personal reasons, I also relish for a second chance at the aforementioned ""college experience""; not so much the whole get hammered and party 24/7 part, but moreso about living on campus, forming camaraderie with other fellow students,  being a student, etc.

Any honest feedback (positive or negative) would be greatly appreciated! It would really help me gauge if it's worth applying for next semester or I wait and pursue some other projects before things really settle down with more certainty. Thanks in advance!",1600556055,1,0

The Rubin quarantine protocol is inconsistent with my quarantine experience. I‚Äôm annoyed at the COVID-19 response team,"For context, I‚Äôm the author of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/immvh3/self_reporting_is_prohibitively_inconvenient/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).

Long story short, I have to quarantine for 10 days despite having one negative rapid test and one negative laboratory test.

If you don‚Äôt already know, all of Rubin has to quarantine for 3 days, since 4 people tested positive for COVID-19. 3 days of quarantine isn‚Äôt enough time to actually isolate anyone who really has the virus, but is enough time to test those students and see whether their laboratory tests are positive or negative. Logically you would then continue to quarantine the positive cases and let out the negative ones, right?

Yeah that makes sense.

In my case, I had 2 negative results, one a laboratory one at Gould Plaza, and another at MinuteClinic as a rapid test. Despite having two negative tests, they still didn‚Äôt clear me for quarantine?

It‚Äôs just really frustrating and adds insult to injury that they‚Äôre being more stringent with me, someone who self reported a minor cough, hasn‚Äôt been in contact with anyone with a positive case, and as far as we currently know, no one in the building I‚Äôm staying at has a positive case, than they are with a building where there have been 4 positive cases, and 1 positive case last week. 

In my circumstance, they assumed both of my tests were false in order to be extra safe. If anything, it makes more sense for them to make that assumption for Rubin, a place that *actually has COVID-19.* 

There‚Äôs absolutely no consistency in NYU‚Äôs response! I‚Äôve basically spent the last week in quarantine for no reason! 

I don‚Äôt mean to diminish what Rubin‚Äôs kids may be feeling. Quarantine sucks and I hope you guys hold up as best as possible during these 3 days. It‚Äôs just insulting that NYU‚Äôs response is so lackluster, inconsistent, and disregarding of people‚Äôs lives. 

At any rate, I‚Äôm getting out on Monday (9/14) so all of this will be behind me. But spending 24 days in quarantine is not a fun time at all, and I‚Äôm incredibly upset at the NYU administration that they treated me much worse than the other students who are in a much more serious situation.",1599960765,7,0
"""It‚Äôs Hard to Keep a College Safe From Covid, Even With Mass Testing""","Um so 

""According to the school(UIUC), some students ignored the requirement to isolate after testing positive, even going to and hosting parties, and tried to game the system, including repeatedly seeking out another test and trying to get around the school‚Äôs app, Safer Illinois, which shows a badge clearing students with negative results to enter school buildings and even some local bars. One student who posted a video on social media trying to show people how to hack that app is ‚Äúfacing discipline,‚Äù and about six have been suspended.

These actions, by only about a dozen students, paired with parties, drove the university‚Äôs surge in cases, administrators say.

Quick Rant,"Hey I just got moved into quarantine today cause I tested positive after the spit test. I just gotta say I am so tired of all of this. I understand the arguments and know that no one want to be experiencing what we‚Äôre experiencing but it‚Äôs just rough. I did EVERYTHING right. I social distanced. You would never see me without a mask. Tried to limit my time in close spaces by avoiding the elevators. I haven‚Äôt even seen the lounge in my dorm to avoid any chance of it but here we are. And then I see that there was another party in the park. I know a lot of those guys are gonna test positive but a lot of them aren‚Äôt. They‚Äôre gonna get away scot-free. They‚Äôre not gonna learn anything from it. And at this rate I feel like I‚Äôve been precautious for no reason. We‚Äôre probably gonna go home anyway and while I‚Äôve been social distancing and making at most 2 friends, people have been living it up. I know these people are dumb and are making the matter worse it‚Äôs just irritating that you can do everything right and still end up in the same place where everyone else is. I‚Äôm biting the bullet man I should have just stayed home. Rant over, sorry y‚Äôall",1599955585,107,0
If only I could meet someone who feels the way I feel about this song,"NYU alum here. 

When I transferred to NYU, I found it quite difficult to meet new people. I joined a lot of clubs, went to a lot of events, but honestly did not meet many with whom I could connect. So I spent a lot of time alone, either in Bobst or in my room. 

And whenever I was alone, I'd listen to all kinds of music that would make me feel nostalgic - about relationships I never had, memories of past events that never took place. Music also made me think about the future and at times fire me up. I would pay close attention to those emotions.

Sometimes, I'd wonder if there was someone else out there in my situation - not anti-social, but just not good in large groups. Interested more in plain conversation and simple things like grabbing coffee, going to the bookstore, going for walks in parks, and not parties and going out. Someone more interested in emotional authenticity. 

For some reason, I would never really meet these people, even after going to lots of club events. I guess they were just more comfortable with being on their own or just with one or two other close friends as was I. 

I think a lot of you are currently going through what I had to go through during my years at NYU so I decided to start r/musicmeets, a group for those of you who want to meet someone, a friend or maybe even a romantic partner, through music. 

Because it's hard to fake your emotional reactions to music. And finding someone who feels about a song the same emotions that you do may be a sign of emotional compatibility.",1599955458,13,0

I do plan on getting some certs e.g. Security+ and the CIPP/US.

Experience trying to receive counseling living outside New York,"Hey all, 

I just wanted to share my experience trying to get counseling as a student living on the West Coast at the moment. I stayed here because all my classes are remote anyway and it saves me money. I deal with panic attacks and anxiety and I thought, as a grad student starting this fall, I would take advantage of the free counseling services the school offers. 

First off, the people in the Student Health Center are great. The desk staff were helpful and thoughtful and the 10-15 minute phone interview to discuss my needs went really well and the psychologist I was speaking with has been nothing but helpful. 

The issue is that, because of beaurocracy, the student health center cannot offer me remote counseling. In my state, there are laws about Councelors licensed in other states so I am totally blocked off from help from the Student Health Center. 

Obviously this is not the Student Health Center's fault, and really not even NYU'S, but it is an important security blanket that I have lost due to COVID and other thing that I'm paying for at NYU that I won't be able to take advantage of. I'm bummed",1599777381,1,0

Internal Transfer from CAS CS to Tandon CS - Worth it?,"**Context:** I'm a freshman at CAS and I'm planning to major in Computer Science. I'm already taking CS 101, CS 102, MATH 121, MATH 122 this year.

**Question:** 

I am exploring the possibility of transferring internally from CAS to Tandon BS in Computer Science program in my Sophomore year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know your thoughts on this and if: 

**1)** You think it is realistic and possible (I've heard that internal transfer acceptance rates are very low!)

**2)** You think it's worth it

&amp;#x200B;

Here are **my thoughts** that influenced my decision:

\- I would like to have an engineering school experience instead of a liberal arts experience. 

\- I would say the BS in CS program at Tandon is more rigorous than BA in CS at Courant, just from the courses required for both. 

\- I feel like there's better employment prospects with a Tandon engineering degree than one from a liberal arts school

\- It just feels like the environment at CAS is geared more towards arts instead of technology/engineering side. 

\- Extra curriculars and clubs at Tandon are way better, plus I would be surrounded by engineering majors instead of arts majors, which I believe is a big influence.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you think of my points.

Please help me out! Thanks in advance :)",1599653279,1,0

Help needed gathering syllabi!,"Hi y'all,

I am an Arizona State University currently doing my undergraduate honors thesis on Information Systems curricula across the country, and I would like to examine NYU SPS's Information Systems Management program in greater detail. 

As part of my research project, I would like to examine Information Systems Management syllabi in greater detail for all classes.

For the past couple of months, I've been trying to get in touch with SPS leadership and advising, but they haven't been responding to my emails at all. It's starting to get very frustrating since it feels as if I'm talking to a wall, and COVID has made my research project (which I got approved before COVID) close to impossible (considering every university's administration is running around with their hair on fire). 

Therefore, I was wondering if y'all knew any better way to get my hands on IS Management syllabi without individually contacting the instructors. With other universities, I have received a lot of pushback from instructors who aren't willing to share without department approval, and would like to avoid repeating that process.

Pass/Fail,"Is NYU considering adopting a modified pass/fail policy for major requirements this semester? If not, who do I talk to to ask admin to consider? As a remote student stuck at home, I thought I‚Äôd have all the time in the world to study and focus on my classes this semester, but the pressures and hardships of covid have still been negatively affecting my schoolwork just like the spring. I work three jobs to support my family, I don‚Äôt have a perfectly quiet background because my entire family is crammed under this one roof, and the time difference for my classes is awful. I thought professors of online classes were going to be more accommodating and considerate of the circumstances, but if anything, they seem to be acting like the global pandemic has stopped. My classes have almost zero leniency for technical issues, watching recorded lecture instead of attending live, or even something as simple as zoom fatigue. I understand that a lot of NYU students are well off and are operating completely fine under these circumstances, but I‚Äôm exhausted. I regret not taking a semester off so much. As schools around the country start to adopt new pass/fail policies for this Fall, I wish NYU would do the same. It would allow me to focus on the aspects of my education that actually matter instead of just counting points and weighing the importance of losing that .5 points off my grade for missing a class vs sleeping during my 4am lecture. Sorry if I sound like I‚Äôm just throwing a pity party for myself, I just needed to get it all out there. I understand the argument against pass/fail is that I knew what I was signing up for this semester, but truthfully, I don‚Äôt think I did. I didn‚Äôt expect my parents to lose their jobs this late into covid, I didn‚Äôt expect my city to go back into lockdown, I didn‚Äôt expect my professors to require more this semester than any previous one. NYU pretends like we‚Äôve fully adjusted to remote classes, but I think we can all agree that we haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôve already talked to my advisor and weighed my options with the current pass/fail policy, but with the tides turning at so many other schools I‚Äôm curious to see if it‚Äôs something we can get going here. Sorry again for if this post is negatively received, I really just wanted to rant and find a solution that could maybe benefit other students like me.",1602950591,1,0

SEEKING ADVICE/HELP - considering internal transfer Tandon to Tisch ~ career path,"hi all! 

Im currently a sophomore at NYU Tandon and im majoring in IDM which is interactive digital media for those who don't know. It is my first year as an IDM major and because of that my schedule is filled with a lot of introductory course classes (i assume they do this for students to get exposure of what the program is like). I have not picked up interest in any subject throughout my education until I took a 3D modeling class in the IDM program. I am really interested specifically in becoming a Game Environmental Artist, someone who works a lot in computer art programs such as Maya, ZBrush, Photoshop, etc. I realized that Tandon does not offer a lot of courses that will help me hone my skills and pursue this career, so I am considering applying for an internal transfer to Tisch at either their Game design major or IMA major (Interactive Media Arts). 

I am seeking for any general advice of what to do in my position from anyone studying currently in the field or have any knowledge, I have heard a lot of people on different threads say pursuing a Game design degree is not worth it and they push people just to get a minor in it. However, this type of curriculum (modeling) is something I can see myself have passion towards, but having little to no information revolving the field. 

I have a 3.8 GPA (everyone always references this so here it is) 

I appreciate any advice in advance. thanks!",1604035073,1,0

Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can‚Äôt see everything you submit
* We  don‚Äôt actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the  anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's  applications

A question about resigning from an on-campus job.,"I am currently working as a research assistant at a lab (in CIMS) and I am just frustrated because of the sheer amount of work I am expected to put in, thus I am thinking of leaving. I swear they are squeezing in 40 hours' worth of work in the 20 that I am allowed to work for and this has cost me potential internship offers (missed many application deadlines, couldn't prepare enough for the interviews). 

I am required by them to write a research paper but, there is **no formal contract that binds me to said condition**. So my question is that if I resign from the lab midway, is there a chance that I won't be able to work on campus anymore? My fear is that they might contact CIMS' HR department and say that I didn't honour the conditions of my employment. 

Please advise, I am on the verge of burning out.

Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can‚Äôt see everything you submit
* We  don‚Äôt actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the  anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's  applications

Sublet Available on 13th Street and 2nd Ave,"Hi All! I am subletting (landlord approved) my room in a 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment conveniently located a short walk from NYU, and just one block from Trader Joe's. The room is a true bedroom (NOT a flex room) and is $1,600 per month. 

The apartment has an updated kitchen/bathroom, dishwasher, in-unit washer and dryer, as well as an already furnished living room with a couch, TV, and rack right by the door for winter jackets and coats. The bedroom has a built in close with large drawers and shelving in addition to two hanging bars. The room is easily big enough to fit a full size bed and a good sized desk.

Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can‚Äôt see everything you submit
* We  don‚Äôt actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the  anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's  applications

Good luck!",1606136412,1,0

On the School‚Äôs Coronavirus Response and a P/F system,"Many people have commented that we shouldn‚Äôt have a universal pass/fail system in place this semester because (paraphrasing) ‚Äúwe knew what we were getting ourselves into.‚Äù  or ‚Äúwe signed up for this.‚Äù 

I think it‚Äôs important to clarify your (individual) viewpoints on this, as the University also seems to be shifting their perspective on what we ‚Äúsigned up for.‚Äù 

We signed up for an in-person bachelor‚Äôs degree program which would take four years (8 consecutive full time semesters) to complete. 

*We did not sign up for a 5 year bachelor‚Äôs degree or a 4.5 year bachelor‚Äôs degree.*

*We did not sign up for an online degree.*

*There was no discussion or agreement ahead of time that the format and length of our education would radically change from semester to semester (without regard to our academic performance (such as needing to retake classes)).* 

Pretending like a four year degree is now a semester-to-semester agreement is disingenuous to the point where it‚Äôs laughable. It‚Äôs disrespectful. 

At this moment, second semester sophomores and above have nearly no chance of transferring to a different program, let alone one in the same ‚Äúrank‚Äù as NYU. First semester sophomores have about a month left, then they‚Äôre in the same boat. It‚Äôs important we‚Äôre honest with ourselves here. A majority of the NYU student body is ‚Äústuck‚Äù at NYU. That doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt like NYU. 

It simply means the semester-to-semester narrative is no more realistic than Narnia. 

___

*The next major defense of NYU and Universities in general is ‚Äúthere was no way to foresee this situation‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat we‚Äôre supposed to do during a global pandemic?‚Äù*

I‚Äôm obviously not saying we should‚Äôve maintained in-person classes throughout the pandemic. However, I still believe this whole situation was managed terribly by the administration (admittedly better than some other universities though). 

In regards to first point: this argument might make sense for a university located in a rural town in the middle of the country. For a school that claims to be ‚Äúin and of the city,‚Äù you‚Äôd think NYU would have better disaster relief plans and funds. Particularly given the *city* in which we‚Äôre located. A plethora of disasters have affected the city since the school‚Äôs conception which include (but are not limited to): 9/11, Sandy, Irene, 1977 Blackout, The Great Depression, The Great Recession, Polio, H1N1, HIV/AIDS, multiple terrorist attacks, many fires &amp; explosions, multiple airplane crashes, etc. The list goes on. If any university in the world should be ready for a disaster in a moments notice, it should be NYU. 

___

*In regards to second point (what could we have done?):*

Perhaps instead of focusing on relentless real estate expansion and building a ‚Äúglobal footprint,‚Äù they should have had their shit together in NYC. Maybe it‚Äôs not a good idea to have more than 230 areas of study (which will likely grow in the future). LS is still a money making scheme imo (Srry to those in it lol but I‚Äôm talking more long term). NYU‚Äôs marketing tactics abroad are still extremely questionable. Also, does nobody else find it a little concerning that Langone + School of Medicine account for 75% of the school‚Äôs operating revenue? That we have one of the smallest endowments relative to other universities similar to NYU? 

This goes to a broader issue that we students refuse to discuss or, more importantly, do anything about. NYU is a real estate and company first. They continue to grow and build without improving the quality of education or student life. 

Admission rates are obviously dropping because more people are applying every year. Meanwhile they‚Äôre touting the continuous expansion of the Abu Dhabi and Shanghai campuses (increasing student body size), and beginning to offer entirely online programs. Looking back, they also merged with Poly in 2014 which was another major expansion (for better or worse). 

All while they couldn‚Äôt handle their shit on the NYC campus. This relentless expansion leads to administrative bloat. The university has become too big and broad for its own good. 

They had it coming. They deserved every dollar lost, every news story, every lost applicant, and every lost transfer. It won‚Äôt stop either. They‚Äôll continue to expand. However, the bubble will burst in due time. It will make them wish for a time like this again. Once again, they‚Äôll deserve it. Also, if the college bubble bursts, the value of our degrees goes out the window with it. 

If we refuse to do anything about it as students, then we deserve it too. Nothing would work without proper organization. We are supposed to run the university, they do run us. We pay for them to operate (well us + school of medicine makes half lol). It is unacceptable that they are allowed to operate in this fashion. 

We must recognize that we signed up for a four year degree, we are not paying semester-to-semester rent.  We can‚Äôt stop going or choose another school whenever we‚Äôre dissatisfied. That‚Äôs simply not how degrees work in practice. 

Sorry for the ramble. P/F is related bc people keep mentioning how ‚Äúsigned up for this‚Äù and ‚Äúknew ahead of time.‚Äù Disregard anyone who tells you you‚Äôre not allowed to complain. We‚Äôre paying tens of thousands of dollars for a product that impacts our lives. It‚Äôs absurd to think you‚Äôre not allowed to criticize said product.

Dear ________,

My name is ________ and I am a ___ year student in the _____ School of ______.

I have some concerns with how the university is handling grading this semester.

With the strains this semester has placed on students‚Äô mental health, I, alongside the rest of the student body, would like to request a universal Pass/Fail policy, as we had in Spring 2020. We have seen multiple other institutions enact this, such as UC Berkeley, Penn, and Stanford. Columbia students just uptown have access to a universal P/F option, as does NYU‚Äôs own Shanghai campus; what is stopping the administration at the Washington Square and Brooklyn campuses from showing the same care for their students?

While it is true that students enrolled in this semester knowing that they would be taking online and blended courses, most students are on a strict timeline for financial and other reasons that made it impossible to defer a semester, forcing them to adapt to clearly inferior modes of learning; it is simply unfair for students to be graded on the same metrics they would if they had all resources and the reduced stress of a regular semester afforded to them. 

Students across the board have wrestled with a decline in their mental health, with a survey of the student body on the NYU subreddit showing that 73.9% of students have been struggling with mental health due to the circumstances of this semester. While students and professors are trying their best, it is reasonable to believe that it is more difficult to learn and retain information, on top of personal obstacles that each student is likely facing as a result of the pandemic.

Given the unique situation that we are all in this year, there is absolutely no reason for NYU to not show the same consideration for its students and their struggles that multiple other institutions of the same caliber have. It is incredibly insensitive on behalf of the administrators, and, as a student, I strongly encourage and urgently request for the Pass/Fail policies to be changed immediately to match those of Spring 2020.


Looking forward to your response,

Int Student; Should I come to campus in Spring?,"\*PLS HELP

To people who went on-campus in fall: Was it worth it? Especially with regards to the whole quarantine process. I know food was a problem but did it get better? How did you manage to get stuff for your dorm before quarantine? 

\------

So I'm an international student and I have my F-1 visa. I planned to go on-campus in Spring but my parents are worried and honestly, rightfully so. I'm having second thoughts now because neither of my parents can come with me because of the travel restrictions so idk if I can manage moving to another country alone. So I have a roommate (she's from NJ) but she can only move-in once my quarantine period is over and I know a few people who are planning to go from my country, so I'm trying to co-ordinate flights and stuff but my concern is quarantining alone for 14 days. To clarify, I don't have a problem staying alone but it's more to do with stuff like finding mattress toppers/blankets/etc for my dorm and also the food. As I understand, you're not allowed to go out of your room for 14 days at all. I'm also a spring admit so it would be my first semester at NYU. On one hand, I don't want to be dealing with all these potential issues in my first semester but also I'm certain that I don't want to do online classes from my home country. The reason is the timezone difference. During fall, I've had many internships/volunteering activities that required me to attend meetings and be active during EST and it's been a total shitshow bc I'm awake when my family's asleep so I feel isolated even staying at home. I can't handle waking up at random times and doing exams at 3AM, it's just not how I want to approach it. A lot of my friends are also struggling bc of this. I've decided that if I can't go to campus in spring, I'll take a gap year (bc I have lots to figure out anyway so it wouldn't be the worst thing). 

But I'm wondering, considering COVID and how it was in fall, should I come to campus in spring? Or is it not worth it? What are your experiences?",1605953578,1,0

Research Questions,"Idk if there's other resources about this elsewhere so sorry if this post asks questions that should be obvious, but I honestly never thought about doing research until the last month or so so I'm sort of clueless about where to start looking.

So I have a couple different areas I'm curious about starting research in. My first question is just sort of how do you get into research period. I honestly have no idea where to start looking, particularly in humanities/arts (I'm in Cinema Studies and would be interested in issues of representation and stuff like that).

But I'm also wondering if research ever happens in areas that don't have majors assigned to them? For example, I have some topics I'm interested in in the areas of Disability Studies, but while there is a Disability Studies minor and a ""Center for Disability Studies,"" there's no major or department (I'm not sure if a ""center"" is the same thing as a ""department"" I guess?). Will there still likely be research opportunities for students even when there is no major or department for that topic?

Finally, do you need to be majoring or minoring in a particular area in order to do research in that area? So, for example, like I said I'm in Tisch Cinema Studies, and I have one Tisch minor declared, but am still figuring out whether I want to do a second major or a second minor, and if so, what I want that to be. However, my other areas of interest are basically all related to issues of like social justice, gender studies, ethnic studies, disability studies etc., and I am wondering if I need to have actually declared a major or minor in a department like Social and Cultural Analysis or declare a Disability Studies minor in order to do research in that area?

NYU SPS POST TRADITIONAL DEGREE,"Hello all, 

Im most likely transferring to NYU in fall 2021 (I‚Äôll actually be on the wrestling team) and one of the coaches was telling me about SPS and how it is cheaper but still provides the same opportunities in terms of education, internships, and connections. I was planning on transferring into CAS and majoring in Econ and minoring in cs or data science, however one of the post-traditional degrees in SPS stuck out to me being ‚ÄúApplied Data Analytics and Visualization‚Äù, and now I‚Äôm actually considering transferring into SPS instead. So I guess I have a few questions: 


1) Is anyone on this sub majoring in the applied data analytics degree at SPS, or already receive the degree, and if so what do you think of it overall (classes, teachers, workload, etc) and do you feel confident that the knowledge and skills gained from it will help land a job as a data analyst/scientist? I haven‚Äôt been able to find much of any info on this degree besides that on the SPS site, so I take it that it is quite new. 

2) Can I take electives or extra classes at CAS if I‚Äôm an SPS student?

3) I‚Äôve heard most of the classes at SPS are offered in the evening after reading some forums from a few years ago. Is this still the case? (I would much rather take the majority of classes in the morning so this may be an issue for me)

4) How is social life, if at all, different being an SPS student as opposed to one of the more traditional schools? (CAS, Tisch, Stern)

* An application is a holistic process and we can‚Äôt see everything you submit
* We  don‚Äôt actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what  they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the  best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)

I've spoken to an NYU admissions counselor over the phone and asked about the admissions rate for children of staff and faculty.  I was worried that since NYU is tuition-driven in terms of financials, I would be disadvantaged in the admissions process due to my tuition remission status.

Questions about NYU/Career Path from a HS student,"According to multiple sources across the internet, NYU is a great school if you want to break into high finance. I am a junior in highschool right now and my GPA on a 4.0 scale is a 2.67, I know, horrible. However, I've done well on the PSAT when I've taken it. Last year I scored in the 89th percentile and that was without any SAT prep classes (I will be taking some in the near future). Still, applying to NYU with a GPA so low is pretty pointless. In order to combat this I would like to try and transfer in from a community college. On NYU's website it states that in order to be eligible to transfer into CAS you must complete 16 credits prior to transferring. Assuming my GPA is in the 3.7 - 4.0 range after my first semester, and I have completed 16 credits specific to a Finance/Econ major, would you recommend applying to transfer then, or after a full year, or two? Ideally I would like to spend no more than a year at the community college as I would still like to get the whole college experience.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I was reading something on Wall Street Oasis that said NYU CAS Econ/Finance Majors are non targets for the bulge bracket banks. I then also read that someone that was an NYU CAS Econ major got a job out of college at a hedge fund. Obviously, there are many more things that factor into this like internships and connections, but can anybody offer some insight to this? When people say NYU is a target school for Wall Street are they referring to strictly NYU Stern? If I did manage to make it into NYU CAS should I try to transfer into Stern?

can i bounce back from a c,"i‚Äôm a freshman and i‚Äôve had a really rough time this semester. my mental health is terrible, i have awful zoom fatigue, and just getting used to the first sem of college during this time was really rough. 

i‚Äôve done alright in my classes, it looks like i‚Äôll end w 2 As and a B/B+, but i really struggled with this one class for a number of reasons. it counted towards my major, so i couldn‚Äôt withdraw or p/f it, and it looks like i‚Äôm most likely going to end w a C+ in that class. it‚Äôs enough to pass, but like...it‚Äôs a c. 

i‚Äôm quite freaked out because i know it won‚Äôt look good on my transcript. also, i‚Äôve seen a lot of people in the comments talk about how a W looks better than a C, which makes me even more nervous. so i guess my question is, can i bounce back? 

i‚Äôm not going to pretend like i can see into the future, but i learned a lot just about how academics in college works and i feel much better prepared for next sem. i‚Äôm also taking a lighter coursework next sem, so i genuinely think i‚Äôll do better than i did this past sem.

Wellness Exchange sent me to a psychiatric ward,"
Trigger Warning for Mental Health ahead. 


So, I have always been aware of my mental health issues. If I ever self harmed or felt hopeless I knew to call hotlines and have been in therapy since I was 15.  Moving to New York for grad school is the longest I have been without one. So I got acquainted with the wellness exchange right off the bat. 
I was having a panic attack as I am planning of taking spring semester off but without my aid I wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford my rent in New York, and I just adore it here. I hit myself in the cheek, I used to self harm by hitting myself in the head to stop overthinking (very bad I know) I explained this wellness, I said I‚Äôm so stressed I wanna bash my head into a window. I never expressed the want to kill myself, nor did I want too.
They told me to go to Tish Hospital and asked if I would like them to call ahead to let them now I was coming. I thought great. Maybe I won‚Äôt have to wait in the waiting room with Covid people.
I wanted something to calm my panic attack. Like Xanax and resources outside of NYU. 
I‚Äôm in the Psych ER. I talked to one person and they said I needed to be committed. I expressed my fear over being committed as I can‚Äôt be away from my job that long and it‚Äôs finals. As well I am immunocompromised and in fear of COVID-19. The doctor said if I did not voluntary commit myself she would involuntary commit me.  I was in the ER from 2-11PM. I got to the ward and talked to nurse. I was crying and shaking because I was scared to sleep in a room with a roommate with Covid. They ‚Äúlet‚Äù me sleep in a padded room. Crying my eyes out I was told I had to stop and I was bothering the staff and I need to stop. They gave me ativan to pass out. I stayed up till 7 am and was given another Ativan and slept until noon. My team of psychiatrists gave recommendations on new medications and I begged be let out as I am far to scared to get any proper help. They said that was not possible and I had to be there at least for two days. I even explained I never had thoughts of killing my self. You don‚Äôt see a therapist. From my understanding from other people there. You get a team to adjust your meds and at the end of the stay you meet a social worker for therapy. No one talked to me about my issues that caused my anxiety attack. I had to do two groups to get my cell phone. Which is standard but they are not group therapy. I had to paint a picture and then do 5 minutes of meditation. After throwing up my 3 ativan, the team said they would release me, but it would against their recommendation so I was not given any adjustments to my mediations nor any calming tools. I‚Äôve been out for a day now and I keep having flash backs of the padded room when I close my eyes and I feel like I was in a nightmare and don‚Äôt know what happened in those two days. 
Please call a hotline if you feel lost or DM me even. But do not go there.",1606976570,1,0

* Being LGBTQIA+ is illegal but I heard there's there an underground gay community outside of campus. How true is this and how have you gotten in touch/found other non-student LGBT social groups?
* How do you get tested for STDs/HIV?

My grade was 94 until final exam and I got a C+,"My midterm, two presentations, and participation were all 94-95.

The final exam format was 10 multiple questions and 50?60? short answer responses. I think it was 50 but someone in my class said 60. There were no lines for these answers and under every question, there was just a big box capable of holding like 100k words. No guidelines on how much to write and a lot of the questions asked for two or more things (list and describe all 5 of the ___ and the practices that come with them) We were given 2.5 hours and there was a timer attached to the exam.

The usual classtime is 9:30am-12:15pm but the exam opened up at around 2pm and my schedules were too packed to fit the exam in. It was finals season and my Thursdays are 8:30am-8:30pm so I stayed up to study and prepare for other stuff and took the exam at 7am.

I ended up not being able to even finish the exam. This was the case for a lot of other students as well. We all emailed her and only a couple students received a response back and it said ‚Äúthe exam will be curved and we will make sure the grades for the class are on the usual curve.‚Äù However, I still received a C+.

I got a response from her after a week from that and she told me to send her a complete study guide (she uploaded a study guide a week before the exam) by 5am of next day to receive extra credit bcs she has to travel and can‚Äôt respond often after that. Again, my schedule was already packed with other classes‚Äô stuff and I tried to fit it in by staying up but I could not do it.

I let her know and asked if I can get it replaced to an incomplete until she can help me at her most convenient time but she said she can‚Äôt accommodate bcs she‚Äôs out of country rn and told me to contact the professor who hosted the first half of the semester but added that she‚Äôs not sure if I‚Äôll be able to reach her bcs she‚Äôs also out of country.

How can I cancel my insurance for Spring 2021?,"I‚Äôm a Vietnamese student studying remotely from my country this Spring. I want to waive my health insurance since obviously I will not be using them. However, the waiver form requires international students to have their own insurance. The thing is, in Vietnam, healthcare is so easily accessible that having insurance is almost unheard of.

I‚Äôve emailed Student health center but any advice on what I should do while waiting for a response?",1608147615,1,0
Premed track at CAS,"I applied ED for the premed track at CAS and just got accepted, but I know premed isn't an actual major there.

Does anyone know how declaring my actual major (ex. biochem) works? I know you're assigned an advisor, but I can't find information on when you actually decide on a major.

Also congrats to other '25 students can't wait to meet everyone next year :D",1608146643,1,0
NYU Shanghai Transfer?,"Hi! I just got accepted into NYU Shanghai and I am extremely fortunate and grateful for my acceptance! However, I was wondering if it would be possible to have my campus changed to NYU NYC. Would I have to reapply ED2? Would I not be able to reapply if I decline my acceptance? I also wanted to run and be a part of the Track &amp; Field Team, would this help my case? Would love to hear tips/opinions!",1608145201,1,0

Cognition v. Cognitive Neuro,"I highly doubt it but if anyone took both Cognition (PSYCH-UA 29) and Cognitive Neuroscience (PSYCH-UA 25), can you compare the 2 classes? 

I know that cognition is more mind based while cog neuro focuses more on parts of the brain/their function, but I'm asking more about which class you liked more and why? The prof is no longer Pascal so it'll probably be different but I'm trying to decide between the two. Thanks!",1608138215,1,0
