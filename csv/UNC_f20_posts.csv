App state transfer to UNC??,So I was transferring to App state but after the university‚Äôs recent disregard for the black community and mishandling covid I am reconsidering. I have never been to Chapel Hill so I was wondering how it compares to a school like App. What is the overall vibe of the student body? How is the off campus housing situation? Is it typical for a 3rd year to bring their car? Do you feel like the faculty values the students and actually tries to help you? Etc...,1602041123,1,0

Chapel Hill area COVID safety,"Hey guys,
I‚Äôm a first year considering an apartment for the spring semester, so I was wondering if anyone staying in the area currently could let me know how it is covid-wise?

The statistics online don‚Äôt seem bad, but Chapel Hill also has a smaller population, so I guess I‚Äôm looking for some insight on the prevalence of infections.

Cases are high in the current area I live and the people barely follow social distancing measures, including my friends, so I don‚Äôt feel comfortable going out anywhere at all. I also desperately need to get out of my house for my mental well-being. I‚Äôd love for anyone‚Äôs input on the Chapel Hill community!

I‚Äôm so sick and all my parents care about are my grades,"This is a rant, I‚Äôm sorry, I just need to scream into the void for a minute. I think I‚Äôm looking for some form of the validation I was expecting from my parents.

In the middle of the night on Monday, I woke up with a really sore throat. Like it hurt really bad to swallow, and I was freezing. I had a high fever so I called campus health that morning and got tested for COVID (long story short, I‚Äôm negative). I called my mom because I was scared and she started rattling off all of the reasons it couldn‚Äôt be COVID? She kept referring to what I had as a ‚Äúbug‚Äù even though I had a fever over 102. I told her I was afraid to drive myself to campus health because I felt so weak and she told me to take an Uber, which I didn‚Äôt want to do because I would be exposing some poor Uber driver just trying to make a living to COVID, and she told me it was ‚Äúpart of their job.‚Äù So I drove, and I definitely should not have. By the time I got to the doctor, I was about to pass out and my heart rate was above 130. They made me drink a powerade and gave me some medicine and I drove home to sleep, and they told me they would give me an excused absence form for the rest of the week. I emailed all of my professors to let them know what was going on and asked for extensions. They‚Äôve all said yes. I called my parents to update them, and the first thing they asked was, ‚ÄúDid you miss class?‚Äù And when I told them I had, they immediately wanted to know how I would ‚Äúmake it up.‚Äù At that point I just made up some bs because I wanted to sleep. 

Woke up the next morning an absolute wreck, couldn‚Äôt keep water down, called campus health and they weren‚Äôt calling back. Again, my parents didn‚Äôt want me to go to the ER unless campus health ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù it, so I literally just lied again and told them that they had before calling 911, because again, I was terrified. I was like, falling down each time I tried to stand. They kept me at the ER all day and gave me a ton of fluids and fever meds, gave me a rapid covid test there that came back negative. AGAIN, all my parents wanted to know was how much class I had missed, and was I going to go to class tomorrow. And again, I lied.

So I feel like a shitty person now. I haven‚Äôt done any schoolwork yesterday or today, just tried to keep myself out of the ER by drinking a ton of water and sleeping. I don‚Äôt have anything due until next week, but I do have a physics exam on Monday that I haven‚Äôt studied for. Should I be doing more right now? Am I just being lazy? On top of that, am I being lazy and just a piece of shit for lying to my parents? Every time I get up and do something I‚Äôm immediately exhausted. Does anyone else have parents that seem to conflate their value with their grades? Like, I just want them to care about my wellbeing and not a number on a screen. I care about my grades too, immensely, but I‚Äôve also seriously never been so sick in my life.",1601673681,1,0

How possible is it to double major in unrelated things AND do Army ROTC?,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm a prospective student applying this fall and I‚Äôve been wondering about possibly double majoring in Political Science and Environmental Science. I‚Äôm also (for sure) going to do Army ROTC, which I know is a substantial time commitment as well. ROTC fulfills the requirements for a minor in Military Science &amp; Leadership, so if anyone has double majored AND minored, I‚Äôd appreciate any insight you can give me :)

Is this an entirely unrealistic plan? I‚Äôm ok with just picking one of these majors if this is just way too much, but, if it‚Äôs possible, this would be pretty cool. Political Science is a BA and Environmental Science is a BS, so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd have to take an above average number of GE classes. I‚Äôll be submitting 9 or 10 AP credits (might self study for 1), so hopefully I can get some of that knocked out ahead of schedule and free up some time. 

I‚Äôm also ok with just not taking electives haha if that‚Äôs what it takes. I am not interested in staying more than four years and I would rather not take summer courses either, as I have some summer plans already that I hope to do. Can this be done in 4 years? If it‚Äôs not realistic, don‚Äôt be afraid to tell me I‚Äôm stupid and I need to reconsider. That‚Äôs probably the case tbh

I‚Äôve asked this a couple times on other, general forums but this question is specific to Chapel Hill. Obviously double majoring is going to be a little different depending on where you go, so I‚Äôm hoping y‚Äôall can give me some insight as to how it is here. Please let me know if this is realistic or not :)

Morehead Cain Scholarship!,"Hi everyone!

I am OOS applicant and plan on applying by the october 15th deadline. i wanted to hop on here and get any intel on the prestigious Morehead Cain scholarship from any chapel hill students,alumni, or even applicants that may know more than me. I was nominated by my school in TN (we have had 3-4 past students win the scholarship but some chose other colleges. so roughly 2 students from my school have been apart of a MHC class) and am almost done with my application that is due october 1st. I wanted to know what the Morehead Cain board/readers like to see in students? Part of me is worried that I‚Äôm not good enough for the scholarship. My main priority is getting into chapel hill alone as an OOS applicant but i truly believe I have worked hard in school to maybe have a chance at receiving this scholarship. i‚Äôm iffy on putting my stats but for reference right now i have a 4.78 GPA, 31 on the ACT (waiting on sept scores to come out), been a leader/president of 3 clubs, varsity sport all 4 years of HS and consistent community service,extracurriculars and awards over the years. 

from what i‚Äôve seen/heard Morehead cain scholars are usually students that are ivy league bound. If anyone has any more information on the scholarship itself and what type of students are selected, i would be so appreciative! oh and any tips and things to avoid on my application. i feel so alone right now about the scholarship since no one else in my grade is applying to chapel hill and my counselor has already helped me so much.

"Found NOT GUILTY!! [FINAL UPDATE to ""Everything I read about the honor court is a bunch of horror stories, and that I'll be convicted even though I'm innocent of what they accused me of doing. HELP??""]","[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/icqxeh/everything_i_read_about_the_honor_court_is_a/)

[First update](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/imvdoe/update_to_everything_i_read_about_the_honor_court/)

I'm so glad to be able to write this update. It CAN be done. I'm sharing this so that people know they should NOT always accept whatever deal is offered by the professor or Court, and you can be found not guilty. **If you have any additional questions about the process that I haven't answered in any of my posts, feel free to message me** (no matter how far in the future you panic because you were charged and made a Google search about the HC and found this post). After my first post here, one guy who had been found guilty in the past reached out to me and gave me helpful information, so I'd do the same for anyone else here. 

It took a lot out of me, but as you can see from the title, the administrator that ran the Honor Court hearing ended up finding me not to be responsible! 

The professor was not there (as I said in the last update, I waived my right to question the witnesses), but during the fact-finding phase they tried to smear me by recommending the admin ask me certain questions about my personal life, as well as uploading their own 'evidence.' To counter this, per the advice of my defense counsel (provided by the Honor Court), I added a corroborating witness statement last-minute that I took the exam by myself, and I lucked out when the admin decided that the signed ""admission of guilt"" supplied by the professor was inadmissible as evidence because of the shenanigans that took place on the part of the professor (not informing me of my rights, etc. as I discussed in the other posts).

Most of the hearing involved me explaining the similarities and differences between my answer, the ""corrections"" I made to my already correct answer as part of the punishment from the professor, the answer key, and the Chegg solution that I was accused of using. 

There was no concreted evidence to be considered, but the deliberation after my defense counsel made the closing statement took around 45 minutes I think. In total, my particular hearing lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes, in stark contrast to what the defense counsel said was the typical duration of these hearings (6-8 hours).

Again, there are a lot of things to be considered in how you want to proceed when you have been charged by the Honor Court, and they don't do a great job of giving you the information you want unless you hunt for hints or explicitly ask about something. Don't just make your decision based on how much evidence (factual or not) that they have, but how much they could end up finding. It's their job to prove that you are guilty, and they will go to all lengths to try to do that.

If you have any questions, ask away either in the comments or DM me if they're more personal! Thank you all for your advice and support. It means a lot to hear kind words from strangers sometimes.",1601085478,1,0

I got a spring housing refund (Baity Hill)- now UNC wants me to repay in 10 days,"Hey all. I lived in Baity Hill (graduate housing) last school year. We received an email ""encouraging"" us to move out by March 21 5pm. In June I got a refund for April and May. This week Carolina Housing told me this is in error and is giving me 10 days to pay them back. Apparently their refund policy (or ""waiver"" as they are calling it) was we had to give notice to vacate after March 22, as well as move out after March 22. Which conveniently is the day after they encouraged people to move out. And I'm not eligible because I gave notice to vacate before March 22. Fine- I understand that logistically I'm not entitled to the refund, but this still seems like a really shitty policy designed to refund the least number of students. I called them out on this and they said we had the option to stay at Baity Hill and back in March they never made any promises about what would happen to students that chose to leave. 

If housing asked anyone else to pay back their refunds let me know! Idk how many people this happened to. I'm also wondering if it's just a Baity Hill issue or also happening to students who lived in dorms.",1601039012,1,0

Which of these classes should I take next semester at my current school?,"**tl;dr: bold stuff is the most important** if you don't want to read the whole thing.

I am a freshman at another school who *really* wants to transfer here if the username doesn't give it away. (don't worry I'm NOT looking for a chance me)

 I'm currently registering for courses at my current uni for next semester and so far I know all the classes I want to take but one. I would like input on **which of my options you think would: look best to the AOs and/or would have the best chance of actually transferring.** 

So here are the classes I already know I (probably) want to do next semester Spring 2021. From what I understand 4 real classes is standard at my school (I'm not using course numbers so as not to give away my current school):

\-Linear Algebra (3 credits)

\-Intro to Macroeconomics (4 credits)

\-a 300 level Spanish class (3 credits) I got a 5 on AP Spanish so I already have credit for some lower level classes.

\-the first-year seminar (1 credit) I'm being forced to enroll in (but it's easy so it almost doesn't count as a real class)

\-**TBD**

**And here are the options I am thinking of for the last class to add to that schedule**:

\- a.) my uni's version of **ENGL 105** (this would be my first option but I heard it likely doesn't transfer from other places -- is this true and should I wait?)

\- b.) some variant of an **Intro to Accounting** class (because that's technically my major at my current school, though if I came to UNC I would do Statistics)

\- c.) my school's equivalent (I think) of **STOR 155**, which I already got credit for because of AP Stats so it may not go toward my GPA (?) but haven't taken in 3-4 years. Plus this is what I eventually want to major in so it may help to have a refresher?

\- d.) an **equivalent of a Visual (VP) or Philosophical (PH)** class that might transfer to UNC . Should I try and find a course that would match up with a Gen Ed category UNC has that my school doesn't, and that I would need to take if I got in? Except for the ENGL 105 equivalent, I am already done with all the Gen Ed stuff at my current school, but I think the two categories above are things UNC wants that I haven't taken because my current place doesn't require them.

\- e.) **wild card/something completely different**

For context, I would major in Statistics if I came to UNC and either add a Spanish or Econ major to that. 

Also, if it helps, here's the stuff I am taking now. I don't know how impressive this would look to AOs or not:

\- Calc III

\-Intro to Microeconomics

\- a social science gen ed

\-a literature gen ed but it isn't a fluff class

\-seminar I was forced into

He's asked several times throughout the semester how he could make things better for us - a whole anonymous feedback survey near the beginning of the semester, asking people if homework was helpful/too much/too little, would we like the mental health day off, etc. He said in class that he was glad when the class did really well on the midterm, and his emails are always so nice. He also moved our exam so it wouldn't fall the day after election day, and from friends I've heard that he's been so accommodating when students are struggling.

Or should it be on neither, only noted on resumes or applications directly to intelligence based or government jobs?

For my topic, I am trying to get an idea of how helpful UNC's mental health resources really are in allowing those who struggle with mental health disorders to succeed academically. I, for example, suffer from OCD, and have found that the accommodations provided by ARS have allowed me to better thrive in the academic environment. However, I'm trying gauge the overall consensus and would love to know how helpful these resources really may be in fostering academic success. If you have 5 minutes, I would so appreciate it if you would take this super quick survey! You do not have to use the resources for it to be applicable to you, you just have to have some sort of mental health disorder. It is all anonymous! If anyone has any feedback on the survey, as well, I would love to hear it!

Help Prospective Students Learn About UNC Chapel Hill!,"Hey there r/UNC; your moderators have granted me permission to tell you all about the website that I am interning for.  So, if you‚Äôre at all interested in helping prospective students learn about UNC from a safe distance, then please keep reading!

What is this site that I intern for? CollegeVizzy, a social media-esque platform that aims to improve the college application process for students who, for any reason, lack the ability to visit college campuses in person.

Cool; how? In a nutshell, CollegeVizzy supplies a space where college students can make prompted social-media style posts about their college campus‚Äîand where prospective students can compile and share notes and impressions of universities they‚Äôve visited.  The end result, we hope, will be a resource that provides a somewhat more comprehensive look at a given college than a virtual tour or an Instagram page might otherwise by itself.  And right now, more than probably ever until this point, high school students could use as much information as possible to learn about the schools they are considering. 

Of what concern is this to r/UNC? Well, good ideas aside, CV still needs a solid, content-creating user base.  That is where you can help.  If you‚Äôre interested in making an account and sharing ~stuff~ about UNC, the link is below.  Everything is free, there are no ads, we sell no user data, and making a post will enter you into a giveaway that we‚Äôre running for a $150 Uber Eats gift card. 

Tell us anything!  Show us your favorite places on campus, your dorm, or whatever else you‚Äôd want prospective students to know about.  The use of online photos or screenshots from virtual tours is welcomed¬¨‚Äìyour personal experience on campus is really all that matters.  If you have any questions about the site or about posting, or any feedback, leave it down below.  I didn‚Äôt want to make this post unbearably long, so if there‚Äôs anything that doesn‚Äôt make sense or isn‚Äôt clear I would be more than happy to follow up in the comments.  Thanks! 

As an aside: we have been following the re-openings of universities across the US, and we, like probably a large portion of the country, are aware of Chapel Hill‚Äôs rocky start to the school year.  I just want to say that we hope it gets better for you guys soon.  Stay healthy.

Quick Guide for getting research experience in undergrad,"When I was in undergrad I needed some research experience for grad school.

Others may be in the same boat so I thought of some cool pathways to become an RA, and I wanted to share with my fellow Tarheels. 

Long road:

1a. Pull up the directory for all the professors in your department. There is a faculty page, where you can flip through every professor's cv. You're looking for recent work, say in the last 5 years or so, that sounds interesting to you. You can go through Google scholar to read the whole paper, but don't... you won't understand 2/3 of it.  Just read the title, abstract, intro and conclusion. And think about whether the idea is interesting.  

1b. Keep in mind that for their paper to get published, they spent a metric fudge ton of time on the idea, and if you can think of even a slight tweak, or you're willing to carry a paper forward they'll be as excited as a Duke transfer... your idea of how to extend the paper won't work, we spend years learning to shred new ideas like it's a blood sport. But the professor has 47 potential papers on deck for whichever student wants that sweet sweet publication. 

2. Email the professor... say, hello professor blah blah, I wanted to extend your idea on Clemson mental deficiency... could I join on a project with you. If you're not still working on Clemson deficiency, I would like to contribute to your current line of work. 

3. They'll send a zoom link and schedule a meeting time. Congrats. If they don't, repeat the process for the next professor on the list...

Tldr. Look up profs, read their cv, find a paper you like, email prof, repeat. 

Short road:
1. Pull up professors on the departmental faculty page. 

2. Type a professors name into Google scholar and go to their faculty page on Google. You're looking for a professor with 4 publications in 2019.

3. Email them asking what they're working on, and tell them you'd like to contribute. 

Pro road:
1. Email the department chair in 4 departments. 

2. Ask if any of the profs in their department are looking for a research assistant... list any potentially useful qualifications in the email, and send a cv....

Here's what happens-&gt;

You spend 45 minutes writing an email-&gt;Chairs get email -&gt;they'll read the email in about 22 seconds-&gt;they'll forward it to 3 professors in their department...2 will have grant money and actively looking for an assistant. 1 will be looking to mentor/publish asap.-&gt;they'll be far more interested in bringing you in since you were referred by their boss.-&gt;they'll send a zoom link, you'll talk, you're in

Quick thanks to all the TAs and Grad Students,"Just wanted to say thanks. I got a few friends that are teaching courses and I know firsthand (well, secondhand, but really directly secondhand) what y'all have been going through this semester. On top of having a massive wrench thrown into the middle of your research--ostensibly the reason you're there--you also have to navigate the shitshow of changing plans every other week and maintaining sanity when faced with total uncertainty. 

Oh, and the bars are closed. Real icing on the cake there.

I've had some good professors at UNC. I've had some bad professors too. But I've never had a TA that didn't take my concerns, questions, and aspirations seriously. I've never had a TA that didn't work with me to get done the shit that needed to get done. And I've never had a TA that didn't totally and unequivocally level with a class when shit hit the fan. 

So remember to stop by your TA's office hours and say hi, acknowledge that they're in the thick of it too, and thank them for keeping it real when it seems like so few else higher up do. They need to hear it as much as you do.

However, this morning while I was scrolling through emails I noticed another email from Carolina Athletics in my ""Other"" (not Focused) inbox. It was the exact same email as before but it was the glorious green text saying I HAD received a ticket. The time receipt? 6:15pm, 2 minutes before they told me I hadn't received a ticket.

Did this happen to anyone else? It's never happened to me so I'm not really sure what to do. I really want to go to the game (the weather is supposed to be about perfect), but I seriously don't know if I have a ticket or not.

I might call Carolina Athletics and demand that they honor the first email that came to me saying I had won a ticket, but I don't know if they'll honor it. Of note is the fact that the two different status emails I received were identical in every way except one said I had received a ticket and one said I hadn't. Both were in the official Carolina Athletics email formal so I know it isn't a scam.

Depression and choosing a major,"I'm not passionate about anything. It really sucks because I know I could be passionate about so many things if I just didn't have depression. My depression isn't very intense like it used to be but it has still  made choosing a major just so bland and uncertain for me. I'm taking COMP110 right now and it's one of those classes where I go ""oh another area of study I would probably love if I weren't mentally ill."" I once had someone tell me I shouldn't major in comp sci if I weren't passionate about it because I'll just fall behind all the people who love it or like it. I feel like that's true. I'm just so frustrated with how depression is ruining my life. I want so bad to be passionate about things and to pick something to study that I'm going to enjoy and that I want to do for the rest of my life. But I mean with depression I can't even see myself having a ""rest of my life"" in the first place.  Therapy/psychological help is something that is inaccessible to me because of my family and because I can't afford it.  I've managed my depression myself for so long but I'm so tired and I can't wait for this semester to be over.

At what point is it a good idea to declare a class P/F?,"Hi all, for some context I'm a Junior working on a B.S. in Computer Science and currently sitting at a GPA of 3.52. As such, any grade I earn that is less than a A- (90%) will hurt my GPA. 

In my own personal experience when applying to internships, they always ask for your GPA (and sometimes there's a minimum GPA of 3.5 for the position, but usually it's a minimum of 3.0 to be considered). However, they almost never ask for a transcript. 

As I sit, there's only 1 class that I believe I could feasibly pull off an A- in. 2 of the remain 3 are most likely going to be anywhere between a B- and B+. The last one is looking to be a C+ to B. After doing the calculations, I believe it is safe to assume that my grades this semester will look like this:

* COMP 455: B+ (3.33)
* COMP 550: B (3.0)
* COMP 426: B (this all depends on the midterm grades yet to be released) (3.0)
* STOR 435: B- (2.67)

My question is what do I do? None of my grades are *terrible* but they're more all kinda average to mediocre. My only concern is that declaring P/F on a class is negating all the hard work I spent trying to do well in it. However, a lot of the internships I've been interested in and been applying to want the applicant to have at least a GPA of 3.5 or 3.0. While P/Fing everything would mean I'd be secure in my current GPA of 3.52, I fear that the P/Fs on my transcript will make an employer assume the worst and think I did very poorly in those classes, especially since they're all major classes.

BUSI 102 (and ECON 400) Tips and Advice for Spring 2020,"Hello!   


I have a quick question about BUSI 102. Is it hard and what would be its difficulty in comparison to other courses like ECON 101 or ECON 410? I did well in ECON 101 in the Fall 2020 semester and I plan on taking BUSI 102 and ECON 410 this Spring.  How is the course structure like and the content itself?

Secondly, I plan on taking ECON 400 as my political science methods course for my major and I was wondering for those who took it how was it. I have credit for STOR 155 and I enjoyed statistics quite much and I feel the course would be more difficult because it is tailored to economics. Reading the course description, it is definitely more math-y and ""STEM"" then other political science courses I took like POLI 271 Modern Political Thought or POLI 150 IR. With this background in mind, I would appreciate if people in the political science or economics major(s) can spread some insight.

Credit hour-wise, I was planning on taking BUSI 102 in the fall since I‚Äôll have a heavier course load then (1.5 credits vs 3).

MATH 534 or MATH 528 (plus lab)?,"I am a CS/math major. I was wondering if anyone had any opinions on MATH 534 (Elements of Modern Algebra, with Professor Prakash Belkale) v. MATH 528 (Mathematical Methods for the Physical Sciences I, with Professor Pedro J. Saenz Hervias) + MATH 528L (the lab, with Robert Hunt). I am registered for both, but also on the waitlist to get into STOR 435/MATH 535 currently, which I will prioritize over these classes since it's a core requirement for CS and I'm considering a stats minor and/or a machine learning class. Hopefully will get into that, and then will drop one of these two classes. But both are relevant to stuff I'd like to learn about (534 ties with computer science, 528 ties with scientific computation), and I might take the other in the future anyway.

I've had Professor Belkale for MATH 233 previously. He was a nice man and not a bad teacher, but I did have trouble understanding his accent and handwriting. Professor Saenz has no info on RMP. He does seem to have a cool lab website, though. Robert Hunt is a grad student without much info either.

If anyone has any insights into these instructors or classes please let me know. More specifically if you've taken 528, do you need much background in physical sciences to take the class? I'm pretty much purely a ""computer scientist"" lol. And is taking the lab worth it? I took 383L, and it was a fair amount of extra work, but I think it was worth it for the MATLAB experience and the A on my transcript. Helped that it was over summer though, this semester will be pretty busy for me, so it might not be worth it.",1607092959,1,0

"Here‚Äôs the vaccine situation in North Carolina: overall supply, your place in line, how quickly the line might move (Sen. Jeff Jackson)","HERE‚ÄôS THE VACCINE SITUATION IN NORTH CAROLINA
 
This week, North Carolina got 85,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
 
Next week, that will drop to 60,000.
 
Some of you saw the headlines about Pfizer vaccine shipments being reduced, for reasons that are still unclear. That appears to have happened across the board. So, while we were originally expecting to get another 85,000 Pfizer doses, now it looks closer to 60,000.
 
But that doesn‚Äôt apply to the Moderna vaccine. 
 
Next week, our state will be getting 175,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine - which just became FDA-approved last night, so we now officially have two vaccines.

Both vaccines need to be administered with a first and second shot. The shots must be 21 days apart for Pfizer and 28 days apart for Moderna. 
 
You cannot mix a Pfizer with a Moderna vaccination - you need two doses of the same kind.  
 
These estimates are very rough, but it‚Äôs safe to say that within the next six weeks North Carolina will be getting hundreds of thousands (but likely not millions) of doses.
 
But, keep in mind, everyone needs two doses. So, for example, if we get one million doses by the end of January, that means 500,000 immunizations. 
 
For context, that‚Äôs less than 5% of our state.

Many sources, including Dr. Fauci, say that herd immunity kicks in once 75 to 85% of the population is immunized. However, he says that once 50% of the population is immunized we should start to see an effect on slowing community spread.
 
At this point, it‚Äôs safe to say that it will be many months before we hit 50%. 
 
We may very well end up with much more supply than the current rate, but that‚Äôs less likely to happen in the next couple months than in the months that follow. Dr. Fauci, for instance, says we should have greater supply starting in late March or early April.
 
That means that for purposes of controlling the overall rate of infection for the next few months - *which will be crucial* - the vaccine may not be a major counterweight. 

HERE‚ÄôS WHERE THE VACCINES ARE HEADING WITHIN OUR STATE RIGHT NOW
 
First, we‚Äôre shipping to all the hospitals. We have 116 hospitals in our state. In the first week, we only had enough vaccine to ship to 53 of them, and some of them only received a small number of vaccines.
 
The 53 hospitals that were chosen for the first shipment all have ultra-cold freezers. Novant, for example, had to quickly buy roughly 20 new sub-zero freezers in order to receive the shipment.
 
Once the vaccines are unloaded from their ultra-cold delivery box, they must be moved into a freezer within five minutes.
 
Due to how the vaccine is packaged, the smallest number of Pfizer vaccines that a hospital can receive is 975. You can‚Äôt sub-divide that number due to packaging.

The Moderna vaccine is different. It doesn‚Äôt require ultra-cold storage, just regular freezer storage. That means it can ship in batches of 100. While supplies are still scarce, this makes the Moderna vaccine more well-suited for rural hospitals and smaller providers.
 
*Important Note*: Nursing home distribution works differently.
 
The federal government wanted to give states some flexibility in deciding where vaccines would go *except* when it comes to nursing homes, which they wanted to ensure were a priority.
 
They also wanted to make sure that the administration of the vaccine in nursing homes was handled with particular care.
 
So the approach they came up with was to contract with Walgreens and CVS to use their medical staff to administer the vaccine to nursing homes.

And the deal is the federal government will pay for that *as long as* your state allocates at least 50% of the Moderna vaccine to nursing homes. 
 
North Carolina has complied with that, so nursing homes will have the benefit of a large number of trained medical staff on site to handle vaccine administration.
 
This does not, however, apply to all forms of long-term care facilities. Right now, this is specifically for nursing homes due to their highly elevated risk.
 
 
HERE‚ÄôS HOW THE PHASES WORK (I.E., ‚ÄúYOUR PLACE IN LINE‚Äù)

The CDC established guidelines for how states should prioritize vaccine distribution. North Carolina has adopted those guidelines.
 
1a: Health care workers specifically dealing with COVID (note: this also includes clerical and janitorial staff working in COVID wings) and residents/staff of long-term care facilities.
 
1b: Adults with at least two chronic conditions that put them at severe risk, and front-line workers at high risk of exposure. 
 
2: Adults over 65, adults under 65 with at least one chronic condition, and front-line workers.
 
3: College students, K-12 students (when a vaccine is approved for children under 16, which hasn‚Äôt happened yet), and essential workers at lower risk of exposure.
 
4: Everyone else who wants a vaccine.

The most recent estimate is that we may reach group 1b by mid-January. It depends entirely on whether we continue to receive the vaccine at the rate we expect.
 
1b is a vastly larger pool of individuals than 1a, so unless we start receiving the vaccine more quickly it will likely take much longer to get through 1b.
 

BOTTOM-LINE
 
It‚Äôs important to stress that the big variable here - how quickly we get more vaccine - is very difficult to predict.
 
That said, at this point it appears the baseline scenario is that it could be many months before we've immunized enough people for it to become a major limiting factor for community spread.
 
That means this is still largely up to us, as individuals. We still owe it to each other to keep infection chains as short as possible.

*Our vigilance is the bridge to the vaccine.*

ONE MORE THING

In the meantime, it would be extremely helpful if the U.S. Senate would pass the COVID relief bill they‚Äôve been debating for the last several months so we can get financial help to people while we ask them to stay safe and stay smart. 

The state of North Carolina - like most states - is highly dependent on federal assistance in this circumstance and our state legislature has been waiting since August to get this help.

The latest scandal is that the frats have been selling cocaine to fellow students.

In the background remain long-simmering complaints about sexual assault and other inappropriate behavior.

When is enough enough?

Average GPA at UNC nowadays?,"I have found some old articles from back when UNC was thinking about adding ‚Äúcontext‚Äù to the grades on transcripts so people had some idea whether a particular grade was ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù for a class or maybe just overall for the university.  Obviously that fell apart (funny enough, one article said UNC‚Äôs excuse for dumping the idea was that Connect Carolina was too much of a POS to handle it).  

Anyway, some of those articles have an average GPA for UNC, of course whining about grade inflation.  But the interesting thing was, the average they gave for back then still looked pretty low to me (while Duke was found to have boosted the average grade to an A-, UNC‚Äôs average at the time was still just barely above a 3.0).  And then the fake-classes scandal happened, and I have the impression that a lot of the school started grading even more harshly to compensate (embarrassment I guess?).

Everyone here that I meet has tons of extracurricular activities, relevant work/internship experience, and skills and projects they've worked on. I pretty much have nothing. I use all my time and energy just trying to get decent grades in my STEM classes. My classmates had more accomplished in high-school than I do now. I'm not sure how I got in here.

I'm just so tired. If I do anything just for fun over break I feel guilty for not doing something ""productive"" to improve my sad resume situation, but if I try to do something productive I just get overwhelmed by how much there is to do to get me to the level of all the other students here. So then I just try to avoid it because I can't handle it. I'm not passionate or excited about anything anymore; I just want to not be a failure.

I'm scared. I'll have a ton of student loans when I get out, even though UNC was one of my cheaper options, and I can't afford to go to grad school even though that seems the norm in my field. I really shouldn't have gone to college but I mean it's too late for that now. I'm worried I won't be able to get a job to pay off my loans and it freaks me out.

Getting Back Into A Class?,"So I enrolled in a course the day of my registration and everything was fine.

The class was capped at 40 students, so I'm worried not enough people will drop for me to get in. My main problem though is that this course is required for my minor, and my major courses follow a specific, structured schedule beginning in Fall 2021 and the program doesn't accommodate for additional courses. This course is also not offered in the summer, meaning next semester is the only time I have to take the class. I explained it to the person who emailed me (someone in administrative support for the department), and asked to be kept in the class but idk what more to do? Should I just chill out and wait and hope I get enrolled? Email the professor at the beginning of the semester? Department heads?

Seeking GPA and cs major advice,"I'm currently declared as a computer science major but tbh I'm not sure if I want to study cs anymore. Made some really stupid mistakes on the comp 210 midterm, which is adding to my doubts about this major. I've heard that for cs, GPA isn't as important as some solid personal projects, but at this point I don't even have one personal project I've done that's not from high school.

Part of me thinks it's because I'm too stressed right now (my dumbass decided to take 6 classes), and I shouldn't doubt my choice of major, I declared it because I was genuinely interested in cs and I actually enjoy the programming assignments. The other part of me thinks that if I actually had the passion I would've pulled through on this midterm and on personal projects.

Not sure if I want to go to grad school (for a master's) and I know GPA is considered for that, not sure if I can even get in. I know I want to major in stem, but I can't even decide on a field of stem because I was so sure I'd major in cs. I just feel so anxious and defeated.

So I guess my question is, has anyone else been in my situation? If I keep going as a cs major, what GPA should I be going for? In general, what GPA should I be going for if I'm a non-cs stem major?

UNC Law School Admissions Advice,"Good Afternoon Everybody,

I am a senior at UNCW who is interested in applying for law school at UNC. I will be graduating in the spring with two degrees in Criminology and Political Science. My current undergraduate GPA is 3.306, which I am anticipating will go up before I apply, as I have been immensely dedicated to my studies the past year after dealing with personal issues during my sophomore year. I am anxiously waiting for my LSAT score to be released, as I have just taken the LSAT-Flex earlier in the month. Aside from GPA and LSAT, I have completed a legal internship in the summer of 2018 and also have plenty of leadership, community service, and philanthropic experience being president and philanthropy chair of a fraternity here at UNCW as well as being a member of a greek honors society.

UNC Law is definitely my number one choice of Law School and I plan on applying for admission for the Fall 2021 semester. Realistically, If I am denied from UNC my only other option would be NC Central. It is unfortunate that North Carolina only has two public law schools, as I could not even dream to afford an out-of-state or private legal education at universities such as Elon, Campbell, Duke, or Wake Forest. With that being said, thinking about the future of my education has caused me a great deal of stress nowadays.

I am hoping to find some students admitted to UNC Law that were also lingering in the lower 25th percentile when it comes to GPA to answer some questions for me.

What were your LSAT scores when you were admitted? 

What do you believe is the most crucial information that the admissions officer looks at on your application?

How are you enjoying your legal education at UNC thus far and how has the shift to online classes affected your studies?

Do you have any advice for those who are planning on applying for UNC law in the future?",1602697681,1,0

Contemplating dropping CS major but not for academic reasons,"So I normally don't use Reddit but I decided to create this account because I needed to let it off my chest and can't do so on  UNC Facebook group. I'm a junior majoring in computer science and I am highly contemplating dropping the major for something else. This isn't for academic reasons, I've gotten A's, B's and C's in my major classes. I wish my GPA was higher but the Comp sci classes really aren't that bad if time is put into them. The reason I want to drop the major is due to the students. Let me explain. 

I feel like a ton of the Comp Sci majors are extremely snobby and condescending. I didn't have many friends growing up and always had sort of a self esteem issue and I thought college would be a place with fewer cliques and less judgment than high school. I've tried to have conversations with a few of them and all they wanted to talk about was computer science and tech. That isn't an issue but what is an issue is their constant flexing on extremely trivial matters. One time this guy was flexing about how Capital One gave him a 16 inch MacBook and saying it was much better for running/compiling code than my cheap Dell laptop. Another time they would talk about how much they were getting paid at their Microsoft internship and how they were spending it on more tech  items. A lot of them also openly look down on me when I ask for help, and this was pervasive not only among the students but also among the student TAs ranging from Comp 110 TAs to 411 to 426. I understand I might sound soft but this really hurts me. 

I haven't interned anywhere yet but the behavior of many computer science students is really discouraging me from pursuing the major anymore. I don't know if the work place culture will be any different but it sure doesn't seem like it.",1602435070,1,0

What percent of transfer applicants come from outside NC/ or a CC?,"Hey everyone, college freshman here applying to transfer this year as a part of the c/o 2024. I was combing thru the CDS and it looks like last year the transfer acceptance rate was about 50 percent (which is obviously waaay more favorable odds than first-year undergrad, especially for OOS kids). 

That said, while I know there isn't a hard cap on OOS'ers for transfers, does anyone know what percent of the transfers they accept come from out of state? (or conversely, come from instate or CC's). 

I ask cause I come from a 4 year state flagship (though not of the same caliber as UNC) and am curious how skewed the odds are for/against me this time around. FWIW I had a 1510 SAT in high school plus 2 700+ subject tests. I am hopefully gonna have a 4.0 at the time I apply (likely no worse than a 3.9 knock on wood). I am not including that stuff cause I want a chance me but I just don't know if tests and GPA would impact your answer. Thanks!",1602267796,1,0

HPM Major at UNC,"Hello!

Does anyone have some experience or information about the HPM major at UNC. I am a sophomore and during the summer I realized that this was the major I was interested in, because of the timing I still have 2 pre reqs left for the spring semester (I talked to my advisor and he said that this is ok). I am just really nervous about the whole process, as I heard that is extremely competitive and I feel as I am nor a very strong candidate. I think that my GPA is ok, it is about a 3.6, which is about the average score. I have very little extracurriculars, and the only thing I feel that is good is my enthusiasm for the field, and the experiences that made me realize I wanted to do this. So to summarize are all of the applicants that are accepted super smart? and super involved? or are there some like me?

Secondly, whenever he gets around to uploading these lectures (normally around 1.5 hours long each) then we have to scramble and watch around 7.5 hours of lectures to catch up, which is extremely annoying and stressful.

"UPDATE to ""Everything I read about the honor court is a bunch of horror stories, and that I'll be convicted even though I'm innocent of what they accused me of doing. HELP??""","[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/icqxeh/everything_i_read_about_the_honor_court_is_a/)

Idk if anyone cares but I figured by this point after all the questions I've asked about this process, I might have helpful information for anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation. 

There are different types of hearings, not just one for guilty and another for not guilty. For instance, you can choose whether you want an administrator presiding over the hearing, or if you want a panel of students. I thought the idea of a bunch of snobby kids my age with power complexes deciding my fate like it's tea time to be terrifying, so I have decided to go with a single administrator. 

If this is the type of hearing you choose, it will just be you, an administrator, and your accuser. I'm not sure if this is true in every case, but I was told that if I ""waive my right to question witnesses"" that my professor (the accuser) will not be there. I don't want my professor to think that I'm bad-mouthing them and I don't think it will add anything to the hearing, so for my mental health I have decided to waive my right (although I am meeting with a defense counsel first to discuss this). From what I can tell, the administrators are surprisingly down-to-earth people who seem to be effective neutral parties.

After my last post, a lot of people suggested that I lawyer up. Specifically, people were saying to contact Carolina Student Legal Services (CSLS) to get one for free. Two things are barring this. Firstly, CSLS cannot represent anyone ""against the University."" I tried to argue with a law student that this wasn't really ""against"" the ""University"" but they disagreed lol. Secondly, the Honor Court limits attorney involvement. They can't stop you from talking to a lawyer outside of the hearing, but they are not allowed to be at the hearing itself or make decisions on your behalf. 

I mentioned last time that this was not being a ""speedy"" process as I heard from the Honor Court about four months after the professor punished me and the other students they accused. According to the administrators, they received the report two months later than the professor should have sent it to them. However, it would seem that I still have grounds for an appeal anyway because I received a charge decision 62 days after the preliminary meeting, just two days longer than the 60-day window that is allowed for in circumstances where delays would be expected (the pandemic). In normal days, the time-frame allowed is 30 days maximum. Anything longer than this requires explicit permission from the HC Attorney General.

 I should also mention that the Honor Court doesn't care about anything screwed up by my professor when making their own decisions, because the professor's actions are ""out of their hands.""

Due to some other technical rules, I found out that my pass/fail grade for the class would stand, and that I would not have to retake the course in any case. They have told me that they would make no changes to the sanctions already imposed by the professor (and completed by me) in the case of my ""guilt."" However, like I was saying last time, this would still mean that it would go in my Student Conduct Record that I was sanctioned by the Honor Court, labeling me a cheater and a liar. If I were applying to medical schools, they would see this and obviously I would not look like an awesome candidate. So I'm not going to let them do that, because, well, I'm not a cheater (in any case in my life). 

I guess we'll see what happens. Nothing really new has occurred since that last meeting, but I figured this information could help some people out. If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them, but this post is probably longer than anyone on this sub cares to read so I'll stop myself here for now.",1599282158,1,0

Volunteers to lead English as a Second Language virtual classes,"Hey everyone, we're in the process of bringing the International &amp; American Student Alliance (IASA), a student org at multiple universities across the country, to UNC and one of its biggest programs is English Clusters. This program provides free, non-credit English as a Second Language (ESL) classes to international students who want to practice/improve their English skills in a casual environment. These classes are typically led by students who are native (or at least near-fluent) English speakers and interested in helping international students and/or gaining teaching experience.

Class topics can range anywhere from skill-based (i.e. pronunciation, writing for graduate students, reading) to topic-based (i.e. Southern culture, American movies) to casual conversation-based (i.e. discussion of current events, practicing English by playing games). While the teaching opportunities in this program are great for those studying to become English/ESL teachers or wanting to teach abroad, we still welcome those who are not. While the type of class that you will teach (a more casual conversation hour format vs. one on pronunciation) will depend on your background, knowledge, and experience, anyone from freshmen to graduate students can participate.

For this semester, all of these classes will be virtual and will begin the week of Monday, September 14th. Classes typically meet once a week for around an hour and there's a lot of flexibility for the day/time that they can be taught. In addition to these classes being open to all UNC international students, we're combining the English Clusters across all of the universities that our organization is at (Indina University, NCSU, University of Georgia, etc.) this Fall since everyone is virtual anyway. This means that an international student from UNC can participate in a class led by someone at NCSU, and vice-versa.

If this program sounds interesting and you'd potentially be interested in leading one of these classes, visit uiasaa.com or dm me and I can give you more information!",1599174289,1,0

(If you like what we're doing, I'd love to have you be a part of our early access list!)

**Also, in case you're curious,** the reason I decided to make Qwerty was because at most colleges, different majors &amp; classes have 100s of smart students trying to learn very similar material and this means that these students can be an invaluable resource to each other.

Yet, most of us go 4 years without interacting with a meaningful number of these smart students in our direct academic vicinity.

Personally, I've been in lecture halls with over 100 students and pursued a major with over 300 students.

Sadly; however, I only ever got the chance to interact with a handful of my peers in these classes/majors. Usually, these were students I met through my social circle who just happened to be taking the same class as me. Sometimes, it involved luck and countless posts on Facebook, GroupMe, or Reddit.

**Coincidentally, the classes that I did well in were usually those where I had the advantage of a collaborative network of peers that I could study with and learn from.**

**Sometimes, I can't help but wonder how much more I could have learned or how much better I could have done in college if I had the benefit of this collaborative network for all my classes.**

How to ask for extra points,"If you're on the line between a C or B or A, it's not impossible to just ask the professor if there's any way to get an extra hundredth point or more.  

This is easier if you're in a smaller class with more of a connection with the professor.  And if you're professor is a dickhole, they will remain a dickhole.  And if it's STEM, I don't know.  You smart people might be stuck with your smarts and lucrative job opportunities while us humanities people struggle to get by.

Anywho.  After you see your grade, email the professor with some sort of interpretation of the course content.  If it's underwater basket weaving, pass along an interesting article you've come across on the subject and interpret it.  Put a good couple of paragraphs into it.  Wrap it up jokingly suggesting ""If this is good enough to give me the extra \[however many points\] to get an A/B/Pass then all the better!""

Source:  I did this and got 2 entire points to get an A last Spring.

Dormer Window Dorm Rooms,"Hey there,

Anyone have experience living on the top floor of one of the dormitories with dormers? I lived in a super small apartment last year and couldn't stand being so far away from campus.

Re- Petition to pushback Pass/Fail Deadline at UNC-CH,"[http://chng.it/SNWCMkmK](http://chng.it/SNWCMkmK)

Because the first one did not phase the administration. 

A petition to change the original pass/fail deadline was previously made a few weeks ago, but was declined by the university administration even with the overwhelming support of the student body. They **claim that everything was ‚Äú thought of ‚Äù during the roadmap discussions** earlier in the year and that all decisions are final. **This is also the same administration that carelessly decided allowing students to come back to campus was ‚Äúan excellent idea‚Äù** and not expect an increase in COVID cases. **This is also the same administration that thought a shooter was on the loose when there wasn‚Äôt.**

**True enough, there are a lot of things that the university did not predict correctly this year including their implementation of the pass/fail option** this semester. **They did not expect faculty to slack off in grading** when they asked them exactly what they wanted to be done. Not to **mention all of the linear testing that formats and other unproven experimental formats** that were being used for testing which hurt students.

**There have been numerous developments since their roadmap discussion.**¬† Our sister universities like **NCSU have until December 23rd**, well after their finals to declare pass/fail for their courses, **which is in stark contrast to our policy even though we are in the same school system**. Many of us **students did not know our grades until almost the very end of the course because the professors were not making our grades available fast enough**. So we did not know whether or not to pass/fail.¬†

**We also did not know how pass/failing multiple classes would impact our chances of grad school, med schools or other higher studies,** so many didn‚Äôt. This was also a deciding factor for many students in their decision to not pass/fail classes. These decisions might make a difference for students now that the semester is coming to a close.

This decision is also unfair because **professors and TA‚Äôs still get until December 1 or longer to input/change grades they haven‚Äôt graded since the beginning of the school year.** So all the professors who were slacking in their grading now magically **input grades that they have graded ‚Äúfairly‚Äù or so we are told to believe.** And us student, are still drowning **in uncertainty about our grades.**¬†

**Please sign and share this petition. Strength in numbers can show them this is much needed in an unconventional semester such as this one.**",1606164965,1,0

CHEM 241 Final Exam,"So there is nothing solidified yet, as Professor Todd Austell has still not sent out an email regarding this, but I wanted to put a post up to see if what he's doing is even allowed. Our exam is on Tuesday, and there was a cheating scandal with Chegg on the third midterm, so he wiped that midterm completely and our final now counts as the final exam and our third midterm (at least 50% of our final grade). He has already stated that he would make the final exam linear, broken up into 4 different parts with an hour max to do each part, but only 3 hours total (so we have to pace ourselves as best as possible). After a QnA session he held for the final, he mentioned briefly (to only about 1/3 of the class) that  we would also have to take the exam with our cameras on in a Zoom meeting (but there still is nothing formal set up yet, as he has neglected to send an email informing us about that being the case.) So, in sum, are professors allowed to make whatever changes they want to a final exam setup AFTER the pass/fail deadline with &lt;24 hours notice before the exam, especially after making the exam worth at LEAST  50% of our grade AND making the exam linear (when it wasn't linear for any of the midterms)?

I spoke to an advisor and they have voiced their concerns to the ARS and Registar depts but it‚Äôs probably still going to happen. so even with a really good time on your registration day or even if you are a last semester senior and have an 8 am registration, please check your classes on nov 29 and make changes accordingly because there are students (from seniors to freshmen) who will begin registering for classes on that day.",1605925616,1,0

How do I (or should I even) politely ask my professor to please answer my email,"So I have class in which the participation grade is 10% of the final grade. The syllabus says that if you miss more than 2 classes, you get a 0 for participation, and I've missed more than 2, but I have 2 excused absences through the dean of students. I really worried I'm going to get a 0 for participation and it will bring me down to a C, which would make me really sad, but I'd at least like to know. So I emailed the professor at about 8pm two days ago basically asking if I was going to get a zero for participation and kind of very politely reminding him that I have two absences approved by ODOS. He's also just been very lenient this semester and gone back on a lot of his syllabus polices, like the syllabus says he doesn't give any extensions but he's been really flexible in light of covid this semester. Sometimes he's just kinda slow with emails. The only time I've gotten back an email in the same day is when I put ""urgent - "" in the subject line but this obviously isn't urgent so I feel like it would be disrespectful to do that. Obviously I really like this prof so I'm scared to send him another email but this is making me anxious. Would it come across as pushy?",1605907303,1,0

I feel absolutely hopeless,"Just another vent post. I‚Äôm a third year bio student and probably about to fail orgo 1 for the second time, or (best case scenario) get an LP and no course credit and I‚Äôll have to figure out my options from there. I‚Äôve never planned on med school so it‚Äôs not the worst I guess, I just feel so ashamed. Being a good student was basically a key facet of my personality before college, but as soon as I got to UNC I realized that I had terrible burnout from high school and severe depression that I haven‚Äôt been able to shake. (And yeah, I‚Äôve been trying to talk to CAPS and the grad psych clinic for years and keep getting rejected because my problems can‚Äôt be solved in the short-term therapy window and the same goes for anyone else in the area I can afford.) 

I tried to take orgo 1 for the first time over the summer and it was without a doubt one of the worst academic decisions I‚Äôve made‚ÄîI honestly believe based on how I did in Chem 241 that I probably could‚Äôve done okay had it been in person, but in the pandemic I ended up living in a house alone off campus and could barely get out of bed most days. The second time started out much better, but I quickly fell into the same trap. The worst part is that I know the class is difficult, but I haven‚Äôt even been able to make myself study so I can‚Äôt claim that the material is too challenging because I genuinely haven‚Äôt tried hard enough to learn it. At this point the only thing I can feel slightly good about is that I haven‚Äôt cheated, just failed outright (lol). I can‚Äôt even think about having to try to take the class again without getting nauseous, and there‚Äôs another section after it. Again, I‚Äôm just ashamed and have no idea what I‚Äôm going to do‚Äîmy parents definitely won‚Äôt understand, if I have to tell them, and my housemates are all competitive pre-meds so I don‚Äôt particularly want to tell them either. 

Anyway, fuck depression and fuck COVID, but I really appreciate this sub for helping me feel a little less isolated in the struggle this semester.",1605861507,1,0

Advice for Applying to Grad School w/ a Mediocre GPA?,"Hi so I finished undergrad at UNC in the spring and am planning on applying to grad school for social work and UNC‚Äôs program is one that I want to apply to. However my junior year was an absolute hellscape in terms of my mental health/personal life and I missed anywhere between 1.5-2 months of school w/ about 2 weeks of that being spent in the psych ward. My doctors originally suggested I withdraw from school and take a 5th yr but ultimately we agreed that it wouldn‚Äôt have been helpful/productive and while I don‚Äôt really regret staying in school instead of withdrawing I feel like I kind of shot myself in the foot in terms of looking good on grad school apps. Since I fell so behind in my classes I ended up with some shit grades and my GPA took a major dip from a 3.25 to a 2.9. Luckily I got it up to a 3.0 in my last year but I‚Äôm still stressed about how grad school admissions will view my transcript/grades. I‚Äôm not planning on going to grad school until 2022, so I can start building up a more impressive resume and pay of student loans from undergrad but I was wondering if anyone had any experience or advice about getting into a grad program at UNC (or any school) with a more mediocre/middle of the road looking GPA/transcript.",1605843131,1,0

Can a 26 year-old grad student join a frat at UNC Chapel Hill?,"Here‚Äôs some context for my situation: I finished my undergrad degree at Tufts University back in 2016 and spent 2 years working for a small tech company in Boston. I then spent 2 years after that working for a biotech company in the UK as an expat. I just moved back to the states and was recently accepted into the full-time MBA program at UNC Chapel Hill and plan to enroll in fall 2021. I will be turning 26 around that time. 

When I attended Tufts University, I shortly realized that it wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for in a college experience. It‚Äôs a smaller-sized liberal arts school in the suburbs with D3 sports. I soon wished I attended a ‚Äúbig time‚Äù state school with a elite sports, big greek life, and huge party scene in a college town. However, I decided against transferring as I would‚Äôve been a few credits behind and it would‚Äôve cost extra time and tuition money to catch up. 

I really want the experience to be able to join a frat, be a member of that sort of community, and have the opportunity to party and go to big sporting events. Although I‚Äôll be 26, I say I could pass off as 20-21 as I have a baby face and a lean build. I also feel like I could be a valuable mentor for the other frat brothers. 

My question is: would it be possible and socially acceptable for someone in my situation to join a frat at UNC?",1607495469,1,0
Professor Issac Unah's POLI 411 and POLI 416 - Advice and Tips? Questions on Course Content.,"Dear UNC Subreddit, 

I am currently registered for two courses this Spring semester taught by Professor Isaac Unah and they are POLI 411 and POLI 416, which broadly deal with the Constitution and in a way, Constitutional Law. 

The former is called ""Civil Liberties under the Constitution"" and the latter is ""Constitutional Policies and¬†the Judicial Process."" I was wondering if you guys  have any advice or insight on these courses or by the professor, if you have taken these courses. Additionally, what about Professor Unah? I tried RMP and there were not that much ratings/reviews about him and any new perspectives would be great! I looked at the Quizlets and some notes online and they appear to be lots of SCOTUS cases and political history. 

I am quite interested in the course material after looking at the POLI 411 syllabus from another professor and I am thinking about how Professor Unah will teach the course. 

Thanks!",1607491047,1,0
