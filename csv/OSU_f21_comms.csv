"Didn't live in either, but:

1. If you're a woman, it's somewhat worth it to pay the extra $$$ for the security (your unit is virtually not accessible by outsiders, since I'm guessing that the front door is fob entry and then you have your unit inside this). In contrast, a regular house can be easily broken into, especially if it becomes known that it's occupied by two women. If you're two dudes, I don't know if it's worth it.
2. You should think about what you're ok putting up with, and what you can't stand. I'm pretty sensitive to noise, and when I lived in one of these luxury apartments in Columbus, the walls were paper thin, and the neighbor above me walking around shook my unit (to check this, try knocking on the walls around the unit and see if the knock feels hollow. Then jump on the floor with your heels and see if the floor vibrates. If either of these two things happen, you'll almost certainly be plagued by noise from your neighbors).
3. To see if the management actually does their job, ask to see the common space, especially the trash chute and the room that collects larger trash. While my apartment had really fancy individual units, the trash area were, well, trash.
4. And I guess you're doing this here, but definitely try to find some current or former residents and get their opinions before signing leases. While I was living in my apartment, I got some of these questions from the prospective renters, and although I felt uncomfortable saying outright that the apartment sucked, I would either play grumpy or refuse to give answers to save these people from entering into the devil's contract.",1631509423,2,0

I understand your frustration but it is ridiculous to assume that we students go out there and fight crime and give out food when we pay the university that promises to keep us safe to do so. That‚Äôs how we help. We pay for our safety and we pay to be protected. City taxes that we pay to live here do go towards protecting us. Taxes that our parents pay go towards police to protect their children who are at a university trying to earn a degree. Students didn‚Äôt damage anything, and it‚Äôs hypocritical to imply that we don‚Äôt contribute to reforms, yet we caused the limited policing around the city. 

Further, change is the only way things progress in life. If students begged for reform and change in the city that they pay for, that reform is probably well intended and is expected that the tax dollars of our parents and our tuition money can be used in the slightest way towards increasing the safety of the next generation. 

Students are not responsible for the cities‚Äô responsibilities. While I don‚Äôt think defunding the police is the best idea considering the situation that we are in, it is ignorant to disregard the lack of resources the city has to offer for its citizens.",1631506586,4,0

I couldnt see anything. Why? The person operating the camera was focused in on a beautiful girl working there rather then feet away from her where the crime was being committed.

The reality is you probably need more Security or Police patrols. 

People have to look out for one another. I know its harder to have maximum security at an off-campus rental (landlords wont do it).

People need to be aware of their surroundings. Keep your eyes peeled and off your phone. Dont wear ear buds and be prepared to take action. 

All these Gen-Ed's, I wish some sort of self-defense class was among them. Now, I am not saying each student will be Bruce Lee, but some basic self defense knowledge. For instance, if a girl is grabbed in an attempted sexual assault, what can she do to free and defend herself? In some cities, the PD's will put on self defense classes geared towards women against larger attackers. Hilliard PD does this. Maybe OSUPD can too? I dont know if there is a self-defense org on campus or not but maybe those with knowledge and help others learn.

I believe bringing back Safe Ride, operated by DPS or in someway by OSU, would be a wonderful start to transport student to their destinations (within a certain radius of campus of course). Im just not big in to Lyft or Uber and of course if the student has to foot the bill, they will be less reluctant to use it.",1631502914,2,0

A friend‚Äôs brother was the primary witness of the shooting. Said that the girl lost a lot of blood but that he believed the shooting itself to be an accident and that the person seemed to be VERY intoxicated. He ALSO said that he told the police where he saw the shooter fleeing but that they did not pursue the suspect until backup arrived nearly 40 minutes later (when the backup arrived they asked him which direction the shooter fled even though he had told first responding police officers much earlier). Obviously the shooting is not the police officers‚Äô fault but the story definitely seems to enforce that OSU and CPD are not effectively organized or effectively patrolling campus area and are putting forth minimal effort to prevent incidents near campus.,1631502456,28,0

"It wasn‚Äôt just the Wex staff that didnt get a raise or pay $90/ month to park, the staff on the academic side of the university also didnt get a raise, and many of us that make &lt;$50K/year are assigned A parking passes at a cost of over $1000/yr.

I started my job back in 2010. Since then, my pay has only gone up $6300. I‚Äòve paid almost $7000 to park from 2010 until 2018, until it finally hit me how much money I‚Äòve spent on parking; I entered the lottery to downgrade to B parking in 2018, and it‚Äôs still around $500/year. So raises here don‚Äôt mean a goddamn thing, unless your the university president.

Employment at Ohio State is no longer doable for me. I can‚Äôt afford their impotent 1% annual merit pay raises any longer, they don‚Äôt even come close to covering cost of living increases or the greedy CampusParc annual increases. It was a complete insult to everyone when they announced that they were reinstating our pay raises, ‚Äúup to 2%‚Äù, while patting themselves on the back.

"As a professor at OSU, here are my thoughts:

* A Canvas quiz has a window of ""availability"" when students can access it and a separate ""due"" date and time ([see this pic](https://imgur.com/a/FyXeWzu)). It sounds like the exam was not only ""available"" but also ""due"" on the day you attempted it. So on one hand you were told the exam had been postponed, but on the other hand you were told that it was still due on the original date. How were you supposed to know which to believe? Why didn't the professor just change the due date in Canvas?
* You said ""if we‚Äôre going through something tell your professors"" but really you should tell the Student Advocacy Center (SAC) and let them tell your professors. If you reach out to them and let them know you are going through a tough time they will contact your professors and request that they accommodate you. I hear a lot of excuses from students and can't just take everyone at their word, but if they connect with university resources and I hear from SAC I will accommodate them every time. Even though you've already talked with the professor directly you should still go to SAC. You can just pop in at https://advocacy.osu.edu/connect-with-us/zoom-ins
* SAC also helps with disagreements with instructors, so besides just generally asking your instructors to accommodate you, SAC can also help advise you what to do in this particular situation. They may even reach out to your professor directly.
* I will echo some of the other comments about professors going through their own challenges. Your professor probably never used Canvas quizzes before the pandemic, and she is still trying to figure things out. She messed up and is now faced with this situation where you have seen the exam and it will be impossible to keep things fair between you and the other students in the class. This means more work for her, and she is already completely swamped. That said, she should stay professional, acknowledge that she made a mistake, and work with you to find an equitable solution. Berating you is unprofessional and unproductive.

I don't know if any of this was helpful, but I hope you're able to work it out with your professor. Good luck!",1632538767,28,0

The rule of thumb OSU gives is double the credit hours and that how much time outside you should spend on it, but chem is a whole different animal with labs. My the best way I can recommend is try to study master 1 core concept every 2-3 days. How long is up to you, but you should feel confident about it when you think.

2. Book is good for learning concepts and theory, practice problems are good for math/application. Instead of approaching problems that require application as just a problem, think conceptually what they are trying to ask.

Not employers, nor employees literally nobody gives a shit so there is absolutely no point unless you are taking your second major just for fun. In either case you are fine.

"The credit hours difference at CSCC is a complete scam. They did not cover any additional material to what OSU offers. You will see all of CSCCs 2000 level math courses are 1 hour more than OSU, 2366 is the exception (it is 3). The reason is because instructors get paid by the credit hour and the instructors want more money for teaching 2000 level courses compared to remedial level courses. However, CSCC will not offer pay differences in course levels. So to get around this, since instructors are paid by the number of hours they teach, they simply increased the number of credits the courses are.

There are so many issues here. First, students pay by the credit hour, so they are paying more for no additional material. Second, there are definitely implications around giving ""free"" credit for no additional work.

Take a look at the course syllabi/learning outcomes. OSU and CSCC are absolutely identical, down to the section numbers. So what is CSCC supposedly doing with the additional 20-25% additional instruction time?",1634607768,3,0

We had to make a study and relate that data to the topic we were writing about. The study could be as complex as you wanted it to be, to the point of experimentation. But I did a survey on SurveyMonkey and that was completely acceptable, and so did much of the class as well. There was no final exam, just turning in the final paper you worked on throughout the semester. Overall, not a bad course.

"My first two years, I had the privilege of attending one of the most prestigious music schools in the country, the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, NY. I studied cello performance and music education, and I was heavily involved in a cappella at the University of Rochester.

At the time COVID broke out, I was getting Cane's with an old friend and I told her about how I loved my school but I had been having a hard time finding a community there and came to realize that I was burnt out the entire time because I wasn't really excited and motivated about the career trajectory that cello performance laid out.

I realized I needed to be at a place where I could explore some of my other interests like conducting and pre-med. It would have been nearly impossible to do that at my music school, so that very day I looked into transferring to OSU (I grew up in Columbus, and I knew that OSU had a great music education and medical program).

I'm now a 4th year at OSU studying cello performance with pre-med. I feel like I have finally found a community here through CRU and my local church (Five14 Church). I've never been happier tbh. I learned a ton while I was in music school and I wouldn't change anything about the experiences I had.

"For CSE majors like me, most of us have already applied, but that's a completely different market compared to you (judging by past posts, I'd assume you are chemistry and neuroscience). Companies are always looking for new grads, always. New grads are fresh and hungry for work. I'd definitely start researching who you want to work for (research, engineering, medical field, grad school might be too late for next year, etc). You definitely should be in the applying process, but everyone's different. Not everyone has the time, and there'll be at least one company that's always hiring; you just got to find it. I'm connected to a handful chem/bio students on LinkedIn, and some of them have already accepted offers for next summer.

Tips:

* The earlier you apply, the better chances
* Apply to as many as you can, even if you don't qualify. Chances are others are doing the same
* Don't be afraid to apply to the top companies in your field, so like the Google-of-chemistry companies idk. It's always nice to get the experience of tougher interviewers
* Don't lie on your resum√©. It's too risky to get it twisted during an interview.

"Hi, current Honors student studying CIS. 

The primary benefit of Honors is that you get priority scheduling. This won‚Äôt be true for your first semester since the rest of us schedule in the spring and you‚Äôll do so in the summer, but after that it rocks. You have great odds of getting the classes you want at the times you want. When your non-honors friends are taking 8 AMs, you‚Äôll love that. 

Other things that will be different: 
-you‚Äôll live in an honors dorm freshman year. There‚Äôs Lincoln (far away from everything, non social), Taylor (North Campus, big tower, not very new, but has AC), and Bradley (South Campus (so prettier scenery), smaller and more social, all new floors and furniture, but no AC). If you couldn‚Äôt tell, I liked Bradley. 
-since you‚Äôre an engineering student, you‚Äôll have to take Fundamentals of Engineering Honors (FEH). It‚Äôs 5 credit hours, a lot of work, but enjoyable content. The final is coding a game. 
-you‚Äôll have the ability to take Honors classes, which cap at 25 students. Taking an Honors Gen Ed is way more enjoyable than the non honors version imo. The professors care more and you get to participate more. 

When it comes to choosing a school, the benefit of honors is that graduating with honors, or even better, with honors distinction (meaning you did a thesis or a capstone project), looks good to employers. It means you kept your GPA up, took more rigorous coursework, and if you did research, have more relevant experience. Other reasons to be a Buckeye are that you‚Äôll have access to the largest living alumni network, be able to participate in literally any activity you could think of, and never be bored, especially on a Friday night.

"I recommend taking the sidewalks on campus. There are some really annoying parts of campus where some sidewalk gaps are wider and slightly raised up, so pay attention. Also, people like to take up the entirety of the sidewalk if no one else is around. Be prepared to shout at the six-person wall ahead of you so they know that you are coming and can move out of the way. People are pretty chill about letting you pass as long as you give them advanced warning.

During busy times you need to be careful. I'd avoid the stretch from 18 Ave Library to Scott Trad when it gets super busy because people like to jut out at weird angles there. Any small opening you thought you could get through could be gone in an instant. I've also had people randomly push me when I am in front of them there so just be aware. It gets less crowded during the cold months. You probably don't need to worry right now.

Take the road on the RPAC hill. If you have small wheels and try to take the sidewalk there is one part near the sewer lids that will wipe you out if you aren't distributing your weight on the board right. I got a lil tipsy one night and decided itd be a great idea to do the rpac hill on the sidewalk. Barely survived. Definitely dont do that lil bit o hill that goes under the red rpac bridge thingy at night unless you have some experience. The rpac hill is terrifying in general.

"I feel the exact same way. Even them talking to me just immediately puts me in a bad mood for awhile. I feel bad because I tend to get short with them and they think I just have an attitude issue haha. They also pay my tuition, so living on campus isn‚Äôt really an option. 
Getting roommates is a really good idea. I think as long as rent isn‚Äôt more than $400 a month, I‚Äôd be able to afford it. I just feel so guilty about it and I‚Äôm afraid of hurting my parents because of how concerned they act everytime I bring it up.

"Hi, thanks for replying. I‚Äôm a junior. 4 semesters left if you count summer. I have about $6000 in savings too, but I don‚Äôt want to drain them. We just passed our 1 year mark and have talked about getting married, but don‚Äôt want to rush things. The issue is that his family are very old-school Christian and don‚Äôt believe until moving in together until after marriage. The rest of his family are a bunch of abusive assholes and his parents are all he has. He doesn‚Äôt want to disappoint them, which I understand. He‚Äôs tried to talk to them about me moving in anyway and they were not on board haha. They made that very clear. It‚Äôs hard because he‚Äôs an adult and can do what he wants, but not having any other family in his life has wreaked havoc on his mental health and I think going against his parents main wish would make it even worse. He was raised Christian too, so be feels some guilt about it.",1640889439,1,0

"&gt;Something that is neglected in that ""92% vaccinated"" assertion is the number of exemptions that are likely not counted. Which is something that we simply don't want to think about or really acknowledge, but that population does number in the thousands, afaik.

Something I posted elsewhere, but we should not forget this, as we will be in classes with a lot of them as well as in other contact situations.",1640889133,1,0

"I sympathize with you. My relationship with my parents has suffered greatly over the years, to the point that, like you, I now resent them and feel nothing but frustration and annoyance. All they have to do is speak to me for me to feel agitated and start to take on a bad attitude with them, though this is with my father more than my mother. These feelings come from years of being suppressed, never being heard, listening to their conflicts all the time, and so much more. So I understand you.

For my first two years, I lived on-campus, and it was amazing. Not because the dorms are really anything special, but just because the people I was living with weren't my parents. Being able to move into my own apartment this year was even better. But the only reason that was possible was because of roommates: two girls that I was roommates and friends with my freshman year and who were happy to let me live with them for the rest of our college career.

The easiest and best way to help with costs is to find roommates, if you are alright with living with other people. If you have any friends you know of, you can talk to them about it. I'm also aware of Facebook groups and probably a GroupMe or two that you could use, though I am not sure what they are since I never needed them. Somebody can reply to this comment and offer some options if they like. But roommates will be your best bet, as they can share the burden on multiple fronts, including rent, utilities, food if they're willing to split the cost, etc. Insurance and individual things will still be on you, but if you've got a couple of roommates to split general expenses, that will take a huge chunk of the burden off of you.

Another option you have is to apply for a [COVID emergency grant](https://sfa.osu.edu/contact-us/consumer-disclosure/COVD-19-aid). I receive this automatically, usually $2000. Your amount may be different. It won't be a whole lotand it likely won't get you through more than two months, but a couple thousand dollars will help you.",1640889031,1,0
How long have you and your boyfriend been together.? And what year are you in? If you and your boyfriend have been together long enough (atleast a year) and you feel safe and comfortable with him I‚Äôd say go live with him and then when you can pay him back later he‚Äôll probably be fine with that also just be willing to help where needed. For my second question if you don‚Äôt have much time left maybe a year or two an apartment might not be so bad just work a lot during the summer,1640888973,1,0

"When did you start feeling symptoms?

CDC guidelines are a little confusing, but it‚Äôs all about symptom onset. Quarantine is also different from isolation. Quarantine is based on exposure, isolation is when you‚Äôve actually tested positive.

For exposure (no positive test yet), the CDC recommends 5 days of quarantine followed by 5 days of wearing a mask. So you can go out and about after 5 days, but need to adhere to wearing a mask for another 5. You should be tested on the 5th day after exposure, not immediately after.

Once you‚Äôve tested positive, it‚Äôs based on symptoms. If you never develop symptoms, isolation is for 5 days and then strict mask adherence for another 5. If you do develop a fever, isolate until it goes away, then wear a mask for 5 days after when you go out.",1640886540,1,0

"I really don‚Äôt see the point in going virtual. Yes omicron is a problem and cause for concern. But we have a highly vaccinated population and can handle this without shutting down. We can do more testing and masks if it‚Äôs deemed necessary. If they did the first week online and nothing beyond that, I‚Äôd deal but I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs sensible at this point.
