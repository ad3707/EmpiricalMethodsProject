Please consider carpooling other students with you, it saves us 3+ parking spaces and you can even make money from it (depending on how you charge your passengers).

So far the biggest challenge is getting the materials, almost every day I've gone to home depot to get more wood, glue, or nails, because I don't want to buy more than I need.

Also I was trying to remove an old ac/heater unit that doesn't work. To do this I had to cut out some hoses underneath the van. Turns out those hoses were still part of the van's ac system and I cut a pressurized line causing me to get a face full of freon, and officially kill my van's ac. (Although the fans were already dead so it did't work anyways) 

It's been tiring but fun and I'm making good progress, I'm confident I'll get it mostly done by my Sep 20th deadline. I hope yall have a good week!",1631416413,1,0

There's something very easy about making friends when you run with people.

Does anyone know who those obnoxious delinquents on north scholars ln are,"I cannot comprehend what could compel a person to cause such a ruckus at such a late hour, but the limits of self-indulgent buffoonry must exceed the capabilities of my imagination. On friday slightly before 11 pm several groups of neer-do-wells congregated on north scholars ln, greatly disturbing the peace and tranquility supposedly afforded to us students during quiet hours as we convalesce from our activities and embark on preparations for the upcoming week. A male section of such pitiful heralds of restlessness and perturbation began to loudly chant ""bts"" repeatedly ad nauseum, as if that was the only function their neural systems were capable of directing. Fortunately, or, as fortunate as this ungodly situation could possibly aspire to become, this particular band of speakers mounted on legs proceeded south and their distasteful chanting faded from earshot. This was the only fortune that bestowed itself upon the victims of their disregard and disrespect, however, as the rest of the group mostly remained in their positions, being as much of a nuisance as they have been. It was impossible to discern the specifics of their incoherent utterances above the intolerable din of their babbling, except when one member yelled loudly, seeming proudly, as if realizing the purpose of his life within one grand announcement: ""i have covid!"" I do not know the purpose or the context of such a hideous commotion, but i am hard-pressed to identify any that would justify the degree of perturbance imparted by this group of deficient delinquents. Unfortunately, i am not in the possession of knowledge as to what actions may be taken to rectify this dilemma, short of joining the commotion myself to implore them to seal their accursed orifices from which sounds issue forth that are of no value to anyone. Thus, i find no recourse besides posting this complaint on this site, in the hopes of it resonating with others who have been similarly disaffected.

TL;DR: bunch of loud people doing stupid things and being generally obnoxious in the middle of the night at seventh and erc honestly just stop please be loud sometime else like during the day

Seriously why are there so many people making noise on the road at all hours of the day can you please at least talk quietly when you go out together

I love the fantasy (The Eragon series is amazing) and horror genres - I'm always looking for someone to get spooked with (Call of Cthulhu/Lovecraft are great!)

I enjoy being social and getting outside, too! I'd love to meet at a caf√© with someone and chat!

Update: How comfortable is too comfortable for roommates to be?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/qac85x/how_comfortable_is_too_comfortable_for_roommates/

Someone shared my post in a Facebook group or something and my roommate saw it lmao

He brought it up today and was honestly super sweet about explaining about being gay and what that means when around straight guys and all of that. I‚Äôve never known any gay people so I was glad to learn.

He explained how him being nude/me being nude doesn‚Äôt play in to him having any attraction to me etc. and asked me if I‚Äôm uncomfortable with anything he‚Äôs done and I told him no I‚Äôm completely fine and comfortable with him.

He asked if I wanted him to stop masturbating when I‚Äôm in the room with him but I told him it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all, and I asked if he cares if I do it when he‚Äôs there and he said no, and that he saw me doing when I first moved in and that‚Äôs why he thought I was okay with it. I just said I don‚Äôt want him doing anything like that when my girlfriend is over and he said of course he would never do that. 

So I guess it‚Äôs fine to be suuuuper comfortable with your roommate lmao. We were both hanging out tonight, naked in our room. I grew up super sheltered so this is a new experience. No guy has ever seen me totally naked before especially not jerking off xD",1634622827,1,0

I practice for hours and hours and hours and I cannot seem to understand anything. I‚Äôm a humanities major and I did not want to transfer out of revelle because I was discouraged to do so by my councilors. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm on track for graduation with a double major except for this damn fucking math requirement. I‚Äôm so scared of failing again for the third time and I can‚Äôt move on to taking the second calculus requirement without passing math 10A, which I cannot do. I‚Äôm so sick and tired with burning myself to a crisp and putting all of my effort into these math classes that I cannot seem to pass. My major classes and other science requirements come easy to me. I‚Äôm a 3.6 student with a 4.0 GPA for both of my majors and other than this requirement I would be able to graduate on time and maybe get into a good grad school. My parents do not know that I am not on track to complete revelle‚Äôs math requirement.

The mayonnaise or whatever they use to make the potato salad was a liquidy, light coating (imagine the gross ketchup water that sometimes sprays out when you forget to shake the bottle, but with mayo instead) that was barely passable as a dressing.

Maybe it is easier for me back home because ‚ÄúI study in America‚Äù - a description that is achievable by only a small threshold of the population. Anyways, what are some tips and things to keep in mind when trying to start a relationship or something more casual with a girl who was born and raised in this country? What are some things that I can or cannot do or say ? What are some things that can help? Sorry for being vague.
Thanks in advance.",1634549135,1,0

Switch Major? Math 109 killing me,"I‚Äôm a transfer math major and 109 is killing me. The first midterm is this week and i‚Äôve been struggling so much with the homework. 

I chose math because it‚Äôs always came natural to me, I breezed through all the calc series and linear algebra and differential equations classes, but proofs are so foreign to me. I‚Äôve been studying my ass off all week and still suck at basic proofs. I can follow along and understand all the steps but doing it from scratch and figuring out where to start is impossible for me. 

Should I switch major? 109 is like the most basic UD math class out there, and i‚Äôm thinking if I can‚Äôt even get through this how will I survive the next 2 years of basically only math classes every quarter.",1634543099,1,0

One of our main goals is to combat food insecurity, so on **Friday, November 5th from 4-8PM**, we're gonna be serving free vegan food at the **Food Cooperative** in the **Old Student Center** (*between Revelle and Muir, across from the Old Gym*)!

There is a suggested $5 donation, which goes towards our Pay it Forward program! This program is a fund that people can use to cover the cost of their meal during our regular serving days (M-F, 1-4PM). 

We *HIGHLY ENCOURAGE* you to **bring your own dish or tupperware!** 

**OUR ALL VEGAN MENU:** pasta with your choice of alfredo or marinara, garlic bread, saut√©ed veggies, and (a limited supply) of plant-based sausages.

I'm eager to look at these problems through a behavioural lens and dive into how we can mitigate privacy exposure via changes in human behaviour (rather than merely tweaking settings across services you use or switching to alternative software platforms).

Ultimately, this may eventuate to the creation of a platform that helps you learn about privacy and security best practices and create a tailored, fine-tuned privacy behaviour framework to meet your privacy goals (i.e. to create privacy-centric habits that endure). However, the format and content of the platform are TBD as this research exercise will quantify the areas of development/curriculum we should prioritise. As a part of this research, I'm keen to hear the perspectives on the following questions from US-based students:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is your personal privacy (in online and offline life) something you regularly think about ? If so, why?
2. Have you considered the potential risks associated with apathy towards the management of your privacy?
3. What is the biggest problem you've experienced while managing your privacy?
4. Why/why would you not consider yourself a privacy-conscious individual?
5. How do you currently manage your personal privacy risk? (or why aren't you?)
6. Do you regularly check in on the exposure of your personal information online? (or why you don't)
7. Are you aware of the extent of the exposure of your personal information online?
8. What are the highest friction (most difficult) steps you've taken towards the management of your privacy? And, what are the highest friction steps you want to take in the future?
9. What actions do you plan to do in the future to mitigate exposure of your personal information online?
10. Do you feel personally confident to assess and mitigate exposure of your personal information online? Or, would you prefer to be assisted in the assessment and mitigation process?

&amp;#x200B;

If you're keen to chat about this, feel free to connect to tell your experiences. Please reach out via PM, and we can talk; or, feel free to comment on your experiences below. Also, let me know if you know anyone else who may be keen to answer these research questions or help out with the platform's development.

Thank you so much!

Rant,"Today felt like a terrible day.. so let's just say this presentation Someone made a kahoot with 7 questions with different GIFs.

Now it would be known that it's anonymous on who named themselves on kahoot, but the kyle rittenhouse gif was in poor taste of that Someone and it wasn't meant for any disrespect. Anyways one of the Presenters decided to call Someone three times  (didn't pick up) and then message them, ""let's talk man. "" and that Presenter also asked, ""what the f is happening?"" and so Someone explained it, yet that Presenter still wanted to call and discuss this with that Someone. "" that Someone was not comfortable to talk as they were frustrated and their mental health was worsening. So that Presenter decided to give unsolicited advice about emailing the professor and apologizing and be honest for Someone's sake cus you don't want her to think you couldn't care less and that makes Someone even more frustrated.

Attendance based grading &amp; OSD absence accommodations,"So basically I got an email from one of my profs for winter quarter saying ‚Äúif you cannot attend every class, don‚Äôt take it‚Äù because the majority of the grade is based on in-class group work. Now I need this class for my major and it would be really very inconvenient to have to take it at a later time (it‚Äôs not offered often and I‚Äôm graduating next year, and it‚Äôs a prerequisite for another required class). I also have OSD accommodations allowing ‚Äúoccasional absences‚Äù. I‚Äôve never had to use this because none of my classes have had mandatory attendance since before covid. I emailed the prof back asking if I could make the class work given these accommodations but got no response yet. I‚Äôm not gonna be missing like half the classes it‚Äôs just that my medical specialists are constantly on months long waitlists so sometimes I have no choice but to schedule procedures during class time. Theoretically my accommodations should protect me from consequences. But what is the prof actually obligated to do? Give me alternative assignments when I miss class?

"For the average international CS major that has a 3.3 GPA, how do you go about getting scholarships?","Hi all!

International student here. I'm thinking of majoring in computer science at UCSD. However, it's expensive to attend for an international student. I'm thinking of applying to some scholarships to help decrease my financial burden while I pursue a rigorous education. I don't think I'm an outstanding student, so I predict that I would only be able to get average grades since there are many smart people around.

Nonetheless, I think I should still try my best to apply to scholarships. I've looked at many resources about scholarships located in the university's website as well as others.

Unfortunately, I'm really overwhelmed by all the information and need some help. Most important to me is that I'm not sure how to effectively and efficiently go about getting scholarships that suit my circumstances.

**Because of this, I would be grateful if there are any international students who are willing to provide an informational interview about getting scholarships more effectively.**",1633574883,1,0

Winter quarter might be my hardest quarter yet,"I dropped Econ 120C in fall and have to retake it again in the winter. Unfortunately that means that I also have to take it 5 classes in winter if I have any hope of graduating by June.

I'm taking 5 econ courses this quarter and that thought alone already makes me tired despite not having done any work yet. Hopefully most of the classes I've picked will be more writing based than mathematics based, but it all depends on the professor. I've read the syllabi for the various courses that were already published on canvas, but I feel drained just reading them. I know all the classes so far will be perfectly doable and that I won't have any problems with them, but the idea of juggling all that course work and keep a tight schedule is not something I look forward to. 

I only have myself to blame for doing so badly on the Fall 2021 Econ 120c midterm that I'd be forced to drop it and thus be stuck in this current predicament. I just want to vent a bit. I'm a transfer and have only been in this school for a year and a half, but I'm already sick of this place. Spring 2021 and Fall 2021 took a lot out of me, especially because I was taking all the required econ courses at the same time during those quarters as well as an advance econ elective in fall. It was incredibly draining and I felt and still feel burnt out by all of it.

If I'm able to pass all my classes this winter, I'd be done with all my econ requirements needed to graduate from the department. After that, all I'd need to do is complete the DEI requirement and I'd be done with all the requirements asked of me from the school. Spring quarter, if all goes well, will be the easiest quarter of my life because I plan on taking only the easiest classes with the easiest professors I can find. I (hopefully) only have 6 months left before graduating and that's what's keeping me going. 

I just need to pass all 5 classes this quarter and persevere.",1640921859,1,0

So Long and Thanks for All the Stress!,"Next week will be my last week being here at UCSD for almost 10 years and it's really surreal. 

In a nutshell, I came here as a student in 2012 and now I've been an Administrative Assistant for the past few years after graduating. I've done a whole lot of growing in this space. I've made some really terrible mistakes that I've had to bunker down and learn from. I watched friends get dropped from the school. I went from being on academic probation to subject to disqualification. And yet, I still made it.

I've made some amazing relationships with people here. I got mentored by some fantastic people (treat those people at RIMAC Sports Facilities NICE you hear?). I went from working two jobs 7 days a week, 7/11 on the weekends and working in janitorial services at RIMAC; to having an administrative (albeit part-time) job as an administrator here on campus. Now I'm moving toward a full-time job in a gaming company and couldn't be happier.

I don't really know who I'm making this post for. Maybe it's for myself, just to vent off some last frustrations, because there's a lot of bullshit that goes on behind closed doors. But I hope that someone, whether it be a current student, staff, or otherwise will know that despite the odds and adverse circumstances, you can make it too. 

This place can be hell. It can be one of the biggest challenges you'll deal with in your life. But you can overcome it, and you'll be even more ready for the next challenge. I have a lot of love for this place in my heart, but sometimes, you know it's just time for you to move on.",1640811870,1,0

Should I report my friends for shoplifting from the student store?,"I'm a freshman and met other really cool freshmen, and now we're a big friend group. I like hanging out with them and think they're nice people, but they steal a lot from the student store. The first time it happened, I was with them and realized that maybe I didn't know my friends well enough. Some just started shoplifting, and others have been doing it for a while. 

I had heard that one person in the friend group got caught for stealing a small thing, but I know that this person has stolen over $500 worth of items. It feels like everyone in this friend group shoplifts, other than this, I like them. I'm not proud of this, but I wanted to fit in so I just ended up doing what everyone else does.

I want to stop and turn myself in, and also pay restitution and any other sanctions. I know this is a serious thing, and that if it's over a certain amount, California makes it a felony. I guess my question is, if I should turn in my friends too. It will be through the anonymous tip form that the UCSD pd has so they won't find out...it just seems shitty to turn them in, and shitty to not. I don't know, any advice would be appreciated.

Is it toxic for me to want to return to my dorm?,"OOS first year from the Midwest here. As most people on this subreddit are likely aware of, the flair up in omicron cases has garnered some caution regarding a return to campus. With that being said, is it toxic for me to want to return to my dorm for mental health reasons in spite of the omicron spike? I've been trying to convince myself that I shouldn't take home cooked meals or being near my family for granted, but I can't stop dreading the feeling of suffocation I'd have from having to take virtual classes in my old, hometown room. 

I don't really mind virtual classes themselves, but I'd at least want to use the dorm I'm paying for in order to have some semblance of autonomy. Plus, the time difference isn't exactly ideal for some of my classes in terms of how late they'll go until. However, a part of me also feels like it's selfish of me to want to return to campus despite the safety hazards that come with it.

"Socializing, a rant-ish :)","So, if you check on my post history, a few days ago I made a post regarding if anyone wanted to hang out over the winter break. It got a good amount of attention, and the instagram GC I made has a good amount of people on it. That being said...

The GC seems to be dead on arrival. There are 20+ members in the group chat, including myself. Yet, it seems that everyone, the moment they joined the gc, they instantly went to turn off notifications for it. There is ZERO interaction and/or involvement. I ask if anyone would be down to do anything, and it gets left on seen by half of the people.

My question now is. Why join a gc that aims to hang out sometime soon, and not even partake in the conversation about hanging out? No ideas, no offers, no opinions, no availability, etc. NOTHING. Just what feels/seems to be sitting on the sideline waiting for, I dont know, SOMETHING to happen I suppose? No one asks if someone wants to hang out somewhere. Go eat something, go to the beach, some place to have fun, etc. Its just baffling if anything else.

This isnt to say that they should be dedicated to the gc 24/7. That would be/is unreasonable from me or anyone for that matter. But my question still remains. If you are not gonna contribute or give ideas or options as to what we can do to hang out and when it could happen, why join the gc? What is the point of saying you want to hang out or do something if youre not even willing to give the slightest of efforts to make that idea come to pass?

Idk. That was all. Just frustrated. I want to hang out and do stuff with people, as my previous post said. But it just feels like everyone is all talk and no actions when it comes to actually meeting up.",1639777871,1,0

How to Fix an Incorrect Grade in Academic History?,"So in academic history for one of my classes, I have a B+ when I should have at least an A. To clarify, the class is graded based on whether you satisfy certain criteria involving completing assignments and scoring well on tests instead of a total class point score. I satisfied all of the class‚Äôs criteria for an A, and I believe that I most likely was erroneously given a B+ in A.H. due to some confusion over my grade on one of the tests. 
So, what is the best and quickest way to get this fixed? I‚Äôve already made a Piazza post to instructors and emailed my professors, but I‚Äôve gotten no response yet and am getting frustrated because I don‚Äôt want to be worrying about this grade over the holidays. Do I just keep waiting? Do I send more messages? Should I contact VAC or someone else? Also, how long after the quarter can profs make changes to grades?

My main concern is will my second report count as a second violation even though I did not get any decision for the first one? I'm really panicking because if by chance, the first AI violation decision comes against me, then am I screwed or the fact that my first AI violation was not proved before the second will be taken account.

I started meds for my depression and anxiety, found it easier to study but I just didn't test well all quarter no matter what and thats what led me to barely pass. Plus, I probably would have done better if I didn't have to start and adjust to my meds during the first weeks of the quarter if my parents would have supported me to start them during summer.

The finals being worth SO much is just a gigantic slap to the face when you had a high homework score all quarter.

I know it's still the grade I earned, just seems like professors have no sympathy for rounding grades up like they used to. If I was a professor and I saw a student missed the cut-off by one question, I'd give them the grade. In the end it could determine whether they get into a good grad school or not so it's painful lol.

My OCD is really bad right now,"

One of the things I want to write in my assignment is that a certain disease is caused by a mutation in a specific gene. Now I remember reading this before. Maybe it was one article or more likely multiple. This isn‚Äôt a new finding and when googling ‚Äúwhat mutation causes the disease I‚Äôm researching‚Äù it is in multiple articles and even on websites. Now I‚Äôm just concerned as to what needs to be cited. Do I just cite the article I‚Äôm looking at now? Or do I try and cite like all the articles I looked at that have it. I looked at Wikipedia and saw this and tried to see the source they used to see if that was the original research but that‚Äôs behind a paywall. Now I‚Äôm nuts like does everything that I talk about in my assignment from these articles need to be cited from all 20 or so other articles since I read through them? I feel like I‚Äôm just way overthinking it but it‚Äôs just stressing me out so much.

- Also I know like review articles list the citation for the articles they found the information from. Does this article need to be cited as well? I know some people do say that it‚Äôs good to read that paper as well but many of the people I talked to said it‚Äôs okay to just cite the article I used and not the original/article they used if I am not reading that as well. 

Thank you",1638813772,1,0
Parking situation during finals week?,"Last time we had in person finals I lived on campus as a freshman. Now as a third year and first in person finals to which I drive myself to campus for I‚Äôm not sure what the parking situation during the week of finals will look like. 
I usually park in gliderport for my classes since they don‚Äôt start till 9:30 and I know I wouldn‚Äôt find parking on campus at that time. 
But since my final is at 8am I was thinking maybe there will be more parking around that time on campus? Anyone have any insight on what the parking situation is on campus during finals week would be very helpful!!! 
Getting to school at 8am is already going to be a mission for me and since I will be lazy that early in the morning I don‚Äôt really want to park at glider for just one final lol.",1638812485,1,0
