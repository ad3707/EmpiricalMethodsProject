Grad Student Worker Sues UCPD For 2020 Picket Line Beating - Support Requested,"Hello all current and fellow UCSC students! 

The student who was violently beaten during the protests at the front of campus last year is suing the UCPD! In an an effort to build the case they are asking that anyone who was there or may have knows someone who was there to come forward with footage of the police officers as well as the attack itself. 

I believe we all received an email in relation to this which has a lot more information as well as links to footage of the event, so you can see if you know anyone who was in the crowd. 

I have no relation to this person or their efforts to build the case but I wanted to share this information somewhere where it may get more attention. If you are interested in this and would like to know more there is plenty of information you can google about the attack and the lawsuit. 

Help our peer get the justice they deserve and help expose violent officers that have no place on any college campus!",1612471204,0,0

We're finally getting a stimulus check!,"[Democrats Plan for Stimulus Checks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/biden-stimulus-checks-what-you-need-to-know/?outputType=amp)

&gt;Adult dependents are eligible for stimulus payments under the Democrats’ current plan, according to multiple people with knowledge of the matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the two prior rounds of stimulus payments, people over age 17 who could be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return — such as college students or disabled adults — were not eligible for any stimulus money. About 13.5 million adult dependents were excluded, according to the People’s Policy Project, a left-leaning think tank.

The Futurist Society," 

Hi everyone! My name is Damian and I'm an engineering student at UC Irvine. I'm creating a club called The Futurist Society and I'm trying to expand it to the other UC campuses.

In this club we'll discuss future technologies like flying cars and reusable rockets, and form a network of students excited for the future! The pandemic is a rough time to do club stuff, so we'll also be prepping a lot for next year!

For now we'll all just be on one Discord, but once we get some momentum going we can create chapters for each school. If technology and futurism interest you, come check us out! [https://discord.gg/5fMtcnW2FD](https://discord.gg/5fMtcnW2FD)",1612403392,12,0

Alternative things to do if Computer Science is not for me,"Hi so this is my 4th year at UCSC (but 5 years in college total).  I transferred from a community college in Fall 2019 as a computer science student but I haven't had the best experience in my learning ability.

I'm currently taking CSE 101 for the second time and at this point I'm not sure I can complete a computer science degree.  There are 3 main points I ranked that I feel can be my next steps if CS does not work out for me:

1. I am really considering other majors as a plan B.  I might still want to remain in the tech industry so I've been thinking about Cognitive Science, I've been thinking about UX / UI/ product design as an option.  I feel like this could be a best option for me since some of my core CS/Math classes also fulfill some Cog Sci classes but I'm worried if the department will let me change my major this late into my college career.
2. Alternatively if I wanted to continue in CS, maybe UCSC wouldn't be the place to do that.  So I was thinking I would transfer myself to a state school in my hometown in the Bay Area where I wouldn't have to pay for housing (once schools open up again) and maybe the material wouldn't be as rigorous.
3. Or worse case, I obtain an easy degree that's fast to complete and obtain a city job in my area.

Keep in mind I really wanted to finish what I started but I'm just not finding much motivation and patience to complete computer science, especially during the pandemic.  Even if I do graduate, I'm expecting the job search and my actual job to be incredibly stressful as well.  If I'm struggling this early in my career, how can I make it once I work?

If anyone has any advice that could help me in my struggles I would really appreciate it.  I'm sorry for the rant, I'm just not in a good mental state as of currently.",1612148592,36,0

2) How is the difficulty and workload of the major in general?

3) How are the opportunities for research, internships, etc?

CSE 183 and CSE 102 workload,I was wondering if anyone has taken CSE183 with Alfaro and can tell me how about how many hours of work a week it is? I am also planning on taking 103 with Bailey so if anyone can also tell me how much work that was in a week. I will also be taking a music GE(not decided which one yet). I plan on working a part time job of about 15-20hrs a week next quarter so I am really trying to plan ahead so I don't get burnt out and slip my grades. Please let me know how hard these classes were if you've taken them and about much work a week was assigned,1611872797,1,0
Buzzfeed Founder and CEO went to UC Santa Cruz,"I know this is so random, but I just found out this was true??

When I was touring UCSC, I kept getting bombarded with ""Susan Wojnicki went to UCSC"", and how she was a big force in tech (which is true), but I never heard anything about this dude!

Just think it's cool seeing innovative slugs doing big things, or should I say ""did big things"" since Buzzfeed is already an established company.",1611855545,1,0

CSE minimum upper div elective workload,"So Im a junior CS major and I need tips for the lowest possible work load while still getting credits for my graduation. I need a low work load not cuz im lazy but I have to start working a part time job (15-20hrs), and im also looking for internships(fingers crossed i find one before next quarter), so I dont want to get burnt out and have my grades slip in critical classes. Ive already satisfied all my GE reqs, so I can't take more of those, as it would be a waste although I could settle to take one for the funsies if it sound cool enough. As of right now I dont want to take any main classes such as 130 or 102, 103, because I know those are gonna be a ton of work to take on. So far I was thinking about 180(Databases), 150(Networking) and 185S(Technical Writing), but I dont personally know anyone who has taken these classes before so I was wonder what you guys think of the work load of these classes or have any suggestions for other easy classes.  Would this be doable w/ a part time job? I have basically no social life(thx to corona) so I think this frees up a bunch of my time.",1611820216,1,0
Is anyone else taking econ upper divs and struggling to learn stata?,"Im taking 104 right now and absolutely struggling to get the homework done because of stata. I feel like one hour a week of Stata instruction in discussion section isn’t enough as TA’s arent exactly equipped to be teaching us programing especially when sections are done through zoom. I feel like if professors are going to be basing such a significant portion of our grade in Stata its unfair for them to have us essentially teaching ourselves. Its so frustrating when even the teachers admit that the point of their class is to learn econometrics and not stata as its just a tool, yet all of the time I should be spending learning the course material I’m spending debugging and combing through stata forum posts from 5 years ago. Is anyone else in the same boat?",1611816658,1,0
cse30 is kicking my ass,"hi so venting here. 

this class is literally making me bust my ass. coding doesn’t come naturally to me and i really hate it when i can’t understand something. the professor is soo harsh when it comes to grading and this has to be my least favorite class in all my three years (trust me ive had some pretty interesting quarters). 

cse20 didn’t prepare me for this much. and ive went to tutoring sessions and with 480 somethin students in the class they can’t do that much. you get three minutes with them so please tell me how someone is supposed to understand something in that short time. 

sooo how the hell do i pass this class. its gonna be week 5, half way through the quarter and this professor is something else, his assignments are something else, im exhausted, and im venting and trying my best so please this is not me complaining just venting.",1611811480,1,0

Looking for Housemates ASAP/Spring Quarter,"Hello, we were looking for housemate(s) asap or spring quarter in a room at our place on Peach Terrace since one of our housemates has a family emergency and cannot stay any longer. The house is a 5 minute walk from campus and currently has a washer and dryer and parking spot if needed.

The room is a master bedroom with a walk-in closet and private bathroom so it would probably be best as a double but, it’s totally up to you. As a double, it would be $737 or more as a single and this is totally negotiable.

A little more about us living there is that there are three of us currently living at our place: two fourth-years Bioinformatics and EEB major and a second-year Robotics major. We’re pretty laid back and chill, usually focusing on our own classes and hangout with each other when we have free time. We are LGBTQ+ and BIPOC friendly and are Covid conscious currently during the pandemic. If you feel like you would be a good fit or had any more questions, feel free to PM me.",1613810530,1,0

Has anyone transferred from UCSC to another UC?,"I’m a first year and I’ve not decided if I would want to transfer yet because I’m still not sure if I want to stay in this major or switch to a major UCSC does not offer.

How did you prepare and what was the experience like?

ALSO I don’t even know if I’d want to transfer to another UC, because I would consider CSUs as well. 

Is UC to 4 year even the way to go? Would UCSC to Community to 4 year be better? I heard credit transfer to community is weird.

Also the original rear rack. All included. I uninstalled them to shed some weight. 

Comes with 1 charging cable.

Chain is cleaned and in good condition. 

Odometer has approx 3500 miles. I have to ride the bike about once a week to keep the battery healthy. So the milage will be slightly higher.

Cosmetically the bike is in okay condition. I have taken a couple of spills on it. Only damages are to the pedals and scuffing on the leather seat. 

Mechanically the bike runs very well. I can cruise around downtown and the beaches and still have plenty of juice to go up the hill and back onto campus. 

Never had any motor or electronic issues. 
Ready to ride. 

I cannot ship this because of shipping restrictions on lithium batteries.

Hybrid system for fall apparently. Thoughts?,"• There will be remote teaching and learning options for fall quarter. We plan to provide options that will allow students to remain fully remote by providing most classes needed for making progress toward degrees remotely. 
• Larger lectures will be remote/online only and discussion sections could be a mix of in-person and remote.
• Instructors will be encouraged to design class sessions for either in-person students or for remote students, but to try not to engage students in both modalities at the same time.
• Some courses could have two offerings, one in-person and one remote/online.
• For in-person courses, we are exploring scenarios for 50 percent classroom occupancy to facilitate social distancing, well-being and COVID mitigation.
• We are exploring scenarios for two-thirds on-campus housing occupancy to facilitate appropriate distancing, well-being, and COVID mitigation. 
• Departments, colleges, and other course-sponsoring units will receive guidance on in-person instruction in the next few weeks.
• Flexibility is key — plans and scenarios may change based on the progress of the pandemic.
Our planning values are flexibility, community well-being, COVID mitigation, and ensuring educational access as we learn to work together in a new environment. Our plans continue to be subject to change due to variable health and safety conditions. We are committed to transparent communication and the prioritization of well-being.",1613593268,1,0

Returning from Leave of Absence,"So, I’m in the middle of a Leave of Absence, and I’m a bit concerned about how I’m supposed to return to UCSC once my Leave of Absence is finished. My LOA is scheduled to end at the beginning of the Fall Quarter, so that would be my first quarter back at school. 
I’ve been looking through information on the UCSC Website and I’m really not clear on what I’m supposed to do. I thought I had to fill out a readmission form so I went to the readmissions page but there it says, “LOA students are automatically reactivated for their approved return term.”
I don’t really understand what this means. What does “automatically reactivated” entail exactly? Upon taking my leave of absence I was instructed to cancel any housing applications I had setup, so I was under the assumption that I don’t have a housing guarantee anymore. Is that true? 
When it comes to enrolling in classes, do I just go to the UCSC portal and enrol in courses like I would have if I’d never taken the LOA? When do I start doing enrolling? Since this would be for the up and coming Fall Quarter, would I start enrolling now or wait until the Summer Quarter is drawing to a close? 

What about UC SHIP? Will my “automatic reactivation” also mean that I’m automatically signed up for UC SHIP like usually happens each quarter? 
And do I have to fill out a readmission form? The Readmission Page seems to think I don’t but I want to be sure. 
Should I contact specific staff or offices to ask about this stuff, and if so, who do I contact?",1614886129,5,0

CSE 107 with CSE 12 and AM 20,"Hi people. Next quarter is almost here, and I am a freshman. I decided that I would take CSE 12 and AM 20 in the first pass and Physics 5B in the second pass, however now that we are in the second pass, Physics 5B still has spots available, but the labs are full.

CSE 107 next quarter is taught by JJ if that helps. Do you think it might be too much?

Also, is it possible that a spot opens up in the Physics 5b Labs?

Lastly, I was also planning on either taking Oceans 1 or Astronomy 1 instead of physics, but both conflict with CSE 12 and AM 20. Are there any easy GEs that are still open? Thank you all for helping.",1614816207,3,0

Long story short - I've lived with my mom and step-dad since 2012 after my biological parents divorced. She won custody of me and the rest of my family that year. She's been a controlling narcissist my entire life (from considering us kids as burdens, not letting anyone in our house for fear OUR rooms would tarnish her image, stalking our social media for if we say anything wrong, being EXTREMELY homophobic to my older sister for being gay, etc etc). I've developed habits from the trauma over the years like I can't listen to loud sound, repetitive noise makes me panic etc. My sister's therapist has gone so far as to call her mentally ill and so has my counselor.

Around 2016 she became an alcoholic that - to put it very plainly - destroyed what was left of our relationship. My step-dad has given up trying to convince her or argue with her bc she always just throws it back in his face and plays the victim so he just let's it all happen. If she wasn't abusive before it was a lot worse after she started drinking. When my family moved I remember finding old stashes of bottles littered around corners of the old house.

I finally cut her off back in June of last year after she went off the deep end to my sister and I. We haven't spoken since, and from what my brothers tell me every drunken rant she has is always about how much she's done for me and how I'm a rotten selfish person for taking advantage of her.

Because I can't get her financial information for FAFSA, I've gone to a couple counselors through CAPS that have helped me talk about my past (AWESOME PEOPLE) as well as get two letters knowing of my situation and can back me up. The reason why I'm asking here is because I'm worried that if I submit this to Financial Aid they're just going to go tell me to go to my biological dad for money instead. 

For those who HAVE applied for independent status, how did it go? is my case good enough? will they just tell me to go to my bio-dad? will I just have to break my silence and ask my mom for her financial info?

Thank you also for reading all this, and replying what experience you have. It really really really means a lot :/

UCSC Dining Hall Employee Complaint,"hey there, i don't know if you guys have encountered this worker in the merrill dining hall, but he seems a bit suspicious. he introduced himself a couple days ago, we talked for like 5-10 mins, just thought he was trying to be nice and what not. next time i went, he was talking about how he has been trying to go to mystery spot and this other place in santa cruz, and i was like ""oh yeah that's cool"", i had no clue what to really say lmao. and then he was like ""yeah, maybe one of these days we can schedule something together, and i just got this ping pong table, you can come play sometime."" i said ""ohh okay, i gotta go see ya."" he's like in his late 30s probably, and it just sounded really weird to me, like i'm not tryna hang out obviously. of course, i see him again today, he brings my food out and he's like ""i've been meaning to talk to you, i called this place and i can get this reservation for ziplining in SC in like 2 weeks, let's plan on it"" and i was just standing there thinking how weird it was. and he asked for my phone number and i was super hesitant and said ""uhhh idk"", and he grabbed my meal ticket and said ""i think your info and stuff is on here.. yeah i'll add you in my phone"" (my full name and phone number is on the ticket) and i was just so shocked. i just grabbed my food and dipped. what the hell do i do about this? i don't really feel that safe and don't wanna go to MY own dining hall, i think imma go to 9/10 the rest of the week.",1615839733,1,0

Advice for helping GPA (got an F first year in calc),"Okay so it's pretty simple, I want to go to law school. My first year I came in as a chem proposed major, and my grades were as follows: quarter 1 = 2 C's &amp; B, quarter 2= B, B, C+, **F!. \[CHANGED MAJORS\]** quarter 3= A,A,A

Fast forward, Fall '20 all A's and I'm poised to get all A's this quarter as well. Obviously that's the goal always moving forward and I know when applying to schools I can write an addendum on what was going on at the time my first year (I had to actually leave school and return so there's a gap but there's obvious improvement in abilities). So I don't mind applying with that transcript, I have no shame in improving as a person and student but that F is just dragging my gpa down and that's a factor I'd like to control if I can. The F was in Math 11A, I did all the work, went to section, got help from others but ultimately I just didn't do well, I flunked the final. I don't know if I should retake it?? Just satisfy my math GE with an easier class? Retake calculus as P/NP? (I've never done that before so idk how it works). If I took calc again as P/NP does the F just go away? or what happens lol. Any advice would be dope. Thanks &lt;3",1615834134,1,0

Psychiatrist/psychologist suggestions?,"Hey everyone! I’ll start off by saying I’m not a slug but I do live in Santa Cruz county. I wouldn’t be posting on here if I hadn’t gone through all my other resources so hopefully someone can help. I’m currently a college student and I’ve always suspected that I have adhd. I was able to get by pre-pandemic but with everything being online, my life has pretty much gone south. My university has no resources for adhd evaluations. I’ve made all the calls I could to their different resource centers and nothing. I’ve tried looking online for any place that does a diagnosis but the only one I could find costs $3,500 which I can’t afford. The rest only helped kids and I’m in my 20’s so that doesn’t help me either. What I’m basically asking is if anyone has struggled with something similar, were you guys able to find a diagnosis place in the area? Preferably one that doesn’t cost $3,500 as I don’t have health insurance.

Debacle Over The Grading Policy In An Unnamed Class,"There has been an issue that many students, including myself, have felt frustrated by in one of my classes.  I will try to stick to the facts when describing it and not disclose any identifiable information about anyone involved.  My hope in sharing this is that people will stand up for what they believe to be right, especially when they see others acting unethically.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Students raised concerns over the Professor’s change to the grading policy.  The Department Chair got caught using an alias to manipulate a post asking for an update about the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

**BACKGROUND**

*January*

* In Lecture 1, the Professor told students to buy access to an online textbook.  The Professor stated that homework would be assigned from the textbook and that the homework would be counted toward final grades.
* In a Piazza post, a Student asked about the percentages that each assignment category would be weighted in the final grade.  The Professor replied that the weights are tentative.

*February*

* In a Piazza post, a Student asked about what category homework assignments from the textbook would be put under.  Neither a student answer nor an instructor answer was ever provided.
* In a Piazza post, a Student asked about whether the homework assignments from the textbook would be part of the final grade.  In response, another Student, who is an instructor-endorsed answerer, stated to expect the homework to be part of the final grade.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE ISSUE**

*March 10 (third-to-last day of instruction of the winter quarter)*

* In a Piazza post, the Professor announced changes to the grading policy.  First, the 2 lowest quiz scores out of a total of 3 quizzes taken would be dropped.  Second, homework assignments from the textbook would not be counted toward grades because some students had issues accessing the textbook.
* 30 comments were posted in the followup discussion section of the post.  One Student suggested to treat homework assignments as extra credit by awarding points to those who completed the homework but not penalizing those who did not completed the homework.  Other students stated their agreement with this proposal, reasoning that money and effort were spent on the textbook and that it was known from the beginning of the quarter to do the homework.
* Another Student expressed concern that a single quiz would have a disproportionate effect on final grades.  Some students agreed with this concern, some disagreed with it and some stated that this concern would be addressed by the proposal to treat the homework as extra credit.
* Another Student suggested to contact the Dean if a majority of students were concerned about the grading policy issue. Some students agreed with this suggestion, worrying that the Professor would dismiss the concerns of students, while other students advised against contacting the Dean before contacting the Professor.
* Later in the day, all 30 followup discussion comments were removed from the post.  (In Piazza, students are not able to delete any of their posts or comments.)
* In a separate Piazza post, a Student expressed support for the proposal to treat the homework as extra credit. 2 other students posted comments expressing agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE UPDATE**

*March 11 (second-to-last day of instruction)*

* In a Piazza post, Student 1 asked for an update as to whether points for the homework assignments would be counted toward final grades.  Student 1 also asked whether to contact the Dean if there was no update.
* A Piazza user, using a name with the initials A.W., changed the post to ask whether anyone knew when the final exam would be.
* Replying to the original question, Student 2 stated that the only update was that all 30 followup discussion comments on the Professor’s March 10 post were removed and then posted screenshots of the comments before they were removed.  Student 2 also requested that the Professor address the concerns of students and expressed dismay that rather than doing so, student concerns were removed.
* Student 1 posted a followup discussion comment expressing confusion as to why their original question had been changed to ask about the final exam.
* Student 2 replied by expressing their concern that the issue was getting swept under the rug.  Student 2 pointed out that the original question could be viewed using Piazza’s question history feature and then posted a screenshot of the original question.  Student 2 also posted a screenshot of the original question at the top of the page, along with a message informing viewers that the question had been changed.
* Student 1 and other students replied in the followup discussion with several more comments.
* The Department Chair, whose initials are not A.W., updated the post to reveal that they were the Piazza user who had previously changed the post to ask about the final exam.  They apologized for doing so, but stated the post’s original question was “not appropriate.”  They stated that it was “trying to intimidate” the Professor “by threatening to write to the Dean.”  They stated that this treatment was driving faculty away from the department and then told students to be respectful.  They apologized again and stated they were greatly frustrated to see the way that the Professor was treated.
* Student 1 updated the post to respond to the Department Chair’s apology, stating that it was never their intent to disrespect or intimidate anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE CONCLUSION**

*March 12 (last day of instruction)*

* In a Piazza post, a Student asked whether the homework assignments would be treated as extra credit and counted toward final grades.  A T.A. replied that the Professor’s policy announced on March 10 would remain the same.  Referring to the March 11 post, the T.A. stated that the Department Chair “joined the Piazza to further address your concern.”",1615781887,1,0

Question Regarding Freshman Housing,"I'm very new to Reddit so I apologize if this has been asked already. I was admitted to UCSC in February and invited to the College Scholars Program soon after.

I have been talking to other admitted students and found someone who I'd be interested in sharing a room with, but they weren't invited to the program for the fall quarter. 

How does the housing process work? Once I commit and get my college affiliation, can I indicate on a form somewhere that I want to share a room with this person even though they're not in the College Scholars program? I'd also appreciate any advice or information about the program from anyone who's been part of it in the past. Thank you!",1617924763,1,0

Lessons from remote operation that we shouldn't forget.,"1. The housing crisis / over priced rent can be optional.

Transfer Admission Concern,Hello! I just accepted the offer to transfer to UCSC this fall 2021 but I'm not doing so well in my courses this semester. So far I dropped physics and am failing o-chem. It's not out of a lack of effort it's more of a mental issue as well as other factors like family/financial problems and all that. I recently went to the doctors to see if I could get help managing my anxiety and stress but I'm afraid it's too late to bring up my o-chem grade. If I drop the class I'll have two Ws on my transcript and I fear that that will look like I'm being lazy or slacking off. Might there be a chance that the offer is rescinded??

A Porter Caves Story,"Today, I visited the Porter Caves. I hadn’t been there since pre-COVID, which is weird because they are a sacred place to me. Now, when I say sacred, I don’t always mean that I have to be silent and still. Some sacred places call for voices, or rumbling feet, or stimming. This cave calls for singing. It makes sense because it echoes, and your voice is a perfect way to make yourself known when there is no light (though I had a flashlight). I wish I knew more cave-specific songs. I only know Secret Tunnel from ATLA, so I sang that. It was fitting because I have taken two lovers into this magical place, and only distance prevents me from bringing a third. As I ventured deeper in, I caught glimpses of the ceiling in my light, and thought how much it resembled the throat of something very old and very slow, like how Coraline felt crawling through that tunnel between the worlds. I remembered a dream of looking down a hole in a block of ice carved by someone I barely had gotten to know and thinking how it resembled a bear’s throat. I came to where the cave opened and briefly leveled out, and then climbed another gentle slope, a hill under a hill, if you will. Then I switched off my flashlight and let myself not see. I couldn’t even see my hand in front of my face, much less the walls around me. I remembered that after a week of darkness like this, my eyes would permanently dilate. Longer than that, and I would go mad, like Gollum. I sang the Song for the Divine Mother of the Universe, which I had learned at camp, to confirm that I was safe. Then I sang Ozi V’zimarat Ya, which tells of G-d’s strength. After all, it was the right time of year for that melody. Deciding a total of three songs was enough, I turned my light back on and started back to daylight. I slipped and caught myself, my hand landing right in a pile of tacky, warmer-than-expected mud. I decided to let it dry on me the way I might with glue after a papier-mâché project. I exited back into the sunlight.",1617841821,1,0

Prospective bio major,"Hi all! I was admitted to UCSC for biological sciences, and I’d love to hear any and all input on the program. Im not planning on being a pre med student, my plans are to shift more into the ecology or microbiology side of things. 


I have a few more questions, though. Are there a lot of lab/research opportunities? Also, is there anything to do around campus? Im not sure how much I’ll like the feel of Santa Cruz, since I like a bigger city feel, but im planning on checking SC out this weekend. Im deciding between sjsu and ucsc at the moment and its been tough trying to figure out what would be better for me. 

I haven’t been too sold on santa cruz since it was more of a safety school, plus it’s a lot more expensive that sjsu, but im trying to look into it a lot more now that admissions decisions came out.",1617752801,1,0

Accuracy of my pro/con list?,"I've been considering the pros and cons of this school.  Potential incoming transfer here.  My heart is set on the school while my head thinks it would be smarter to go to another UC.  

Pros:

\-Redwood Forests and a campus that requires hiking.  The campus would be physically and mentally good for me.

\-Great transfer community.  I know housing is an issue, but I like that Porter/RG are mostly for transfers and help you connect with other people.  I especially appreciate that RG is 23 and older.  STARS seems great too.  

\-(Also my con) Overall ""chill"" school culture.  Probably one of the few UC's that doesn't emphasize stress culture.  

\-Good recruitment from B4 in Accounting

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\-Diversity and food?  Santa Cruz seems to caters mostly to white people.  I'm really going to miss taiwanese tea shops, good sichuan (and other ethnic) food, and ethnic grocery stores.  I've heard the food is not great.  

\-Housing.  Once again, cool that it is guaranteed for the first year but IDK about after that.  I feel like this school and the city is notorious for housing issues.

\-Economics and business do not seem to be the school's strong suit.  While the BME track seems to have plenty of recruitment for accounting, I don't see nearly as much in finance, banking, or consulting as other schools.  I have even heard of some people refer to the econ department as a joke.

\- ""Chill"" School culture.  It's a double edged blade.  I love that y'all don't compete over who got less sleep due to studying.  On the flip side, I've heard that a good chunk of students are unmotivated and/or anti-intellectual.  It's not that I want to be in an uber competetive environment; I just want to find a place where the people around me inspire me to be better/do more and be able to work collaboratively with them.  

&amp;#x200B;

My main other options would be Irvine and SB (fairly confident I got accepted to these), and potentially Berkeley and LA.  Top 3 choices are Berkeley, Irvine, and SC.  I do not know if I can deal with party culture of SB and every friend I've had that transferred to LA was miserable.",1617742121,1,0

Aspiring scientist from Louisiana looking for advice,"I have just received an acceptance letter for UCSC's 9 month post-bachelor research program hosted through their STEM Diversity program. It's basically a junior specialist position doing biomedical research plus some professional development courses and other opportunities on the side. I am seriously considering taking the offer. 

I am from South Louisiana (Yes I'm riding an alligator as I type this) and have traveled the country, but only spent a substantial amount of time in SoCal as far as California goes. It would be amazing if anyone could give me resources or direct advice on how to navigate all the things associated with moving to Santa Cruz and attending (technically working for) the university including housing, transportation, assistance programs, etc. The main reason I qualified for this program is because of my financial hardship so I need to learn how to get out there and survive on a budget.

Minority Life on Campus During Normalcy????,"Hey everyone, How is minority life during normalcy at UCSC? Is there apparent racial tension for any minority students (especially black)? Generally, do you feel like it is a safe, exclusive and friendly environment? Any positive or negative anecdotes? Should I transfer to UCSC from SDSU as a black student?? 

I go to SDSU and am a second year next year. I am not currently on campus, but there is a lot of racial tension, such as people being called monkeys from cars on the street, and segregation due to the very exclusive and big  sorority/frat population. I only spent a mont down there and was warned by black older women to be careful in the area that I live, and felt a bit unsafe being black, but this was also during election time. At home, I am already feeling so many microagressions and actual racism (from professors saying they won't Lynch black people, they just wont hire them, to sorority girls only wanting to talk about BLM wit me and exclude from everything else). I just want to be chill, learn, and be friendly without segregation in the year 2021 :|",1620201805,1,0

i dont want to hear ""well they send you reminders to fill out the waiver"". I shouldnt have to do something to avoid being robbed thousands of dollars. 

If the school requires health insurance for students, thats fine. So just place an enrollment hold until students show they have insurance. But no, instead the school would rather squeeze every last dollar from our pockets no matter how predatory and force a charge of 1000$.

I feel like during COVID and with online zoom courses, I've sort of fallen *way* behind in school and I feel like a lot of other people have lost that motivation as well.

On-campus housing for second years,"Hi! I’m currently a first year and I’ve been home because of covid, I’m hoping to get something on campus for fall 2021. Can second years get either a dorm or an apartment? Or do we have to get an apartment?

Also, I’m affiliated with RCC, and since second years do not get priority housing. I was wondering if I would have a better chance at getting housing if I applied for a double, or if I would have a better chance at getting it if I applied as a triple. Or if I applied for an apartment or a dorm. I have one roommate but we could find another one if a triple would be the best bet. 

Thank you!!",1620056312,1,0

Hold off on classes for now or take advantage of online classes?,"So I'm not the best at making friends and I'm wondering what mindset I should take? I'm thinking about taking summer classes to get ahead but I'm still conflicted, because I want to be able to meet people.

* Hold off on taking a lot of classes right now (especially classes with less people) because it's online and harder to socialize with people, wait for in person classes for a better experience for the class and to meet people

or

* Take advantage of online classes which are easier, take as many as you can so you have more time to chill on campus and more time for outside activities, clubs, hanging out w ppl, etc.

Tips for figuring out housing?,"I’m a first year right now, and I’m pretty confused about my housing situation for fall quarter. They said that campus was opening up with some type of hybrid system as well as reduced capacity (?) for students that will be allowed to house on campus. This brings up the question of it’s any much worth it to head up to Santa Cruz for the following school year than it was this fall quarter. From what I understand the only thing that is changing fall quarter is labs being in person, and labs are the least of my problems (referring to online learning in general). 

Now my next question is that I’m not sure if I should dorm or get an apartment. It seems I’ll have less chance on getting on campus in general with the limited capacity, but I’m not sure if I would rather be dorming than in an apartment. I’ve only been on campus once, and I obviously wasn’t able to dorm this year, so I feel like I missed getting to know campus which was a big part of why I wanted to come to UCSC. My worry is that being in an apartment downtown or something would result in the same, but I do find living in an apartment more appealing than dorming.

Finally, this would be the first time moving away from home and I have no real idea about the process for finding an apartment, rent, etc. I’m not even really sure about the time frame - when should I start looking in the first place?

Your space would come furnished with a large desk (big enough for desktop), thicc captain bed w/ mattress, and a personal closet (only need to bring a desk chair lol). There's direct access to ethernet and our kitchen is pretty solid w/ everything one would need to cook. The apartment complex has an onsite community laundry room, communal bbq pits, and workout equipment. 

We're open to all genders, no prefence here. It's already a mixed gender household. 420 friendly but we ask that you smoke outside the unit (complex is fine with it).

Seeking advice on living in towns outside of Santa Cruz,"So I'm moving from South Louisiana to the Santa Cruz area to be one of UCSC's NIH PREP scholars. After doing a little research on housing in the area I've noticed that it's considerably cheaper to live in the smaller towns surrounding the city. Some of them like Scott's Valley, Bonny Doon, and Felton also seem to be up in the redwoods and away from the commotion. I love the outdoors, but still enjoy frequenting the city so that seems like a good balance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate any info on what it's like to live in these smaller towns and especially what the commute from them to campus is like, as I'll be working on campus about 5 days/week. I imagine it's not as simple as looking up distances on google maps because that won't account for traffic, navigating small curvy mountain roads with lower speed limits, etc. As of now my girlfriend and I will be splitting a car which might get tricky whenever she finds employment.  I plan to get a bike for shorter commutes.

How does CSE 102/103/180 stack up to each other?,"Hey guys,  


Long story short, due to covid I have financial issues and have intentionally dropped from a BA to BS to seriously hasten my graduation. At this point, the focus is for me to just graduate and not work in CS but work with/help my dad. Family business is really struggling with covid and I have no qualms with working there since I kind of am not enjoying CS as much as I thought.  


As I'm currently planning my grad path, I'm looking for lesser workload courses. For example, I took CSE 101 with tantalo and even though his lectures were easy to understand and quizzes were super easy, his assignments took a lot of time. 

If you had to choose 2 classes from 102/103/180 to fulfill the Breadth Elective, which 2 would be the easiest? Take note I'll be taking them remotely and working part time with my dad so I potentially won't be making the TA sessions.   


I've been to the Peer Advisors and I get conflicting reviews about the classes. Some say 180 is super easy whilst one really specified that 180 was heavy lectures AND heavy programming. 103 is also cited as being no programming and easier than 102 but when I dig around this subreddit it seems like 103 is one of the hardest classes in CS! I don't know what to believe at this point and any if not all input is greatly appreciated!!!

A reason why I think on campus housing is better than off campus,"Just something to consider just in case there is another large wave for the pandemic:

If there is another pandemic or some other reason that you have to leave your UCSC housing permanently during the school year, the on campus housing department won’t make you pay for the rest of your lease. For off campus housing, a lot of the time, if you signed the housing contract, you have to pay until when the contract says your lease ends.

On campus housing is really stress free compared to off campus housing because you don’t need to find anyone to sublease and you could potentially save a lot of money.

Another reason on campus housing is good:
-You don’t have separate electricity, internet, water, etc. bills to pay. You just have one single payment that includes everything that can be found on the UCSC website.",1621265896,1,0

Manifest: Local Networking Web Application For UC System,"I wanted to share my formal pitch for a web app I'm working on called Manifest to connect clubs on campus within UCSC and the rest of the UC system:    


* What is the Manifest app? Messaging for local communities. 
* What is the problem it solves? Sharing information between locals quickly and efficiently.
* So what, who cares? It may help to streamline events, activities, and more in real-time within the local area. There are so many steps to joining a club, promoting events, and emailing groups—Manifest was created to unify these activities in a local platform.  
* Demo link: [https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)  

Here are the instructions to install the app on any smartphone home screen by going to the demo URL ([https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)):  

1. Have location services enabled via Privacy &gt; Location Services (on) &gt; Safari Websites (Ask or Allow)  

2. Have location services enabled via General Settings &gt; Safari &gt; Location &gt; Ask/Allow, you can add the app to your home screen via the Safari app on iPhone.  

3. Once added to the home screen, it should work as a native iPhone app.  

4. After location is enabled, here are similar Android instructions to add on home screen:  [https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en)  

5. Note: to enable location on Android, it is required that Google Chrome settings allow for the location to load, and this must be adjusted via Chrome or the default browser. 

The url to access the site and add to home screen is: [https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)  

The main bet behind Manifest is the idea that locals can share contextual information more quickly and efficiently than anywhere else on the web.  Please feel free to further DM any brutal, hypercritical feedbacks.",1621253356,1,0

Need advice on commuting,"I'm only taking 1 course that requires me to be on campus in the fall (a 4 hour lab once a week), but I'm having a really hard time figuring out what I should do about it since I live in Monterey, and the trickiest part is that I don't have my drivers licence and I'm don't know if I could be confident enough to drive the commute by the time classes start (especially considering I'm probably/hopefully going to be working close to full time in the summer). Taking the bus is also out of the question since it looks like it takes about 4 hours each way and I have chronic pain so I don't think I could realistically handle a 12 hour day like that.

Waitlist admit deciding between here and Texas A&amp;M,"Considering they're both large research focused universities, there are a lot of similarities, cost isn't a factor

Texas A&amp;M Pros:    
\- admitted to engineering college which is excellent, and allows me to pursue a engineering major  
\- has an ETAM system where as long as I maintain the pre-req GPA, I can major in any engineering field  
\- seems more conducive to switching majors (I'm in between ChemE/BME and bio)  
\- relatively good academic reputation  
 \- ranked on average around T100 nationally and T200 globally as a STEM research uni  
\- know a few people going here

Cons:  
\- seems to be in a weird location with no major cities around it  
\- location may hurt for intern opportunities  
\- might feel like high school 2.0  
\- weaker in terms of biomedical sciences 

UCSC Pros:    
\- relatively good academic reputation  
\- clean slate  
\- relatively stronger for biology from what I hard  
\- seems to be a happier place  
\- I may resonate more with the students and be happier at UCSC  
\- easier to access intern opps

Cons:  
\- might feel lonely  
\- ranked a bit lower than TAMU on average, but still around T100-150 nationally and T200 globally as a STEM research university  
\- seems super hard to change majors  


I have a few questions: 

Does UCSC have strong pre-med advising? 

Is it as hard as it seems to switch majors at UCSC? Can I ever switch into any engineering major from bio? 

Does UCSC have strong ties with bay area for hiring interns? 

I do not feel like I reached my full potential this application cycle, I only received waitlists at U Dub Seattle and UC San Diego (hard to get off) and rejections from most others except these 2, so I am considering applying as a transfer.

I wish the school would just be upfront about not caring about us,"I transferred here in the fall, knowing full well I was going to get screwed over by an institution that doesn't care about me, since that's just the modern reality of college in America. The UC's response to Covid has essentially been, ""Give us everything like it's normal while we give you nothing. What else can you do, drop out?"". From the very beginning of my time here the school has made it clear their priority is taking our money, not providing a decent education.

We all know this, and knew it going into this year. We are paying full price to not get access to any of the amenities we're paying for, we're getting a substantially worse education from teachers that put in the bare minimum effort to adapting to online classes. We can't socialize, or meet people, and its pretty obvious the average mental health of students is in the trash, but teachers refuse to give any amenities for anything other than serious medical injury. BSOE is actively bragging about not allowing students to take classes P/NP. Meanwhile, I can't get an appointment with my therapist less than a month in advance, since they're so booked up with students struggling to keep going. 

You'd think the school would put extra effort into making classes worthwhile, considering they're literally the only thing we're getting for our money, but after over a year of online school teachers are still unable or refuse to make simple changes to adapt. Some have even refused to allow students to talk in the chat to each other, because why would we want any chance to feel like we're not alone in this. Others refuse to record lectures because they found people who attend live do better. Sure, throw away the most helpful resource, and only benefit of online learning because you discovered that people who skip class do worse. Teachers are putting more effort into accusing students of cheating than they put into actually teaching the material. 

Despite making it abundantly clear with their actions they don't give a shit about us, the school constantly tries to pretend that it does. I'm so sick of hearing ""We're all in this together"" or its dozens of variations from this place. The students have continued to pay extortionate prices for mediocre online classes, and the school... has to work from home? We're not in this together in the slightest. We're the ones taking the entire financial burden of the pandemic, while getting a worse education, and less opportunities. Every positive message they send out is so hollow in the face of how they're treating us. Positive words mean nothing when their actions constantly contradict them.

Now, our social security numbers have been leaked, we're gonna have to worry about identity theft for the rest of our lives, and the school provides credit monitoring for ONE YEAR. Not even til we've graduated, how many students do you think will have their identities stolen while still attending? 

This school has done nothing but screw me over. I was willing to meet it halfway in dealing with the pandemic, but it feels like I've gone 95% of the way, and the school won't shut-up about how great it is for going 5%. None of the decisions made have been about providing anything more than the bare minimum they can get away with while continuing to charge full price. My education isn't important. My mental health isn't important. As far as this school cares my life doesn't matter as long as I keep paying tuition. 

I don't think I can do this anymore. I came here wanting to learn and grow, and instead I've just been repeatedly stepped on. I put in so much time, and effort to get here just for them to spit in my face. I hate this. I'm sick of complaints being met with advice about mental health as if there's something wrong with me for being furious and depressed that my life and money is getting wasted on this. I hate that every option I have is terrible, not because of Covid, but because of this school's greed. I hate this school.",1619134171,1,0

I might have less than 60 credits when transferring. Help,"Hi everyone
I’m hoping anyone will have insight on this issue.
So basically I’m a dumb ass and it came to my attention through an email from general UC admissions that I’m missing two semester units from the 60 required to transfer. It’s a long story why this happened- my school took forever to evaluate my transcript from my past cc, and a couple of classes that my counselors thought would transfer didn’t. In the email, they said to attach proof that I can complete the classes by the summer and they’ll “reconsider my application”. So, I did that, and felt a bit relieved. I was accepted to UCSC (my number one choice), and i was looking through their admission contract and it strictly says: you have to have the 60 completed before spring 2021.
I am absolutely devastated. Maybe I’m overreacting but I’ve been crying all day. It’s too late for me to call the admissions office right now, which I know is the obvious thing to do. But does anyone know if they are truly that strict on this rule, especially if I was already admitted? I’m just panicking so hard right now and i feel like a complete idiot.",1619048701,1,0

Would anyone be interested in unofficial free tours by a knowledgeable alumni?,"Hey guys! I was on campus today for 420 and made friends with a couple soon-to-be transfer students. (It’s also the first time I’ve made new friends in over a year, this hella privileged fully vaccinated life is glorious man). I graduated a few years ago but I really, really love UCSC and also have a really big knowledge of things like hidden spots on campus and fun historical facts about the school (Kresge seceded from the school like 2 or 3 yikes, yes it’s as dumb as it sounds. Also Kresge used to have hot tubs, those got shut down for the most expected reason) as well as a lot of knowledge on how stuff like financial aid and the disability resource center work. I realized from meeting the transfer students today that no one is able to get tours of campus right now because of Covid, which makes sense. Covid is not transmitting outdoors (unless you’re like right in someone’s face without a mask for extended periods), people are 18 times more likely to get it inside. Also now vaccinations are open to everyone over 16, though of course now everyone has had a chance to get dose 1. I was thinking if I required everyone to have dose 1 and wear masks I could maybe show people around campus once a week on Saturdays or Sundays or something? I need to be super clear this is not officially with the school, in fact I’m pretty certain if I at all act like it is they’ll sue me. 

I think I’d want to do two different kinds- one where parents could come along and one where they couldn’t, as I super understand parents wanting to see the school they’re about to spend a lot of money. But with parents there I can’t say shit like, “So this is Porter college, it’s originally the artsy hippie druggie college and now is mostly transfer students who just turned 21 and are delighted to legally drink. When First Rain happens and everyone runs naked through the school it starts here. The reason that there’s a plate that says in memorium of a koi fish is because there was an MTV reality show in the early 2000’s about frats that had an episode on campus, which is fairly hilarious considering we BARELY have a Greek scene. They captured and fried one of the koi on camera, so they were SUPER expelled because koi live longer lives than humans.” And that’s the shit I want to tell people lol.",1618981788,1,0

Games &amp; Playable Media M.S. or Computer Science M.S. or ...?,"Hello slugs! New post, new issue.

I'm a third year AGPM major minoring in CS and it's about that time of my undergrad where I should probably be thinking about grad school, gap years, jobs, internships yada yada you name it. I'm REALLLLY insecure about this because of a number of factors so here goes.

I LOVE making games and I have a couple games on Roblox that I've scripted and one of those has done pretty well for me financially. I've been leading my own game-dev team for these games for a couple years now. Additionally, I've gotten a couple job offers from other Roblox dev groups that offer WAY more than what I'm even making with my own games. On top of that, my experience is really solid (I think) when it comes to working on the Roblox platform that I see myself as a really solid candidate for other job offers in that area. I know my own games won't be able to financially support me 100% forever, and I know eventually I'll have to go out and find work one day.

I've tutored for Tantalo's 101 class for 3 straight quarters now, been offered tutor positions in CSE 160, CSE 111 etc you name it. I've been into computer science my entire life and I've always wanted to focus in software design or really just coding anything. I've learned so many tricks with web dev, graphics, file structures and command shells to help streamline my game development, and I LOVE tinkering these with small ideas and concepts. 

As it sits right now I have a 3.89 GPA, on track to graduate Spring 2022, and I want to figure out what I should do after that. Haven't had any internships, but with my experience in my own team/company I've say that's pretty solid? Still haven't done the 170 series either so that'll add to that.

Which brings me to final questions:  
1. Is getting a B.A. in AGPM (w/ the CS minor) ""enough"" to be good for the industry?   
2. Am I good where I'm already at? What are some reasons I should go to the GPM M.S.?  
3. Should I take a gap year and scout things out?  
4. Is the CS MS more attractive in case I don't want to do game dev?  
5. Should I even bother going to grad school?  
6. For those who ARE in/considering grad school, what has your thought process been and why?  
7. Say I do choose to do grad school, is the GRE still relevant? what am I going up against?

Should I be listing a different major to get past job/intern requirements?,"As a robotics engineering student, I'm wondering if part of the reason I'm getting zero responses from companies is that I'm not even making it past their ATS (applicant tracking system). I've done everything else I can do to make my resume ATS friendly, so I figure that bc Robotics isn't a really common major and I wind up checking ""other"" a lot, the system automatically discards my application. 

Should I just be checking EE, CE, and/or CS to try and get my foot in the door; or is that a technicality that will eventually get my application disqualified when I interview with a real person?

I've got average grades and do academic extra curricular stuff, so I figure at least one company out of the 50+ I've applied to would have at least done a follow-up. Has anyone else with an uncommon major experienced anything similar?",1611624200,1,0
Open Recent Grad Positions at Google Robotics,"Hey Slugs!  


I'm a UCSC alumnus circa 2018 and Mechatronics Engineer on contract at Robotics @ Google . We're growing our team of contractors to support a number of research collaborations with various AI research groups at Google, and we're on the lookout for a handful of recent graduates skilled in mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. If you loved Mechatronics at UCSC, you're the kind of engineer we're looking for- although that class is not strictly necessary, it does encompass a number of skills that we need. We've found good folks coming from the CE and RE departments (including myself), but what it says on your degree is less important than the skills you're able to bring to the table, so don't be shy about applying. No prior work experience is necessary, but is desirable.   


The positions we're looking to fill are entry-level contracting positions, specifically as robot operators, but you'll have plenty of opportunities to work on a number of projects. Although they're contractor positions, they're well paid, include benefits, and we get free doordash every work day- and the famous free Google cafes once they reopen post-covid.  


If you're interested in applying just send me a DM, and I'll give you my work email to send your resume to. I know you CE/RE folks are out there, help me show that posting on Reddit about jobs wasn't a terrible idea!

Honestly, the issues UCSC is facing now as it careens down the rankings are likely all due to her record of poor leadership that was on full display at UCR during the time I saw her.

Don't get me wrong though, I think it's definitely a positive for UCR that she's not here anymore (probably a reason why we've been doing better ranking and perception wise), but I didn't want that to come at the expense of you guys :/",1611372835,1,0

I know the issues of enrollment, housing and such are a problem at most schools, but aside from those I was wondering if this is a valid rating of the CS program?

Off-campus landlord doesn't fix anything...,"I really need some advice about my off-campus living situation if anyone could spare the time.

Tldr: landlord takes ages to fix things if at all and I don't know what I can do that's within my legal power. What should I be more stern with demanding? Are they breaking any laws here?

I'm living with a few housemates off-campus this year. Our landlord doesn't bother us which is nice but they also do little to nothing with helping fix things around the house which I believe should be their responsibility. Some examples:

The house was advertised as having a dishwasher and I saw it when I toured the house. But we quickly found out that the dishwasher doesn't work at all. It's been 4 months since we let them know and we still don't have a functioning dishwasher.

Also, our oven cooling fan suddenly stopped working a bit after we moved in. It took them at least 1-2 months to get a replacement part, we had no oven for that entire time.

Just today, the dryer (that was advertised as coming with the house when I toured) stopped working as well. It was already a piece of garbage but at least it dried our clothes (after letting it run 3 cycles). I told the landlord, she hasn't responded yet. Based on the previous experiences I just listed though, I fear she'll take ages to fix it if she even fixes it at all.

I've tried being somewhat pushy but I feel like it might be more helpful if I had a better understanding of my rights as a tenant, etc. Any advice?",1611268396,1,0

I just needed a place to vent, so bare with me. 

I’m currently a senior in the Chemistry BS - Biochemistry concentration program. To fulfill our comprehensive and DC requirements, we need to take BIOC 110L in the spring of our senior year to graduate. Unlike normal Chem BS and BMB majors, we don’t have a choice on what lab we want to take to satisfy this requirement. I emailed my advisor asking what the status of the class is for next quarter, and I was told it wasn’t being offered. At least the other Chem and BMB majors have labs that will be offered next quarter remotely.

I honestly have no idea what to do now.  I’ve already been accepted to grad school, but if I can’t get that class and graduate, then I’m completely out of luck. COVID has ruined yet another thing.
