"When do you find ""your people""?","So, I'm a freshman here at NEU and luckily I was able to meet a lot of people and make a lot of friends last semester. But now that it's second semester, I'm already starting to realize that a lot of the people I met last semester aren't necessarily people I want to continue to be friends with. To no fault of their own, of course, I just kind of feel like we aren't necessarily compatible as long-term friends. COVID isn't helping this, either. 

The issue is...well, no one wants to be lonely, especially now. If I start to slowly phase away from the friends I made last semester in search of new ones, I'm worried that I'm going to have a period where I just don't have any friends at all. I'm an incredibly social person; besides sleeping, I'm never in my room and constantly either at curry or the library and always with people, so I would feel very lonely and sad if this were the case. 

I guess maybe a part of it too is that we're confined to one building, our dorms, so I've been spending all of my time with the same people, which can also get frustrating. A part of me does think maybe I just need to take more time to myself, but when I'm by myself...I feel lonely. 

I don't know. Do any other freshmen feel like they just haven't found their people yet? And any upperclassmen, even in a normal year...how long does it take?",1611611523,1,0

Concerns About NU,"Hey guys,

So I applied ED to Northeastern, and looking back on that decision after being accepted, I’m not sure about how I feel. For some reason, I feel as if I underestimated myself, and I’m insecure about Northeastern’s so-called “prestige.” I know this is probably a stupid thing to care about, but I can’t stop thinking about the what-if scenario of possibly having gotten into a “better” school.

I’m going to NU for a humanities major, and although the co-op aspect was really appealing to me when I applied, I realize now that I’d really like to go somewhere that gives me a truly intellectual experience. I’m just worried that NU has too large a focus on co-ops and career opportunities, and that I’ll be left feeling like I haven’t gotten a rigorous education. I’m planning on going to grad school, and would really like to get into some top tier programs, but am not sure how NU looks on grad school apps.

Plus, it seems like the social aspects of NU are kind of lacking. I can deal with not seeing friends for 6 months, but it seems like there’s a generally pretty competitive atmosphere. 

As of right now, I’m not really an NU student so I’m waiting until I’m actually taking classes there to make a final judgement. For the people who are currently attending NU, do you think my concerns have any merit? I’d specifically really like some insight from students majoring in humanities.

TLDR: Accepted ED but concerned about NU’s prestige, social life, + academics (when it comes to humanities specifically).",1611581716,1,0

College decision pros and cons please help,"So I recently heard back from some schools and currently my two personal top choices are RPI and Northeastern. I was wondering if people could share some thoughts on what you think of RPI vs Northeastern? The cost of both schools is basically equal after aid for me so that would not make a difference.

I am going to study civil engineering and am female. Also I have a sibling who attended RPI and loved it. Also at the moment I don't think I would study abroad, if that makes any difference.

Here's some of my ideas so far:

**RPI:**

* I heard a lot about the ratio of male to female being less than ideal, but personally I don't think I would be bothered too much by it. 
   * I also have been looking into the women mentor program at RPI which seems pretty cool
* From what I've seen it's ranked above NEU in civil engineering
* Location: I've also heard mixed things about RPI's location

**NEU:**

* Not a fan of the location. I think I would be fine in the city location but I think I'd rather have a more centralized campus/less built into the city
* Co-op: Where do I even begin with co-op? Something I've noticed at every webinar I've attended for this school is that when current students are asked why they chose NEU or what is something they like about the school, they have 2 answers: co-op or the location. I understand how important getting experience is and the advantages of it, but I don't think the presence or absence of a co-op program would sway me too tremendously
* I've heard they have lots of good professors
   * I do feel like at every school there are bound to be some good/great/not-so-great professors so this might just be irrelevant

The information I've gotten is from endless amounts of webinars, reading past reddit posts of students making similar decisions, and talking with a couple of students. I was only able to tour one school (not NEU or RPI) during covid since almost every place is closed to tours, but from that school, I really liked the traditional campus feel where there was just buildings, some green space, and then if you walked off campus there were more things like restaurant/stores/etc.

Thank you so much! Any thoughts or ideas are appreciated

is northeastern fun? can you get the traditional american college experience here?,"I was accepted into the NU IN program about a month ago and have previously visited Northeastern! I am graduating this year and will be an incoming freshman in August/September. Out of all of the schools that I've been accepted to thus far it seems as if Northeastern is the strongest academically and works really well to set you up for a great career.

However, one thing that I am really looking for is that traditional college experience where there are lots of opportunities to have fun! It's not my biggest priority, but I don't want to be up to my neck in student loans for a place I don't truly enjoy. I went to a wannabe prestigious public school and felt so jaded by the end of it, so I definitely want a fresh start.

I heard there are some awesome hockey games for the students to enjoy as well as several clubs. In a non-COVID world are parties common? Also is it easy to make friends there? I'm really hoping to come out of my shell a bit.

Sad about classes and coop,"Hey everyone. I know I’m not the first person on here right now talking about already being burnt out but I just needed to say it somewhere. 

It’s only the fourth week of classes and I am already so tired. I’m so burnt out, I’ve already cried about my classes multiple times, and I never feel like I’m caught up in anything. I knew this semester was going to be tough for me, but god, I didn’t realize how bad. Maybe it’s cause I didn’t fully consider what it would be like without spring break and how much that mental break relieved me.

One of my classes gives two homeworks a week that are supposed to be part A and part b, and somewhat small. They never are. They’ve taken my partner and I still hours, and just when you’re done with one, the next one is due in three days and have to continue. I never feel like I have any form of a break. 

And coops. Last year I got so lucky that I got a coop pretty quick and they didn’t cancel their coops when COVID hit. I loved the company but not the role (data analytics) that I did and wanted to try something else that I could do with a CE/CS degree for this coop cycle. And so far, nothing. I’ve applied to every single one that I’m even remotely interested in, and am doing that daily almost. I had one interview that I thought went really well and got rejected. I haven’t heard anything since and I’m worried that since my previous coop was in a different “area” I won’t be able to get a more software based or embedded role. 

I’m just already so tired and there is so much more to do in this semester. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to say it somewhere. Any thoughts or anyone’s personal experience is welcome. Sending good thoughts and luck to all my fellow students. Hope you all are doing okay!",1613677288,1,0

Anyone else weirded out by this?  It feels wrong to me for the university to be pushing /all/ of us to pursue any option to get the vaccine.  Probably 90% of the people who got that email are healthy young adults who can probably get by using basic hygiene practices to let those vaccines go to far more impacted communities.  For those who need the vaccine immediately due to medical conditions or age it absolutely makes sense, but it feels wrong for them to push us all out to take vaccine doses from other communities in Boston which have suffered through COVID far more than the NU community has.

Petition for the university to give us some days off,"I used to use Spring Break to avoid burnout.  Me and a lot of my friends (and a lot of people on this sub) are already getting burnout.  We have 12 weeks left and only one day off other than weekends.  I think the university should give us 1-2 days off sometime between now and Patriot's Day just to keep students functional.

A lot of other schools have mental health days or other measures to help students.  Yeah, this might fuck up what professors have planned, but I think maybe even telling professors ""hey, we're gonna basically give students a weekend off where spring break would be, don't make hw due until later the next week"" would be huge.

Club positions,"Hi I just came here for some general advice. I’m currently a freshman who is on the board of a pretty popular club and while I want to try out for next year’s board, the only position that I think I would have a chance at and could do really well is super competitive because someone else on the board (who has accomplished a lot within the club and is a natural leader) is also running and I know for a fact they would get it over me. I would love to be elected again for next year, but I just haven’t contributed a lot to this club this past year because I was adjusting, but also because my position doesn’t exactly have a lot of duties.
I just want to know if it’s okay not to have a board position on a club(?) if that makes sense. I know co-op employers like to factor in what you do outside of your major (I am currently CS &amp; neuro) and especially for stem, I feel like if I don’t have anything else, especially when I don’t have any jobs or side projects, it would put me at a disadvantage.

Advice for a potential transfer?,"Hi everyone -- I'm a current business student at Ohio State and looking for advice from anyone who can provide any!

I applied and was accepted to NEU during my initial college search (two years ago) but ended up not going as I opted for going to my state university where i knew more people, was closer to home, etc. However, I've recently started to have some pretty big regrets about that given I don't feel very academically challenged and don't particularly resonate with the culture here. 

I'm finishing my second year at OSU currently but if I transfer I'd plan on staying for three years (so 5 years total in undergrad). I guess I'm looking for any advice from either people who have transferred into the business school, transferred after 2 years at another institution, or have any other input. Particularly if it's easy to get involved, make friends,  succeed academically, or generally integrate as a transfer. 

Note that money isn't a particular issue as I've saved a bit by going to my state school for two years, so I'm willing to compromise on spending more for a better college experience/better professional opportunities. Thanks everyone!",1614884536,7,0

Additionally, you will need to be available late March/early April for onboarding and training. Interviews, on-boarding, and training are all to occur remotely, facilitated by our CXTs and the occasional full-time staff.

"nother burnout post, sorry","I have not gotten more that 3 hours of sleep every fucking day for the past 3 fucking weeks. my eyes are so fucking red that 2 of my proffessors asked if I was high. my bloodstream is probably 90% caffeine at this point man.

I stay up until 4:30 am to study and have to wake up at 6:30 each day to take notes on the textbook before classes. yesterday my computer ran out of power when I was almost done on a fourteen page paper so I had to stay up all night rewriting it. The only rest i get is when I black out for 30 seconds from having not slept. one of my friends passed away last week and I couldn't even go back home to see her family. I feel like such a fucking dick. I haven't even had time to call my own family man so i feel like such a frecking asshole. I have literally contemplated jumping our of my fucking window on multiple occasions but stopped myself cuz my job doesn't pay enough for me to have a funeral. my roommate asked if i wanted to go skiing last weekend at the fucking concept of me having fun seemed so frecking foreign. honestly fuck,fuck,fuck fuck northeastern, right now I  Would Love to BU.",1614711719,1,0

Has anyone gotten in trouble for not testing every three days?,"So I just got an email asking me to change my in-person status because I live in a zip code surrounding campus.

I get that Northeastern is doing this for safety (and because that's code for legally covering their own a\*\*).

Personally, I find the notion of testing every three days because of my zip code a little ridiculous because I'm outside the norm of undergrad - I'm almost 30. I've lived in this neighborhood for ten years; not because of campus but because it's my home. I'm not hanging out with other college kids; if I was I might as well just be that ""hello fellow kids"" Steve Buschemi meme - it would be weird. I'm also in a high-risk household, so the most dangerous thing I'm doing as an old, remote student, is coming to campus to get tested.

I wrote them an e-mail to clarify but I'm wondering if anyone has had any actual repercussions for not testing every three days? I'm fully prepared to modify if I need to but quite frankly in my case, I think taking an hour out of my day every three days to walk to campus and get tested when getting tested itself is the most dangerous activity I'm doing, is bull\*\*\*\*; so I'm trying to avoid it if possible.",1615997489,2,0

I want to withdraw from a class so badly but I’m scared to,"So background context, I’m a second year and a combined English and Graphic Design major. This semester I’m taking a class that merges literature and technology. At the time I didn’t think much of the course description stating that mix, so I didn’t think it would be a big deal.

Well, I was wrong. In the first week we started using a program called Oxygen, and I fucking hated right off the bat the encoding I saw would be happening. I began to get nervous for the class, but I told myself I shouldn’t be a wuss about it and that I could commit to it and shouldn’t sell myself short.

The first half of the semester we focused on using more of that TEI program. Mind you, I am not at all involved in the computer science field, so this was especially a pain in the ass. We had to encode an entire document, and I would get frustrated when I got so many errors (I don’t know how you computer science people do it, I hate anything with just one linear answer) but I finally finished that stupid project, barely. I still have yet to receive a grade in it.

The second project now is more difficult. It’s more heavy on data, and again I’m confronted with tech gibberish. They walk us through the stuff, but it doesn’t change that it’s hard for me to process and understand. And the first half is already due at the end of this week, and the second half talks about how we’ll be using word2vec and programming language R and let me tell you, those terms are a nightmare to a writing major. 

I’ve been feeling that burnout that I know everybody has been feeling now, and I’ve just been stressed overall and this course honestly isn’t helping, on top of applying for co-ops and the stuff my other courses are demanding. I’ve spoke to my advisor about dropping the course, because I want to graduate ASAP and I would hate if this hindered me, and they said I could always do a course in the summer to make up for it and still graduate in that timeline, and that there are other courses I could take that’ll fulfill the requirements I need. So that’s helping me consider this more , but who even knows if I’ll be faced with a situation like this in the future.

All I know is I’m sitting in my room right now, staring down this upcoming project and hating it the more I read it.

TLDR: I’m not good at computer science stuff and I’m stuck in a course that involves a good amount of it, I want to withdraw but I’m worried of how it’ll affect me in the long run.",1615942079,1,0

Covid Test Scheduler - Real or fake?,"Hello,

My story begins with trying to get a covid test so I can return to campus (living off-campus).

I see that I am ""exempt"" from covid testing.

Not sure why I was given this status, so I call the hotline at the bottom of the testing FAQs.

Covid Testing hotline said I was given this status for 90days due to my positive test.

I have never tested positive for COVID.

NU staff figures out that someone with the same name at NU (first and last) had tested positive and gave me the ""exempt"" status by accident.

All cool - they say the staus should be removed in the next 2 days (But I want a test today)

So I ask the COVID hotline if I can go get a test today since I haven't been able to for 2 weeks.

They said to go and try to get a test and explain what happened with the exemption.

I go to Cabot ready to run my mouth since I couldn't make a test appointment. 

Get through person #1 with daily wellness check, no comment

Person #2 who takes NUID, also no comment

I'm now in line to get a test with my printed barcode.

Never had to explain that I didn't make an appointment with anyone in Cabot.

Makes me wonder, do I even need an appointment to get a test?",1612806485,1,0

So many issues with how Marino handles the Zones too.

Can we also have a penalty system for those that book an appointment and never show or cancel literally 5 minutes prior to the booking?

CAMD Double Major/ Media and Screen Studies Question,"
Hello! I actually just transferred into Khoury and I’m majoring in Data Science. 

But I’ve been really interested in possibly pursuing a double major or simultaneously getting a second degree in Media and Screen Studies from CAMD. I’m not 100% sure this is what I want to do because I have zero experience in the field whatsoever. So what I really wanted to do was take a couple of classes in the Media and Screen Studies major that could also count as NU Path requirements. However, I have found that a lot of the courses require me to be in the Media and Screen Studies major. Does anyone know of a course that could help me get a feel for the major that doesn’t require me to be in the major in order to take it? 

I was also wondering what the process would be like if I was to apply for a double major in Media and Screen Studies. How exactly would I go about applying in the first place? Any advice?

Any guidance whatsoever would be greatly appreciated!",1612307326,2,0

MechE to CS?,"I'm a first year MechE student as of now and am contemplating switching to CS. I've just been getting more and more bored of my physics classes, even though I do well in them.

I cant attend NEU,"I just want to cry about not being able to attend NEU because of my family’s financial situation. I really want to go to Northeastern, especially after getting accepted into the NU in program and getting a dean’s scholarship. However, even with the scholarship, the school is still super expensive. I’m personally willing to take on the debt but my parents won’t even agree to co-signing loans if I go to a school that amounts to more than 50k a year. 
My family’s financial situation has changed since the year that is required for the IDOC forms and I’ve filed an appeal but I haven’t heard back from them yet. Even so, I don’t expect to get much money at all after looking at the original financial aid package. I’m so sad that I can’t attend. It’s in Boston and I really wanted to be a part of the co-op program and start networking. 
I’m going to have to attend UMass Amherst at this point. I just really wished that I’d be able to go to NEU. Just wanted to express that. Maybe I can attend for my masters degree. Wish the best for all current and prospective students :)",1619159130,1,0

Officially a Husky!!," OK, THIS IS CRAZY. I applied to Northeastern, SJSU, and UNCC on a whim thinking I wouldn't make it but still wanted to shoot my shot. It was pretty nerve-wracking to wait and my credentials were not up there at all but I still made it to Northeastern University for this fall where I will be studying my Masters in Bioinformatics.

Now that I got in, I'm concerned about the coursework. I have a few doubts:

1. How do I prepare for the coursework over the next few months?
2. What is the co-op program like? Is it classes one semester and then co-op the next? Is it co-op during the day and classes in the evenings? How does this system work?
3. I took the Omics concentration. Will I be able to change that if I'm not feeling it?

I saw Aoun in Wollaston's one time.,"I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly. Weird encounter, I think the stress is finally getting to him.",1617988737,1,0

it probably just stems from insecurity and ik that, but i just don't know how to deal with it. i'm worried it's gonna be even worse in the fall when covid is a lot better bc there will be so many parties and everything and i'll feel bad about myself if i don't go to them/i'm not out doing things all the time. does anyone have any advice or has anyone struggled with the same thing? idk what to do",1617925377,1,0

1. Does the Northeastern Promise serve as a renewable grant for all 4 years? 

2. Does the grant money shrink if you decide to go on a paid co-op/work a part time job? 

3. Would grant money also shrink if you are taking classes in the summer?

4. If you decide to live off campus, would the promise grant money shrink?

decrease in income? I plan to appeal the package I have been awarded due to the fact that there   
was a major loss in my family's income during 2020.

Northeastern v SCU for CS (and possibly UCSD if I get off of waitlist),"Hey All, 

I'm trying to decide between Northeastern and Santa Clara University for CS. Cost is not a factor. 

Pros for SCU:

* Located in Silicon Valley
* I live 10 minutes away
* Known for their CS program in SV
* Focus on undergraduate teaching
* Wide varieties of opportunities for CS students
* 5yr MS CS Program

Cons for SCU:

* Overall name recognition
* Too close to home

Pros for Northeastern:

* Co-op Program
* Boston and new environment
* Prestigious for their CS program
* Travel abroad

Cons for Northeastern:

* Too far away from home
* Could be difficult to adjust to a new environment 

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

And at these respective schools: 

* How hard is it to get an internship/job?
* How good and accessible are the professors?
* How is the overall quality of the cs program? 
* What do you do in your free time in Boston? 

And if I get off of the waitlisting for UCSD, should I even consider it? Even though UCSD is in a great location and has great name recognition, I heard it's pretty difficult to get the classes, internships, and jobs you need. Seems easier at SCU or Northeastern.

Am I in the Wrong? Really Need Help,"TLDR: Lack of information led me to take a midterm late, the makeup was only in person and I'm high-risk for covid and not vaccinated. Original midterm graded, 41% grading disparity from the TA grader responsible for grading every other students exam. 

I had a midterm scheduled for the last week of march and when that day came I was a bit surprised the midterm hadn't been posted. I asked every student in the zoom meeting when the midterm was rescheduled for and nobody knew. Then, I made a post asking when the midterm was on the canvas discussion board (the professor's preferred method of questions), however, I received no response. An additional question was asked about which lectures the midterm covered and again no response. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then the next week the midterm assignment was posted and the time available stated a start time but no end time (as happens on canvas depending on the type of assessment). I had assumed that the lack of a closing time meant it could be taken any time before midnight. I understand I should not have made that assumption without being 100% certain, but it was an honest mistake. On the day of the midterm I had a second midterm which was about 3 hours long and started around the same time as the first midterm. I ended up taking midterm 2 during the time I should have been taking midterm 1. After finishing midterm 2 I  discovered my mistake with midterm 1. I ended up taking the entirety of midterm 1 about 2 hours late. 

&amp;#x200B;

I emailed my professor and was told that it would not count, as a burnt out student this was obviously crushing to hear. I asked if there could be a make-up since I missed the exam due to what I believed was a lack of communication and was told I would need to take it in person in my professor's office, being high-risk for covid I was not comfortable with that idea. I promptly informed my professor, and was told that it was policy. I then spoke to the additional professor listed on the syllabus just to confirm this was the policy, I was told it was not and my professor would be informed. My professor ended up just grading the midterm I handed in 2 hours late, I got a 35%. Previously, I had a 96% on the first midterm and a 90% average on problem sets. I spoke to the original TA grader of my midterm and was told I received around a 76%.

Aoun’s need for speed and the new normal. pt 1,"
My eyes slowly open. I roll over on my side and feel something like a cable I must have been sleeping on. 

Where am I? Snell? Everything is so groggy. When will this semester fucking end I think to myself. 

I inhale a deeply unsatisfying stench of 2 day old ramen noodles and Marshall’s cologne. No, im in my dorm room. 

I reach for the light but feel a tickle down my arm. The cable. But... its not a cable.. its a tube of some sort. I track it slowly with my eyes leading up my arm and into my sore shoulder. Its connected to some sort of catheter. What the fuck did I get into last night? 

A passing thought of Rebecca’s shit coffee in the morning makes me chuckle. 

Back to my arm. 

“What the fuck is going on here” I say, confused yet oddly interested. 

As I reach for my dorm room light, I feel a soft, but overcompensating-for-something hand reach out and grab mine. 

“Slow your roll their, champ” a voice proclaims.

Its.... Aoun?!

“Uhhhh-“ 

Before I can mutter much, he whispers to me through the darkness...

1. Are most physics professors good teachers?
2. How easy/difficult is it to conduct research(both independent and with a professor)?
3. What's the department of physics like? Is it tight-knit/collaborative?
4. I plan on taking the most advanced courses possible; how feasible is it to do so?
5. What are some of the most popular and interesting co-ops for physics majors?
6. Does the campus ever feel crowded?

"The Huntington News' new opinion editor is the author of past hit columns such as ""President Joe Biden is not a president for all; he is a dictator for all"" and ""Mail-in voting is not as efficient as it appears""","I saw this on [twitter from Deanna Schwartz](https://twitter.com/deannaschwartzz/status/1379819212856680448?s=20), who was an editor in the past at Hunt News. I think she's well liked on this sub from past posts/comments I've seen. I'd encourage you to read the whole thread. TL;DR, Hunt News has a new opinion editor.

Now, I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with a Trump supporter being the editor, and I think Schwartz puts a little too much emphasis on that part. You can hold different political views and still write insightful or quality columns. The problem is that all of her political columns are just regurgitated right wing talking points. If the point of an op-ed section is to make readers consider different point of views, then I'm not sure how well it does that.

Op-eds should be fact checked by an editor at the very least. The past editor did not do a great job of that, and I don't have any hope for the new one. Given the quality and factual accuracy of her past columns as a contributor, I can't imagine what type of job she'll do as an editor.

[I actually commented about this exact person a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEU/comments/m84tmd/oped_stop_roxbury_gentrification_by_opposing/grhn5yn/) on a different post here in r/NEU, so I guess they did reconsider what op-eds they choose to publish and went the other way with it. I still hold pretty much the same views. I don't think it affects the quality of the reporting, but the op-eds are going to be bad.

DO NOT GO TO NORTHEASTERN. Specifically the nursing program. It is a scam.,"My friend recently got kick out of the nursing program for who knows what. Her clinical instructor’s main reasoning of failing her was that she was a quiet and non-assertive person during clinical. She succeeded in lecture and previous clinicals, and our final clinical evaluation is ENTIRELY dependent on who our instructor is. Some are easy graders, and others are hard asses. She has only one semester left, yet no one in the nursing department board was on her side or gave support. She was forced to give a testimony on why she should stay and no conversation was had. They just told her no and basically told her to fuck off. Now she is kicked out of the nursing program, in debt in student loans, and does not know what else to do. On top of that, this could be an example of discrimination because English is not her first language. Plus, she was a transfer student and had to retake many prerequisites because NEU hates transfers and does not believe in their credits. She has been in college for almost 6 years, and at a loss that this was brought up upon her in her second to last semester. 

This is all because of one person’s subjective opinion on her performance. I know that she’d thrive as a nurse and not cause harm. But the fact that she is kicked out of nursing just because she’s a quiet person does not sit well with me. There is so much more that is fucked up in the nursing program, such as incompetent professors and clinical instructors. I'm even surprised that some of them still have their nursing licenses. 

Anyone have any ideas on what to do? Sign a petition? Get a lawyer and sue? Please help my innocent friend.",1620868245,1,0

Do not go to LightView (RANT),"Hi everyone, 

I feel compelled to share my negative experience with LightView because I read posts and comments here telling how bad it was and largely ignored. 

**tl;dr** : It's extremely overpriced for a poorly built and a poorly managed apartment. Do yourself a favor and get a better apartment elsewhere. 

**Background:**

I originally moved into LightView in March of 2020 through a relet. I was displaced during the onset of the pandemic due to Northeastern kicking their students out of their dorms. The motive to move to LightView was simply was that it was nearby. I also renewed the lease for the 2020 - 2021 academic school year with the following intentions:

1. I was informed that study abroad's qualified for an amended lease and I was considering studying abroad in the Fall of 2020.
2.  I was informed that graduating meant I could be released from lease and would not need to pay for the summer as I was no longer a student. 

**Management:**

I think by-far the most problematic aspect of LightView is how poorly managed it is. As I stated above, I originally was drawn to LightView because of what seemed like an incredibly flexible lease (I both wanted to study aboard in the fall and I was graduating). The flexibility part is incredibly misleading - they require you to turn in proof that you are studying abroad or have a co-op outside of Boston incredibly early. For the fall, this was May (The deadline to apply for some programs weren't until July), and for the spring that was around October. The graduating statement was a flat out lie - when I asked about this later into my lease (in case their is paper work), they apologized and said I was mislead, even though I showed them email specifically saying that I was told I could do this. 

After discovering that I was financially obligated to pay through the summer, they informed me that I could sign an ""intent to relet"" form and they would find someone to take over my lease in summer. In the spring they ""found"" someone but didn't do any follow up. When April comes around, I ask them for an update and they tell me there is no such thing as an ""intent to relet"" and that I was completely obligated to find someone to relet to on my own. They also informed me that who ever takes over my lease must meet certain criteria (Male &amp; Northeastern Undergraduate) which again was a lie - my roommate relet to someone from a different university and I lived with girls for my first lease. 

Some other frustrating encounters / things they do not tell you:

1. They made me sign two leases (one for March - August 2020 and one for September 2020 - August 2021). I application they made me fill out for the second lease required a deposit and they informed that my original deposit would be return in 30 days. I received it well over **100** days and I believe only got it when I informed them that they are in breach of the lease. 
2. One weird thing about LightView is that you are not paying for 12 months, you are paying for 11.5 Months and they require you to leave August 18th, with some exceptions.
3. One of those exceptions was if you accepted a new lease while you were on one. After I signed the lease, I requested if I could participate in this exception, move-in early or at least move my stuff into the new room - I was told they could not do this because the room needed to be ""inspected"" and ""cleaned."" This was also a lie - my roommate was in the exact same circumstances and was granted this exception. He informed me later that they ""inspect"" the apartment but did no such cleaning. 
4. The way they set up the lease, if you relet you end up giving the individual an extra month free. So for example, I reletted May - August, the individual paid May 1st, June 1st and July 1st and will had August free. 
5. The ""cleaning"" is done by the previous tenants because they charge tenants for any cleaning they have to do (something like $100 per trash bag). 
6. They do random inspections and you will rarely get an email about it. I cannot tell you how many times I've woken up to several people in the apartment for an ""inspection.""
7. They also require one of your parents to co-sign or for you pay the entire year in full (so keep this in mind when you fill out your application).
8. They do not lease to freshman and sophomores. 

**The building**

As many other posts / comments have stated - this place is incredibly poorly built. The walls are paper thin and (surprisingly) the floors are thin as well. This means you will have the misfortunate of hearing anything and everything your roommates are doing, anything that is going on outside, and anything going on upstairs and below you. Here are some examples of what drove me nuts:

1. The apartment had an eco so I could hear, very loudly, anytime someone was cooking. 
2. The god-awful construction they are doing downstairs that somehow never ends. If you are on the second or third floor towards the front of the building, be prepared for 6am - 8am incredibly load drill sounds that **will** wake you up and again around noon that made zoom-class impossible in your own apartment. 
3. Upstairs had someone that played the drums at night making it impossible to sleep.
4. If the neighbors were playing loud music - we could hear it.
5. If people were making noise outside - we could hear it (its so thin you can hear the conversations very clearly).  

Another issue was poor circulation of air. If someone smoked weed or was cooking in a different apartment, we'd end up smelling it. The heating / cooling system does not work - its kinda of crap shot whenever you will get heating / cooling. 

Frequent hot water-outages, 50% of time they will not tell you there would be outage. 

Poor internet - it was awful, they do not tell you how to get connected, it frequently disconnects your devices and was incredibly spotty. A lot of people ended up purchasing their own internet. 

Cable does not work. Tried with multiple televisions and the tech support recommended television tuner. Ended up using an Apple TV instead.

Walls are easily chipped and they will charge you for it. 

Laundry machines are awful - Mobile Pay does not work anymore and the machines frequently break. One time, more than half of the machines were broken (and it does not explicitly say its broken they just show an error message when you try to pay). When I informed management about this I was told, just ""keep trying different machines."" Sometimes the washer won't release water either, so you will notice that your clothes are not wet. 

The trash-shoot is frequently broken - do not be surprised if you go its location and find piles of garbage bags laying around because the shoot is broken again.

The common study areas are first-come, so they will be impossible get as a lot of people go in the morning and stay there for long periods of time. 

The gym is lacking in equipment.

The mailing service is a OK, however you will get your package until the next day. 

Depending on your room - you might be facing the second building (so you won't really get sunlight). The is common for floors below five. 

Dishwasher is awful - low water pressure means most of your dishes may need to be re-cleaned. 

**Conclusion**

I cannot stress any further how I do not recommend this place to anyone. If you are like me, and intend on coming to this place because of their so-called flexible leasing policy - do not (just go on campus). Moreover, LightView brands themselves as luxury but it is anything but - any of the on-campus rooms are far more superior than anything you will get there. If you desire an apartment style building (with your own kitchen), Northeastern does have properties and I would suggest using Northeastern's off-campus services (they are actually very helpful). In my opinion, there is no real advantage to LightView. Not even proximity as there are even apartments next to LightView that are constantly leased to students.",1620864885,1,0

Surviving the Summer at Home?,"I was a first year at Northeastern this year, and this is my first summer being back home after being at college. Despite COVID and everything, I really did still enjoy my freshman year and I made some incredible friends and I miss Boston so much already. 

I've only been home for like, three days and I already don't know what I'm going to do for the rest of the summer. I'm working, but my job doesn't start until June so the entire month of May I'm just gonna be at home doing absolutely nothing. I don't really keep in touch with many people from high school anymore, and out of the like, seven people I do still talk to, three of them are sleep-away camp counselors in another state so they won't even be here. I have tinder and everything so I know I can meet people through there, but my parents are kind of nosy and like to ask me where I'm going and who I'm with whenever I go out (I appreciate they care, but y'know...it gets kind of annoying) and I don't even know how I would explain meeting people off of tinder to them. 

Also, why are Northeastern summers *so* long? Like four months? I heard that it's common that after your first year you don't go home for the summer anymore; how can I make that happen for me with co-op and everything? And I know this is far away, but I would die if I had to move back home after I graduated...so how would I go about preventing that?

Uncompromising CS professor fails me,"For context, this was a must-pass assignment, for which I failed to complete a code-walk. All told, the code walk takes 15 minutes. Two meetings were scheduled to have the code walk, the first of which I did not know about (Outlook auto-accepted the meeting without my knowledge), the second one, I legitimately forgot about due to finals stress. Hypothetically, it would take very little time to have the code walk and settle the grade today, but the prof is uncompromising.

Seems like a completely arbitrary decision to fail me, especially given the circumstances, yet he's totally within his right as a professor, given how I unresponsive I was. They were honest mistakes during a really stressful period of my life, and it almost feels like I'm being punished for being human.

Has anyone tried to appeal something like this with CCIS/Khoury? Do I have any form of recourse with the higher ups? Here's our email convo:

OP: 

&gt;Hi Professor,  
&gt;  
&gt;Are you or any of the TA’s at all available to have the code walk for assignment 9 today? I’m sorry for the inconvenience, but suffice it to say that I have been extraordinarily busy these past few days.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you,  
&gt;  
&gt;OP

Professor:

&gt; Skipping two meetings in a row with the professor is extremely unprofessional.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Frankly, I've already marked you as failing the class.

OP:

&gt;Based on the way I’ve handled this assignment, I don’t deserve to pass this class, and I have certainly not earned your trust or respect. But it’s out of desperation that I am asking for one more show of grace. Is there any way that you can give me one last chance? I can come to your office in person if necessary.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; I understand if the answer is still no.

Professor:

&gt; I haven't speculated on what I'd do if I had the time, in point of fact I don't. I'm sorry, but I would look forward to working with you again in the fall.

OP:

&gt; Is it possible to schedule time with a TA or other faculty member? Again, out of desperation, but if you granted an incomplete, we could postpone the code walk to a later date that is more convenient for you.

&gt; No. I am the only one who is doing the remainder of these, and there is no later time. This was the end of the semester, the semester is over. Grades are completed and in.",1619977357,1,0
Asking Professor to round up grade,"So I have a borderline C right now in a class and I was hoping my professor could round it up to a B-.

The agreement that I have for one of my scholarships and to have my father help me pay for college is that I only have A’s and B’s. It would be hell if I got this C.
