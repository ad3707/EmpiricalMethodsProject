Reminder: screening tests start this week!,"Per the [latest guidance](https://coronavirus.upenn.edu/announcement/message-campus-community-start-fall-semester):

&gt;Beginning the week of September 13, all [fully vaccinated] students enrolled in an on-campus program will be required to participate in a mandatory screening test program twice a month.

(For non-vaccinated students the old requirement of 2x/wk still holds.)

Schedule [here](https://covidscheduling.upenn.edu/), view results [here](https://covidresults.upenn.edu/), and find instructions [here](https://coronavirus.upenn.edu/content/penn-cares-testing-program)

A TL;DR of instructions and tips:

*No food, drink, gum, tooth brushing, smoking, vaping, etc. for 30 minutes before the test
*Bring your PennCard and OpenPass
*Remember you'll be asked to keep your mask on as much as possible; wear one that's easy to push up partway.

*If you're eternally underhydrated like I am, set a reminder for 1 hour before and another one for 30 minutes before your test. Use the time between the 2 reminders to drink as much water as possible.
*Gently biting your cheeks between spits can help encourage salivation
*Tuck your chin, raise your tongue, and let gravity do the work as much as possible. Forcing too hard adds bubbles, which don't count towards the required volume.",1631474436,1,0

Obviously I’m fine with that policy, but I was wondering whether it’s within their authority, given Penn has [specifically mentioned](https://coronavirus.upenn.edu/content/public-health-guidance) in their public safety guidance that there is an exemption to the indoor masking requirement for those in shared spaces where 6ft distance can be maintained (which was the case in Joe’s cafe, since it was pretty much empty).

Is STSC 001 worth my sanity?,"Sorry if this post comes off as lazily written but I'm in a pinch right now

I am taking STSC 001 - emergence of modern science to fulfill one of my requirements, being a school of arts and science student. I chose this because I initially was in another class for that requirement and it would have been an easy A, but the professor recommended for me to do something else so that it would be more fruitful. So that's how I ended up in STSC 001, seeing as the title of the class was interesting. I shouldn't have listened and changed back when I had the chance. I didn't change back because the professor of STSC ensured that my troubles would only be temporary, but here I am right now.

Anyway, background out of the way, I have an essay due tomorrow thats 5-7 pages double spaced, so about 1600 words. I only have 500 words which is one and a half pages right now and I'm on the verge of just giving up and dropping out of the class. Why is this essay so dang hard for me? Because the texts we are given to do are not meant for angst heavy undergraduate college students like myself and are meant for elite scientists to read. Unfortunately, this makes it frustrating to extract the main points. Also, the prompt is so open ended and is basically asking what is science. It is so hard to create a single sentence that captures information as well as having evidence that links to that point.

It felt like a challenge to produce those 500 words with the paraphrase and thought and all that and I couldn't handle doing that more than two times more to get enough pages.

Why didn't I start earlier you may ask? Because I'm a fucking loser and have many times thought I don't deserve to be in this dang college with my failures beyond comprehension. On a more serious note, I want to have all the relevant texts clarified for me before I start my paper. We didn't go over one of the texts until just yesterday and it was mistake to not get started even without the full picture. I thought not having the full picture would lead to holes in my essay.

I want to drop out because I despise this course with all my heart right now but that means I'm only taking 3 credits worth of classes and I feel that will fuck me up in the long run.",1632448972,1,0

Slips found under doors with coded messages,"TLDR: If you found a slip of paper with a coded message on it anytime in the last week or so, comment here or let me know. The slips are on white paper, about 1.5"" by 8"".

The full story: At the beginning of the semester, a bunch of slips of paper were slipped under doors of suites in a few dorms. Some people eventually figured out that they decoded to combine to make a message that said ""send only one person to shoemaker green on Sept 18th"". One of the people who cracked the code went there, and found a message that, when decoded, said that more slips had been distributed, but only 3 per dorm. Because they are so sparse this time, we haven't been able to find enough of them to make decoding possible yet (maybe it's technically possible, but really, really difficult), so, if you've sen a slip or heard from someone who has, let me know so we can keep assembling the slips.

Also, if you want to try your hand at decoding what we have thus far (we have 5 out of 11 slips), post a comment to that effect and I'll add the slips we have and other helpful information. Alternatively, our google sheet that we're using for this can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M4rEHgCTx0OqlpSSwrmEniI5KuUoe5G37wFy5\_zqsnY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M4rEHgCTx0OqlpSSwrmEniI5KuUoe5G37wFy5_zqsnY/edit?usp=sharing)",1632264158,1,0

Reasons to Apply to UPenn,"Hi current students and past students, 
UPenn is a school I have a lot of admiration for. 
I am wondering, as students who are there, have been there or are looking to go there, what is UPenn like and what does UPenn have that other schools don't offer. 
I have seen a lot on the professional environment but the very ""work hard party harder"" kind of life is also very existent.

PSYC-111 (Perception) with Prof. Burge--- HELP!,"Does anyone have any tips for the first midterm? It's on Wednesday, and I have no flipping idea about what's going on in this class.

I'm considering dropping this course, but I feel immense shame even thinking about it.  I'm so overwhelmed. My plan is to drop it if I don't do so hot on this first midterm, because each midterm is worth 25% of my grade (2 midterms- 50%), the final is worth 40% (just...why?), and HW is worth 10% (no problem there). 

I don't want to make a habit out of it, but... any cramming tips for this midterm? I'm feeling trapped ATM.

Freshman Stress,"

Hi, Penn Reddit.

I’ve been thinking a lot about making this post for some time now, and held myself back multiple times. I was afraid, and still am, of coming to terms with what I’m experiencing. But when you feel what I feel every single day here, it’s impossible to not want to reach out and see how others feel/respond. I’m sorry if this may sound rant-y sometimes, but it’s just the truth of my experiences. Thanks for reading.

I’m a freshman, and I moved in on the regular dates in late August. I was so excited to start a new chapter in my life and live in a new place, but my time here soon made a turn for the worse. 

In spite of the fact I like my classes, my dorm, and Penn as a whole, I’m cripplingly lonely. 

I’ve always been introverted and usually enjoyed spending some time alone, in spite of the fact I had a great friend group in high school I was really close with. (We did a bunch of things and had experiences that really made us close.) My BFF from high school pretty much vanished from contact, so my lifeline for support during the transition was gone. I saw everyone making friends and going to events, and felt forced to do the same for fear of being alone. All my social connections from my life before this were gone, after all. I tried to reach out to people by going to all the events, but every day, especially in NSO, I felt worse and worse, going to everything alone and having no one to talk or connect with. I was already going through so much adjustment from leaving my home, country, and parents, that my social awkwardness and anxiety made it really hard to talk with people normally.

After that, it seemed like everyone had groups to eat or hang out with all the time, and that was something I desperately wanted, and still want. Every fun Instagram story, every time I see a group walking off down Locust to do something fun, every story people tell me about how much fun they had doing X or Y with their group, it feels like a dagger to the heart. I see people texting friends on their computers in class about what they’ll do after with them and feel just as bad. Every time I leave my room, it’s a reminder of how lonely I am, and how I failed to reach out to people. Even when I find someone I like, it feels like they always have their own thing and their own friend groups, so I feel even worse. 

One thing I’m honestly thankful for is that I have one friend that I feel close to and comfortable with, but I’m worried he doesn’t fully understand what I’m feeling. 

As time goes by, I get more and more afraid that I’ll have no one to connect with, and no one that will understand my feelings. I’ve talked to CAPS a few times too, and they did help a little, at least. 

If you’re a freshman and you’re feeling similar to the way I am, please feel free to DM me. I know I can’t be alone with this horrible feeling I have to bear every single day of my life. I’m not looking for people that pity me; I’m looking for people willing to listen and understand. It might turn into a friendship, even! 

Penn has been a rollercoaster, but my huge qualm and constant fear is a social one. I love it here, but emotionally, I’ve never been in this much recurring pain. I want things to get better, and I know that they can. 

If you have advice, stories, or if you want to talk, feel free to comment or DM. Again, if you’re a freshman (or anyone, I guess) and you want to meet/connect or share your experience, also feel free to talk to me.

Thank you guys for reading what I have to say, and here’s hoping my future in Penn is brighter.",1633292828,1,0

Questions about Jerome Fisher M&amp;T/taking econ at SEAS,"I'm a high school senior considering applying ED to Penn's M&amp;T program but I have a few concerns. Besides how hard it is to get into the program, I've also heard rumors that it gives an extremely difficult workload. I'm willing to work hard, but the things I've been hearing seem excessive at best and hellish at worst. How true are the rumors? Can any M&amp;T students or people that know M&amp;T people give some details about what I would realistically expect for the workload? Also sorry if this sounds stupid, but if I'm accepted into M&amp;T but can't handle the work, can I drop out and just get a single major at SEAS?

In the unfortunately extremely likely case that I don't get into M&amp;T, is it still possible to pursue a secondary degree in something finance related (business, econ, etc.) while attending SEAS? I think that there's an econ minor available at the college but I don't really know that much about it.

How hard is it to get a research lab position in the psychology department at UPenn?," First time poster and I know I don't go attend UPenn but I figured this was the best place to ask about Ivy League schools. I'm a senior about to graduate from a Midwest university and was looking to be part of psychology research labs around the country during my gap year/s before applying to grad schools. While I have an extremely high Psych GPA (practically a 4.0 if we ignore one class during the pandemic), I have a lower overall GPA because of just terrible life circumstances and then recognizing I don't want to go into medicine anymore (3.23 rn) and the only research experience I have is the independent research study I'm conducting during my senior year, acting as PI and first author. I can get strong letter of recs and I have been emailing professors all over the country asking for positions and informational interviews and have gotten responses that tell me to ask again in the Spring, but also open to discuss more.

I'd like to think I'm quite personable and educated but I'm afraid to apply to any positions at any of the prestigious because I feel like they'd just look at my surface level information and drop me from consideration, compared to the other applicants who've probably done much more. I just want to be given a chance but I don't know how the psych department at these schools is about accepting students and how open they are to such things.

How possible is it for someone to shift from career in HCI to Private Equity?," 

Professionals in Human Computer Interaction help in creating websites and apps for tech companies, SaaS cos, FMCG companies, etc; which is using the ideas of 'mass psychology' for commerce.

Using the skills accrued while working in HCI, MBA should help get the aptitude to slide into Private Equity; as managing / flipping a business is largely about knowing market consumption i.e. what market wants and cash flows  
(not entirely though, talent management and etc too are required);  
Hence, an HCI degree will have transferrable skills of how consumption works and then an Ivy League MBA will help get foot in the door for buy side finance.

I have a degree in finance from a regular college in Mumbai with a 3.0 GPA. Worked in State Street Bank for a year and then slid into advertising during the pandemic. Private Equity takes the elite of the elite of B School recruits and the aim is to sharpen your profile as one, hence I chose HCI as it is a easy transition for me as I am already doing the same work in advertising. The intent is to have a great profile and preferentially work in Management Consulting (as Accenture and BCG too have Ux roles) to sharpen up my profile and skills in making products for mass consumption and then get my MBA to transition in Private Equity

My questions

1. How possible is it?
2. What do I have to be prequalified with before applying for an MBA? Would CFA work? (large part of that is corporate finance)...Would courses from Wall Street Oasis, Peak Frameworks, Corporate Finance Institute work?
3. Do they need pre MBA industry experience or will it be the same ritual ie working in M&amp;A for an investment bank first after MBA and then get in PE after some experience?

Also, the aim for MBA is either Ivy League like Wharton or bust",1636650173,1,0
potential scammer near Allegro's,"i'm still not sure if this is like a scam this guy does or not but just in case it is, i don't want anyone else to make the same stupid mistake i did.

i was walking home from acme sunday night and while i was passing by allegro's this man stopped me. he told me his car was blocking the street and he needed an oil change desperately, but he didn't have any money and his phone was dead. normally i just ignore/keep walking when people ask me for money, but he seemed to have a very specific story and seemed super desperate so i felt bad. he showed me his phone, which was dead, and told me that once he got home and charged it he would venmo me back. i told him i don't carry cash on me to which he responded with obvious frustration and annoyance (which scared me a little bit, how quickly his demeanor changed). he then pointed to the atm inside allegro's and said i could use that. throughout this whole time he kept saying ""please, sis"" and kept reassuring me he would pay me back, even double (to which i said that was unnecessary). 

i went inside and got the money for him and gave it to him, then realized if his phone was dead how was he going to take note of my venmo? he told me he had a good memory and would remember it so i just told him verbally. at this point i was already feeling like i was just losing $20 but it was already in his hand and felt too late at that point. 

it's thursday now and i haven't received any venmo payments.

it's not a huge deal, i'm just upset at myself for falling for it and actually believing that this man would pay me back. i'm still not really sure if he just made the whole thing up and just wanted $20 from someone, or if he actually did need an oil change and never intended on paying me back. or if i really want to hold on to some measure of faith in humanity, he forgot my venmo...but the cynic in me thinks it's more the first two. looking back, i wonder if getting his number/name would've helped, but if he really was a scammer he would've just given me fake info which obviously wouldn't have done anything.

anyways, if a man approaches you near campus asking for money for an oil change, just keep walking.",1636647477,1,0

Masks at Penn,"This morning, I was happy to see the e-mail from Penn stating that there is a 97% vaccination rate and .36% positivity rate for COVID. Now, reading the email that Penn recreation sent out regarding masking in Pottruck, I can’t help but think that the policies that the school is enforcing are ridiculous and inconsistent.  

I understand that the surrounding community is not vaccinated to the same extent as the student body (even though ~90% of adults have received at least one dose of the vaccine and ~80% of eligible children in Philadelphia), but this community also seems to be the ones who are not following COVID protocols to begin with. Walk into Wawa or any store around here and you can clearly observe this. If you go to a Sixers game or bar, although masks are theoretically required, there are literally thousands of people in close proximity who are not complying. 

Then comes homecoming with the school allowing student groups to hold events with hundreds of maskless students partying. If this were done outside of the schools knowledge, I don’t think it would be inconsistent, but these events were often literally registered through the school with school employees overseeing. 

With all this occurring, I really can’t see any reason to require such strict masking in other scenarios. I expect someone to type “well it’s just a mask, just wear it.” To that, I would respond that I will comply, but it is nonetheless an inconvenience. My skin is destroyed from masks, it sucks to work out, it is impossible to have glasses not fog up so I can’t see the board in class, etc. I don’t understand why those who want to workout, see the board in class, etc. should be told to suck it up, while those who won’t wear a mask to drink and party get a free pass from the school. Does anyone here see an end to this policy? With the COVID situation at Penn seemingly doing extremely well, what metric will we have to see to not need masks any more?",1636581608,1,0

I’m tired of the fetishization of M&amp;T students.,"The females on this campus are out of control. The first time I ate lunch wearing my M&amp;T shirt (with fully covered legs, mind you), I had literally 3 different women try to sit down and court me, like I would know how to talk to a girl. I quickly demonstrated superior knowledge of each of their niche interests, which apparently eliminates me from the dating pool (why shame me for being smart?).

Anyway, that got them to leave but the problem has persisted in the past 3 months and I am so fed up with everybody wanting to get with me. I've taken to moving all the other chairs at tables I sit at to other tables, but yesterday a small asian woman literally pulled up a chair and began ranting about the last STAT 431 midterm. Girl, I don't struggle with STAT 431. I'm an M&amp;T student, not some single degree simpleton. After making it markedly clear that I did NOT in fact want to copulate in a Huntsman GSR, she finally left me alone, but I wish these girls would stop worshipping me just because I am enrolled in the hardest program at Penn (which was not difficult for me to get into, by the way).

The worst are when students from the college attempt to talk to me. We'll be having a nice, platonic conversation, when they inevitably ask the fateful question: ""What's your major?"" As soon as I say those two magnificent letters, I see their whole demeanor change. The doe eyes, the flushed cheeks, the jiggling cleavage. What makes a PPE major think they have a chance with me? Finance and CIS are on whole different planes of existence. I'm not about to impregnate somebody that makes infographics about the gender pay gap  for ""work.""

You may think I'm just remarkably handsome, which I am, but my attractive acquaintances in LSM (they're not smart enough to be friends, but their childlike innocence is sometimes enviable), have literally no problems with this incessant harassment and courting from female creatures. Females see me as an object and a genius, when really I'm so much more: I'm top 100 in the world in Destiny 2. My gray shirt shouldn't reduce me to a bag of meat; if you want my heart, you have to grind with me, raid with me, join my clan, and most of all, watch Rick and Morty with me, and understand it -- no fake fans that shout ""pickle rick"" like its some kind of joke, when it's really the climax of the most tragic episode of season 3. Not that I cried.

If you want somebody for cheap sex, the LSM students are right there (I don't blame you for avoiding PPE majors though). Stop fetishizing my kind for something out of our control. I didn't want to be born a super genius. Hell, sometimes I wish I was an LSM student, moving through the world in ignorant bliss. But I have a responsibility to save the world and create the next Tesla. Seductively touching the iron ring isn't going to make me want to get with you. Come back in a Morty costume, get a return offer from Sequoia, or implement Djikstra's recursively, and then we'll talk.",1637744630,1,0

Endemic Covid? / Disillusionment,"I wonder when the US is gonna start bracing itself for endemic COVID. I hate wearing a mask – within 5 minutes of being in class I'm always drenched in sweat. But I've learned to bite my tongue because I think COVID is gonna be here for the long haul. 

Are the Penn Administrators real people, or are they computers? I really can't tell. What is their job? To Administrate by sending noncompliance  emails  multiple times daily? They do not keep us informed about much except for the latest round of shots, tests, and forms. Their emails are always as bare as possible. This institution claims to promote ""democracy"" yet administrators do not attempt to make themselves accessible to student input. Perhaps it's an effect of Covid but I have become increasingly suspicious of all the faceless people working for this University. This has been a pivotal few years and Penn's responses have always been meek, after-the=fact, and never take a strong stance on anything. Didn't universtiy adminstrators once take strong stances on issues that they believed in? Weren't they once leading intellectuals? Is that what happens when current Admins make &gt;$4 million annually for being professional fundraisers?

&amp;#x200B;

\[Anyway...\]

&amp;#x200B;

As a greater % of the population gets vaccinated I'm concerned about immunity and ever-stronger variants going around. On this end, I think a lot of universities around the country are keeping their students in the dark about potentially valuable info that they are likiely discussing behind closed doors. E.g., what is the likelihood that Covid will be a part of our lives for 3 years? 5 years? 10?I think masks are still necessary. The fact that there haven't been any severe on-campus outbreaks yet is an attestment to their effectiveness. We've all gotta get used to  masks for a while most likely; I have a feeling that endemic Covid will be affecting us for years to come. I also credit masks for protecting me from Covid thus far. Some of the long-term effects of Covid sound awful too. There are way too many stories about healthy people dying from Covid  for me to want to take my mask off for long periods. I don't blame anyone for wanting to do it in Pottruck tho. working out with a mask is horrid. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am grateful for access to testing. But I wish Penn had invested more in improving the student experience. Why hasn't Penn created more heated outdoor sitting spaces so that students don't congregate indoors?  This has been much needed. I couldn't imagine making friends as a first-year student this semester. There are far less places to see people with the mask requirement. I feel like I'm in my own bubble and definitely less likely to chat with others while in class.  Hope everyone is hanging in there.",1637712695,1,0

Negative vibes at Penn?," Hey everyone, this is my first time posting on Reddit so bear with me. I am currently a freshman in a dual degree program (do not want to reveal which for privacy) and I am really concerned with the overall negative vibes at Penn (for lack of better words). It feels like so many people at Penn, from underclassmen to faculty members, in person and online seems so…miserable. And really forward about it too lol. I understand Penn is difficult and I struggled a lot myself in the beginning (though I am glad to say I have overcome and am currently doing pretty well in my classes), but based on what I’ve heard from friends at other ivies + what I’ve read online, it seems like there’s a disproportionate amount of dysfunction and overall misery here compared other schools. From all of the DP articles that seemingly have a new exposé every week (the Gene therapy program article was terrifying) to Freshmen nearing the end of the semester still dealing with loneliness (which I definitely relate to) to one user on here saying they were r-worded by a CAPS admin and it's getting covered up? That’s just online…talking with upperclassmen and graduate students (from SEAS, Wharton, CAS), their comments are so pessimistic and they always say they are so ready to leave. 

Every other day I go back and forth as to whether it was worth it and if I should transfer. I did pretty well in college admissions and got into Yale, Stanford, Princeton, and other top 20 schools…but Penn’s dual degree was my first choice because it had the career pathway that I thought I wanted to get into (that since has changed slightly) and the extra layer of exclusivity, more advisors, and the community made it seem like I would get so much more out of the program than at another Ivy. It’s been fine, but definitely fell a bit short of my expectations. Everyone at other peer schools just seem to take much more pride in their school, or at least have less complaints?

PHYS280 instead of PHYS151 as a PreMed,"Hey, for some very brief context I'm premed studying computational neuro. 

I have AP Credit for PHYS150 and PHYS151, and I'm planning on retaking PHYS150 because apparently med schools want a full year of physics with a lab. However, I found PHYS280 (Physical Models of Biological Systems) to be a lot more interesting and worth my time rather than retaking PHYS151 and just relearning things. 

The issue is that med schools want lab experience, and from what I can tell, PHYS280 does not have a lab component. Would it still be worthwhile to take 280 instead of 151, even though I won't have that ""lab component"" that most med schools recommend?  I would still technically have 151 show up on my transcript, so would that be excusable for the lab component?",1637651077,1,0

Apartment Search: Worth it to play the waiting game?,"So my roommates and I are currently looking for housing for next year and are looking for a nice place that's 1.) clean (newer, few pests) and 2.) close to campus. As such, we've been looking into apartments but have run into a problem with all of the places we've found.  The Radian is really nice and has a great location but, at $1,384 per month, we can't justify the price even if it comes furnished. Hamilton Court is in an arguably better location and has great prices on their 4-bedroom units but unfortunately, we started touring just one week after they leased their last 4-bedroom unit; the cheapest they have available right now is two-bedroom units starting at &gt;$1,500. Finally, we looked into 40th &amp; Chestnut, and although it is reasonably priced (\~$1,100), it is a bit too far from campus and doesn't have enough natural lighting to be worth the price. 

So the question is if our budget is somewhere around $1,150/$1,200 per person, will we be able to find places (either now or in the future) that hit this price? I have heard that the Radian sometimes gets desperate for tenants in the spring and will lower their rates to get lessees. Is this something we can bank on (especially now that sophomores are required to live on campus, freeing up off-campus housing for upperclassmen), or is this a risky game to play? Alternatively, I hear that sometimes HamCo will have units open up if people drop their lease or neglect to renew--is this a reliable gamble to make? Will we be able to get a good-priced lease at the Radian or HamCo with any certainty or should we play it safe and sign someplace that may be farther off just to secure housing? 

Would really appreciate any and all anecdotes/advice on the matter (and any strong feelings for or against any of the apartments I did (or did not!) mention). Thank you!",1637621899,1,0

A little more about my sexual assault by a Uni employee…,"Just want to say so far, thanks for all the support I’ve received (and the assholes that think it’s funny, at least I know hell is empty because all the demons are apparently here at Penn).

Here’s a bit more about my situation:

When all this shit happened with this CAPS clinician, I first alerted someone that worked in a different department which “over rides” CAPS. The person I told LAUGHED at me and made it clear she wouldn’t help.

When I tried to kill myself over it and told the clinician why, clinician and his coworker tried to kill me. No joke. I had evidence of this because the item he tried to kill me with, he sent me home with it so I could “commit suicide” there because he knew my mental state. It gets a lot worse really fast.

After my suicide attempt, when I tried to alert the University authorities, the clinician sent me a pretty clearly threatening email.

Myself and my “support group”  (small, now deceased) BEGGED HIM at the time to put me into a hospital for my own safety. He refused. He said at one point that he was against doing so because “well, who knows WHAT you could talk about there”.

I reported all of this to Amy Guttman’s office. Within hours, I received a call - and there were witnesses in the room when I received it as I put it on speaker - from the same lady that had laughed when I initially told her about the ongoing SA, stating that if I tried to bring Amy into this or if I called the media they would have me arrested.

A few days later that same office asked me to come meet with them to “help me out”. I left the object he tried to kill me with - on my desk in my dorm, so keep that in mind right now…

When I went to their office, nothing was accomplished. It was a trap. When I went back to my room, I found that my room had been ransacked by Penn police - sans any type of permission or warrant - AT THE REQUEST OF THE OFFICE I WAS
MEETING WITH - and that item went missing. 

Penn now will not let me register for classes, won’t give me my scholarship or financial aid… I am fucked. This has actually turned me to legitimate homelessness. 

I have proof of all of my allegations. As soon as I can, it’’s media and lawyer time.",1637516914,1,0

(TW: rape) We have a huge rape problem here &amp; it's because of frats!!!! i'm so done with this,"**Nearly every woman I know has been sexually assaulted.** 

And it's cause the frats here **aggressively** promote rape culture. If your frat is constantly trying to achieve a ""ratio"" of more women than men, especially freshman girls (fresh out of HS!!!!! u guys are creeps), and serving alcohol excessively, it's so fucking clear you're using women's vulnerability &amp; the power dynamic to take advantage of them. 

If you don't think that's rape culture then please re-evaluate your concept of consent. Rape is rarely a violent attack in an alleyway by a stranger. It's friends/classmates/acquaintances **who would NEVER approach a sober female friend in a non-party setting to attempt to initiate sex with her but are totally okay with approaching her while she's in an inebriated state**. It's normalized here!!! You guys really need to ask yourselves if she would agree to have sex with you sober. If the answer is no, leave her alone PLEASE. 

**If you're in a frat you're a part of the problem no matter which way you try and justify it. If you're okay with being a part of institutions that are nationally known for sexual assault, then you're driving rape culture.** Would you ever join a club whose members are known to be 300% more likely to violently abuse dogs????

"Pros and Cons of signing a lease in Hub (3939, 3945 Chestnut St)","I know students are looking for off-campus leases right now, and I wanted to give my 2 cents on the building I’ve lived in for the last 2 years. 

Throwaway for privacy. 

Pros:
 - close to campus &amp; ACME
 - facilities are USUALLY well-maintained (i.e. trash and recycling room is emptied near-daily, packages are sorted onto different shelves by management)
 - management is prompt with responses

Cons:
 - no security/front desk. Packages are dropped off in the lobby, which is visible from outside, and anyone can steal them. I’ve had $180 worth of packages stolen. Mailboxes are often left unlocked and open, so people could steal other people’s mail
 - seriously, no security. Hub got robbed twice in the last year.
 - there were two power/water outages that were building-specific in this semester

everything is going fine but I'm just kinda lonely?,"freshman here. I can't say that there is anything specific about my experience here at Penn so far that is too negative. I mostly enjoy my classes, clubs, living space and all that, and I'm doing okay in them. And I have a couple friends and talk to people as I go about my day, but I just am really not getting that feeling of groundedness or security I'm used to. I feel so much more sensitive to different cues of social rejection or hierarchy even if it is in a sense that I don't care about. for example, I don't really esteem popularity but seeing it in others makes me feel inadequate

I honestly have always been pretty independent and introspective, and I'm surprised that this feeling has been bothering me as much as it has. Before college I would have been okay going about an entire day on my own. I often preferred it. I think it might just be seeing everyone else seeming so happy and outgoing and connected that makes me feel like I'm missing out. sometimes social media, the dining halls, or even locust walk can feel kinda isolating.

moreover, my response to this is to just be patient (hoping it will get better with time) and to focus on myself, and I've been doing that. for example, I deleted social media (temporarily most likely) and I've been getting into my schoolwork and trying to take care of my body and space, which are all great things of course. but they all seem actually counter to helping my original problem which is that I feel socially disconnected. I feel like I have made almost zero new, meaningful connections since like NSO.

the funny thing is, I don't even feel like I have enough time to really expand my social life all that much, but that doesn't really prevent this feeling. can anyone relate? any upperclassmen have advice?

Pest problems bother me to my core,"To some people this will seem very dramatic, but no one has ever really posted about this and I’m wondering if any other people feel similarly. 

I knew coming in to living in the high rises there would be issues with bugs - it’s old, filled with tons of people, and we are in the city after all. However the lack of action of maintenance against trying to tackle roaches in particular has left me feeling anxious and uncomfortable in my own bedroom. I am pretty terrified of bugs, but previously a clean room meant not really interacting with any except the occasional house spider. 

I’ve become obsessive over cleaning and am constantly on the lookout for bugs. Today I had deep cleaned my room for winter break and discovered an entire nesting area for the cockroaches with their waste underneath my air conditioner. This battle is becoming detrimental to my mental health. 

This isn’t a big deal and I am aware of that, but also I’m exhausted from fighting something I can’t do anything about. I would suggest to those looking to live in the high rises to ask yourself if you are okay with living with bugs all of the time. If you have any sort of aversion, the previous answers in this Reddit may mislead you that because you are clean you won’t deal with it.

appealing financial aid...?,"hello! I was just admitted into CAS as part of the Class of 2026 and I'm hoping to appeal my financial aid offer before the enrollment deadline. 

I've seen comments on this subreddit from people who have appealed/called and gotten significantly higher amounts of aid, and I was wondering if anyone would be willing to elaborate on how they were able to do that? (esp since plenty other comments tried to appeal and received..well..nothing)

I haven't necessarily had a change in financial situation which would maybe draw them to reconsider - my family still sends a considerable amount of money to relatives and supports family members living with us that still do file their own taxes so they are independents, which has likely skewed the fin aid's offices' perception of our financials. I have a full ride to a state school (UNC Chapel Hill) and was hoping to use it as leverage, but I'm worried they will not consider it since the school isn't a private institution//scholarship wasn't need based.

So tired of anti-Asian harassment on and around campus,"Is it just me or has there been a huge uptick in anti-Asian sentiment on and around campus over the past couple of months. Just over the last few weeks, I've experienced/witnessed 

* A guy screaming ""CHANGE??!! CHANGE??!!' at the top of his lungs at a group of Chinese-speaking students waiting for their food by a food at 38th/Spruce. He was literally standing directly in front of their faces screaming. Finally he gave up and yelled ""fucking c\*\*\*k"" 
* A group of teenage-looking kids walking past a couple of Asian girls near Sansom West and yelling ""KUNG FU KUNG FU KUNG FU HIYAHHH"" (ngl kind of funny but really rude and racist) 
* A drunk homeless-looking guy on the trolley verbally abusing an older Asian lady using racial slurs and screaming ""tiger mom' - fortunately the driver intervened and made him get off at 40th. 
*  At 38th st. Wawa I (Asian-American guy) was passing through the vestibule and a guy standing there demanded if I have change. I ignored him and he yelled, ""DO YOU SPEAK-A ENGLISH? C-H-A-N-G-E?!?""
* Anecdotally, I've heard of Chinese/Asian international students who've been spit on, had ice cubes thrown at them, had people yelling ""China virus"", etc.

I don't know what can be done about this issue considering most of these incidents are happening with people who are not obviously members of the Penn community. I am just getting sick of it and starting to feel more bitter than I'd like to be feeling about the west Philly community. 

And I feel helpless and also complicit because I am not always able to bring myself to intervene when I see these things happening. I used to think people were being drama queens or exaggerating when they told these stories but now I've begun to experience it myself and I'm not OK.",1639777807,1,0

meh first semester,"how common is it to have a bad first semester at penn? between trying to maintain a friend group, getting used to living away from home, and finally having to tackle my time management issues/poor study skills, my grades have suffered. I can't say I truly grinded this semester, more so just tried to get by, and I wanted to be pre-med. two of my classes I think I'll end up with a decent grade, the other two are kind of in the air but not looking too good. I know everyone says pennface is a thing but the vast majority of people I've talked to these past couple of weeks say they're doing bad and then reveal they have an A- or B+ :/ 

this sounds all over the place but I guess I'm just looking for input, as a pre-med stem major first semester at penn, should I be worried about a bad first semester? I know this sounds really dramatic, excuse the anxiety, but I guess should I think about whether I'm actually suited for the subjects/careers I was interested in.

Visiting professor previously impeached and accused of crimes against humanity.,"María Paula Romo was impeached and censored  by the Ecuadorian National Assembly when she was a government minister accused of crimes against humanity, attempted bribery, among other charges.
  
Thus, with this precedent, it was requested r/UPenn rejected the hiring of Romo as a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania with at least 11,000 signatures of support, a request that was rejected  by the Uni. citing that there were no sufficient reasons to terminate Romo's position.

Dining Plan,"Probably a popular opinion but I'm going to rant about it anyways. The two year required dining hall plan is greedy as HELL from Penn admin. The price per swipe, making swipes unconvertible to dollars, and charging what Penn does on the plan for food that tastes like either road kill or rubber is absolutely atrocious and should be a crime. The other day I bit into a cheeseburger that cracked in half like a cracker. I'm not even a picky eater at all, but the food is genuinely below average at best and it's clearly a policy put into effect to get more money out of kids already shelling out an insane amount for everything else. Absolute highway robbery from the folks upstairs. I'm finishing the semester with a stupid amount of swipes left even though I use them often and am regretful to do so every time for the sorry excuse of whatever inedible trash that commons is serving that day. Based on the pricing it would most likely be cheaper to eat out smartly or cook instead, but no, this school wants to kick us in the face even more and drain my family's bank account even further.",1639680062,1,0

PHD vs. Professor Courses Your Experience?,"Hi all,

I was hoping to gather opinion and comparison insight from students that have taken both PHD taught and Professor taught courses. 

My experience so far at Penn has been so-so. Surprisingly, I have not been overly impressed with the curriculum in my classes thus far. 

I think it is the teaching style. The majority of my classes have been taught by PHD students. They are fantastic on a personal level. Great people. However, I have found that the majority are missing the ability to really connect to ""teach"" for learning purposes rather than stand and lecture, regurgitate info.

Has anyone else had this experience? The PHD students are clearly gifted. Yet at the expense for this school and comparing the teaching of other universities with actual professors my education at times feels like it is falling short.

Is ECON-001 worth it?,"I'm a sophomore in the College majoring in Political Science. After college, I hope to go into either law or politics (but I'm not considering business atm).

While ECON-001 does count as a major-related course for Political Science, I am concerned that taking it may hurt my GPA (very important as a pre-law student) and that I may not gain enough out of it for it to be worth the time, effort, and possible GPA scratch. But I of course wonder if knowing some basic economics would supplement my major well or at least be a good skill to know in life. So the question boils down to whether it is worth it to take ECON-001 as a non-business-focused Poli-Sci major.

(I would probably take either another political science course or PSYC-001 for the Living World sector next semester if I decide against ECON-001).

Question about Vagelos MLS program,"Hi,

I'm a senior that is applying RD to Penn and I'm extremely interested in pursuing the Vagelos MLS program, which is a very selective program that selects about 50 from the first-year class out of biochemistry/chemistry majors. I was wondering if I should include this in my why penn essay?

I plan to indicate in my essay that I'd like to pursue a degree in biochemistry. For some more context, I believe I would be a competitive applicant to the program if I am admitted to Penn (based on my stats + research experience) 

Could I say something such as ""Along with pursuing a major in Biochemistry, I'd like to pursue the Vagelos MLS program if possible...... and then talk about the advantages of that? Or would it be better to stray away from the topic since I am unsure if I will actually be accepted to the program",1640821175,1,0

"Is Remote Instruction and a delay in the opening of Campus a good thing, on balance? Not for Penn students!","On December 23, 2021, Penn’s administration stated that it “must take steps to prepare for a potential surge of  \[presumably “Omicron”\] cases in January” and that delaying  move-in and the classroom experience is “designed to optimally protect the health and safety of our community and sustain the educational and research mission that defines our university.” The decision follows Harvard University’s similar decision.

There is good reason to disagree that this decision protects the health and safety of the Penn community. There is also good reason to believe that the decision continues to diminish the educational and research mission that should define Penn. 

Consider: Penn students have to be somewhere in the world. Penn students at Penn will be subject to protocols and requirements that will better protect them on campus as opposed to being at home.  Penn students – almost all of whom are or will be vaccinated and boosted -- will rarely be around unvaccinated children or elderly adults (but they may be at home).  Penn students will substantially be protected by the vaccine on campus (and will have no obligation to be vaccinated or boosted if living off campus).  Older professors can still elect to teach remotely. The Omicron virus is extremely infectious but it is also apparently milder (the data on this is getting stronger).  In writing this, I recognize that a lot of Penn students will get Omicron, but they will get it at home as well, perhaps more so. Penn needs to be resourceful with its staff, residential, infrastructure and food services, if there is a big surge; but why is that not a challenge for any community in which a student lives? Knowledge for good; let's go!!

There is a major negative impact on the students every time the college experience is diluted, including to the educational and research mission and the mental health of Penn students.  Penn students are getting the short end of the stick (as are students at other colleges).  Why does Penn make its decisions after Harvard makes its decisions? Can Penn take the lead on this?  Some of the measures to protect against covid were obviously necessary and should stay in place.  Remote learning is a last resort, not a step to take every time there may be a surge in a virus that we are now vaccinated against.  The vaccine protects almost all Penn students from serious illness.  That is a game changer.  Time to resume relatively normal operations knowing that Penn has the ability if necessary to be flexible if the situation changes (such as a more serious variant that the vaccine does not afford protection to).",1640539282,1,0
