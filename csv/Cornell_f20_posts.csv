The SA Presidency: A Reformist Member's Perspective,"So I had the chance to watch the SA presidential debate and with regards to SA Reform, the two viable candidates, the current EVP and Undesignated representative, are shaky at best on this issue, however the latter would be far worse than the former.

The EVP claimed that she reached out to pro-Reform SA Members to gather thoughts. While this is true, it was more of a political calculation than a legitimate attempt to hear us out. In fact, she tried to play peacemaker when she has contributed to some of the toxic aspects of SA culture. In essence, she is like Mitch McConnell, who is also politically calculated and takes positions just to acquire and maintain power. Not the worst thing, but certainly far from optimal.

The current un-designated rep, on the other hand, is far worse. He loathed the fact that someone called him unrepresentative of the Black community. Well, its true! There have been countless reddit posts and sun articles by community members and SA members who are BIPOC disagreeing with his stances on SAFC, Julia Feliz and other incidents. This signals that he is running to be sole gatekeeper of Blackness, and anyone who does not agree with him is outside that gate. He has already attacked members internally and externally for having the slightest disagreements with him. 

He is essentially a version of Trump or Viktor Orban. You think the controversies are bad now? They will become more frequent if he is elected and the SA will turn into a country like Hungary, where dissent is extremely suppressed, the Prime Minister becomes more and more autocratic by the day, and reps have even less power than they do now. Also, I suspect the last president is working to make sure he is elected given their intense friendship.

I am voting for the current EVP, who while by no means perfect (see first paragraph), will not cement the SA's status as an oligarchy or autocracy.",1600984927,1,0

"I feel like some students enter GOVT classes not to learn, but to “teach” us all and this is way worse over zoom","Listen, I’m not knocking participation, because I get being passionate about a subject and asking questions to know more. I do that all the time, especially when I’m deeply interested in the class content. 

But some students seem closed off to what’s happening in class and bring everything back to their agenda. This is NOT specific to one political ideology- both conservatives and liberals do this a lot, specifically when their views aren’t “mainstream”.

It’s annoying when students either 1) have a whole debate with the professor during Q&amp;A, 2) try to correct a professor’s *opinion* in the zoom chat, or 3) start giving their opinion that’s only tangentially related when no one asked. These people also NEVER CITE ANY OF THE SOURCE MATERIAL FROM THE CLASS OR DIRECTLY ANSWER THE PROFESSOR’S QUESTION. They just parrot their beliefs, without contributing anything even slightly related to lecture. 

Hot take, your views aren’t as special and unique as you think. We don’t all need to hear them and be “challenged” by them in the middle of lecture, especially when they have little relation to what we’re learning that week. I’m not against sharing your views in class, but when you don’t reference the readings or pick apart one thing the professor said that contradicts your political worldview, just shut up. Make a group chat FFS.",1600973503,1,0

"Tire of school, now I want a job and to move on with life.","I never thought I would say this. Never.

Coming to Cornell I was scared of college and the workload. I eventually settled in and messed up my freshman years eventually switched majors to something that better fits my skill sets and passions. I was happy my sophomore year and even enjoyed my junior year. I thought it would be so hard to leave behind all the friendships and joys I love of this campus and all the memories that came with it. I had a rhythm, and I was feeling alright.

Now with my senior year pretty much a f-up and seemingly has feeling a loss of what could have been. Due to Corona, all the things that brought me joy have evaporated. I’m tried of p-sets, I’m tired of online learning, I’m tired for being shafted to basically teach myself this year and paying full tuition, I’m tired of TA’s saying to just go watch YouTube videos instead of helping me, I’m just tried of being a student. I know there’s some people that feel this way, but I always thought I’d want to be a student for awhile longer after college and to go to grad school and whatnot. So that’s why I never thought I’d feel this way.

Accountability and Change - Why I'm Running For University Assembly,"Hi Y'all, my name is Bennett Sherr (He/Him/His) and I am a senior studying ILR with a minor in LGBT Studies.  This semester is my first time running for any form of student government since middle school, I don't like asking for votes, coming across as self-servicing, and I don't like making promises that I can't keep.  Seeing the University's response to the Covid-19 pandemic and hearing the stories of members of our community who have gotten the virus has forced me to put my reservations on hold to try and make tangible change in our community.  I believe that we as students need to come together and hold the university accountable for the actions they take and the implications they have on our overall health, social lives, and academic success.  Our campaign focuses on three major points: Covid Response, Sustainability, and Student Life; and I have plenty of plans regarding each of the three.

As far as the fall elections go, our campaign is proud to have the most robust and detailed Covid Response plan out of anyone currently running for any position in student government.  I plan to make it so no student gets turned away from testing (regardless of their ability to schedule an appointment), freeze tuition and advocate for a partial refund, and increase the amount of doctors present at the Statler.  These are just some of the plans that I have put forward about how we at Cornell can better handle this crisis.

In terms of sustainability, our campaign is concerned that no other candidates have pledged to fight for carbon neutrality by the year 2030.  Our campaign has the boldest climate plan in the field!  This plan includes creating a community bike-share program and giving students free TCAT passes to reduce the need for cars, increasing Cornell's reforestation guidelines from reforesting 100 acres per year to 200 (which would see the university plant approximately more 60,000 trees per year), and to reinvest in Cornell University Renewable Bioenergy Initiative.  The journey to carbon neutrality by 2030 will not be an easy one, but we're certainly starting off on the right foot with these easy changes.

Lastly, I want to increase the quality of our student lives.  This means making Cornell first off more affordable.  I will fight to end the student contribution and university health insurance fee as well as freeze tuition.  I also recognize that food insecurity is a huge issue for many students on campus and will advocate for the expansion of the Low-Income Access Fund and Swipe Out Hunger Program.  Making student life better also means making housing more affordable.  I will do this by incentivizing Fraternities and Sororities to lease out their spare rooms at affordable rates.  As we increase access to housing, I also want us to increase access to quality mental healthcare.  That is why I want to hire a more diverse array of mental healthcare professions and CAPS counselors and increase the amount of group therapy sessions.  Our campaign also knows that our on campus lives are directly impacted by our surroundings, both natural and social.  All of us have seen the and possibly attended Black Lives Matter protests all across the country.  Instead of vilifying the largest mass movement in American history, like one of my competitors, My campaign will fight for racial justice, this means abolishing CUPD and having mental health professions act as first responders to all non-violent crisis on campus.

These are just some of the progressive policies that I will fight for if given the honor to represent you all on the University Assembly.  My full platform can be found at my website [http://sherr4ua.mystrikingly.com/](http://sherr4ua.mystrikingly.com/) or on my campaign instagram @bennett4ua.  I hope you all are as excited as I am about bring this progressive, student-first, agenda to the University Assembly and I hope y'all will join our campaign!",1600913415,1,0

I’m the guy who wrote the SAFC letter and I’m running for UA to fix it,"Hey everyone, I don’t really use reddit a lot except when my family sends me memes of trash pandas. But I wanted to reach out with you all because this community was really supportive of me this summer even if you didn’t know who I was. 
For those that don’t know, I wrote an article this summer about how I noticed that SAFC had used money to donate to a political fundraiser. I thought since it’s our money, it shouldn’t get involved in politics. While some people were pretty mean about it,  my friends kept sending me posts from the subreddit to cheer me up because out of everybody online a lot of you understood where I was coming from. 
That support was immeasurable to me. Some of you even wrote a letter backing me up. This summer, I became really involved with coming up with ways to fix the SA and make it an inclusive group that works for everyone. After talking with some people who knew more about the SA, they told me the best way to fix the culture was from the inside. So here I am, running for a seat on the University Assembly (UA) so that I can try to fix things through oversight and just being a voice for reform in the room. 
Since so many of you helped me through a pretty tough time this summer I felt I should reach out, thank you, and ask if you can help me fix things.

Can a grasshopper and toad,"I have this toad. It's a good toad. I catch it bugs every day. I try to keep the selection varied, and interesting. A little crunch from the millipede, some interactivity from the pill bug, slugs for an easy bite to eat, and crickets for the pleasure of the hunt. When everything froze and my basil died, the abundance of crickets in the yard disappeared overnight and I am having difficulty locating more. Feeding it exclusively pet store crickets feels like if a human friend of yours decided to go through the winter on a diet of only peanut butter cliff bars. The closer winter nears, the more days pass without food. 

Then I got a grasshopper. I was hoping the grasshopper would bless my toad with the wisdom of God, or at least a little psychic revelation, because this particular hopper was bottled from the Dalai lamas headquarters, but this bugger does nothing but sit on the wall. It was shaken around in this bottle in my backpack for many hours before I put it in the terrarium, and furthermore very nearly lost its neck when I was feeding the adjacent project because I needed to slide off the textured lid so the captured houseflies would not escape and did not see it actively stick its head through the grate when I started, but it seems ok and still hops around. Thanks for reading my question is if there is anyone I can contact at cornell who used to participate in the amphibian club who can discuss winter habits and psychology of toad and grasshopper alike (presuming amphibian owners know entomology) so I can preserve the creatures sanity and health. Yes contact me.

Professor Steve Bennoun Opinions Request,Hey I’m visiting here coming from UCLA’s subreddit. I am taking Math for Life Science students with Steve Bennoun at UCLA. I believe that this is the same Bennoun who taught in the math department at Cornell a little bit ago. So how was he? Am I screwed if I take this class with him if I want to get an A for medical school? Any opinions are greatly appreciated from this pre freshmen!,1600834671,1,0

Is there anywhere,"Is there anywhere I can go in person near campus but not on campus for public wifi, with seating which is not on the ground outside against the wall (like b&amp;n or starbucks downtown) but actually intended to be used and sat on? I will not use privately owned wifi. I can use campus wifi (see 2, then). I say not on campus because I am not a student and am trying to not be much of a bother, but near campus because I quite enjoy biking the roads that pass through and walking treks past the many waterways which Cornell has over time monopolized. 2: where nearby is a good indoors location to sit and read which is not outside in winter 
but is also not a business with regular traffic or tight channels 3: are there any Cornell students who are chess players and would like to play three or four ten minute games on chess.com at a time, my rating is realistically not higher than 1200 but sometimes I surprise myself; pvt message me and perhaps we can use this sitting place as an appropriately social distanced chess locale.

Career Fair Update [ENG STAFF POST],"There will be a career fair Monday, on the Statler 5th floor. We will be serving you a hearty risotto
accompanied by a delicious salad of selected baby lettuces, arugula,
fresh basil, walnuts, and apples, with a simple dressing of wine
vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, broken Gorgonzola, and cracked
pepper.  There will also be a selection of piping-hot freshly-baked
breads, some with cheese, some without.

To drink, a nice Pinot Grigio, and for dessert, tiramisu for those of
you who want to continue in an Italian vein, but for the more
adventurous, my very own special creme brulee! -- with just a touch of
almond.  And since we're all friends here, I'll let you in on a secret
-- that subtle little almond flavor comes from a little dash of
Amaretto.  Just a little bit of it.

Ah -- ah -- ah HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  Some of you actually believed me
for a minute there, didn't you?  You actually believed that Martha and I
had spent hours planning and preparing this meal, carefully
shepherding our limited Career Fair funds and cooking like demons to provide
our fellow miserable graduate-scolyers a taste of the experience of
our former peers, people who weren't admitted to MIT for graduate
school and ended up as street people wandering aimlessly around Palo
Alto mumbling things like ""Internet"" until they bumped into a tree and
four venture capitalists fell out and gave them jillions and skillions
of dollars to start ill-conceived ventures that opened at 58 and
immediately went to 75, then 90, then 120!  Yes, and by the time you
graduate it'll all be over, that's right, Netscape'll be bust, the
market will have suffered a ""correction,"" those guys at the Journal
will be talking about the Internet the way they talk about Ebola
Zaire, VC's won't touch computer science with a ten-foot pole and
it'll be another ten years before the next scam comes along and you'll
have missed it.

You'll have missed it, so you'll never know what it's like to have
your own table at Alain Rondelli up in the city, hundred and fifty
dollar dinners every night, John Markoff calling up on the phone and
200 demented idiots with greasy ponytails and Macintosh Powerbooks
cheering themselves hoarse for you in 34-101 every time you say
something like, ""I've been thinking about Emacs..."" -- yes, the train
will be gone and you'll have MISSED it, you'll just be left on the
platform with a broom in your hand and it'll be no Pinot Grigio for
YOU, buddy!

So just to get you ready, pal, it's another twenty-six Stefani's
pizzas.  FOUR of them with ANCHOVIES.  You don't like it?  Go ahead,
QUIT!  HAHAHAHAHAHA!  Plenty more where you came from!  We're going to
Star to try to find the cheapest soda we can, because we don't have
much cash and there sure are a lot of you thirsty little folks, aren't
there?  Sure hope we have enough money left over for ice cream
sandwiches, but if we don't, think of it this way: you probably
wouldn't want to eat the ice cream sandwiches we can afford on the GSL
budget, anyway.

So come on over to the fifth floor playroom tomorrow at about 12:15.
Or don't -- we don't care.  It's a seller's market.",1599966579,11,0

"Considered ED to engineering (BME) for class of ‘25, advice would be greatly helpful!!!","Hi I am from central NJ, and was wondering a few things about Cornell BME and Cornell as a whole. I am really considering it as my ED. 

Background on me
- Go to a magnet high-school that is focused on the health sciences
- Played soccer for my highschool for 4 years
- A music nerd and love every genre (besides country lol)
- I consider myself pretty social, hard working, and good at time/stress managment


1) I haven’t heard much about students not in the music school taking part in music bands or groups. If any engineering students play in any bands any info would be greatly appreciated! (I play jazz guitar and would love to play in a jazz, funk, or blues group)

2) I love science and bio, I find calc somewhat interesting and physics is ok. Are these “basic” classes at Cornell interesting? How are the BME classes in the later years in regard to projects, workload, and how interesting they are?

3) For engineering students, what would a normal week look like in regard to hours studying and hours socializing? Having an active social life is super important to me, but so is managing my school work.

4) After looking over the curriculum, a big concern of mine is the ability to take electives and classes outside of my major. I plan to minor in Business or neuroscience and would still love to take classes in art, music, ect. Does anyone have any advice or experience with this? (Atm I have 3 5’s from APs and plan to take 5 more this year and all of the tests. I have a 5 on ab calc, macro/micro econ, and am taking ap lit, ap spanish lit, ap psych, ap physics mechanics, and bc calc)

5) I am also concerned about the student life in the winter. What do students do for fun in the winter? Do students feel more stressed/depressed these months and what are some things they do to alleviate this stress? 

6) How is the competition and atmosphere in engineering? 

7) A weird question, but what has been the worst part about Cornell? What is something you wish someone told you about Cornell before applying? Hearing the negatives will help me have a grasp of the challenges here.

Any help will be greatly appreciated even if that means just answering one question!!!

Quick transfer inquiry,"Hello Cornellians. Hope you're all doing well during the current dumpster fire and are all in good health. I may be stressing out about this way too soon, but I am an incoming freshman at a not very selective pennsylvania public school who is hoping to apply to cornell as an either information science or computer science student for transfer in a year and a half. 

A very important point to make is that I was just a fantastic student in high school, graduating with a whole 2.5 GPA and not much to my name aside from a (maybe not objectively) narrative and some extracurriculars mostly pertaining to volunteering and service in the disabled community. I have since been working on getting treated for previously undiagnosed ADHD and hope to get my shit together. I know I sound like I have my head in the clouds, hoping to get at least a 3.7 by junior year and miraculously get enough weight behind my transcript for Cornell to not immediately throw my application in the trash.

Should I take wines?,"If you have taken HADM 4300, how difficult is it?

As a little background on myself, I am a junior in ILR and I have 3 years of experience working in the wine and spirits industry. I am currently a manager in a large liquor store on Long Island. I deal with wines on a daily basis and in general am fluent in tasting/suggesting wines based on pairings, profiles, etc. I am thinking about going and taking the level 1 sommelier courses.

"If you’re not premed/prelaw/pre grad school/pre-finance, stop obsessing over grades","Alum here \~6 yrs out. I got a 3.9 and worked my butt off. Like, literally made myself sick studying. In retrospect, nobody in the real world cared. If I could go back, I'd get a far lower GPA and socialize more, have more fun and not spend my weekends reading textbooks and doing problem sets making myself miserable.

**I realize that exempting med/law/finance folks is a huge caveat. Sorry.** So to anyone but those folks: it’s perfectly OK to just do “good”.  In retrospect, I’d trade my 3.9 for somewhere between 3.0-3.5 if it meant my 4 years at Cornell were less unbearably stressful.

I thought college grades correlated with success after college as much as high school grades correlated with the  college you got into. That was wrong. High school grades matter to obsess over, and you won, you got into Cornell. 

College grades? if you don't fall into one of those categories I listed, it's less important. I'm not saying do poorly, but find the point on the ""quality of life"" vs. ""GPA outcome"" spectrum you're OK with.

FWS Issues,"I am currently taking my second FWS and I am... really struggling.

I know my expectations are not high because I have already taken an FWS semi-online before (last semester) that has done the very things my instructor has not done above.

I have only been to three meetings so far and I honestly feel that I cannot tolerate staying in the class until December even though the workload is manageable and the topic is interesting. What should I do? Should I email the instructor asking to make these changes or risk an FWS change before the add deadline? Has anyone been in this situation before?

But this was a big section of people missing?!  Does Cornell or Cayuga Health notify you when you were in a classroom with someone that tested positive?

Everyone else seems to have their shit together and like, although I don't really care how anyone else does because the class is not even curved but I lowkey do not know what to do. For everyone else in the class it feels like they're just vibing their way through having a low level revision while the professor is SO FAST that I sometimes can't even note down what he says. I also absolutely hate that one freshman who has jolly good laughs with the professor and points out his mistakes as if they're colleagues. I have never felt so utterly lost in a course. I went to my TAs office hours and it didn't help at all because she just told me to read the book AS IF I HADNT BEEN DOING THAT.

Experience would be nice, but we can also train any new photographers - really the only requirement is that you have a camera :)

Last Week for Open Free Graduation / Profile Photos,"Hi, I have quite a few people in the backlog I'm about to shoot this Sunday, but I decided to open up Friday and Saturdays as this will be my last week of open photoshoots for the public. Note that the sessions because of the time it takes to adjust lighting, manual settings, posing etc takes about roughly 1:30 (this is just how it is because of location / outdoor shoots / fixing your poses etc.). 

Samples from previous shoots, you do not need to know how to model, but it would be very helpful and speed things up if you practice the poses assigned to you beforehand. 

\*Disclaimer I'm not a portrait photographer, I'm a photojournalist and a landscape photographer. The photos below are from my first shoots where I was learning to use my gear / control lighting and posing. It's a learning process. 

\*Sign Up Google Forms

The combined cap for 2208 will be 400; Freshman who were able to enroll in 2207 this semester with the higher cap are not expected to be able to enroll in 2208 this spring.

Grateful,"With everything going on in the world, this sure is hell is an incredible place to be right now. Being at Cornell and in the US in general is just such a surreal opportunity. Life is really good here and however hard it gets I’m just reminded of how lucky I am to be here. Particular to be able to have an in person experience during a global pandemic. As an international student, I am especially reminded of how rare and magnificent this opportunity is to be around so many diverse and bright people. Not to mention the strong career that comes out of this. 

I just hope that more people take a moment out of their stress and frustration with exams or the SA or life right now and just appreciate how good things are. Happy Thanksgiving everyone!",1606107068,1,0

Joining Cornell in Spring 2021 for MEng in Engineering Management. Had questions regarding how the in-person classes are being conducted and deferral. Thank you!,"Did you or your friends have an overlap with Coronavirus during your degree at Cornell? Any experiences you’d like share regarding the online lectures? Like if some of the classes are in person or not at all, and their frequency (in-person)? Is the campus completely dead or are there some activities being carried on as long as people have masks and are social distancing?

Any idea about the deferral? Do I have to fill out a form and I’ll be all set or is it to the school whether to grant it or not? Any idea about the deferral application deadline for Spring 2021 semester?

Do you regret choosing Cornell or are you happy with your decision?,"I recently got accepted to Cornell and I'm really happy about it but also confused if it's the right decision for me. Also because of current times it's difficult for me to visit the campus. I'm wondering if anyone can give insight as to if they are happy with their decision to go here or regret it. Also, any pros and cons of the University and the area. 

For some background, I applied to the engineering management master's program and also got accepted to a Master's in Industrial Engineering at another university. I'm a little hesitant to not choose Cornell because it is an Ivy league so I'm also wondering how much that helps in the future? Since I am an international student I have a limited time to find a job after I graduate, do you know what recruitment is like for the engineering management program?

Going home this week and dreading it,"Don't get me wrong, I love my family and everything, but I absolutely cannot be who I want to be at home. In a few words, my parents are very religious and culturally conservative and I'm just... not. I have to hide a lot of things about myself, like my sexuality, my future plans and ambitions, and much of my personality. Any morsel of confidence is replaced by filial subservience. I hate it, I'm honestly a little envious of people who have more modern parents. I hate that I feel this way, because I'm not going to have my parents forever and I do want to enjoy their presence, but it's hard to do when I'm fundamentally the opposite of who they wanted their son to be and they don't even know it.

I wonder if I should just be honest about everything to them, or hide it a bit longer. I'm afraid they'll disown me or something\*, but if nothing else, I still need their financial support. I doubt this is a unique problem, I thought perhaps posting on here would provide some fresh perspectives.

Why Ilr Essay,"I thought I could write something along the lines of research about labor economics, my passion for economics, a diverse amt of interests, why I value education, and started a nonprofit that took this education to create jobs for ppl on the street by getting them a GED then job offer, stuff like that. 

ie, I became interested in econ then researched labor econ with a professor specifically jobs during time of recession (not just covid), and found that people without diplomas suffer the most so this motivated me to continue tutoring people but a shift towards getting them GEDs so they would have a more secure job during recessions etc and how I want to build this more and why I want ILRI would have focused on specific ILR classes in economics and electives. 

But, I am under the impression that ILR wants some sort of essay that focuses on HR and the labor relations like organization in a business and stuff. I'm like WHAT. That will make my essay harder. Do I need to talk about HR and job community organization bc I have zero experience with that. I mean working at Kumon is one of my ECs so worst of worst I talk about specifics and think I can get away with that. But what do you guys think? 

Bonus: (I appreciate if you can comment on this, this goes for non ILRies who took ILR classes too or minored in it): What is your favorite thing about ILR?

Thank You. Sorry if this post was unorganized. I just freaked out bc I have 0 experience in HR or am not yet into that. I will use my ILR degree for an MBA or Law School if admitted. But for undergrad, my biggest focus is Business or Econ. 

Rn, I am taking AP Gov and AP Econ. I already emphasized econ enough but if I can put AP Gov to use in the essay and talk about politics too, I'd be cool. But I'm scared about "" Since you have plenty of space in this essay, you should draw on anecdotes that affirm your interest in people and policy in the workplace. ""

How to help keep the Senate blue and the help Biden Administration,"If you feel powerless about the current political climate with the lies about ""voter fraud"" and Biden's transition, here is one way you can help. 

Georgia's runoff elections will determine if the Senate will be blue during the start of the Biden administration (source: https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-2020-election-results/2020/11/11/933814538/with-alaska-gop-victory-balance-of-power-in-senate-to-be-decided-in-georgia). The majority of top Republicans are going along with Trump's temper tantrum because they want his followers votes, and that includes the votes for the runoff race in Georgia. Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are Democrats running for the Georgia seats in the senate, and if they are both able to be elected it will be a lot easier and faster for Biden and Kamala to pass the legislation needed to combat covid.

How Does Applying to Be a TA Work?,"Non-CIS major here, also want to shed light for everyone else who’s curious, especially after some conversations with some friends in different majors.

- What if someone has experience in the material of the class but took the next class? (i.e. MATH 1120 but someone wants to TA for MATH 1110)

I do plan to be away - from some time at November 27th through December 31st, so it seems that I should use that travel form.

Heads up for people living around West Campus!!,"At first I brushed this off as a mistake or coincidence, but then the same thing happened to my friend soon after and it's freaking me out so I have to talk about it.

A few days ago, I was waiting at the bus stop of one of the off-campus apartments around West when this guy who was wearing a Cornell shirt approached me and acted like he knew me. At first I thought maybe it was someone I knew but didn't recognize because of the mask and because he just casually said ""Hey, how are you doing?"", but it soon became clear that he wasn't someone I knew and when I ignored him, he just left the bus stop the way he came, which struck me as really odd.

Then today, my friend was on the bus and the same guy got on a stop after, and started acting like he knew her. She was super nice, unfortunately, and he ended up forcing her to give him her number and touching her earrings and making her incredibly uncomfortable and she had no idea what to do. He then proceeded to hug her as he got off the bus, which made her even more uncomfortable, and now she's afraid because he has her contact information and he's a student. Once I heard her story, I knew this wasn't a coincidence and we were both incredibly creeped out.

Neither of us were sure what to do, or if we could even report this anywhere since he didn't *technically* do anything, so I thought this was the best place to put this information in the hopes that anyone who sees this knows to be careful!",1605128779,1,0

CS2800 and No Breaks,"I just finished my first round of prelims, only to find out my next round of prelims starts the following weekend on a Sunday. I also find out that CS2800 is adding another exam, a semi-final, on top of the existing remaining prelim exam #2 and final exam. 

I realize that the semester is different and that we all have to adapt, but honestly, in what world is an extra test possibly lessening the burden on students? I respect Professor Zuylen and I think she is an amazing professor. I also realize that it would be frustrating for professors to find out that their students cheated on assigned homework and exams. But that's been a frustration for honest students too since everyone is cheating and driving the median up, making the grading scale unfair. 

In addition, a lot of students, including myself, have already made travel plans to leave the Ithaca area (to return home, not travel). Now, I have to look into changing those plans in order to attend the extra in-person exam (something I am scared to do amid a pandemic).

I honestly do not know if I can survive my current workload and the current pace with an ***additional*** exam. I just got finished with an awful first round of prelim exams and I don't know if I can continue to just study all day and all week for the next few weeks without a significant break in between.

Set of Real Numbers is Countable,"I'm looking at these two proofs - one from CS 2800 and one from a class at Berkeley (example 3).

[https://courses.cs.cornell.edu/cs2800/wiki/index.php/Proof:The\_set\_of\_reals\_is\_uncountable](https://courses.cs.cornell.edu/cs2800/wiki/index.php/Proof:The_set_of_reals_is_uncountable)

[https://math.berkeley.edu/\~arash/55/2\_5.pdf](https://math.berkeley.edu/~arash/55/2_5.pdf)

I understand Professor George's proof, but I'm confused about the Berkeley proof.   Why does the Berkeley proof consider the decimal representation of real numbers between 0 and 1 and not just the real number itself, since it's already in decimal form (since it's between 0 and 1). Doesn't this just add potential holes in the argument, since there are either 1 or 2 possible decimal expansion forms?

I'm not comfortable with the real numbers or decimal expansions, so there's a good chance I'm missing something. My friend wrote a proof that uses decimal expansion but I feel like this makes sense since he wants all real numbers to be in decimal form, not just (0,1)

Better headphones,"Hello cornell community, 

I see so many lost souls with pieces of plastic stuffed in their ears on campus. Buy the HD6XX headphones from dropbox, they are 200 dollars and are PREMIUM sennheiser HD650 headphones at an astonishing price. 

I think many of you have the resources for high-end audiophile setups but also many are budgeting personal funds as independent persons making their way in an expensive college life. With textbooks and food and associated fees of student living, many may forget about the music they enjoy, permitting the inevitable deconstruction of their favourite tunes to forgettable soundbites as the complexity of the soundstage is lost in the transition from the digital realm through cheap in-ear monitors. Assuming a digital setup, I cant think of a more affordable entry into audiophile tastes--and little here is sacrificed, as they are constructed with the same driver materials from the same factory as the HD650's. The only difference between this and the classic sennheiser experience is a softer fabric earcup, and slightly worse cable materials, which is changeable. And listen to abba.",1602916335,1,0

Predestiny - A Tale of Loss and Acceptance,"I did bad on a test. Big deal. I'll get the next one and pick up my game. 

I then devote myself full heartedly to this class, hell I even drop another class for it. I live it and breathe it and seriously do the most. I know the textbook like the back of my hand and do just as great on homeworks. Surely the fact that 70% of the grade is exams is thought but that just means I need to work harder, right?

Then comes the 2nd exam and after multiple days of nonstop studying I....get the exact same bad score. How could this be possible? I did all the practice, read the textbook religiously multiple times and never missed a lecture.

There's one last chance I guess. Not expecting any miracles here, I'm past that, just hoping to show any sort of improvement. Maybe just enough to suggest to whoever gives me a grade at the end that there might be some microscopic reason to have mercy on me in assigning final grades. 

Aaaaaand I get the EXACT SAME GRADE AGAIN. This is bad. This is very bad. Not only have I done poorly 3 times in a row, I've shown no reason through my exam grades why I deserve a not awful grade. Will I even pass this class? Oh my god.

Some time passes. I get sad, then angry, then sad. I cycle through the feelings until I reach one final sadness plateau and the sadness escapes from me slowly like the leftover oxygen exhaled in the final seconds of a deep breath. 

I realize I did poorly. I realize I can do nothing about it now. I realize I still have so much to be thankful for. I see the worth in myself. I accept that I put my strongest foot forward. I still harbor a little bit of anger towards the instructor for letting a student like me exist, for letting a screaming effort go unheard in a tunnel of cold calculated darkness. I look forward to putting this chapter of Cornell behind me. Think of this day as one in the great tale of my life. Admit I've faced worse before. Look to the future.

I am currently taking calculus honors (which I am doing fairly well in, but is my lowest grade). Does Cornell architecture have a having focus in Math and physics? I remember seeing that for architecture you only need 1 MQR credit/class to graduate and I saw other MQRs like “introduction to Payton” or “visual imaging in the digital art” which seems more interesting than calculus or any the other more math based MQRs.

Seeking out MS in CS students/applicants/alumni for advice!,"Hey all,

I've recently heard about the Cornell computer science MS program (not MEng), and must say I am highly intrigued by it.

I am an international student, will probably have a GPA around 3.55 by the time of admissions next year, and so far have 6 months of research and one semester of teaching experience. 

There are still incomplete parts of my application (LoRs, SoP, GRE etc.) as there is time but I am worried that my GPA could set me back.

This is a pretty different program compared to other MS programs as it is more teaching-heavy,  so it would be great to hear some feedback from current students, applicants, or alumni regarding the program. I will list some talking points below:

* Has anyone continued to a PhD program at Cornell or elsewhere after completing this program? MS in CS admissions page is quite insistent that those considering a PhD should apply directly to the PhD program.

* What factors did play a role in you choosing this program over others?

* I would appreciate any details regarding the intensity/workload of the teaching part.

YAF's tweet about the SA,"So, I'm seeing some posts about this, and I kinda want to hear the perspectives of the people who think this is a bad thing. Specifically, here's my thought process:

\- Anti-disarmament people were getting doxxed/harassed for a while (yes, some pro-disarmament members were getting harassed too, but they were the ones who started the entire 'insult anyone who disagrees with you, threaten them, and list their names on social media' shit)

\- The SA leadership is mostly leaning to one side and did not seem to care.

\- The Cornell admin did not seem to care either.

So, either people could've started doing what the pro-disarmament side was doing (doxxing/harassing), but that I assume is illegal and not something a student would want to do. Or, they could've tried to bring more attention to this topic, which they seemed to have done. 

I'm wondering what else they could've done? Also please feel free to criticize any of the premises of this argument (if you think I'm being biased). To me, it kinda seems like a rational thing to do, but people seem to disagree, so I want to hear some differing opinions.",1608260823,8,0

NLP 4740 question,"Does anyone know why we are supposed to do this QA project individually when in 2017 where people were working in groups of 2-4? Source: [https://www.scribd.com/document/421276582/Project-3-Write-Up](https://www.scribd.com/document/421276582/Project-3-Write-Up)

Considering we spent one full lecture on Question Answering systems, with the TA just reading off the slides word for word (as per the usual in this class), I don't understand why students are required to complete a rather large implementation, going into finals week, with amounts of data that some computers (+colab) cannot process without crashing? 

Considering this is not the first time an issue like this has happened in the 4740 history, Source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/9von6k/nlp\_piazza\_post\_requesting\_extra\_time\_for\_project/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/9von6k/nlp_piazza_post_requesting_extra_time_for_project/) , where only one TA is truly able to help students with the project, I am disappointed that during the **PANDEMIC**(!!!), the stress has not been alleviated, and that the same problem recurs (something I wish my RNN would actually do rn).

'Discussion' based OH stuff are a nice idea, but it is not going to help when students' code is crashing, and no further assistance can be given. Not to mention the amount of OH which have been canceled lately, which is understandable, but then the assignment should also be modified if the help needed cannot be provided. If the course staff (+prof) do not want to help (or cannot, which happens) debug students' code (which is partially understandable), then why are the assignments so vague and open ended?

I would hope that the course would focus on teaching material in a clearer way, by dividing up the focus of the class. If that means teaching the ML methods and fundamental Pytorch material from the ground up, then so be it. Please stop making assumptions that students are already familiar with such material (the prereq is CS2110, NOT CS4780!).  I still do not understand the rationale in spending most of September + October discussing feature sets, and easier algorithms such as NB and Viterbi, and then all of a sudden expecting students to pick up NNs (and more complex architectures), implement them from scratch AND write long reports with in depth analysis, when zooming through key modern (attention, what's that?) approaches to the subject.",1608251237,12,0

MEng in CS worth the cost?,"I'm a career switcher with a Bachelors in Economics from a well regarded liberal arts school hoping to break into the tech industry, and I was recently offered admission to the MEng in CS program at Cornell.

Anyone have any input on whether this program would be worth the 70k I'd have to take on in debt considering the alternative cheaper routes available to break into tech? For some context I was also offered admission to UIUC's online MCS, which would be 20k all in.

I would love to spend a year at Cornell, but I'm just not sure if that price tag is justifiable with no family financial support. All thoughts appreciated!",1604071645,1,0

Let’s save Cafe Pacific from running out of business!,"Cafe Pacific is Collegetown’s best kept secret. But sadly, the owner is considering shutting down the business. She told me she was barely able to survive this past summer, given how empty Ithaca was, and that this school year hasn’t brought as much business as she expected. She’s been there for over 10 years, and I’d hate to see her run out of business because of COVID. 

For those of you who don’t know, Cafe Pacific is located across the street from Mango Mango and serves a variety of Japanese comfort dishes, desserts, and boba. The food is always delicious and the prices are fair. But above all, the owner is honestly one of the kindest people I’ve ever met. She always makes an effort to talk to her customers and takes random acts of kindness to the next level. For example, when I ate there yesterday, she brought me and my friends an assortment of free cakes after discovering it was one of our birthdays! 

Yes, the atmosphere is a little dingy, and the wait times can sometimes be a little excessive. But she essentially runs the whole restaurant on her own. She dedicates her life to serving this community. I say it's time to return the favor. So let's help her out during these trying times! 

Here's some additional info about Cafe Pacific if you’re thinking about going: 

* They deliver on [ithacatogo](https://www.ithacatogo.com/restaurants?collapsable=1)
* Also can order online through [paywithway](https://paywithway.com) 
* They have seating inside (it’s never really crowded, so I feel safe eating there) 
* They’re open 2PM-12AM, Sunday-Thursday and 2PM-1 AM, Friday-Saturday 
* Consider paying with cash! Cash is always better for small businesses because credit card fees = :(",1604069035,1,0

I think a lot of students right now feel that they're struggling alone, and simply hearing how other people are also struggling with classes and prelims might curb a lot of self-blame and self-hatred. Unlike major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression, I think everyday issues that happen to everyone (school stress, imposter syndrome, loneliness etc) are more easily alleviated by talking to friends and teachers. I'm not saying school stress can't cause depression, I just think supplementing people with some comfortable social interaction might go a long way in making us feel less isolated.

Here are the breakout room topics. Please comment with any other ideas, and share with your friends. If you can't make this time due to time zone conflicts, please feel free to suggest a time or hold a copycat session.

Is it possible to get at least a B in my classes this semester? I didn’t do well on the first prelims.,"Basically I’m dumb and thought this was HS and didn’t study, and also took too many classes, so for my first set of prelims, I got mostly Cs. 

I am slowly trying to get my shit together (I met with my advisor, and I dropped 6 credits, went from 22 to 16 total, found tutors, office hours, etc), and am doing a little better on my second round of prelims. 

The class that worries me the most is math 1920. I slacked off hard. I think I got a C- for the first prelim, and a B- for the second prelim, and these tests were worth 20% of my grade each 😬",1604016938,1,0

I wanna say a big thank you to Prof David Mimno!,"Professor David Mimno has been a godsend during this pandemic. He gave everyone a 10 (10!) slip days this semester. Even when I used all of my slip days the first week of school due to a major health scare (not covid), he told me to take as many as I need. 

Afterwards, when I realized that this health issue might be long term, he was the one who encouraged me to go to SDS about my health issues and to get a letter asking for accommodations. Even more, he has a no questions asked policy about extensions and when I went to office hours, reminded me that I need to calculate days for all of the other classes I missed and to make up their work. He reminded me that it's important to prioritize sleep and well, my sanity. 

His extensions have allowed me to keep up to date with all of my other classes and it's thanks to him, despite going to urgent care maybe once a week, for my first time at Cornell (this was also due to a major change), I'm on track to pull a 4.0. 

Thank you so much Professor Mimno and the many other Information Science professors who have been so accommodating this semester.",1604013623,1,0

"Hey, I get it","I’ve been hesitant to post anything or to look at this subreddit, as posts fill the page with thoughts around anxiety, depression, suicide, and more. And with the utter shit show that is 2020, I want to share that yes. I get it. I’ll see posts about gpa. About prelims. Scores on tests and more. And it makes me ache with worry. Because I get it. 

One of the big reasons I chose not to go back was that worry. That in the midst of the pandemic, and a horribly polarized election, somehow Cornell stress would be even more amplified. And that I would have no balance. I know freshman year, I used to describe the Cornell stress continuum as a running hamster wheel.... and after last semester, I realized quickly that I wouldn’t be able to adapt to a semester like this without my parents. But that isn’t an option for everyone. 

I want to voice some frustration for us all. That despite how awful this year has been, academic stress and pressure is being made worse. After a particularly bad prelim, I shared with a professor my issues with severe test and generalized anxiety, to be met with a “try harder” and a blank stare. Empathy seems to be absent as some profs spend more time obsessing that students will cheat and that exams must be made harder as a result, punishing a good majority of students who go about their day and try their best. Empathy doesn’t seem to exist when as students we break down, and need more time, to be met with emails asking us to immediately submit our work or face consequences. That is for some of my profs. 

For others, they genuinely have given me time and accommodations. In a semester of hell, I developed severe back and shoulder issues, and yet some of my profs have taken the time to humanize and sincerely care. To talk to me and spend office hours letting me just rant. There are big thank you’s I want to send to those professors, who ask for feedback and implement it. Who are lenient in their grading, to acknowledge the challenges faced by students. 

Yet the common theme is that we are all burnt out. And we are scared. And we are tired, so so tired. As many have shared, please do contact the crisis line, caps, or a therapist you can access if you find yourself thinking of suicide, self harm, or just being generally upset and needing someone to talk to. From my experience- talking to someone honestly does make things better. And please reach out to others, including myself. I can’t begin to express how much I understand the struggles and pain so many of you have expressed. I get it. For many weeks I felt low in the pits, till I ended up reconnecting with a therapist, and started just talking about the brain fog and fear from this year. 

I know many of you are also anxious for the election- same here. I am so fricken scared every day- but we are going to get through this. If you can- VOTE- if you can’t, share info about voting with your friends who can, and definitely please, have a conversation with someone if you feel incredibly anxious or scared or anything- talking to others helps, especially when we realize that we aren’t alone. 

And for those of you scared about your gpa... about your grades... about your future.... I get it. I’m a premed who at one point was incredibly obsessed with numbers- and the reason I no longer am is because I realized quite a while ago that learning sometimes needs failure. And that to challenge yourself to the point of hurting yourself.... that isn’t worth it if you plan on helping others in the future. We need to realize that loving ourselves is equally important if long term we want to succeed. My best friend always says “so what if you fail a class? You can retake it. So what if you don’t do well on an exam? You can study differently and do well the next time. You know what you don’t get a next time on? Life. You got one life, and if you spend it being miserable and sad all day, you’re going to have nothing but regret. So please. Please think of yourself and give yourself a big big hug. “. And honestly, those words are something we have to tell ourselves. 

I know I am an internet stranger, and it may seem weird to hear this. But I’m here for you. I’m sending you the biggest virtual hugs you could ever get. And I’m here if you need someone to talk to, rant to, or just listen to what’s going on. Please reach out, and please please please, don’t forget who matters the most- you do!!!!",1604011827,1,0

Looking for Full Stack Web Developer,"Hi all,

I am a senior studying Engineering and CS at Cornell. I am building a company called DroneHub ([flydronehub.com](https://flydronehub.com)) to provide the most affordable nationwide drone imagery on the market. I've written a tool that programs DJI drones to capture images from Google Earth views so that you can pre-plan the exact images you want to receive. There is no technology that currently does this.

There are several nationwide drone pilot networks that allow you to hire pilots and request drone work. In conducting tests, I've found that pilots are willing to fly and capture imagery for 30% less than normal when using these automated flights. Industries such as Real Estate, Construction, and Energy pay hundreds of dollars an hour for pilots to manually fly and collect imagery. By planning flights with Google Earth, the same services can be offered for much less.

I am seeking students who have experience with Full Stack Web Development to work with on this. If you are qualified and interested in helping to develop and build this, please send your resume to [contact@flydronehub.com](mailto:contact@flydronehub.com)

Your contribution will be rewarded with significant equity in the company",1603995027,1,0

r/cornell is ranked third best university subreddit (half shitpost),"As I was applying to college this year, I visited a lot of universities subreddits. Even if there are some memes you find everywhere, I was hit by all the little specificities. So, as I only have a few days left to complete my applications, I was thinking, why not spoil the little time I have left  by ranking universities subreddits? 

1. UCLA ( r/ucla): LA kids are roasting anything that breaths: Berkeley, USCC, UCSD, their own university... It is one of the most active university subreddits, with a wide range of quality content.  

2. University of Michigan's ( r/uofm) subreddit is one of the most creative college subreddits. There is a reason why QS ranks them first in memological science.  

3. Cornell ( r/Cornell) has a nice and chill subreddit, with the absolute best campus pictures. 
4. UC Berkeley ( r/berkeley) has a state of the art subreddit, with more serious content than anywhere else. It is definitely not feel good, since 50% of content is about failing or being depressive. Come on bears, less whining, more memeing.
5. Notre Dame ( r/notredame): ND students are the absolute bests at roasting their own college. Cool pics too.

&amp;#x200B;

Honorable mentions: 

Johns Hopkins's (r/jhu) subreddit, despite being small is genuinely funny, even for an outsider

The University of Central Florida  ( r/ucf)  has one of the biggest university subreddits, with a wide range of quality content

Almost all of the University of California's subreddits (particularly r/UCSD) are active and fun. If calling UC Berkeley UCB does not make you laugh, you can skip

The University of Waterloo, Canada's pride ( r/uwaterloo) has one of the biggest university subreddits and was one of the few universities to reach r/all 

Dishonorable mention:

The University of Chicago's ( r/uchicago ) subreddit members spend their time making jokes on the fact their university is not fun. Neither are they.

Harvard ( r/Harvard ) is disappointing.  It is a middle sized subreddit, where 30% of the members have nothing to do with Harvard, 30% are pretending to be Harvard students while the others are sucking each other's dick in a circle (they call ""announcing someone you are a Harvard student ""dropping the H bomb).

FDSC 3940/5940,"I don’t know if anyone here took this class this semester, but if it is ever offered again with the current professor, please do not take it. It was the most disorganized class I have ever taken by an incredible margin, and the grades that were just released are not at all reflective of student performance. Many of my friends have received B or lower grades despite turning in all work and receiving generally good scores on the very few assignments that were actually “graded.” For clarification, there were no exams nor feedback given on the semester-long project that supposedly made up a large portion of our grade. The class was “curved” despite there being no factors to discernibly differentiate grades throughout the semester. 

If anyone here took the class this semester, please consider emailing administration to correct the injustice that was this entire class. I wouldn’t post here if I wasn’t 100% confident that many students have been wronged by the conduct of the professor and the experience of 3940.

Transfer Question,"Hi Guys,

I am looking into applying for transfer from a midwest school. I am currently planning on applying to the school of engineering but I am not entirely sure yet what I want to major in. If I decide to major in something that is not engineering and want to transfer to A&amp;S, would that be possible? I know it is pretty easy for those who started their freshman year at Cornell, but how seamless or otherwise would the process be for an external transfer?

Thanks!",1609351753,1,0
What I learned from fucking up my first prelim at Cornell,"This semester I took ECON 3030 as a freshman with credits, despite being advised by the department not to. I was sure I wanted to major in Econ and maybe CS so I just wanted to get the core done. I didn't aim to do super well, just a median grade. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a British school where they don't use GPA and only finals matter, plus prelims were open notes and the presidential debate was on the night before my 1st prelim, so I just flipped through the lecture notes in front of the tv. Unsurprisingly, I did NOT do well. The mean and median was 80%, and I got 60% with survey points added on. It was a D. I got a D in a core class and my first class in my major. I freaked out. I was terrified, lost, and just very disappointed in myself. How the hell am I going to survive the next 4 years? Will I graduate with a 1.0 GPA? 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really understand anything in class while everyone else seemed to know what they were doing. I felt really dumb. And then I realized I can't study the way I did in high school anymore. I took McKee's advice and started redoing all the discussion questions and make a formula sheet before the prelim, closing any knowledge gaps, go to OH when necessary, and made an effort to do psets instead of just letting my study group carry me. Always do the questions that look the scariest. I got 94% and 92% in the 2nd prelim and final respectively, and a B+ at the end, better than I could ever hope for after that first prelim. I am still slightly miffed because I would've gotten an A if my first prelim didn't count, but I know I had to give myself the time to learn how to learn. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you will find some solace in my story. I thought I was just too dumb for Cornell, and I know I'll feel that way again in the future, but I'm not and neither are you. And so what if I got a bad grade from that class? What matters much more is that you've done your best given the circumstances. Times are tough, and Cornell is even tougher. Your grades are not you. It's never the end of the world and it's never too late.",1609350727,1,0

advice needed for prospective student,"hi! I hope it’s okay I post here because it’s not necessarily an admission question and more so about the majors at Cornell. 

So, I’m finalizing my application for the class of 2025 but for the life of me I can’t decide which school to apply to. I’m really interested in the “end result” of biomedical engineering — i.e. coming up with/producing innovative medical devices, applying my knowledge in a technical way — and I’ve done well in my physics/calculus classes in high school, but to be completely honest, I don’t enjoy physics / calc too much. I don’t know if it would be a dumb decision to pursue engineering if I love the career outcome but dislike the intro stuff I need to do to get there? I can put in the work but I’m just worried I’ll be super depressed 

on the other hand, I’d major in bio with a concentration in neuro at CAS. I feel like whereas I might be too dumb for engineering, I could definitely handle bio. I love love love neuro, but I dislike the job prospects because while I’m interested in a pre medicine path, I’m not 100% committed to that. At least engineering would provide a solid career.

advice?? sorry if any of this is dumb loll I’m just so torn and trying to minimize hassles down the road should I get accepted / enroll in Cornell. I guess another option is to major in bio at CAS and minor in biomed engineering and then transfer if I realize I do like biomedical engineering more? idk. Thanks for any input!!",1609343083,1,0

Another such post,"TW: mental health

What do you do when you don’t know where else to go? You post on Reddit. I’m hoping maybe someone will understand how I’m feeling and give me the words I can use to keep going. 

Some background about me, but I obviously don’t want to give away who I am so I’ll keep it a bit vague. I’m a sophomore in CS, I’m gay, and I’m from a conservative, homophobic family. My parents are South Asian in culture and I grew up with that whole “nothing is ever enough, the bar is always higher” mentality. I want nothing more than to graduate someday, hermit in an apartment with enough money to get by and an interesting job. Maybe one day settle with a partner. 

But I’m so scared of not being able to do what I want to do for reasons outside my control. Getting the job I want isn’t going to happen unless I’m lucky enough through the hiring process. Finding a male partner will never be easy because of my family situation. My grades are slipping this semester, clouding the future further. My best friend is dealing with so much right now as well and I feel helpless because I can’t do much to help him. Slightly less concerning, but still another thing on my plate, is I’m running out of money. 

I am dealing with imposter syndrome, frustration, anger, and anxiety. I have no idea what counts as good enough. I do not know if I’m on the right track, or if I’m gonna end up okay. I don’t know if the choices I’m making now are good. I’ve thought about ending things a couple times in the last few months, but the handy hotline was very helpful. 

I can do everything right and still lose. I’m losing in so many areas right now, and while I’ve also had some wins, I feel like the losses are more impactful than any wins. Lately I’ve been neglecting my health, either lazing around in bed or working to the point of nausea on a task and still not getting enough done. This is a low point. 

Thanks for reading through this, I really appreciate that someone out there is listening to what I have to say. I don’t feel like there’s anyone in my life I can talk about all this with. I feel better putting it on here because you can choose whether to read or not, but if I ask a friend then I’m just burdening them with my useless nonsense.",1609319461,1,0

going remote this semester was a sad error, yay for home comfort but nay to staying inside practically every day and not being able to go around campus during the better part of the year

I ruined my eyes (further) with everything online

my grades could’ve been better

I should’ve put more time to work on that frog, I actually might get a C in the class and that’s really depressing to have been in the B-B+ range and have it be brought down by a C- frog assignment that I’ve gotten up to a B+ now on my own time during break for fun

*now I will*

use up the paper stuff I have from past school years for studying to have less screen time and ease my eyes (maybe find eye drops lol any recommendations?)

make cool frog extensions by the end of break to do cs 1110 good and not feel like a C- embarrassment who just didn’t manage their time well and did poorly in some other classes too

not worry so much, take a rest during part of break and do some chill activities, watch funny videos, catch up with people online and things I couldn’t do that much during school, prioritize self care, and just look forward rather than backward 😇

Financial Aid Increase for Single Rooms?,"Looking to live on-campus next year (too lazy to cook and do other adult things).

Disingenuous tenant,"I am Michael Busch and I would like to set the record straight on these libelous statements and assumptions. The fact of the matter is that this tenant is not telling the truth. The three of them toured the property and the last email I had from them was that they were ""anxious to sign the lease."" I prepared a lease for them and heard nothing. I asked the 4th person who had recommended them if she knew what was going on and she said she would write them. I then received an email from them that said ""It turns out that Maia doesn't feel comfortable with the house manager living in such close proximity to the tenants so she isn't interested in signing. Thus we can't sign that lease. So sorry.""  There was no mention of financial hardship, nor concerns about covid, which they have since voiced. I wrote and told them that I thought it was completely irresponsible to make a verbal agreement, ignore the correspondence with the lease and a subsequent inquiry and 4 days before the beginning of the lease to back out. Paul, the house manager, who was a professional chef and had served as house mother is a sorority at Cornell and been named ""house mother of the year in 2000"" was offended at her implications and told her so. I have had many satisfied tenants over the years. The house rents significantly below market because I think the rent situation in this town is absurd. None of this has anything to do with Maia saying she could not afford to live there. That was never stated to me. Anyone's status as a DACA student is immaterial to this discussion.  What it is about is the irresponsible behavior of these three bowing out of their verbal commitment, being non-communicative, and ditching their lease leaving me in the lurch and their oblivious attitude that actions have consequences. Paul's comments stand on their own. I'm sure if someone insulted you in that way, you might be inclined to respond in kind.",1609226068,1,0

Taking CS2100&amp;2800&amp;MATH1120 together?,"Hi,

I was wondering what the stress level/workload of taking CS2100&amp;2800&amp;MATH1120 together would be.

This is my first semester at Cornell and honestly I'm a little stressed out just from the intro courses.

I'm taking CS1110 and Math1110 rn with three pretty easy courses(one being FWS) and I'm expecting As on most of them(based on my prelim&amp;assignment grades), but I heard CS2100&amp;2800 are much harder and I have no idea what MATH1120 will be like compared to 1110. 

Also I spend literally all my time studying and I'm scared that I'm only getting good grades because I try really hard... I know this sounds weird but I'm worried that upper level courses won't be enough from just trying hard(needing some talent in CS/Math, etc.)

I'm just really anxious that I won't be able to handle taking those three classes together considering that taking intro level courses wasn't an easy ride. 

Can anyone who's taken them provide insight?",1607238198,1,0

Homework Grading,"For one of my classes, I have homework that I turned in on October 26th that’s STILL UNGRADED. When I last asked, the Professor said the TA had not responded to his emails, but that he was unaware of the problem. But it’s been 2.5 weeks since then? For two of my other classes, November 14 and 18 homework’s have also been ungraded. How people so far behind on grading??? I swear this has never happened to me before. 

Oh and for the first class, homework solutions stopping getting released so I have no idea how I did on the psets lmao.",1607209002,1,0

Engineering Liberal Arts Requirement,"So I noticed that on the class roster, some classes have multiple Liberal Arts Distribution categories. For example, PSYCH 1101 has the distribution categories labeled as  SBA-AS, SSC-AS. Does this mean that you can count it as either of those categories or does this class count as both? I'm asking in terms of the ""At least six courses chosen from at least three of the thirteen categories listed below totaling a minimum of 18 credits;"" Requirement.

At what point does it become too late to totally change directions?,"I’m a first semester freshman, and already not feeling so good about premed. I feel really confident that going into medicine IS what I want to do, but I’m worried that the path to get there might be too difficult for me and that I’ll be stuck with a pretty unemployable major if it doesn’t work out. I feel like quitting already would be preemptive, so my schedule for next semester is pretty much all geared towards premed. I feel like if I were to try out something new sophomore fall I’d already be hella behind (in classes, ECs, internships, etc.) And I don’t even have the slightest clue what I would change into. This is all reallyyyyy stressing me out—four years seems short enough to decide what I want to do, and really I have much less time than that. Would really appreciate some advice rn, from really anyone that has undergone a major change in plans or has felt similar doubts :(",1607208255,1,0

Freshman internships?,"Sorry I’m really uninformed and never done any internships before, how do I get started? I’m taking 1110 this semester and I don’t have anything exemplary to show in my resume. Is it reasonable to expect good offered with just this? Most of my friends seem to apply for so many internships and I’m here to embarrassed to ask them how this works, where do you get connections, where do you apply, when is the right time to apply. How common are freshman internships I’m feeling pressurized to apply for one. I though I’d wait until sophomore year so that I’d have atleast done CS 3110 or a CS elective like machine learning :( can someone give me more insight on this? Thank you",1607206627,1,0
