What are some grad programs that realistically open career opportunities?,"The job market is a competitive place, and having an undergrad degree alone doesn‚Äôt really set you apart from others.

I haven‚Äôt spent my undergrad years wisely, my mind has been goofing off the whole time, and I don‚Äôt really have anything going for me in the job market. MAYBE it‚Äôs worth going to grad school, if such grad programs exist that can actually help me get a job.

How difficult is it for a non data science major to get into DSC classes?,"I‚Äôm considering minoring in data science. However, I know this major is super popular and the classes are probably really hard to get into if you‚Äôre not a data science major. I‚Äôve already wasted a year here because I switched my major so my remaining schedule would be very tight. I‚Äôve already planned out what classes to take for the rest of my time here, and if things don‚Äôt go the way I planned I might not be able to finish the minor requirements (since many DSC classes have prerequisites). 
What are your experience in enrolling DSC and relating classes? Specifically DSC 20, DSC 30, DSC 40A, DSC 40B, DSC 80, ECON 120A, COGS 108, MATH 189, DSC 106, CSE 150A.",1612446551,6,0
"I don‚Äôt care about salary. If my degree helps me after I graduate, then I‚Äôll be happy.","If I hadn‚Äôt gone to college, I could have instead taken a full time low-skill job right after high school. That would‚Äôve been totally ok. An honest income is respectable. What infuriates me is that I might have to take a minimum wage job, four years later and with thousands of dollars in debt.

As a first generation college student, everyone in my family was excited I was going to UCSD. They had no idea how GEs worked, major classes, internships, etc. They thought that a degree was the golden ticket.

I‚Äôm not saying a degree is useless, but I think we all know that a degree on its own does not guarantee you a high paying job. Experience is also important. In my four years, I‚Äôve had not a single internship.

I don‚Äôt expect a lot of money from my first job. What I am hoping for is that it‚Äôs a job that requires a college degree. Otherwise, I‚Äôll have really mixed feelings about whether coming here was worth it for me.

If I end up getting a job as a cashier at sprouts, that‚Äôs honest respectable work, but I could have done that exact same job out of high school. So I will feel really unsettled about having spent four years and so much money going to UCSD.

On the other hand, if I end up somewhere that I needed to go to school for, even if I don‚Äôt make a lot of money, I‚Äôll be reaping the results of these four years.",1612433309,207,4

Harassment from Administration (or staff in general),"I recently had an experience of being harassed both in person and over email by an administrator, and while I'm not going to write who it was or what exactly happened, I want to share what I did to address it so that other students know what to do (this is still in the process of being dealt with, so take this with a grain of salt because I don't know yet what the ultimate outcome will be).

First thing I did was I contacted my RA. I discussed what had happened, and this gave me important information about what to do and I found out that this administrator had done things like this before (which became a compelling piece of information later in the process). Next I called the office where this admin worked and gave an account of what happened, called the university and reported it to the office analogous to the office she works in for a particular college. At each step, I made sure to leave my name, my phone number, and my student ID.

Next step was posting on social media. I gave a thorough description of what happened, and tagged the university, my college, and a few other departments. My college ended up seeing it and contacted me, which helped me to get in touch with the boss of the admin that harassed me and got me his personal email address. My college also texted screenshots of my instagram posts to that boss, which helped me get an appointment. When the admin started emailing me, I CC'ed her boss so he'd see it all too. This led to the boss asking me to have a meeting with him the very next day, along with the admin being told she is not allowed to contact me.

Finally, I'll be submitting an official complaint to the office for the prevention of harassment and discrimination. If I'm not satisfied with the results, I've already told the admin's boss that I'll report what all happened to the media, and asked him to keep me updated as far as possible as to what all is going on with the situation (the admin's being reported to HR by her boss).

Overall, my advice is this: use up every avenue you have for dealing with harassment from admin and staff. Call everyone you can. Give them all the information you can. Write down exactly what happened ASAP in detail. And most of all, don't give up and don't settle for less than what you deserve.",1612334814,245,1

Free PPE,"I wish UCSD would give free disposable masks and hand sanitizer each month or so to people living on campus, especially with the worry about the new strain. Everyone on campus should be wearing two masks, one paper and one cloth but paper masks are super expensive at the price center Target. It's so weird though because I went to UTC early last quarter and many boutiques were offering free disposable masks on a table outside their store and thats what made it click in my head that the least UCSD should be providing on campus students. 

Bottom line is: I'm tired of personal protection equipment eating into my savings, when it LITERALLY IS WHAT KEEPS ME FROM GETTING A DEADLY VIRUS, I see a lot of people wearing one cloth mask and it makes me scared for them because a cloth mask does virtually nothing, and also I think UCSD should provide PPE to suites and apartments on campus in order to prevent or at least slow down the urge for **some** people to party their asses off.",1612332471,29,0

Messed Up Order,"So today Cafe V had two soup options: White Bean Chicken Chili and the Poblano Cheddar Tomatillo Soup. I ordered the Poblano Cheddar one because I'm a vegetarian and I don't eat meat. I just can't bring myself to anymore. 

However, when I started to eat it, I noticed that there was chicken in it. I thought I was just overthinking it but I asked my friend to look at it and she tried it and confirmed it was chicken. I think they ended up giving me the Chicken Chili instead because there were also beans in the Soup.

Also my friend went to OVT today and ordered chicken wings, only to find feathers in her wings??

I'm not sure if I should leave a review or let someone know about this? I tried giving a rating on the Ordering App and it wouldn't give me an option to leave me a description. I feel bad about leaving a complaint, but I feel like I should do something so that it doesn't happen again.",1612327384,17,0
Big regrets on being a COMM major :/,"Damn.. I just realized that BS majors are so much harder than COMM; COMM is literally just 13 courses while CS or Public Health is like 25+ courses required. I'm graduating early this year (with a double minor too since there's so few COMM course reqs) but I feel so dumb for having chosen to major in COMM as a 4-year student; but to be fair I also had many of my GE's completed so it's not like there would've been a point in me going to CC first and taking classes. I jumped straight into COMM and Business courses as a freshman, and I regret taking both - I honestly don't feel as though I've learned anything from my COMM classes, except maybe some of the more interesting media production classes, and I hated Business classes and even those were hard for me. I'm sure COMM is a good choice for those who want to go into journalism/literature/media production etc., and I initially wanted to do marketing/go into the entertainment industry, but now I'm really questioning it; marketing seems to be so based on the approval of others and entirely about scampering for people's attention, whether that's through creative means or SEO/algorithmic targeting. I used to think that my career should be something that I enjoyed and just enough for financial stability, but now I've been thinking I should've picked something that made good money even if it wasn't my passion and then live a fulfilling life on the side - I definitely don't have a ""dream job"" cause professional success isn't as paramount to me as other things in life that make me happy.  Now I feel like I no longer have consistent interest in my passion anyways and my original career goal (marketing) doesn't even align with my values and skills. Anyways I'm sorry, just a little vent on my personal experience/time here at UCSD.. if you have any questions about COMM or business classes at UCSD too I can try to answer them too",1612326220,23,0

Cancel housing contract but also do spring waitlist?,"Hi all I know a lot of ppl have asked abt whether or not they should cancel their housing contract and most ppl say to just stay home for the rest of the year but...after the sh¬°t show that was my parents arguing right before my stats midterm I know for a fact I want to go back on campus for spring quarter. My issue is idk what to do rn. 

I was on campus fall quarter but I decided to delay my return for winter since they gave us the option and was even debating just staying for the whole quarter. However, housing won‚Äôt refund the whole quarter and I‚Äôd either have to cancel the housing contract for the entire year n then get on the spring waitlist (which seems like a huge hassle and a risk) or just continue paying for the quarter even if I‚Äôm not there (which isn‚Äôt a very smart option). 

I was finally leaning towards just going back for the rest of this quarter since my home environment is getting rlly toxic again but my parents are really trying to push me to just stay. They don‚Äôt want me locked up in my dorm 24/7 which ngl I was fall quarter n it was quite depressing,,so both environments aren‚Äôt making me feel v fabulousüôÇ anyways I feel like at this point I just wanna finish the quarter at home but I still wanna go back springüò≠ 

So my question is how likely would it be that I‚Äôd get off the spring waitlist if I decided to do that option n is it even a good idea to do that? (Also damn I wanna keep my room rn. It‚Äôs a single on the 10th floor in Tioga :/ ugh idk what to do)
Lol sorry this kinda turned into a rant I think I needed to figure this out by typing it n might as well see if anyone has some advice :‚Äô) 

TLDR: don‚Äôt want to go back to campus for rest of winter quarter but DO want to go back for spring..what should I do abt housing contract? Cancel n risk spring waitlist? Keep it? Or just suck it up and go back to lonely campus rn?",1612323045,6,0

Really fucking stressed out and need to vent,"Due to the very convoluted way my parents immigrated to this country, I've never been able to work. From about 2013 or so, we've had no status. As a kid, I didn't really care. But around 16, I saw my peers getting jobs and I asked my dad why I couldn't get one, he perpetually kept saying ""you'll be able to next year"", and the next year he'd say the same thing, and the year after that he said ""you'll be able to in your senior year"", and after that he said ""you'll be able to in college"". Well, surprise, surprise, still no work authorization. This is despite my being here since I was 2 and our family paying taxes every year we've been here (ironically, my dad can't get SSI even though he paid taxes due to lack of status).

We lived in modest means when I was young but my mom got diagnosed with ESRD in 2009, and my dad lost his job a few years ago. Since then, we've been living under the poverty line. I worked hard af in high school and set my sights on a top 20. I couldn't leave California because California is the only state that gives financial aid to people without legal status. So, you can imagine my delight when it paid off and I got into UCSD with a full ride on merit. My brown parents‚Äô lofty expectations were filled by my admittance into a globally ranked top 20 university and I, of course, was overjoyed to be able to study what I love at such an institution with no financial worries.

However, I'm in my third year now and obviously haven't been able to get any internships outside of campus or anything like that. I've lost many nights of sleep over the lack of my ability to work and have had many nights of exasperated shouting matches with my parents (especially over the last year since I've been home). This is especially pressing as my dad's almost 70 and my mom's on dialysis. I applied for DACA when it opened up a few months ago, but that'll take ~8 months to get a decision and I'm not even technically eligible since I'm not undocumented but have had a petition pending for years, so who knows.

I've been doing research in an on campus internship for the past two years which I'm extremely grateful for but I also know I need actual work experience on my resume, which I can't get for the aforementioned reason. (Unpaid internships are a scam in my field.) It's **so** depressing to apply to internships, I don't even know why I do it anymore, where I have to check **no** to the work authorization question and I get a lovely autorejection email minutes later. 

I'm going to graduate with no work experience, (assuming I can even work if DACA is approved) no outside internships, and especially in this job market with the pandemic, I have a deep primal fear that I'm going to be royally fucked, and I also feel responsible for supporting my family because‚Ä¶they sure as hell aren't going to be able to in a short period of time. And I'm doing 30-40 hour classwork weeks learning extremely complex concepts at a prestigious university for‚Ä¶what? I can't get any internships, who knows if I'll even be able to work after college, and I doubt anyone's going to hire a new grad with zero experience. Like I said, I've been losing sleep over this recently as the gravity of my future condition is further impressed upon me. I feel like I'm staring into the abyss.",1613809397,1,0

Also ik i definitely need to see my major advisor but they suggest you having everything planned out first (or at least a general plan) n that‚Äôs where idk how to start :/

So I‚Äôm a first year currently with sophomore standing n I‚Äôll have 86 units by the end of spring quarter and I‚Äôve been doing a good amount of looking at my degree audit. Now if my counting and calculations are correct... i only have 21 courses (including the 4 I‚Äôll be enrolled in Spring quarter) left n that‚Äôs everything - GEs and major requirements. So I was like woah if I split it up into 4/5 courses per quarter then that‚Äôs just 5 more quarters. 

But THEN I realized I‚Äôd be short on units to graduate if I only did those. Once again if I calculated it correctly,,I‚Äôll need about 7 more classes. N well conveniently enough a lot of minors are 7 courses so now I‚Äôm trying to figure out what to minor in??! Or just take 7 random courses but I feel like a minor will be a bit more beneficial. Anyways, that‚Äôll still be able to be completed in three years i think so...I‚Äôll be graduating early?? BUT IDK bcuz what if I did my calculations wrong? *Would an advisor be able to help me figure this out even though I don‚Äôt have a plan of exactly what classes I want to take?* that‚Äôs my main question I need advice on. Or if I do need a plan how should I go about figuring out my schedule? I don‚Äôt rlly know exactly what I‚Äôd want to minor in yet but since I‚Äôm almost done with GEs will my last year just be UD psych courses and those minor courses? 

If anyone could possibly give me advice on how to figure this all out I‚Äôd really appreciate it. It feels so overwhelming. 
Especially because..(unnecessary rant ahead): if I do end up graduating early that means I already only have 2 more years leftü§° n I‚Äôm planning on going to grad school SO WHEN TF do I have to start worrying abt applying for that n studying for the GREüò≠ everything is starting to feel like it‚Äôs happening so fast which is why I want to plan it out so I‚Äôm prepared but it‚Äôs so confusing and overwhelming n idek if I‚Äôm doing this shit right.

WebReg ISSUE ADDRESSED! REGISTRAR ACKNOWLEDGES PROBLEM AND REMEDIES,"THE REGISTRAR'S EMAIL TO TRITONS:

**Spring 2021 Enrollment Issue Explained**

See below for an explanation¬†of the enrollment that occurred on February¬†18th¬†and further action that may be required from you.

**Explanation¬†of Issue**

* A human error occurred in the Office of the Registrar which caused first pass to overlap with second pass.
* As a result of this human error, students who were still in their first pass appointment time yesterday were able to enroll in up to 19.5 units and waitlist for classes, while other students began a premature second pass appointment time.
* This never should have happened and we¬†know you are frustrated.¬† We apologize for our error and the additional stress this caused you during an already stressful time.
* To resolve this issue, registration was shut down temporarily and second pass enrollment times for all students were shifted.¬† The purpose of this was to allow everyone to start with a clean slate for second pass.¬†Second pass now starts on February 21st.¬†

**To Students Who Enrolled in More than 11.5 Units**

All students will be required to drop back down to 11.5 units.¬† Please see below for any action¬†you need to take at this time:

* **If you are still within your first pass appointment time** and are registered for more than 11.5 units, you will have until 11:59pm PST tonight (February 19th) to drop courses that put you over the 11.5 unit limit.¬† If you do not drop your classes by this deadline,¬†you will be¬†administratively dropped from your latest enrollments that put you over the limit.
* **If you are no longer within your first pass appointment time** and are registered for more than 11.5 units, you will be administratively dropped from your latest enrollments that put you over the limit.
* **If your second pass was erroneously scheduled yesterday (Thursday February 18th)**¬†and you registered for more than 11.5 units, you will be administratively dropped from your latest enrollments that put you over the limit.

**To Students Who Waitlisted for Classes**

All students will be administratively dropped from waitlists today. Waitlists will start over during second pass (beginning, Sunday February 21st.)

"Webreg situation, update","I've managed to contact and get through to the ucsd registrar office. The person on the phone essentially said 3 things: 1) there is no plan to remove people from courses if theyre currently signed up for them 2) webreg issue is not their fault 3) they can't do anything about it - call/email the academic senate. 

So, I've called every number on the academic senates directory ([https://senate.ucsd.edu/contact/staff-directory/](https://senate.ucsd.edu/contact/staff-directory/)) and the main line. No one has answered. No one has replied to the emails (senate, registrar, VAC). 

It's Friday. It's the last work day of the week - many are seemingly not working as they don't answer the phone or reply to emails. 

so the update is essentially we're screwed and there's nothing you can do about it.",1613760702,1,0

"Here is an email template to send to the Registrar in light of today's events. Feel free to personalize it as you wish (this was written in my voice, of course). Send it to 'registrar@ucsd.edu'.","**Just copy, paste, personalize, and send. Feel free to add, subtract, or revise as you wish, as this was written in my voice (a graduating senior).** If there are any typographical or grammatical errors, I do apologize. **Send it to** [registrar@ucsd.edu](mailto:registrar@ucsd.edu). **We ain't going down without a hell of a fight first.**  

To whom this may concern,

My name is \[insert name here\] and I am a \[insert year here\] year undergraduate student here at UC San Diego. Allow me to get right to the point. As you are aware, an error in the computer system that governs WebReg has allowed an untold number of students to enroll in more than the 11.5 units they are normally allowed in their first pass. That number could be in the many thousands. By being allowed to jump the queue and enroll in more classes than they should have, those students have robbed countless seniors who were expecting to graduate next quarter the opportunity to do so, because the one or two classes they needed to take in order to graduate are now full. This is obviously horrendously unfair, and at an institution that prides itself on fairness and equality of opportunity, absolutely unacceptable.

What many of my fellow Tritons and I ask of you is very simple. **Create opportunities for those who need to take certain classes to be able to graduate the opportunity to do so and restore fairness in light of today‚Äôs incident. What I and many others would like to see done is a complete rollback on all of the damage done today. Remove all those who enrolled in classes out of turn today from those classes and reprioritize the seniors who need them the most.** In the event that that isn‚Äôt a possibility, then create more opportunities for those students to be able to take those classes they need, at the very least. Coordinate with the academic departments to expand class sizes or offer more sections. Anything beyond simply shifting second pass enrollment times and letting those who jumped the queue today keep the classes they enrolled in whilst providing no alternatives to those who need to enroll in those same classes but have now been stripped of the opportunity to do so.

Many of us are now living in a state of anxiety as the conclusion of our academic careers are now in limbo thanks to today‚Äôs error. Many of us are hurting, in distress, and deeply concerned about our academic futures. **Please help us.** All we ask is that fairness be restored and those who need those classes the most are given a fair opportunity to enroll in a spot and take them. Thank you.

Yours sincerely,

I've scored about 95% on the homework, but my quizzes have been terrible. Average score on the first three is 5.5/11. So all I have left is one quiz (which would replace a 4/10 quiz) and then the final.

If I just manage to stay above a 50% overall and pass the final, do you think that's enough to pass the class? I'm taking it Pass/No Pass, so I think that means I would need to get a C- at least. Sigh. This is literally the second-to-last class I need for my degree...

Stressed about Registering for Classes,"Scrolling through I feel like we're all stressed about classes, whether freshman or senior. I know why we have a 1st/2nd pass system, but it's always so anxiety inducing each quarter trying to register. Seats fill up faster than you can count, and waitlists get super long. And only a small amount of people on the waitlist can even get in. It's frustrating to be in, especially with everything being online. 

It's annoying how UCSD wants to keep adding new students, making new colleges but I feel like there's always the same amount of classes or less. Or there's only one professor for that class when maybe there should be two so more students can enroll. 

The seats thing is an issue too, though I understand why some professors can't open new seats because they are on a contract. However many professors are just researchers they could have more seats especially with online options right now.

# It was the ethical thing to do.

When someone at UCSD manages to get past enrollment gates **due to a glitch** **which UCSD bears responsibility for**, UCSD must drop them from the class list, and prioritize those who rightfully deserve enrollment. **MOST SENIORS ABSOLUTELY NEED IT!**

UCSD created the priority enrollment system for a reason. And that system has failed to serve it's purpose. UCSD bears responsibility to fix it now.

Would you prefer classes with 3 exams and no final or midterms with finals?,I'd say a healthy mix is always the most convenient so you can take exams for a few classes and have a week without exams for other classes.

Exchange student questions,"Hi! I‚Äôm planning to go o UCSD next academic year for an exchange. (Through UCEAP program). I had to sort by preference the UC campuses and UCSD is my top choice. 

UCB wasn‚Äôt offered. UCLA was my first option, but after checking the courses, UCLA seems a bit too theoretical and has a smaller variety of courses that interest me. To be fair there wasn‚Äôt much info about their courses. In UCSD many seem hands-on and project-oriented. And if courses get full I have many alternative courses.

Do you think I made a good decision? (I think I might be on time to change the preferences list) For some context It will be my fourth and last year of university, I think you call it senior year, and my major is Electrical Engineering (EE). I think there are some exciting courses such as ECE 148, and ECE 191.

At UCLA I found a great housing option (at UCHA for 5,800 food and housing for the year), but now for UCSD, I am a bit lost for housing (off-campus) I am on a small budget and I don‚Äôt know if I will be able to find something that fits.

I‚Äôve found the Facebook housing group, and I am starting to see some prices. But how much do you think I would spend, trying to find something relatively cheap? Utilities add up a lot to the rent price? And food?",1611493182,1,0

Welcome to the second edition of the ***Times of Tritons***, a look back on 60 years of UCSD history from the perspective of us Tritons (past and present). **In a continuation from the** [**last edition**](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/ku6i0t/times_of_tritons_1_life_for_the_first/), we will continue our look into what life was like for the first undergraduate Tritons, with a look at some suggested date and activity ideas courtesy of the class of 1965 as well as a look inside the very first (proper) undergrad dorms here at UCSD.

But first, a new segment which will appear in all future editions of the *Times* that I like to call...

# Today in Triton History! [or in this edition's case, Yesterday in Triton History!]

(as told by the student newspapers)

[1974](https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb3823652m/_1.pdf)**:**

* ""Two years ago, UCSD students living in Del Mar were the determining factor in electing an environmentally oriented city council... ""Major developers, who have been frustrated since that election, are pouring money into this contest in the hope of regaining control of the city,"" according to \[Tom Shepard, Del Mar City Councilman\], a former UCSD student."" - It would seem that they've succeeded. Do any UCSD kids live in Del Mar these days (whose parents don't live there too because they're rich?)
* ""Muir College resident students can no longer expect lenient treatment for drug violations. Resident Dean Cleo Malone says he will enforce the rule concerning the use or possession of illegal drugs to the letter, with no exception, no warnings, and no second chances. He is determined, he said, ""to put a top to this stupidity."""" - The article goes on to talk about how this comes as a result of several incidents with marijuana (paraphernalia and plants and whatnot). How times change.
* ""The Union of Jewish Students will present the third of its Lectures in Judaica on Thursday, January 24 at 7:30 PM. Dr. Stan Chodorow of the UCSD History Dept. will speak on the subject of Medieval Judaism."" - I just wanted to put this here to highlight how long he's been here. He was my HUM2 professor two years back. The man is literally a living, walking time capsule of this university. If this university were a film, he's seen everything from the promos for other films at the start to the blooper reel.
* ""**The Revelation To Urey**"" \[a lovely piece of religious satire\]
   * In the name of Revelle, the beneficent, the merciful.
   * ***The Revellist Creed***
      * There is no God but Revelle and Urey is his prophet. The Textbooks are infallible. Amen. Random selection has placed you here, and random selection shall take you away. The measure of Man is his G.P.A.
   * ***The Worship of Revelle***
      * You must study five times daily facing MED School.
      * You must tithe $212 quarterly to support your administrators.
      * You must crawl on your knees during FINAL week to your 2A \[the equivalent to HUM2\] T.A.
      * You must tolerate all Muir students and other infidels.
      * You must make a pilgrimage quarterly to the holy center of Matthews seeking to gain Revelle's favour (Note: a suitable donation to the Bookstore may be necessary.)
      * Although studying may be performed at the appropriate times wherever a Urist happens to be, the Library has since the dawn of Revellism been the best environment for Revelle learning and the performance of other religious ceremonies.
      * The Friday night worship services at the Central Library \[now Geisel\] are often frequented by the true followers of Urey.
   * ***Paradise***
      * When the Urist attains perfect G.P.A., Revelle blesses him and delivers him unto Antiseptic Bliss in MED School, where seven beautiful nurses attend to his every whim.

# What to Do and Where to Eat Near UCSD, 1965 edition

Now, to our main content today. Allow me to present you some suggestions on ""What to Do; Where to Go"", pulled directly from the [September 26th, 1965 edition](https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb9182038c) of the *Sandscript*, UCSD's first student-run newspaper (replaced by *The Triton Times* some years later and itself replaced by *The Guardian* beginning in the 1978-1979 school year). The original article can be viewed [here](https://i.imgur.com/GLr5d7o.png), but I shall reproduce it (for your convenience) below, along with my commentary in \[brackets\] at the end of each entry. There are some very interesting suggestions and ideas here:

# What to Do; Where to Go

**EATING:** ***Dinner***

*Anthony's Fish Grotto*, 886 Prospect Street, La Jolla. Anthony's has good but inexpensive food. In as much as there are no reservations, it might be wise to plan on arriving early on weekend nights. \[They used to run a chain of fish restaurants in SD County, but have since whittled down to just one location in La Mesa. Recent [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/biz/anthonys-fish-grotto-la-mesa-5) reviews indicate that the food is okay (at best), but not worth the price. The location on Prospect Street has since been replaced by an office building hosting a BBQ shop called 'Bubba's', which according to [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/biz/bubbas-smokehouse-bbq-la-jolla) is quite good (although my pick for best BBQ in SD is, of course, the legendary Phil's on Sports Arena).\]

*Danny Fa's,* 920 Prospect Street, La Jolla. Has $1.00 huge sparerib dinners on Wednesday, Mrs. Fa's night. \[I don't know what their definition of 'huge' is, but for $8.24 in today's money, it sounds like a fantastic deal nonetheless. The restaurant has since closed and been replaced by some service road next to a boutique hotel\]

*Caliente Club*, Tijuana \[That's all it says for this entry. No idea whatever happened to the club or how good it is or its history or anything\]

***Snacks and After-Date:***

*Der Wienersnitzell,* Pacific Beach. There are two locations, one on Balboa Boulevard, and one on Mission Boulevard. \[Yeah, that one you're thinking of. Now known as just '[Wienerschnitzel](https://www.wienerschnitzel.com/)'. The ones on Balboa and Mission are gone, although there is still one in PB (2669 Garnet Ave.). I usually advise against taking a date to a fast food joint (although since this is an 'after-date' and not a main destination for a date, I suppose it's okay), but Wienerschnitzel is cool (if only because it's a bit of a rare novelty).\]

*Jack-in-the-Box*, La Jolla Boulevard, Bird Rock, La Jolla \[Pretty damn self-explanatory. We all know what Jack-in-the-Box is and what their food is like. The one on La Jolla Blvd. is gone, although there is one on Pearl St. near La Jolla Blvd.

*31 Flavors,* 564 Pearl Street, La Jolla \[Is it embarrassing that I didn't deduce that this was: a) an ice cream parlor and b) better known as Baskin-Robbins? The B-R here doesn't exist anymore. It has since been replaced (at the same address) by the Jack-in-the-Box described above.

***Dates***

*Grunion Hunting* \- at La Jolla Shores Beach, Scripps Beach, or Torrey Pines Beach \[I won't go into too much details about what [grunions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunion) are, but point is, they're fish, delicious, and easy to hunt because during spring nights, they come and mate on the beach (like, the sand; they dig themselves into the sand). Such events are called 'grunion runs', and you can still hunt (or rather catch with your hands) grunions in March and June of every year at those beaches, provided you have a fishing license.

*Cinema 21* \- 1440 Hotel Circle, Mission Valley (Highway 80). \[By what is now known as the I-8, it was a movie theatre (as the name implies) that closed in September 1998 and has since been replaced by a somewhat ugly apartment block.\]

*Unicorn Theatre*, La Jolla Boulevard, La Jolla \[A small movie theatre (you know, the kind that's since been killed by the mega-chains, AMC and the like) that has since closed down and been replaced by a classic sports car showroom/dealership\]

*The Heritage*, folk music coffee house, 3842 Mission Boulevard, Mission Beach \[Has quite a rich history to it, according to a quick google search. It has since closed down and been replaced by a [place](https://www.yelp.com/biz/single-fin-surf-grill-san-diego) that supposedly serves really great fish tacos. Still qualifies as a date spot, methinks.\]

*Jai Lai Games and Mike's A Go Go* \- Tijuana (excellent bands at *Mike's*) \[Here's an explanation of what [jai (a)lai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jai_alai) is (Long story short: was popular in the '70s, but has since faded into obscurity and kind of resembles squash). *Mike's* seems to have been a legit bar and restaurant with proper entertainment (that is, it isn't a brothel), although I can't help but wonder if our antecedents went to TJ to get some like a number of us surely have. Surely, they must have. It's the oldest profession in humankind, there's no way it wasn't as proliferated then as it is now.\]

*Disneyland*, Anaheim, great for dates but about a 90 minute drive. \[Pretty damn self-explanatory, although surely, it's faster than 1.5 hours to get there now. Maybe closer to 45 to 60, assuming not too much traffic. Or did our antecedents have to  make the trip via the old U.S. Route 101?\]

*Sailing*, Mission Bay. (UCSD has a Sailing Club and boats - see the Student Activities Office). \[Now this sounds like a unique and fun date idea. I wonder if UCSD still has little sailing boats for student usage (if not, someone ought to get on it and reintroduce that service; I reckon it may be quite popular and, correct me if I'm wrong here, you don't need a special license to operate a little sailing or paddle boat for a day).\]

***After-Dates*** \[this is essentially a recap of places with nice views; I believe (and I'm sure you'll agree with me) that all of them have stood the test of time.\]

*Mt. Soledad Cross* \- Nice view of La Jolla Shores on the north-west and of Pacific Beach, Point Loma, and Mission Bay on the south.

*Calle de Oro* \- (Overlooking La Jolla Shores) Spectacular view, day or night.

*Bureau of Commercial Fisheries* parking lot\* \[Not entirely sure where this is today, but judging from its usage of UCSD parking permits, it must be near campus. I reckon it's at Scripps\]

*Scripps Institute of Oceanography*, south parking lot\* (Note - AS President has top priority) \[How times have changed. Well, at least the views at Scripps are still as good as they've ever been\]

*N.W. of Salk Institute*

\* note - parking by UCSD permit only.

# The First Dorms

Of course, a look at what life was like for our predecessors at UCSD wouldn't be complete without a look into what their living accommodations were like. As we all probably know, the oldest college at UCSD is Revelle. The oldest dorms in Revelle, which are also the very first dorms built for UCSD undergrads, are the Fleets (Atlantis, Beagle, Challenger, Discovery, Galathea and Meteor Hall and no, their names haven't changed in over 5 decades). Those were completed in time for the class of 1969 (by the very end of 1965).

With the establishment of Muir College in 1967, the University put up the very first set of Muir undergrads in buildings in the newly acquired Camp Matthews. These buildings are still around today (although with ***The Development Chancellor******^(TM)*** around, God knows how much longer they'll be with us), as part of the collection of buildings affectionately referred to by us Tritons nowadays as 'Camp Snoopy'.

[Here is an Imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/tSjeLPo) showcasing what student housing at UCSD looked like in the mid Sixties. **The album is a companion piece to this post, so do click into it and look at the pictures and the captions.** Some very interesting stuff in there, I guarantee you. As someone who spent their first year in the Fleets (Beagle, on the top floor facing the Revelle conference rooms), I found them to be of special interest. I also think they offer a very interesting insight into what our predecessors were like, how they lived.

Not entirely sure what next edition's topic will be, but there will be another one in 2 weeks (or well, 13 days; I'll be sure to get the next one up on a Friday). Until then, take care, wear a mask, and fight on. **You got this, Tritons!**",1611451861,1,0

College of Least Resistance?,"Hi all! Prospective CS transfer student here. Basically I need to rank six of the colleges (Seventh is unavailable to transfers) and I really just want one that will require the least out of me. Ideally little or no new GE's, minors, academic obligations, etc. I am recovering from a recent medical situation that could take at least another year to resolve and I need to keep my academic life low-key for a while.

Based on the credits I already have (showing my STEM courses, etc.), which I've attached, what do y'all think are the few colleges you would rank first as requiring the fewest additional classes I'd need outside of the CS classes I must take for the degree anyway?

I know some of this advice will be subjective but I appreciate your help regardless!!

5 pro tips for saving money on textbooks,"I am a senior, and I have learned some tricks on how to save money on textbooks. I‚Äôd like to share some with you.

1) **DO NOT FEEL BAD ABOUT BEING CLEVER.** Textbook companies are extorting you for so much money. By playing games to save money, you are only beating them at their own game.

2) **DO NOT BUY TEXTBOOKS JUST BECAUSE THE PROFESSOR SAYS YOU SHOULD.** It goes without saying sometimes those ‚Äúrequired‚Äù readings aren‚Äôt actually required, and you‚Äôll be able to learn the same info through other sources.

3) **USE AN OLDER EDITION IF POSSIBLE.** Those are so much cheaper, and almost word-for-word the same as the latest edition. Maybe one semicolon was changed to a period, and the order of practice problems was rearranged.

4) **RENT AND DO NOT BUY.** Unless this is the Campbell Bio book, chances are that reselling it won‚Äôt be easy. So if you only need the book for one quarter, renting makes it much easier.

5) **IF YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST USE AN EBOOK, THEN SHARE IT WITH A FRIEND.** Both of you pay half price, and share the login info. As long as you don‚Äôt log in at the same time, then it should work.",1617048240,1,0
Question about waitlisted class?,"Sorry if this is a dumb question, this is the first time I've waitlisted for a course at UCSD.

One of my friends is entering UCSD as undeclared starting Fall 2022, and wants to go into a STEM major. It is true that they will not be given equal consideration to someone who is already declared as a given STEM major when applying to classes, correct? 

i.e. does being undeclared make it harder to enroll into STEM classes in general or is it no different than anybody else? I anticipate an answer that says it depends on the class?

What I have done is hear anecdotal experiences, and it seems to me like CBD is not all that addictive or harmful.

I personally wouldn‚Äôt use THC ever again (I smoked weed a couple times back in high school), simply because I like to stay sober. I have had kind of a drinking problem in the past and I don‚Äôt want to be intoxicated, like ever again. That doesn‚Äôt mean anything is wrong with someone else doing it, but I would not.

I‚Äôve never tried CBD alone, but what I have heard is that ‚Äúit relaxes you without getting you high.‚Äù I‚Äôm not exactly sure what that feels like, but it sounds like something I could benefit from, especially when I‚Äôm trying to go to sleep and my insomnia gets in the way.

I feel like the DEI shouldn't be the only requirement for all students.,"I have no idea how requirements are decided, so I might totally be talking out of my ass on this. Feel free to explain my cluelessness.

As I understand it, the DEI became a school-wide requirement after a series of events took place in which some students were disrespectful toward minority groups. I know about the Compton Cookout, but I think there were other things like that too.

Seriously, fuck the people who did that shit. They are long gone from campus now, and we are still paying the price for their disrespect more than a decade later.

The argument goes like this: *If we educate students on X, then things like Y are less likely to happen. We want things like Y to be less likely to happen. Therefore, we should educate students on X.*

That is a valid and sound argument. My CSE 20 professor would be proud that I still remember those terms. We can work a truth table out if you'd like, just kidding.

Jokes aside, we collectively don't want any more racist events like the Compton Cookouts, and through the DEI requirement, the overall student body is educated not to do things like that. It's not a 100% foolproof panacea, but it helps.

However, there is so much other stuff that I think all students should learn too. If more students understood the basics of financial literacy, then they'd be a lot more likely to start saving early and keep proper budgets. I took a class on personal finance management at Rady, and it really saved my ass in many ways many that some of my friends did not understand.

I am not equating racism with financial illiteracy. I just feel like there are more things that students should be required to learn, the way we're all required to learn about diversity, equity, and inclusion.

I am no Warren Buffett, but if I save $15 on food each week by not eating out, then I know where to put those $15 so they can compound in the long-term. I feel like most other kids don't understand the same, and even though they're probably smarter than me, they just never learned about personal finance.

The same goes for resume/CV building, networking, interview skills, and a lot of other things. I am not saying there needs to be a class requirement for every last skill like this, but this stuff would make sense to see more students learning.

I used to think classes on this stuff would be unrealistic, since it's already so hard to make space for major classes and so many students cannot graduate in four years. BUT, for all the college requirements that exist, *cough cough Revelle*, I think they could find a way to put this stuff in. Do we really need all that MMW when we could instead be learning about how investment accounts work?

Yes, an idea like this would require a complete overhaul of college requirements, but I think that would be worth it.",1617982577,1,0

If there are any other examples of what they are looking for, especially examples that have passed through the appeal, what do you think they would be? I really appreciate it if any of you know!! It doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be UCSD too, other UC appeals would also be helpful! I‚Äôm just really hoping to give the  UCSD appeal a shot.

I have the problem with only some incoming callers and UCSD health is one (Scripps and ikea have been others).

I am amazed by how hardworking the undergraduate students are. I think you should all applaud yourself for the amount of effort you dedicate to your education. Furthermore, I really appreciate the tenacity of the students here. To want good grades is one thing (we all want this) but to actually want to learn is another thing. I find the latter to be a common trait in many UCSD students I have served as a TA for. I wish I had this trait during my undergrad years.

I don‚Äôt blame the RA for enforcing the rules but all I ask for is some smarter rules. You would think a school as educated as UCSD could come up with some quality rules.

Many students worry about failing after taking a tough final. They will also email their TAs and profs in a state of panic (I‚Äôve been the TA). I‚Äôm not sure about participation-based classes like language classes or even lab classes, but from what I‚Äôve noticed for many STEM classes, profs on average make the grading scale so that only about 1-5% of the class fails (gets below a C-). To fail, you literally have done next to nothing throughout the quarter. If you turn in assignments with modest scores and don‚Äôt do well on exams, you‚Äôll probably barely (but still) pass. If you turn in decent work and don‚Äôt do well on exams, you‚Äôll definitely pass. If you struggled across the board but maintained communication with your TA and prof, you‚Äôll be fine. Profs and TAs care about their students and no one likes the feeling of failing anyone. To fail, there has to be literally no available justification to pass the student.",1615923987,1,0

I feel like the entire focus of UCSD should shift from an emphasis on research to an emphasis on both research and jobs.,"Traditionally, UCs have been for research. Most of the funding that UCSD gets, if I understand correctly, is for research work. That is great, because research is obviously important. The only time I have ever questioned this was when I was doing research in a lab, and a professor whose name I won‚Äôt say said how he had received such a big grant and was trying to come up with new ways to spend it.

Like most things, the purpose of a college education has changed over time. The reason people attend UCSD has changed too.

IN MY EXPERIENCE, and I don‚Äôt have survey data to prove this, more than 50% of undergrad students want to get jobs after they graduate. Most students I have spoken to are not choosing UCSD to prepare them for research program in grad school.

If an undergrad wants to work in finance after graduating, is UCSD the wrong school for them? I don‚Äôt think so.

Research is important and UCSD should keep doing it. This place is changing though. A lot of people are here so they can get a job after they graduate. I think UCSD can also focus on training it‚Äôs students for jobs.",1615878147,1,0

Hi everyone,"I hope everyone is doing well today.

I have a question regarding my options here. As we all know, it's finals week and a pretty stressful week for all. Today I found out some personal/family news that have added on to that stress significantly. I feel like I can't focus on anything academic at the moment. I tried calling CAPS and they said that a counselor would get in touch but I have yet to receive a call so I'm honestly lost on where to go from here.

My situation is not what would be considered a medical emergency or of urgent care (like the death of a parent) but I do feel like it has given me a bit of a mental breakdown. I'm not sure if this can justify either postponing my finals or doing something of that nature. If I did want to take this approach, would I need to contact my professors or is there another service I can speak to?

Looking for a full place to sublease in July or August with a parking spot!,"Hi everyone, 2014 alumni here.  

Did you sign on for a 1 bedroom apartment, excited for all the on campus summer parties you were going to have, only to find yourself meeting your friends using an Oculus Rift in the world's most expensive game room?  

Are you hoping to just abandon your $30k a year Zoom/Google Meet Coursera alternative and return home where they have real BBQ and backyards, but are unsure what to do about your expensive off-campus apartment?  

Were you sharing a place with your precious BF or GF, only to find out they weren't as fun to date when you were stuck with them 24 hours a day during lockdowns, and now after breaking up when you caught them watching, and enjoying, the latest season of The Walking Dead, you're having trouble keeping up with rent costs and considering moving out but have a lease term to abide by?  

Then boy oh boy do I have the solution for you! My wife and I are planning to visit in July or August so my mother can finally meet her granddaughter. Unfortunately, for reasons I can't get into, my sister's house (where my mom is staying) is not a good option. Because we have a 8 month old (will be 11 months or so) baby, we would like to sublease the entire place. We're not a big family so even a 1 BR would do (they're huge in the US).  

The amount we can pay sort of depends on the place, but we are hoping somewhere around $1000 (give or take a couple hundred) a month. I know that's very optimistic but given how little travel there is right now, we figure that's competitive with AirBNB prices. If you know anyone that's suddenly cancelling their summer plans to stay in SD, please let them know. We are a pretty normal/safe family.

"Pierre Ouillet, Chief Financial Officer of UCSD, eat a full bag of shit","\*Full email below

 The UCSD CFO has the fucking gall to tell grad students to learn how to do math after the university blew its own budget building all of 6th college, and is now raising rent by 30-85%. Are you out of your goddamn mind? Fuck Khosla, Fuck this prick, Fuck UCSD. If you just signed up to be a grad, this is what you have to look forward to. If you were aspiring to come here as a grad, look elsewhere. If you're a faculty member trawling through this sub, get this man fired. If you're Pierre Ouillet, who makes $389,375/year to shit on the graduate students who teach at this school for fuckall, choke on a hot log you fucking piece of shit!

Full email sent out by UAW:  
""Clearly you don‚Äôt know how to do math.‚Äù  


That‚Äôs what Pierre Ouillet, Chief Financial Officer of UCSD, said today to me in a meeting between residents of UCSD housing and Chancellor Khosla where we presented our case to the Chancellor and his staff that rent hikes of up to 85% for new residents are completely unreasonable. But as Graduate Student Researchers in the natural sciences, it turns out that we do math quite well, certainly well enough to know that graduate students cannot afford to pay $1,365 (up from $873) on a $2,500 monthly income, as the next resident of my room will be asked to do.

UCSD‚Äôs main justification for increasing rents so greatly is that housing must be ‚Äúself-supporting,‚Äù and HDH‚Äôs only source of income are rents. As we pointed out in today‚Äôs meeting, that simply isn‚Äôt true: [UCOP‚Äôs Rule 72](https://studentresearchersunited.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a5106e05940cfb3c7e234dac4&amp;id=00fb13e7e4&amp;e=8e9bf53b1e) on auxiliary services such as campus housing explicitly states that, ‚ÄúChancellors may subsidize auxiliary enterprises with appropriate available campus funds.‚Äù Clearly, Khosla has the power to balance the budget without putting it on the backs of graduate tenants.

Here‚Äôs what we said:¬†

* Rents must be frozen, not increased, during this historic pandemic.
* HDH must stop pushing degrading double occupancy as a solution to our rent burden.
* The University has the money to make graduate housing affordable, but instead administrators are once again making the choice to shift the cost onto underpaid workers.

Ouillet went on to say to us, ‚Äúby the time you leave grad school, maybe you‚Äôll learn how to balance a budget.‚Äù To that we said, we balance our budgets every month! That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre fighting these rent increases. We already have to choose each month between paying our rent and other life necessities.

Khosla committed to continuing to dialogue and look further into the points we made. Residents have their attention now, but it's clear that UCSD administration won‚Äôt budge unless we continue to hold them accountable.

Forming a union for Student Researchers is one powerful way to give graduate employees at UC more power to fight for affordable housing and fair wages, because with a union UC must negotiate a contract with us collectively. Housing is a workplace issue, especially while so many of us continue to work from home. Khosla is slow listen, but with an SR union he will have no choice. Please ask your friends and labmates to [sign a union authorization card ](https://studentresearchersunited.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a5106e05940cfb3c7e234dac4&amp;id=8d945cb1cd&amp;e=8e9bf53b1e)if they haven‚Äôt already.¬†

And if you‚Äôre a resident of graduate housing, you can get involved in the movement to freeze the rent by reaching out to this [email address](mailto:freezetherentucsd@gmail.com), and attend the socially-distanced rally this Sunday April 25th at noon outside Mesa Nueva.¬†

No friends to be with. This place is sucking the life out of me. The classes. The people. The very buildings themselves. It all seems to tire me out. 

I have another school year left in this place, but I don't think I can take it anymore. I was burnt out when I came here, but now I'm just slowly destroying myself mentally. Like a machine that's on its last legs, but now all the continued work is just destroying it. I can't take it anymore. This place is a vampire, sucking the life out of me. I hate Econ, I take no joy for it. I feel stuck. 

I'm so tired. I just want to rest. I can't take this anymore. I can't take this place anymore. Everyday feels so dreadful.",1619146105,1,0

Help! How do I orchestrate my graduation?,"I live \~500 miles away from SD in Norcal. I want to attend graduation in-person. 

I didn't get the vaccine yet, but I heard that I need a COVID test 1 week before graduation in order to participate. Also, if I **did** get vaccinated, I would be experiencing side effects, which would pretty much ruin the quarter and my academic performance. Also, I need two shots \~3 weeks apart, so idk if I have the time for it. The final nail on the coffin is appointments. God it'd be a miracle if I could even get the shot.

Another complication is that I have a final the day before graduation (fucking perfect, right?), and the syllabus says it can't be rescheduled :/ 

Driving down takes us about 9-10 hours. I honestly don't know if flying is safe; I don't want to disclose any details, but we have someone who's high risk at home, and I absolutely don't want any harm coming their way.

"Credit monitoring is largely useless, you should freeze your credit instead","Feel free to sign up for the year of credit monitoring that was offered after the data breach, however don‚Äôt expect much from it. On top of that, if you are thinking about paying for it indefinitely for the rest of your life, I would urge you to reconsider, especially from a company as shitty as Experian.

Unfortunately, credit monitoring is largely useless. The best thing you can do is freeze your credit at each of the three major institutions. It‚Äôs free to freeze / unfreeze as many times as you want (useful for when you need to unfreeze in order to open a new line of credit, like a credit card).

Each site makes it a little tricky to find the freeze option (and they all try to sell you on their own credit monitoring services along the way), but they are legally required to offer unlimited freezes / unfreezes for free nowadays.

The process is simple and can be done entirely online. There are plenty of guides that‚Äôll walk you through it, but the basic gist is that you‚Äôll create an account at each of the Experian / Equifax / TransUnion websites, and then when you enable the freeze you‚Äôll be given a PIN to use when you want to unfreeze it. You‚Äôll only be shown this PIN once so you‚Äôll want to store it somewhere safe that you‚Äôll remember.

The next time you need to unfreeze your credit, you‚Äôll have the option to do so for an indefinite amount of time, or you can set a temporary lift for a day or two while someone does a credit check. The lift happens instantly, so it won‚Äôt slow you down when you need it.

If you lose the PIN, you‚Äôll have to call in and go through the hassle of verifying your identity, although honestly I wish it was more of a hassle because I went through that process with TransUnion and it was too easy IMO.

All of the credit monitoring companies are terrible, but freezing is your best bet to avoid identity fraud. Ultimately, if someone really, really wanted to steal your identity, they would be able to. The idea is to make it difficult enough that the bad actor moves on to a lower hanging, less protected fruit, rather than waste their time trying to get around a credit freeze.",1619084558,1,0

Need Help!!!,"So this is what happened to me, what could I do? Did anyone ever encounter with similar issues like mine? I am so stressed out...

Hi there, 

My case is kind of complex. I planned to graduate after Spring 2021. At first, I saw that both graduation criterias, Disciplinary Focus Required Economics Course &amp; Disciplinary Focus, required ECON 101 at the same time, so I assumed that taking that one class could fulfill both criterias at the same time, too. However, before I decided to submit the application for DDA earlier around this Feb or March, I double checked with a couple counselors including a counselor for my major and a counselor for my college, Six College, to see if I was actually eligible to graduate. They both helped me go through my audit and at that time, no one told me anything about the fact that ECON 101 could only fulfill one of the criterias mentioned above. One of them literally told me ""everything looks good on your audit and you can go ahead and apply"" for the graduation. Until today, I received this Email saying I am not qualified to graduate, I was extremely confused and found out that it is this tricky ECON 101 criteria that messed up everything of my plan. I even applied for RCL and part time study because I always thought I would just need that last one class (INTL 190) in order to graduate. No one, ever, tried to correct me although I literally told them I planned to graduate this Spring at the beginning of every Zoom Virtual Couseling. I am an international student and my student VISA is about to expire in mid June, so this is extremely urgent to me. This could be an extremely expensive error for me. I really hope you guys could kindly figure something out for me. You could argue that I was being too stupid to understand the school's audit system, but this is not completely my fault. No one, ever, tried to correct me and they went through my audit with me, without noticing the problem. I apologize in advance if any of my words above sound a bit harsh. I truly believe the consequence of such miscommunication could be fixed by you guys and UCSD, as a school full of academic awards and achievements, is able to give me a fair answer.",1619059031,1,0

Double Major Advice,"Hello 

I'm  a first year student majoring in International Business thinking of declaring a double major. Based on some preliminary research, I've found Management Science or the Econ-Math Joint major to be most interesting and compatible with what I'm already doing. If not a double major, a minor in Rady accounting or supply chain also seems a potential path. 

I was wondering if there are any older students who are in the same major or did any of the ones I listed could share their experience? Any recommendations or advice regarding this field of study? Do you plan on/ did you go to graduate school afterwards? Potential career paths? 

thanks",1614925640,8,0

In Person Events During Spring Break,"So as you all probably know, Daddy Khosla as made it so that no clubs or organizations are allowed to have any in-person events till May 31st. Now this makes sense, as Covid is still a thing and we want to keep the students on campus safe and Covid free. But it turns out that Khosla himself was exempt from this rule, and I guess Spring Break does not count for the ""No in-person events till May 31st"" rule. Essentially this means that Khosla is allowing for there to be in-person events for the duration of spring break, as it is technically not a part of the school year. You may be curious and wonder ""Why tf are they doing this?"". It turns out that this is all to keep people on campus during Spring Break, as they do not want people going home during spring break. You may think that this is stupid, and I agree. It doesn't make sense that the method they thought of to keep people on campus is to have in person events, which have been banned for our safety.

I'm stressed because I know they only take 2 grades and this already puts me behind all the kids who got a/a and a/a- and slightly behind all the a-/a- kids. Also, two B+s would bring down my total gpa to 3.733 which puts me behind even MORE people. Maybe I should just pass/np one of them. Will retroactive p/np be a thing this quarter?

There are, of course, some issues with our methodology -- as a result of putting this on Reddit, my responses seem to skew towards male, STEM, and English-native students.

But without further ado, with **1,506 reporting**:

# WebRej (Rhymes with ""ledge""): 826 (54.8%)

#WebReg (Rhymes with ""leg""): 671 (44.6%)

The survey is meant for **commuters and commuters only** so please refrain from taking it if you do not commute to campus. For obvious clarity reasons, please only take the survey once. 

If you have any questions about the survey, please leave a comment in the thread or send us a private message! 

We really appreciate your input!

can someone take a look at my CSE schedule pls,"Hello everyone,

I made a schedule for my classes and was wondering if there were any glaring issues with it (like taking two of the hardest classes together). This schedule is a combination of what my counselor gave me and some of my own tweaks.

Some background about me:

I transferred and withdrew in Fall 2020 (after 6-7 weeks). I took CSE 12, 15L, 21, and ECE 109. I found this workload to be literally impossible. I was studying 12hrs a day / 7 days a week with no progress and got burnt out (Also please let me know if this is normal or not). With that being said, my confidence is really low when it comes to the rigor here and I literally have nightmares about CSE 21 because the 6 weeks I was there scarred me.

CSE 12 was hell but not as bad. I got an 85 on the midterm before withdrawing altogether. CSE 15L remained an afterthought the entire time and I really didn't study or prioritize it because I was just working on CSE12/21 the entire time. ECE 109 was just *hard*.

Anyway, here's my schedule. (I already have CSE 30 credit from a community college).

[https://imgur.com/a/VM99kWm](https://imgur.com/a/VM99kWm)

I intentionally made the first year pretty light. I am scared of the second and third year though. Please let me know if there are any classes I should take/not take together and any improvements I could make.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all !!",1614804414,3,0

CAPES and Engagement Different From First Quarter,"I'm not sure if it's just for my classes, but during fall quarter, almost all my classes offered extra credit as an incentive to fill out CAPEs.

[rant] I can‚Äôt tell if I kicked ass this school year or if it kicked my ass,"I‚Äôm a first year transfer here. I started the year with $15,000 in loans and I just finished paying off every penny by working 50 hour weeks with two restaurant jobs. I even maintained great grades. I should be proud, right?

Except I‚Äôm suffering so, so bad. My physical health is a mess because I don‚Äôt eat enough. My car keeps breaking down during my 15 mile commute to work. My mental health is up and down. Yesterday I cried before serving my first table because I had just taken a midterm and my check engine light turned on while I was driving to work. I was so overwhelmed. Both of my jobs are refusing to give me a day off because they‚Äôre understaffed. I work every damn day. Why did I do this to myself? Why why why why

I started the year cooking my own meals and having a healthy balance between two jobs, school, and health. Somewhere along the line it just went all down hill. You can see it in my face. I spend over an hour on my makeup just so you can‚Äôt see how much of a wreck I am. And yet, people still tell me I look tired at work. Someone told me that he could tell how tired I was because my hair was a mess and I just started crying. 

I wish I could be proud of my achievement. But I sacrificed my mental and physical health to pay for zoom lectures and being woken up by construction outside my window daily. I just need a fkn day off. I should really quit one of these jobs, but I need the money to fix my car or get a new one. These last five and a half weeks can‚Äôt go by fast enough.",1620242780,1,0

I‚Äôve been hearing that people that live off campus aren‚Äôt as openly social and down to do things as opposed to people living on campus? I feel like it wouldn‚Äôt really matter and the experience you get from living on campus would be the same as off campus since you would normally or somewhat be with other college students that go to the school as well.

Is UCSD right for a master's in Finance?,"Hey Reddit,

A little background information... I'm from England and am finishing my undergraduate degree, I'm 22. I averaged 80% last year and will be averaging around 85% in my final year from a just above mid-table University. My dream is to eventually move to America and start my life in the States, I was made aware of green card/acceptance issues.

I applied after the scholarship deadline, and as I said I got the confirmation today that I have been offered a place - but no news on the scholarship side. I am aware that the costs would come to around $80,000 for the year with everything included if I were not to receive one... I would have to take out another loan to make this possible.

I have now maxed out the number of requests sent to reach out to alumni students of UCSD on Linkedin, so Reddit is my next destination...

How is UCSD perceived by employers within the States?

What jobs do Masters in Finance graduates end up in, from UCSD?

Help me, please...my dream is to enter the Investment Banking sector within the Goldman Sachs/JP Morgan's of this world and have been told by many Alumni who responded how this can be very difficult.. even with the great online rankings for UCSD.

How are y‚Äôall holding up a year later?,"I‚Äôm saying a year later because it‚Äôs been a little over a year since Zoom U started. 

But on my end I started Zoom U ok. Like I found it extremely boring but overall ok. But now..... Jesus Christ man I have little motivation and kinda in the feels since there are some people I‚Äôll never get to see again. It‚Äôs a mess on my end rn. 

Those lost 4 quarters would‚Äôve meant a lot for me. But  it be like that sometimes.",1620144546,1,0
What was/is your comfort food around campus?,"I'm posting this here mostly for the memories. I have been off campus since March 2020, and I really miss a few spots.

I guess this post can serve as a guide for incoming freshmen/transfers too, but some of the ideas might be outdated since I've heard a lot of places closed down.

I went to Baskin Robbins in Costa Verde (before it closed) at least once a week, before it closed. I'd usually go on MW or on TTh, after a long night class, and the same employees were there every time. The girl who worked there was really cute, so that didn't hurt either.

Regents Pizzeria was also a treasure trove of good food. It was open late enough that sometimes it was the only thing open nearby. White and Dominick's were gold.

On campus, Oceanview Terrace was really good. It's such a shame I discovered that place in February 2020, and I only had their custom pizzas, but they were really fucking good.

Goody's was amazing, and it worked out so well for me since I'd always be walking between RIMAC and Geisel, but Goody's is gone now. RIP.

The Bistro was really good, but their waits were sooooooo long. I don't know sushi quality that well nor do I know what most sushi restaurants are like, so I don't if the wait was especially long. There were multiple times when they said it would be 15-20 minutes before my ""friend"" and I could be seated, so we left and got food somewhere else.

Of course the farmers market every Tuesday was a goldmine. I don't remember exactly what I'd be getting there, but I never left unhappy.

OH MY GOD how could I forget Taco Villa? That was probably my favorite on campus.

This might get me banished, but I never really liked Santorini's. It was ok, but nothing too special.

I don't think Westfield had any spots that I particularly miss. I tried Shake Shack once, but it was whatever.",1620141443,1,0
I never pulled an all-nighter and I feel like I missed out.,"I'm not saying I never needed to pull an all-nighter. I wasn't always the best student, but instead of studying long hours, I just took the L.

In Fall 2020, I was honestly expecting to fail two of my major reqs since I was way behind. Instead of pulling an all-nighter, I just said fuck it and took the final. Apparently enough other people were struggling too, because the curves were generous and I ended up with a C- in both those classes.

In one of them, I think I literally had a 61% in the class, and that was enough for a C-. Thank God for the retrospective P/NP grading option they gave us by surprise.

Anyways, I feel like I never got to relate with other students on this level. UCSD is a school full of really hardworking people. When Geisel used to be open the whole night in finals week, I know a lot of people actually stayed up the whole night to study.

I was also never at Geisel long enough for them to come around and say ""we're closing you have to leave.""

I am hardworking-ish, but all-nighters are something I cannot relate to.",1620139881,1,0

How has living with your parents been working out?,"Painful.

I was in a hurry to get out of this house when I graduated high school, and this past year has reminded me of precisely why I was in such a hurry.

Pre-pandemic, I thought about spending a few years with my parents to save money while I'd be working. That's not going to happen now. I have been stuck in this insane house for more than a year now, and it's far more than I am able to handle.

I'd rather take on more debt than live with my parents.

I love my parents very much, but I just cannot live with them.

Is it too late to opt out of RedShelf?,"**TL;DR: Is it too late to opt out of RedShelf or do I just have to pay the costs?**

I feel like the opt-out system for RedShelf is designed to trap students like me who aren't super diligent about everything.

So I forgot to opt out of Redshelf this quarter, and now I have an account balance of like $32 on MyTritonLink.

I have not opened a RedShelf book a single time this quarter.

I honestly feel like the opt-out system should be illegal. It's almost like a credit card company making purchases for you, giving you the bill, and then saying ""oh you should have told us if you didn't want that.""

how is pre-dentistry at UCSD? is it true that you guys have the best pre-dental club in the world?,"i recently committed to UCSD because i talked to one current dental student at UCSF who attended UCSD. he made a very convincing argument as to why UCSD is a great choice for pre-dentistry. however, thinking back, i realized i didn't really get other opinions from the UCSD student body so i'm asking here. 

i also asked other dental students and dentists (not from UCSD) about where i should go and most of them told me to choose UCSD (especially over UC Berkeley which was my other choice at the time). i kept being told that it would be slightly easier to maintain my GPA, join clubs, find research opportunities, and enjoy the easy going lifestyle there. the one that many kept brining up is that UCSD has the best pre-dental club in the world. in the moment, i just believed it but now i am wondering as to why it is the best? what makes it so amazing?

Waitlist Summer Session,"Hello, 
So I am currently on waitlist for CHEM6C and HUM3 during summer. I am #6 on the list for CHEM6C and #25 on the HUM3 list. I am thinking that there is a big chance of enrolling for the CHEM6C class since the total class size is 130 and they should add 10% from the list, which would be the first 13 students. However, the HUM3 class size is of 50 students and I am the last student on the list, #25, which is half the class size. I am hoping that they can increase capacity because there is a really long list equivalent to 50% of availability. Is there a good chance of getting into the course or should I just give up? Could they increase the class size and add more TA‚Äôs, or does this rarely happen?",1620084153,1,0

How is possible that CSE 142L is this bad,"Not only is it the most confusing and incoherent class, but the professors and staff treat everyone with such contempt. Nothing works at the beginning and then they refuse to give extensions when they release broken labs. CSE 142L is THE worst class I've ever taken at UCSD.

A quick list of what's happened in the class

* ALL four labs were not fully functional when they were released, taking 2-3 days to get fixed. They would then (sometimes) give a day extension and then scold everyone for not starting earlier. 
* Every lab essentially had a guide made by students that were infinitely more useful than anything the instructors gave us. Lab 3 was essentially impossible without a guide by a student teaching content that was later taught two weeks later. I think everyone used this guide to get even close to finishing it, and without it, so many more people would just have failed the assignment. Either it's an academic integrity violation and you need to take it down, or it should have been part of the instructions in the first place. 
* For half of our labs, when the lab was due, so many people were working on it that it essentially broke the entire thing (i.e. the site we use for submissions would break and time out every time, giving everyone zeroes; we have to ssh into the school's computers and open a docker image, and no one was able to get into one, and people were getting kicked out of them randomly. There also wasn't an extension on this one, thank you very much.
* We have to use shitty software that barely works (thanks moneta) and is a pain to use. It's also broken all the time (the final project just got released and it's broken again, but probably no extension). Their solution to this problem was to ""increase resources to your docker image"" which made everything even slower and essentially made the lab impossible to finish. 

I'm probably forgetting about so many more of the issues we've had with this class. The professors saw our complaints a while ago and their response was ""yeah it's like this in the real world so suck it up"". Thanks for single-handedly pushing everyone away from the computer architecture field. 

I understand that CSE 142 and CSE 142L are new classes and there are going some problems, but this is like a 0.0.1-alpha-prebuild release that evidently was not even tested before given to students. And every time there's an issue, we're either ghosted by the staff or just ridiculed. We can read the instructions, and your actions are just demeaning and demoralizing. This class is laughable in how terrible it's being run and it would be a funny joke if it wasn't completely unacceptable. I took MATH 183 with Ezzati, how is this class even worse than that shitshow.",1621292729,1,0
Manifest: Local Networking Web Application For UC System,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRW-w\_UIjYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRW-w_UIjYk)

The best way I can explain this app is with a Spongebob metaphor. In this episode, the krusty krab is the university/college system of clubs, resource centers, etc. and the bulletin board is the Manifest app. Manifest brings a bulletin board abstraction of messaging to the abstraction of the Krusty Krab, which is actually the entire university system of clubs, resource centers, and institutional orgs (thus currently working with UCSC Resource Centers and the rest of the UC system for this pitch).

Manifest could be a community bulletin board machine of great good, so long as it is free from unlawful censorship and has community standards that facilitate amazing and inspiring interactions.

Here is a more formal pitch for a web app I'm working on called Manifest to connect clubs on campus within UCSC (my school) and the rest of the UC system (including UCI):

* What is the Manifest app? Messaging for local communities.
* What is the problem it solves? Sharing information between locals quickly and efficiently.
* So what, who cares? It may help to streamline events, activities, and more in real-time within the local area. There are so many steps to joining a club, promoting events, and emailing groups‚ÄîManifest was created to unify these activities in a local platform.
* Demo link: [https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)

Here are the instructions to install the app on any smartphone home screen by going to the demo URL ([https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)):

1. Have location services enabled via Privacy &gt; Location Services (on) &gt; Safari Websites (Ask or Allow)
2. Have location services enabled via General Settings &gt; Safari &gt; Location &gt; Ask/Allow, you can add the app to your home screen via the Safari app on iPhone.
3. Once added to the home screen, it should work as a native iPhone app.
4. After location is enabled, here are similar Android instructions to add on home screen: [https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en)
5. Note: to enable location on Android, it is required that Google Chrome settings allow for the location to load, and this must be adjusted via Chrome or the default browser.

The url to access the site and add to home screen is: [https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)

The main bet behind Manifest is the idea that locals can share contextual information more quickly and efficiently than anywhere else on the web.

Palestine,"As I am sure many of you know, over the past two weeks there has been an increase in bombings on the Palestinian people from Israel. Innocent lives are being lost and entire generations and families are being murdered. 

Around this time last year, George Floyd and countless other African Americans were murdered, prompting an increased prominence of the Black Lives Matter movement. Many institutions sent out statements condemning these acts of violence and showing their support for the BLM movement. However, when Palestinians are being persecuted overseas, and many family members of UCSD students are living in fear of dying in Palestine, there has been no acknowledgement or sign of solidarity shown by UC, or even by the classes who claim that they stand for justice. It is shameful to see and often leaves many Palestinian students and Muslim students feel disregarded and overlooked.

I understand that the BLM protest was one that affected our communities directly, since it was an issue in the US, which prompted many to take immediate action. However, despite the fact that this issue does not affect our communities in the US directly, it is still a humanitarian issue. It is unacceptable to stand by while innocent lives are being lost in Palestine. 

Specifically at UCSD, many Palestinian and Muslim students have been distressed by what is happening in Palestine, making it difficult for them to focus on assignments and any aspects related to college work. During this time last year, many accommodations were made for students due to the distress caused by the incidents regarding African Americans. It would be nice to see the same level of empathy given to students now during what can be distressing times for many UCSD students. At the very least, I think UC should release some statement standing in solidarity with those impacted.",1621283406,1,0

My profs are giving out 24 hr midterm exams that take about 12 hours to complete (one of the main reasons why I hate remote work, in class we would only suffer for 1hr rather than using software during the exam now). 

I haven‚Äôt exercised in forever and I feel pretty unhealthy man. Also my body feels pretty inflamed, puffy cheeks etc. any home remedies to help? 

Sorry for the rant, good luck throughout the quarter.",1621272952,1,0

Need advice for toxic lab,"Hi everyone,

I thought I‚Äôd found my dream lab for completing my ms. However, things have been pretty rough for me since I joined it. 
I don‚Äôt want to put many details for the sake of staying anonymous, but the post doc in charge of me has been pretty abusive toward me since I joined it (she would send me texts in the middle of the night, giving me the silent treatment,even lashed out on me in front off a pHd student and For the past 5 months, literally used me as ‚Äúlabor‚Äù to do things for her &amp; with every time that i ask her to explain me the context or the scientific reason behind what she is doing, she would ways roll out her eyes at me or make me understand she doesn‚Äôt have time to explain, and Refuse to even teach me cell culture when that literally the most important skills needed in this lab). Now, things has taken a turn such that this week end, she called me in the middle of the night to scream at me (for something ridiculous!) and send me very inappropriate text message and making false accusation through an email that she ccd the Pi. I talked to my PI who will have a conversation with us individually soon, but the other post doc who is aware of the situation told me to not have any high expectation as my Pi needs this post doc right now. Everyday since I started I feel always stress going to this lab. My friends encourage  me to stay and not let this post doc to stop me from accomplishing my plan (Pi is a very good mentor), but I feel very stressed about this whole situation. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore at this point. Please any advice and inputs would be welcomed.",1621271533,1,0
I prefer to modify my ‚Äúethnic‚Äù name so it‚Äôs easier for other people to pronounce.,"UCSD has a very diverse student body. People come from all kinds of backgrounds and have all kinds of names.

I will not dox myself, but I have a name that most people have not heard before and struggle to pronounce. Let‚Äôs pretend my name is ‚ÄúKhorshed.‚Äù

I usually don‚Äôt pronounce it ‚Äúauthentically,‚Äù unless I‚Äôm speaking to other Persians who are speaking Persian. I change it up a little so that it‚Äôs easier for people to say. The ‚Äúkh‚Äù sound is kind of like clearing your throat, and that is a sound most English speakers are not used to making mid-sentence. It catches people off guard. Before they can pronounce it ‚Äúauthentically,‚Äù I would have to teach them how to. Honestly, that much effort is not worth it to me.

I also feel a little awkward changing accents mid-sentence to pronounce different words ‚Äúauthentically‚Äù while speaking in English. This goes for both names and other words.

I don‚Äôt think anything is unreasonable or self-hating about this. I think it‚Äôs personal preference. I‚Äôm not ashamed of my background, but I honestly don‚Äôt want to mix languages, because I think that‚Äôs awkward.

Usually when this topic is brought up, I feel like my approach is considered to ‚Äúwhitewashed,‚Äù and that someone with self-respect would ‚Äúown‚Äù their name by demanding that it be pronounced correctly.

What do you all think about this?",1621270291,1,0

Poop - Do you know someone who is doing fecal matter or gut research?

Mom is fully vaccinated, which likely adds another layer of 'rare poop' to research.

HELP! Absolutely torn between grad housing options!,"I am a PhD student joining this fall and I cannot for the life of me figure out which grad housing community I should go for. (I am opting for 2/3 bed apartments - and I am single)

While I like the new construction and amenities of Mesa Neuva, people say that the apartments are too small, bad sound proofing and feeling of being in a dungeon. 

Neuvo east and west seem too pricy and small. I have no idea about One miramar street.

Control Theory for non-ECE/MAE major,"Hey all, I'm not an ECE or MAE major, but I did robotics in high school and I'm really interested in control theory. I looked for some courses and saw them in the ECE and MAE department but they're both more focused towards signal processing which I don't particularly care for (and have restrictive prerequisites anyway) There is a robotics-focused one in MAE but it has a non-trivial amount of prereqs from the MAE department, so that's not necessarily really feasible for me either.

How would you feel about an on-campus place to sleep?,"Kind of like those sleep pods at RIMAC, except way more legit. I‚Äôm thinking of a quiet few floors in a building, where there are beds for students to lie down and sleep. It would be about as dim as a movie theater, so you‚Äôd still have maybe one or two employees watching over to make sure nothing naughty is going on, but other than that, you go there to just relax and sleep.

I had many times in which I was in between classes, I had a lot of extra time, and I hadn‚Äôt slept well the night before. I always thought it would be so nice if I could just go somewhere on campus to sleep, instead of going all the way back to my apartment.

If I sleep in the car, I always wake up sore and my skin has weird imprints. So I don‚Äôt do that.

I also can‚Äôt really sleep in direct sunlight.

If there was a dark quiet place on campus for sleeping, it would be so useful for me.

Maybe they could even charge you by the hour.

Advice for incoming freshmen,"I am a graduating senior and here‚Äôs my advice.

Spend freshman year trying out new things. By sophomore year, you should already have a plan of some kind on what you‚Äôll do after graduating. Your plan can change as time goes on, but DO NOT expect yourself to ‚Äúfigure things out later on.‚Äù That kind of thinking will land you in your parents‚Äô house without a job after you graduate. I know that because so many of my friends have done the same.

Get your random requirements out of the way ASAP. Take your DEI out in your first quarter, start your MMW classes early on, etc. Especially in your junior and senior years, when you‚Äôre busy with internships, you will thank me for telling you this.

Focus on landing internships. In my controversial opinion, especially if you‚Äôre thinking of getting a job straight after graduating, internships are even more important than earning good grades.

Find at least one mentor to keep in touch with in the field you want to go into. Academia can be a sort of bubble since tenured faculty are sometimes out of touch with the current state of affairs. Knowing someone who is actually in your desired end goal will help you know what things are really like.

Think, as frequently as you can, about how you are setting yourself apart from others. Dozens of people (college educated) are applying for jobs that‚Äôs posted on LinkedIn. You don‚Äôt want to be just another name on a list of 98 job applicants. You want your name to be bold, highlighted, and underlined in all caps. I don‚Äôt know what field you‚Äôre in or what your future goals are, so I can‚Äôt really tell you how to distinguish yourself, but make sure you keep this in mind.

Have fun but don‚Äôt party too hard. This school is only socially dead for students who are. If you want to make friends, you can.

Make friends that are like-minded, not just friends that are fun to spend time with. Your friends influence you, like it or not, so you want to be around people who are helping you grow, providing you with support, looking for internships, studying hard, engaging in ethical practices, and having fun with you. That rubs off on you.",1621159952,1,0
