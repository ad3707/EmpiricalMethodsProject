"With that lab, error could be introduced in a million different ways, even if you follow the procedure to the letter. Id say if the TA isn't being helpful, ask the professor for advice. Because you can introduce a ton of error by such small things, like poor transfer technique, poor technique when weighing stuff out, especially hygroscopic materials, not being precise with your solution preps, or rushing through seemingly simply steps.

"from the perspective of a CS major with no experience with aerospace at UCF, make sure you know what you're getting into first

maybe try taking one beginner CS course like intro to C to check if you like the work you'd be doing in the major before committing to it

additionally, take a look at the foundation exam content and what that requires. a lot of CS majors struggle with the foundation exam, and an inability to pass this exam could have you switching majors again if you aren't prepared for it (if you've never heard of the FE, all CS majors must pass the exam before being allowed to take upper level electives)

"I sympathize, it can be very frustrating to be trapped on the wrong side of the class average but I'm not sure what you were expecting them to tell you. The chemistry department is severely understaffed for the amount of through put they have to do especially for the lower level courses. Having one professor and a handful of TA's cover hundreds of students is rough and individualized attention isn't really an option, it's more about, ""how can I help the most amount of students."" These are courses where it takes a lot of prep work to be successful and it's very easy to fall behind. None of the professors want to fail you but they do have different approaches to teaching and if you make the standards to laid back the students will never grow and feel a need to learn concepts they will need later on. They'll just eat zero after zero on something that just having it explained a second time in a different way could fix. If they just passed you despite struggling now you'd just be in the same situation in the next class you have to take in the series.   

 If the grading standards are extremely high make sure to clarify with the professor what they looking for in the assignments, ask them questions, and go to office hours. They need feedback too on what concepts you're struggling with and where the confusion is. I've never had any of the professors give me the impression that they were absolutely unreasonable and couldn't be worked with.

If you see yourself as more of going for systems administration or other stuff you should go for IT. You can totally get a coding job doing IT but you just get less related course work.

"I thought the experience was great. I could have gone to a more prestigious school, but the perks at UCF were great - not to mention the weather (I'm from Michigan). UCF also has some majors which are quite good. Whether you choose UCF should depend not just on the money and perks, but also which major you want.

"My friend works in one of the advising departments and what they found out this week (not a finalized plan) is that DeSantis wants as many face to face classes as there was at the start of spring 2020 for state universities.

The Provost announced at the board of trustees committee meeting last week that spring classes will have substantially more face-to-face sections. Fall had about 600 sections that were face-to-face; spring will be close to 2500 sections. The caveat is that those sections will have fewer students than previously as the university follows physical distancing requirements which will limit the number of students who may be in the classroom at one time. The goal is to have the spring schedule published and final in early November.,1603072478,1,0

"I don't want to focus much on the academics, at the end of the day you'll learn the same stuff at either UCF or UF. This may come as a surprise to you, but UCF has a great talent pipeline into the industry. We had about 50 Microsoft interns last summer. We have dedicated recruiters from Microsoft, Facebook, Google, etc. and our pipeline only grows every year: Two of my friends received opportunities from Twitter (one person got an internship, the other one  got a full-time offer). The reason why we have a good pipeline is because our cybersecurity and competitive programming teams catch the companies' eyes. They come for our teams, but they stay for our students since they see we have highly capable developers being produced here.

I was in the same predicament you're in about two years ago, I got into UCF and UF, and although I was set on coming to UCF since my sophomore year of high school, the fact that I got into both universities meant I at least had to weigh my options. I was further ahead in the curriculum if I came to UCF so I chose this university ultimately. I now have two internships at big name companies in 2021 thanks to our pipeline. I might have been able to pull it off at UF as well, but honestly we have some amazing recruiters here.

That's excluding the really top tier CS schools but both UF and UCF are just big public state schools. Both schools have very smart people and great clubs, and big companies go to career events at both. If you put in the effort you'll be successful at either.

But now I'm at UCF and majoring in IT within the college of CS. Let me tell you, the experience is like night and day. Not a lot of distraction mean a better learning environment and you can excel. 

I'm about to graduate next spring and big name companies have already express interest. UCF have an excellent CS program that have won first place for many years now. UCF is partnered with a lot of big name tech companies that practically come on campus to recruit every semester. So yeah, UCF in my opinion, is a smart investment. Hope that helps.",1609383816,1,0

"Computer Engineering major here, not CS but quite close, and I can answer your second question about CS1.

CS1 is all about taking those basic elements you learned (or will learn) in your first coding class and learning the basics of how to use them together in new and more optimal ways. For example, in your first coding class you‚Äôll learn about what arrays are, but in CS1 you‚Äôll learn about good ways to sort those arrays. Some of the things that you‚Äôll learn in this class can be quite tricky, however this is your first real taste of Computer Science in my opinion, so taking the time to understand this material is key. 

I believe Object Oriented Programming is the other class required for the exam, and that is partially a review of your first programming course and partially an intro into the idea of objects and how to use them in programming. Exactly what that all entails is kinda lengthy to put into one comment but you‚Äôll have time to learn it in class.

CS1 and OOP use C and Java respectively in their course, so taking some time to familiarize yourself with how to achieve certain goals (like how to create lists or how to sort an array) in those languages could only help. Later classes like CS2 can use different languages, but I think you‚Äôre mostly concerned with the foundation exam, so only worry about C, Java, and Pseudocode for now.

If you did well on your Intro to programming class you should be fine in later classes, just don‚Äôt get cocky lol",1609382968,1,0
"I'm sorry to hear about your situation. You should contact the Registrar's Office again. 

Based on your situation, you may be classified as an independent, but then you are responsible for providing the documents for FL residency. 

""At any time since the student turned age 13, where both of the student‚Äôs parents are deceased, or the student is or was (until age 18) one of the following:
(a) a ward/dependent of the court or
(b) in foster care.""",1609382361,1,0
"Students have to fill out a residency reclassification form through the Registrar's Office and provide proper documentation to go from out-of-state to in-state tuition. I understand that it's frustrating, but they need specific documents showing at least 12 months of continuous residence. Just living here does not mean you get in-state tuition rates.

There is also a difference if you are independent or dependent and if you or your parent/guardian need to provide the information.

If anyone has questions, you should contact the Registrar's Office. UCF reopens on 01/04.

"As for prestige, if its not an Ivy League university or an academy then pretty much the school name generally isnt going to be a bonus unless the employer is an alumni. It really can actually hurt you from time to time if a school has a reputation as a party school. UF academic programs outside of Ag and Engineering arent something its known for, of course UCF has the same issue despite having great programs. Also the farther away from Florida you get, the less chance of finding an alum of either of the schools so unless you plan on staying in the state, then the name matters even less. You might see if the program you are interested in has any corporate sponsors that are tied to a particular program that you might want to work for.

"I think engineering or CS would be great options. While a degree in applied mathematics might be a good idea as well (based on your interests), it seems like you don't want to stay in academia. If mathematics is your passion, I'd say to follow what you love to do. However, if money is more of a factor look into engineering. I'm a CS major (so I can't really speak for the other engineering disciplines), but we use a TON of math. A lot of CS jobs are in web dev and IT, but you can always go into AI, data science, or software engineering which is more math and research based. Additionally, maybe look into doing a math minor while you're here. 

I never saw myself as being particularly good at math when I started my degree, I just liked coding. But, as I took the courses for my degree I started to love doing math, speaking with math majors, discussing intuition, etc. One of my close friends is super into math as well but is going for an engineering degree because they want to go into industry and build things. I'd suggest trying a couple engineering or CS courses and seeing if you like them.

I was actually talking to global ucf about this weeks ago. You can technically just go abroad and learn another language or they can fund you.

I would have a laptop with a camera since most classes are online. The degree of how expensive and fancy you want your laptop is up to you. Most people have ipad to take notes.

"I‚Äôm in CS but kinda just starting out (just took intro to c, data logic and organization, CS1, and security in computing) so I can give a little bit of a glimpse into it. 

My biggest thing to tell you off the bat is that there is a big difference between Software Development and Computer Science. I mention this because you stated that math may not be for you. Computer Science has a lot of theory and math while software development is from my understanding less marg and theory and more practical coding. 

You can get a CS degree and be a software developer and not use all those theories but you basically have to be able to at least learn them well enough to pass and graduate. Also in CS you only really do C and Java until after the foundation exam (after CS1). So if those languages aren‚Äôt for you or you don‚Äôt have much interest in the ideas that the languages are being used to teach you (recursion, stacks, memory management, performance, etc.) then the early part of the major can seem lame (especially C, since it‚Äôs just text and that may not do it for some people). I‚Äôm not trying to scare you out of CS but I feel that the distinction between Software Development and CS is large and not well spoken about until you‚Äôre actually in CS or trying to get in. So if you like to code but don‚Äôt care for a lot of the math, then maybe software development degree would be better for you. 

IMPORTANT: idk if ucf has a software development degree so this may not be an option for you. End of real important part. 

About you mentioning the security side of things, there is a surprising amount of math in security on the CS side of things. I‚Äôve only taking security in computing but there was an unexpected (to me) amount of math. So maybe specializing in security in the IT major instead could be better. I really recommend seeing if you can ask someone on both sides or at least tried one of the sides. 

You only need intro to c and data logic and organization (I think) to take security in computing so if you wanted to see for yourself if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôd consider doing you can take it before switching majors and it‚Äôll only take up 3 electives (class plus the prereqs might even only be two electives since I may be wrong on one of them). IT also seems like a shorter major to me than CS and you don‚Äôt have to stress about the Foundation Exam. Also double check me on this but I believe intro to C is required for both IT and CS. 

Also if you choose to o something else and you still like coding then join some of the CS clubs. They‚Äôre very chill and interesting, they teach you a lot and you get to code stuff (especially helpful if you like to code but you feel a little lost on what to code). Check out the hacking club to see more about the security things and see if you can make it to their seminar next semester as from my understanding they talk about stuff someone interested in security field would be curious about and not just strictly club stuff.",1609356620,1,0

BTW, Joe Guilder (Home Studio Corner) is a great resource for learning to mix and his teaching applies to any DAW. He's on YouTube, but offers a mixing course that is pretty good.

"If you're planning on going to law school right away, you should have your score by Fall of the admissions cycle. So if you'll be applying during 2021-2022 cycle for admission into Fall 2022, you'll want to make sure you have a score by fall 2021 since classes can fill up and you'll want time to figure out where you're applying. If you want to start in Fall 2021, I'd test sooner than later, but check out your target schools' deadlines for applications/LSAT dates. I definitely wouldn't rush since a few LSAT points can be the difference between big acceptances or even big scholarships sometimes.

I recommend using Powerscore's Logic Games Bible and their other bibles, and a lot of people recommend 7sage or other online places that help with the LSAT, although the prices really vary. Again, Khan Academy is free and helpful for starters/learning where you're at, and Powerscore's books are good for going more in depth into the test.

You can check out /r/LSAT and /r/lawschooladmissions for advice about the whole process. I haven't really talked to UCF's advisor tbh, partially bc I'm not sure who I would reach out to and also because I've heard mixed things from people who have used UCF stuff, like saying that schools average your LSAT scores (they don't).

Good luck with your process! I hope I didn't come off too strong with unsolicited advice, I'm just used to talking a lot in the other subs and I want my fellow knights to succeed.",1608335588,1,0

As for interviewing skills and practices, you would speak to one of us, the Career Counselors. 

Now back to the pseudo-mentorship. I‚Äôve had instances where students meet with me for career exploration and continue to stay in touch with me throughout the year. Our job is to help you from start to finish in whatever you‚Äôd like to get done career wise. From exploration to resumes to job searching, interviews and salary negotiations.

"Ahh, that makes sense then. I‚Äôm glad to hear you were thinking ahead! Reflection is definitely needed in the field you‚Äôre going into. 

I believe there are GAs, GTA (grad teaching assistant) and GRA (grad research assistant). I was a GA. Usually departments and/or offices will send out emails saying that they‚Äôre looking for GAs. You‚Äôd apply for them the same way you‚Äôd apply for any other job. You‚Äôd send in your resume, go through the interview process and they‚Äôll see who is a better fit.

The ones I named are usually the ones I hear the most about. A good idea would be to join the Graduate Student Association on Facebook. I and a few others post GAs that are available throughout the year. 

Best piece of advice I can give you and anyone else reading this is to always keep your resume up to date and easily accessible. What do I mean by this? Get someone at my office to look over your resume and keep it either in your email, Dropbox or Google drive to send off at a moment‚Äôs notice. I keep my updated resume in Google drive and I can send it off within seconds of someone asking for it. That‚Äôs actually how I got my GA. The posting went up, I sent my email 10 minutes after I saw the email. They reached out 20 minutes later.

They could possibly offer an option to come in, then broadcast that class online, but there is no way to make it required. With everyone being cautious still, I can't see the university *adding* more in person activities on campus than are necessary.",1600970580,1,0

If you have a few weeks, then you should be able to figure out your work schedule. If it's tomorrow, then that is a bit unreasonable. 

Also keep in mind that there's only one professor and many students. They can't possibly figure out an exam schedule that magically fits everybody's availability.

I watched the first few minutes but don't really have time to watch it all looking for what you're referring to. 

Personally, I wouldn't call following behind her to shout their disagreement as ""chasing"". Yes, they were following her, but they have a right to do so as long as they don't physically touch her since it's an open campus. 

Did anyone actually *physically* attack her? Do you have the time stamp for that and for the conversation between her and the cop? They show a few highlights in the beginning but it's hard to hear what they're saying. 

I don't agree with physical confrontation. But I will argue that heckling or verbally harassing someone isn't force. Once again, the students had just as much right to be there and to speak, even up to threats, as she did. You can't arrest someone for verbally threatening you because they can just say it was a joke or they didn't mean it. 

Furthermore, I would say that someone who *isn't* a student has less right to be on campus than actual  students, especially now. 

Once again. She would have been perfectly safe imo just standing on her soapbox and saying what she wanted. She purposefully provoked a response and played the victim. The whole ""escape"" and running to the van Was clearly played up.

"&gt;As far as I know she wasn't forcibly removed from campus right?

Thats not quite true.  In the video the police threaten her and ask her to leave on the basis of the fact that the commotion is unsafe.  They are right, but it wouldn't be a commotion if her opposition was obeying social distancing.  I dont think the cop was aware, but thats super unconstitutional.   Imagine if anti abortion protestors could surround a planned parenthood, causing the fire Marshall to come shut down the planned parenthood in hopes of dissolving the situation.  That kind of ""hecklers veto"" is really explicitly against the first amendment, and its the main reason cops protect the KKK when they show up: the first amendment requires the state to protect everyone from violence regardless of what they say and can't silence speech on the basis of the fact that others don't like it.

&gt;No one stopped her from talking, she left because she was never there to debate and she got what she wanted.

Like I explained above, thats not quite true.  Plus, additionally, in the video you can see that the counter protestors were explicitly threatening, verbally and physically, to the point of chasing her and assaulting her, which also isn't legal.

&gt;Free speech swings both ways. You're free to talk but you're not free from criticism.

This is totally true, and I fucking hate Kaitlin Bennett.  But she actually arguably did have her free speech rights violated.

How hard was it to get one? I filled out a google form ON THE LAST DAY BEFORE THEY ANNOUNCED THEY WERE GOING TO TOW TO ALL RESIDENTS, walked to the phase I building, signed a paper, and was on my way.

You had like a month and a half to get a parking pass and you didn‚Äôt. They gave numerous reminders and it took at max an hour of your time to go and get one.

"&gt;I mean obviously it would be better if it were possible to ignore these people right out of existence, but it‚Äôs just not. She‚Äôs purposefully provocative to get a reaction, and it‚Äôs always going to be human nature to respond... I‚Äôm not quite sure what people genuinely expect.

In life you can't fight everyone that says something that makes you upset. End of story. Doesn't matter she is a provocateur or it is ""human nature"".

Many college kids are just out of high school and likely haven't learned this lesson. Thats fair, it's a maturity thing, and she knew they would take the bait. With the pandemic, everything closed and people being stuck inside, tensions are high and many used this event as a way to vent inapporpriately. It was kind of a perfect storm to fuel her content.

What bothers me is some of the counter protesters interviewed aren't even current students. They just had nothing going on and showed up to protest. Obviously they only stoked the fire, which escalated everything. :/",1599944835,27,0

"What I find most hilarious about this is that she defended her ""right"" to be on campus by claiming free speech. 

Okay fine. You're free to say *whatever* you want. 

The other students that you originally harassed are *also* free to disagree with you and say that they don't want you there. 

As far as I know she wasn't forcibly removed from campus right? No one stopped her from talking, she left because she was never there to debate and she got what she wanted.

Free speech swings both ways. You're free to talk but you're not free from criticism.",1599943724,9,0

"The music option is really the best one. 

The issue is that ""leaving them alone"" isn't really a good option, because then they're still able to spread their bullshit. By not doing anything, you're telling them that their behavior is acceptable.

By making it impossible for them to do what they want in a non-confrontational way, you're keeping them from spreading harmful misinformation and essentially wasting their time.",1599943010,23,0
