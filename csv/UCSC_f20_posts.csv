Welcoming Events for First-Years,"hey everyone I was reading how many first years aren‚Äôt aware of any of the welcome events planned for them. Sorry the school hasn‚Äôt been able to communicate these events too well. Just a little background, the way I noticed the system kind of works at UCSC is that all events, advising, and things are managed by colleges individually. There‚Äôs not many school wide events besides Cornucopia (club fair on 9/29). I know for a fact that Oakes and RCC are having welcome week events starting this Saturday because I am a Welcome Leader. If you belong to any of these 2 colleges then you can look on your google calendars and see the events and zoom links posted on there. I don‚Äôt know about the other colleges (I assume they are also planning events for first-years/transfers). But if not y‚Äôall are welcome to come to the Oakes and RCC events even if you aren‚Äôt in those colleges. In all of these events,  there‚Äôs also a chance to win gift cards. We are really trying to help you all adjust, make friends, learn, find mentors, have fun, etc. If you attend these events literally ask your welcome leaders anything! we want to support y‚Äôall and make your first year as painless as possible :) 


ps if you can‚Äôt find any info about events for your college then I suggest you reach out and find your college‚Äôs instagram or you can email your college directly.",1600969423,1,0

Dhar Update: Help from Alan Christy; Send us a Testimonial!!!,"Welcome back to the party everyone

**Update:**

Today we met with Alan Christy, the chair of the council of provosts, to discuss the fact that Dhar failed almost every single person caught up in this debacle. 

To catch everyone up, it's been almost three weeks since the dean of undergraduate education (i think) told Dhar he has to give out grades and do the cases right. He didn't do so, failed almost everyone, and has not started the academic misconduct process for almost anyone. One student received an explanation for their failed grade - Dhar confirmed it was not reflective of their performance in class but instead awarded because Dhar found the student guilty of misconduct (no evidence once again). So, it's safe to assume he failed most of you because he still thinks you're cheating. This is not okay. 

Alan was very sympathetic - he believes we have a very good case for grade petitions and complaints, and intends to try to persuade the relevant parties into giving students their grades. If that doesn't work and Dhar won't budge on grades, Alan believes the weight of a grade petition/complaint of this nature shouldn't be put on all of the individual students, so he is going to use all the info and evidence he's gathered to work with the CCI and at least make the grade petition/complaint process a lost easier on everyone. That's where you come in!

**We're gathering student testimonials**

Were you in PHYS 6A/6B with Dhar this Spring? Did you have a bad experience with him? Are you a victim of the Chegg witch hunt? Send me a short summary of your negative experiences with Dhar! *This goes tenfold for those of you who had meetings with him where he intimidated you, bullied you, withheld evidence from you,* ***offered you a plea deal (and especially if he later failed you),*** *etc.* It also goes for those who had requests to miss class or extend deadlines denied for horrible reasons, or who got yelled at during office hours, etc. 

Alan would like to use these testimonials in a case against Dhar's conduct. He believes his capricious behavior extends back through the whole Spring quarter, so any student in his Spring classes are welcome to send me a testimonial. *They will be anonymous.* They don't have to be long or special, and I'm happy to help you write them.   

Along with that, Alan told us that Dhar has promised to submit the misconduct forms within a week. So, you can expect an email from your provost, maybe. However, Dhar has made claims like that many times in the past.. If you don't get an email from your provost soon, that's an even better case against him. Also, it's best to file a CCI complaint *after* you've completed the academic misconduct process, so we're waiting for him to actually submit forms before we worry about that.

**Send me your experiences with Dhar! We're so close to ending this! With enough evidence** (and luck) **we may be able to avoid filing grade changes entirely**

Thank you to everyone who's helped us along the way - y'all rock. Huge thanks to Alan Christy, who is a super nice guy. If anyone wants help or more info, feel free to msg me!! Sorry for cluttering the subreddit with this stuff so often lol.",1600747867,1,0

Questions about transfer credits,"I'm an incoming student and right now I am not sure of my credit amount because it hasn't transferred over yet.

I'm pretty sure that I will go above the 105 CC transfer limit, but I have some questions. Currently, I need 16 classes to graduate, but I am planning on taking 2 classes at CC in Fall due to unit restrictions. It says that I can get subject credit for those classes, does this mean that they will satisfy my GE requirements if I don't get the units?

I have 40 AP credits, which apparently are different from the CC transfer limit but some don't satisfy any requirements. If I only take 14 classes at UCSC (70 units) and my CC units (105) are maxed out, then I will have all my grad requirements done except the 180 units. 

Can I just use the AP credits which are basically irrelevant to boost me above 180, since they don't count towards the CC limit? Or am I wrong about this",1600639645,1,0

Confusion about Withdrawal Reminder email,"Hey guys, I am an incoming transfer student and I am very confused and scared right now. Up until recently I was fine moving into the dorms, but now I may have other options for living space and I feel like it would be safer for me to cancel my housing contract. Today I got an email about withdrawal (im not withdrawing) which stated this in its ‚ÄúUniversity Housing‚Äù portion:


‚ÄúUNIVERSITY HOUSING:

Students scheduled to move-in for fall 2020: If you have decided not to live in university housing this fall, you must return to the Housing Portal (studenthousing.ucsc.edu) and cancel your housing contract. As a result of your withdrawal from the quarter, all financial aid you may have received for fall quarter will be rescinded from your MyUCSC student account. You may be billed for funds sent directly to you and/or your parents as the result of a financial aid refund. If you have questions about this process and financial aid, please contact the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office at (831) 459-2963 or by email to finaid@ucsc.edu.‚Äù

Does this mean that if I cancel my housing contract, I may lose ALL of my financial aid? I understand the way I‚Äôm reading it means that it only applies to people withdrawing from the quarter, but im just scared and confused because they placed it under the ‚Äúuniversity housing‚Äù portion immediately after explaining I should cancel my housing contract soon.

Advice on CSE30 for incoming transfer for CS?,"Hey everyone! So I‚Äôm an incoming transfer for computer science and I already took Stats 131 during summer edge (didn‚Äôt have much trouble with it). I‚Äôm not really sure how classes at UCSC will compare to the community college curriculum though so I‚Äôm worried about overextending myself in my first full-time quarter here. 

I was advised to take CSE 101 and 120 for the fall so I signed up for those, but I‚Äôm having trouble finding a third whether it‚Äôs general ed (all the open classes seem to have too many prereqs or require me to major in that field) or a random comp sci class. Right now I‚Äôve signed up for CSE 30 (I got transfer credit for CSE 20) and I‚Äôm unsure how well my community college will have prepared me in python for this. What scares me a bit though is that the class is 7 units when the others are all 5. I just want to stay a full-time time student and learn without spreading myself too thin, and I‚Äôm not sure if the ‚Äúextra/ unnecessary‚Äù class should take that much of my time.

Do you think the campus will resume in person classed at some point this academic year?,"I know we haven't gotten an official statement from the admin regarding whether or not campus will open up at some point this year, but I'm curious what you guys think will happen.  Also does anyone know if any of the other UC's have announced anything? UCSC tends to decide last after every other UC has made a decision.

I paid for a year long parking permit out of anticipation of the campus reopening at least partially at some point, since it's better to have it than be without it if the time comes...(I also just stress too much about being able to park my car on campus) but TAPS released an email not too long ago announcing they're temporarily waiving the administration fee for cancellation of a permit, in case somebody would like to cancel receiving their pass.

Personally I think its pretty heinous the admin has yet to comment on whether or not the school will resume in person classes this year. I also thought it was a slap in the face of TAPS to offer a waiver of a $20 admin fee when we literally have no clue if in person classes will resume. Almost as if they were to say ""we'll let you take the gamble classes wont open up for the remainder of the year for free, but good luck trying to get your money back later if your pass winds up to be useless!""",1599770628,1,0

UCSC open campus: possibly a way to take part time classes for cheaper?,"So I was about to take a LOA and take CC classes bc zoom classes are not worth the price imo but my advisor just told me about this: [https://www.ucsc-extension.edu/resources/concurrent-enrollment/](https://www.ucsc-extension.edu/resources/concurrent-enrollment/)

It looks like you can take UCSC courses for $350/unit + $110 application fee. You have to get instructor approval for courses not listed on the site and IDK how this works for prerequisites but it looks like it's a lot cheaper if you want to just take one class ($1860 for 5 units vs $3700 for part time tuition).

Freshman Year Workload?,"Hi, I'm currently taking MATH 19A, CSE 20, and the core class for C9.

Under normal circumstances I would sign up, but I'm already enrolled in 15 credits as a Freshman and (for me at least) these are pretty intensive courses that I need to focus on. I took Chinese classes back in high school, so the class shouldn't be hard, but I feel like my schedule is already pretty packed already with my current classes, ACE, and clubs. 

And even if I decide to enroll, wouldn't I also have to catch up on 2 weeks of assignments? It just doesn't seem very intuitive for me, but the professor has already given me the permission code for her class and kinda expects me to attend. 

I have a buddy who's actually willing to help me out with the office hours if I decide to do it, but honestly at first I thought it would be only office hours, but she then just kinda roped me into it and now it's more than it seems.

"I'm a legal recruiter searching for recent grads in Poli Sci, Legal Studies, Criminal Justice, Sociology, History","I work at a large staffing firm and I recruit people to work at Fortune 500 companies as well as small-to-medium sized law firms in the San Francisco Bay Area. Right now I am staffing in-person and remote positions ranging from $17-20/hr.

Despite COVID-19, there's recently been an increased demand for legal support, which means it's finally a good time for recent grads to apply and get into entry-level positions. This is great news for those of you who are pre-law or wanting to gain experience in the legal field.

I just got a friend from high school hired at a global firm in the Financial District in less than a day. He is super thankful because he was unemployed throughout the quarantine. I'd like to help other recent grads out...since I was Class of 2019 and I can't imagine how things must be for Class of 2020 right now. 

Please DM me here and I'll send you my email for you to send over your resume. Serious candidates only. It's legit. I am just trying to think outside the box and find recent grads. A lot of them aren't actively browsing LinkedIn.

NOTE: I am a recent UC graduate. I prefer to source from the UC network. I also only staff contract positions. Perfect for those wanting to peek into the legal field.",1602714980,1,0

Cornucopia is my favorite holiday,"I can picture it now. 
-There are big corporations handing out college students free stuff.
-The frats are walking up to you asking to sign up and you do (knowing fully that you will not show up but you are too scared to say no).
-The freshman are religiously staring at every booth signing up for many clubs as possible as if it will determine their future.
-You get to sneak into the food line to eat free grilled chicken and tofu. 
-You sit on the grass with ur bros and enjoy the vibes of the ocean view and performances happening
-You sweat a lot because it will probably be 100 degrees that day.

All I‚Äôm saying is that there better be an in person cornucopia next year if there is no covid &lt;3",1602651539,1,0
The GET App for the dining hall has had nothing but problems since it started.,"I understand that new things take time to adjust to, I worked at a restaurant that added online orders and it was a shit show the first month. 

But I don‚Äôt understand why we can‚Äôt go in, pick out what we want, and have them serve us in to-go boxes like they did during Spring Quarter. I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs any more risky than having us all stand around in the same area at the front of the dining hall waiting for our number to be called. If anything, we‚Äôd be more spread out and be in and out faster if we just did it the old way. 

If you were here during Spring Quarter, do you prefer waking in and getting served in a to-go box, or do you prefer the app?",1602650653,1,0
Transferring from CC for CS,"Hello, forgive me if this has been asked numerous of times, I have searched all over this sub and others and still need clarification on transferring. 

I‚Äôm currently attending a community college and I‚Äôm panicking a bit on if I meet the requirements for transferring. My overall UC transferable gpa is around a 3.3~3.4 however my gpa for the foundation courses needed to transfer is around a 2.8. I got a C in calc(ugh :( I know... I wish I withdrew and retook it) and the rest of my foundation courses are B‚Äôs. I am enrolled in data structures and calc 2, and I‚Äôm hoping for A‚Äôs but realistically I think they will be B‚Äôs. I can‚Äôt seem to get A‚Äôs in any of my foundation courses. I‚Äôm worried that by the time I have to submit apps next year, I‚Äôll have a gpa for foundation courses that is less than 3.0. 

Basically to sum it up, how strict is that 3.0 gpa minimum?(as I have seen many other people on reddit say they were accepted with ~2.8 gpa for foundation courses) What are my chances in getting in? What would be your backup plan personally with that 2.8 gpa?",1602650532,1,0

"I'm so confused, about the computer/engineering career fair tomorrow. Please help!","Companies have been popping up and disappearing from the available sessions since they opened which I thought was just them disappearing when they were full but now HP disappeared and my appointment with them is gone. I was really stoked to have gotten a spot when it all closed up pretty much right after, but now it's gone? HP is still listed on the attending companies. Did I just get kicked? Anyone else experiencing this?

Also what's the protocol for multiple sessions with one company? Like, is it a dick move to take a one on one session and join a group session for the same company? Are we not supposed to do that? I'm just confused and kind of terrified for tomorrow.",1602640530,1,0

Opportunity to get involved with sustainability at UCSC,"Hey y'all!

If you are a UCSC undergrad who is interested in environmentalism or sustainability, I highly recommend joining the Campus Sustainability Council. CSC is a funding body that distributes grant money to student-run sustainability organizations at UCSC. Members attend weekly meetings, review grant proposals, and connect with other environmental organizations. I've been on the council for about a year, and it's been a really amazing opportunity to develop professional skills while getting involved in environmentalism.

If you want to join, we're hosting a virtual orientation from 1:00-2:00pm tomorrow (Wednesday October 14th). To get the zoom link, email [csc@ucsc.edu](mailto:csc@ucsc.edu)

On Campus Living,"What type of dystopian shit is this? Sorry for my language, but the entire situation that UCSC has created for on campus living is a complete nightmare. 

Creating a bubble of non-covid students was the intention, but after the two week quarantine? Then what. You still going to enforce social distancing when students can go... anywhere? From San Francisco to LA you can go and come back and they can‚Äôt stop you. Either that, or you interact with people in the Santa Cruz ‚Äúlocale‚Äù. What is the point if you‚Äôre not going to allow any social interactions besides talking over Zoom or receiving your daily rations from the dining hall? What is the point if you do tests and quarantines but then break it indefinitely?

Students who have just started living in college and have not met people besides zoom are really struggling because of the morale implications they are put in. Imagine trying to make friends with faceless neighbors(who all test negative from covid tests), not being able to interact with them besides 6ft away and your only similar background is living in such a shitty situation(people get written up for throwing frisbees 10 meters away) 

On the flip side, imagine you are immunocompromised. You isolate like your peers but once the two weeks are done... you‚Äôre fucking toast. All that time wasted in doors was useless. Everyone can go to Santa Cruz as they please, risking your own health and they could end up giving you covid through the bathroom, air vents, outside, going to dining hall, etc. Those tests? They take 24hrs to get back. 24hrs spreading the damn thing. 

Restaurants are open, people are surfing, hotels are open, but this campus has yet to make any sort of progress or any statement of what it‚Äôs attempting. Either make a complete bubble where all students are covid free, only allowed on campus with no visitors, and free interaction or have absolutely no restrictions at all. Because who in the right mind imprisons students for two weeks for absolutely nothing. ‚ÄúAll it takes is one‚Äù. And it ain‚Äôt coming from on campus cuz everyone has been quarantined AND tested for two straight weeks.

For some context I am living off campus and I have friends living on campus. Fix your fucking system, I am deathly worried about my friends declining mental health, the social isolation they are enforced in, the covid risks from shitty rules, and the lack of any communication from the administration.",1602575414,1,0

I love helping people but I just feel like science is not for me (I didn't even do great in my AP Bio class in HS and struggled so much and my parents just said i better become good at it if i wanna go into the field..) yet I don't even know what I would tell my strict parents especially since I don't even know what I want to do and I just feel like its so late and a failure. Like I thought maybe just becoming a pro-baker would be good cause that's how I've been making money during quarantine cause I'm a self taught baker and cake decorator but the salaries are just way too low and I just feel like its not something that would sustain me if I had a family in the future so I'm just stuck :/ I would really love to hear from people who've had the same experiences as me and what I should do cause It's not easy talking to my parents about stuff like this cause they just get mad easily.,1602033294,1,0

I miss the redwoods,"The best five years of my life were spent in a remote rainforest valley with solar panels for electricity and fresh spring water. No bills, apart from sometimes needing groceries, and 1000 acres of rainforest to get high and explore. I found a greenstone boulder precariously balanced on a cliff that was the size of a truck, and (with much effort) rolled it down the hill where it lies to this day half sunk in the swamp. I was forced to move because the neighbours were a corrupt cop and a cowboy with an underground weed bunker, they wanted my land for the insane amount of greenstone/jade that was buried in the river flat. The highest estimates were up to 400 million dollars worth of greenstone underground. I didn‚Äôt want to mine it out of respect for the natives, who I let walk along the river to look for greenstone.",1602015646,1,0

A couple of notes when using OneNote,"This past summer I got myself a drawing tablet did my homework using OneNote. I had a bunch of issues with the program, but was able to figure out a couple of workarounds that might save people from a couple of hours of headache and frustration.

**Exporting notes for submission**   
For whatever reason there isn't an option to simply export notes to PDF in the Windows 10 edition of OneNote. That being said if you open the office suite version of OneNote (AKA OneNote 365) you can export as PDF. The 365 version does a good job of keeping ""ink"" clear, but images might be lower quality and has some weird interaction with highlighter, the Win 10 version for the most part keeps both the quality of the ""ink"" and pictures (but only if you don't use highlighter in which case everything looks fuzzy for the pages that contain highlighter???). From my experience notes from ether version are cross-compatible, so try each method out and see what works best.

**Limit the length of your notes**
If you have a lot of ""ink"" on your notes, i.e. paragraphs/long notes, OneNote will start to really slow down in responsiveness in stuff like scrolling and inserting/removing space. In addition when you ""Print"" or export the document images in the document will be reduced in quality. I ended up just creating a section for each homework and using a sperate page for each problem. You can then just generate a PDF for each section and combine the PDFs together to submit.

**If you're planning on exporting avoid using the highlighters**
If you use the highlighters there are a couple of things to be aware of. If you have a document with highlighter and ""print"" with the Windows 10 version of OneNote, the outputted document will be fuzzy. OneNote 365 export actually generates a decent PDF in this situation, but as before the images come out blurry, and I've seen inconsistencies between what you seen in OneNote and what the PDF looks like. [Here's an example.](https://i.imgur.com/wXvcxNB.png) [Another.](https://i.imgur.com/f4j1RtM.png)

trying to figure out if ucsc is the right school for me + my major (cognitive science),"hi!

i'm a current hs senior applying to ucsc. from what i've read/looked into so far, i feel like ucsc might be a good fit for me + my major (cognitive science- hci track) but i kind of wanted to get student perspectives as well. i have a few questions so if anyone could answer ANY of them (doesn't have to be all), it would be super helpful.

**1.** **if you're a cognitive science major, how do you like the major? if you're going down the hci track specifically, how do you like that?** (i'm kind of thinking that this would be a good fit major + track for me bcs i really love psych and i also want to learn a little bit of tech bcs i'm hoping to go into user experience and user interface design in the future)  
**2. in general, how do you guys like ucsc? is the community welcoming/warm?** i'm looking for an academically focused but also decent social life/college experience school. 

**3.** i kind of had a bad year in 10th grade and my gpa has never fully recovered from it (i'll be applying with a 3.22). my grades do show an upward trend since then though and i'll also b showing that i'm taking two classes at my local community college. with that and decent essays, **would you say that i have a chance at getting in?**

i'm sorry if this was a lot!! i've been really stressed about my applications bcs cogsci isn't offered at as many uni's and my options have become even more limited due to my gpa.

Taking 12 classes in 3 quarters,"Hey, I want to graduate before Fall 2021, but this requires taking 12 classes and a few seminars.

TIM vs CS,"Hello all!

Hope everybody is having/has had a ""good"" midterm week. So, I'm a CS major that just transfered in. However, this quarter has been rough to say the least and it's just been really clear that I'm not motivated or interested in pursuing coding anymore. I don't want to do any type of software engineering as my career. So I'm just realizing it's kinda pointless me taking these classes at this point. 

Therefore I'm at a point now where I'm considering switching my major to TIM. A major of which is wayyy more up my alley with my strengths and interests in whole area of the intersection between tech and business.  

Of course, there's a couple of reservations:
1) I'm worried TIM isn't viewed as competitively as CS so I might have a difficult time finding as decent of a job (I know getting a job depends on a lot more than just getting a degree)
2) I kinda feel like a failure. I'm walking away from something because in part it is too challenging, usually I can use my motivation to overcome challenges but I just don't have it with these CS classes right now 
3) I have to take diff EQ for TIM and haven't taken calc in a  couple of years  
4) I would have to stay another quarter if I wanted to pursue a CS minor

If anybody out there has made the switch themselves I would be really curious to hear why. Of course, any general advice on the matter would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks everybody (:",1605001434,1,0

 Dear Rachel,  Thank you for your interest in UC Santa Cruz. You have successfully submitted your online TAG application to UCSC for fall 2021 transfer admission. We now look forward to receiving your University of California transfer application during the November 1-30 application period. Apply at [http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/apply-online/](http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/apply-online/). When applying for admission, please remember that your transfer admission guarantee is only applicable for the major you indicated on your TAG application.   UC Santa Cruz does not provide an admission evaluation or early admit decision as part of its TAG program. When you apply to UCSC for admission, we will review your TAG and notify you of your TAG and admission status beginning mid-March through the end of April.

If for any reason you are unable to meet the conditions of the TAG, an offer of admission will depend on your completion of transfer admission requirements and selectivity in the applicant pool.

"I don't understand the appeal of living on campus, especially now....","The two most common arguments:

* 1.) It's college and it's a unique experience; try it. 
   * COVID punches a hole through this. Currently, residences are being strictly monitored and excessive guest are prohibited. Your freedom to socialize is minimal. 
* 2.) I don't want my financial aid to be reduced. 
   * This one I absolutely do not get... You're easily overpaying $800 + a month for rent. Want to park your park? You're gonna need another $600. You'll have to eat but no kitchen, that'll be more $$$.

Why isn't the dining hall menu changing?,"I asked around and here is what I found out...

But first, a request that everyone living on campus fills out the Dining Satisfaction Survey! Check your UCSC email - you should have gotten a special link on Weds 11/4. There's an open-ended comment area and that's a great place to ask for more variety and **be very specific** about the exact foods you wish Dining would serve.

okay, onward to the findings.....

\#1 simple changes are not so simple

Dining has to be very strategic in menu planning, because they need to address the Top 8 Allergens, as well as other dietary restrictions like vegan/vegetarian. So they have to plan a menu that will meet the needs of a wide variety of guests so each gets a meal that meets their dietary requirements. So an updated menu isn't just a matter of swapping out one option for another, unfortunately. Additions or changes have to be looked at holistically because of how the change will affect the nutritional make-up of the menu as a whole.

\#2 social distancing

In addition, they have to plan a menu that they can execute using the equipment at available work stations. In normal times, this requires a decent amount of planning, but in covid times this piece is *especially* challenging, since each station is designed to function independently (so that staff are social distancing and not moving from station to station). So menu items that require multiple pieces of equipment from various stations are no longer an option (reducing variety).

\#3 reliable supply of ingredients

\- Dining also wants to plan a menu that contains ingredients they know they can source without supply chain interruption (remember the toilet paper shortage - it's a similar idea - they have to choose ingredients they feel confident will remain available by suppliers).

\#4 getting your meal made faster

Then there's the important goal of getting your meal delivered quickly and on-time. In ""the before times"", they didn't have to limit the number of staff in a location, but now with social distancing they have to work with fewer staff members. And now they are cooking small batches made-to-order, so your meal is fresh and customized just for you (and to limit food waste). As the Dining staff is becoming proficient with the current recipes, they are able to produce them faster so you're more likely to be able to place your meal order for your preferred time. (Interesting statistic: During the popular meal times, Dining is producing a completed meal ready for pick-up at the rate of one every minute.)

**Thanks for coming to my TED talk :)** 

I hope this info helps.

Lastly, the Director asked me to let everyone know that Dining is continuing to work on new ideas to make the best dining experience possible, given the many operational challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has forced upon us all. 

If everyone on campus can fill out the Dining Satisfaction Survey that will be really helpful!",1604701188,1,0

UCSC's Recreational Scuba Instructors Have Been Laid Off,"UCSC has laid off the head of the Recreational Scuba Department, Cecil Shin.

This program was available under the Recreational Department for all students who could pass a swim test. Unlike most private courses that cost at minimum $500, this course had no fee, only requiring students purchase ~$150 of personal equipment.

Under this program students like myself received training needed to be able to take the Scientific Diving Class and conduct field research in Ocean Sciences.

The UCSC scuba program was a recreational programs that was in the black and fiscally sound. 

To read a message from Cecil and sign a petition for the University to reverse its decision click [here](https://www.change.org/p/university-of-california-santa-cruz-save-the-ucsc-scuba-program-b9067703-ba18-49ef-9413-4175c1bc77f6?redirect=false).

UCSC alum here with a productivity tool that's helping me focus,"It's called Focusmate. I have ADHD and I just started using it a month ago. I wish I had found it during my BA because it would have made such a huge difference. You are basically paired with an accountability partner on video chat and you share what you're working on at the start of a 50 minute session and then at the end discuss how you did. You typically mute your mic during this process but can text chat updates on the work you're doing if you want to. 

They have a group for UCSC students so they will then attempt to pair you with someone else from UCSC or who graduated from there. This only works if you sign up with your UCSC email though I think. I'd love to have more partners that also are from UCSC! I'm in another degree program now so I have been using it to get my work done. I think it's also great for people who have been kind of lonely doing the distance learning thing. 

Anyways I promise I'm not affiliated with Focusmate I just love the service and want to share it. I am a 2019 Rachel Carson grad in environmental studies. It's free if you just do 3 sessions a week but for unlimited it's $5 a month so it's also not a huge investment or anything.",1607276678,1,0

Can I drop a class this late? Please help me ):,"Let me explain . I already changed my Japanese 1 class to P/NP because I knew I was going to fail a few days ago. This is a class that isn't part of my major (although I wanted it to be) but I bombed my first exam because I didn't have the proper settings on my computer to translate English letters to Japanese characters. 

This means that when I type A, it doesn't automatically change to „ÅÇ. I had a completely different setting on my computer that made the 1 key the „ÅÇ key so on and so forth. So you can see where that gets confusing as someone who has never taken an online class and who has never learned another language like this, right?

When I tried to explain it to my professor she just shrugged her shoulders and moved on \[makes sense it's not her problem\]. But I don't necessarily feel like it's a very fair deal since somehow everyone in my class (who took this class for fun, to understand anime, etc) already knew how to do this? This is my first online class, and I was doing well until I bombed this test and there's no way I'm able to climb back up since I'm feeling so dejected. 

Not only that, but having to come back down to my hometown and having to stay weeks longer in an unstable internet/working environment because my roommate at santa cruz might've had covid? \[he doesn't thank christ\]. Not only that‚Äì but the final is an oral presentation which is anxiety inducing in itself.

I'm just wondering if I'm able to talk to someone about this. I already know I'm not gonna pass because of something that was out of my control, am I able to e-mail someone and ask if I can just get this entire class to disappear from my life and my record since I was screwed over from the first exam? (which I got the lowest score on because of my settings). And if not, does anyone think I should just disappear from the class? I know I'm not going to pass‚Äì I already know this. Is it worth the stress to just keep going? The only reason I didn't drop sooner was because I thought I'd be able to pull through for the second exam, but you wouldn't believe how fast paced it is \[it's like I should've known Japanese before I took the class).",1606932012,1,0

Campus Fees,"This may be a bit of an over asked question, or something that should not be talked about and if so then I completely understand and will remove the post, but I really am curious about the subject. I understand tuition prices and I have accepted that portion of it, but I really do not understand the campus fees portion of it. In this current state that we are in where most students are not going to campus for the rest of this year, why should we still have to pay almost $500 for campus fees that we will not even be utilizing? For example, a transportation fee of $136 per quarter is ridiculous to me for something that most of us are not using at all. I may be uninformed on the subject and if so I apologize in advance, but have they said anything about reducing or reimbursing any campus fees for the quarters they are closed?

How do I get the survey prompt to go away on canvas without doing SETs?,"TL;DR: SETs are terrible for students and we should go back to using public reviews or make SET reviews public.

&amp;#x200B;

If there is already a better way to review professors and TA's I'm all for it, let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why: About 4 years ago UCSC was promoting rate my professor which is an online service that helps students write public reviews about professors. The problem they ran into was that either 

A) bad professors would cause people to steer away from them or  

B) there wasn't enough of a distribution of reviews ie: too few reviews(they claimed that there were too many disgruntled students reviewing)

Now, we have no way to determine who is going to provide us with our money's worth. You end up with professors in physics like Dhal or professors like him who skirt by the rules just enough but have no way to be reviewed or gauged by students. We should have every right to be able to determine WHO is going to be worth our time, and our money.

&amp;#x200B;

Ratemyprofessor should be promoted again but this time with more involvement by the students. SETs do nothing, perhaps help the TA's land a job in the future but that's about it.",1606883320,1,0

If you've taken either PHIL 11 or PHIL 27 pls help,"Hey all, trying to plan things out for my academic plan. I don't really want to get into it because it's not really relevant, but I basically need a philosophy lower-div class offered in Spring. According to the philosophy departments published plan (subject to change) the 2 lower-div classes offered in Spring are PHIL 11 - Introduction to Philosophy taught by M. Imaz-Sheinbaum and PHIL 27 - Business Ethics taught by K. Robertson.

I'm just a really indecisive person and wanted to probe the subreddit for people who may have taken one or both of these classes and their opinions on them or the professors. 

These will be my first philosophy classes outside of STEV core. This might be controversial on this sub, but I'm more of a moderate, maybe center-right politically and my experiences taking classes at UCSC is that classes can kinda be hit or miss for whether they're full of political bias or not. Of course everyone has political bias, professors included, but I've experienced some professors who let that influence their teaching maybe a little too much. I enjoy taking interesting classes that can challenge my beliefs, but there's a difference between challenging a belief and forcing a belief onto someone. Do you think that one of these classes/profs would be more prone to heavy political bias more than the other? Let me know what you guys think. Thanks!",1608253156,1,0

I have been swamped this quarter with project after project. Are there upper division courses that are mostly tests or are less work/easy-ish/enjoyable, or professors you liked.

Looking for Friendos,"Heyo guys,

I'm a new transfer student to UCSC, my first quarter will be this coming winter 2021 quarter. I'm an Econ major (Plan to take the accounting focus). This is my first Reddit post ever, even though I've been on Reddit for ""I can't even remember anymore"" now. I'm looking to make some friends/""acquaintances"" to get some semblance of a college social experience. I'm not living on-campus most likely until on-campus classes begin most likely. I guess I'll just start this (heh, as if the post wasn't long enough already) with some stuff about myself.

I'm 24 years old, male, and like to play video games, read novels, and love to cook/learn about cooking even though it's been a while since I cooked myself. I think cat pic's are dope but I'm more of a dog person in the end. Also, I'm kind of an introvert, as can be made known by the fact that this post has been 4 days in the making, don't ask me why, I don't know either man. 

If anyone here is in a similar major, or are taking the same classes, hit me up! I'm taking AM 11B with Katznelson, COWL 52 with Kelly, and PHIL 22 with Robertson. 

P.S: If there are any discord groups for those classes and/or the major can anyone let me know? I'm kind of trying to put myself out there more to not be as introverted.

Question on workload for upper division math,"Hi so I need some advice.

Currently I‚Äôm signed up for Math 105a, and 134. I‚Äôm trying to declare into computational math so I need to finish up the differential equations requirement. I see that Math 106 is only taught during winter and summer. 

I hear math 105a can be difficult and I don‚Äôt know anything about there difficulty if 134 so I hope maybe someone can chime in. I was originally hoping to use this summer to knock out some GE‚Äôs at CC, so I‚Äôd like to avoid taking classes at UCSC, but that would mean taking math 106, alongside 105a and 134. Is that manageable or am I signing up to do bad?

This past quarter I managed to take math 111a, 110, and 23B, but found it pretty difficult to manage them all. Admittedly I wasn‚Äôt so on it with keeping up with lectures, but still managed to do decent to good on the classes. 

I‚Äôve slowly been improving with how I manage everything now that it‚Äôs online, but I hear 105a is up there in difficulty with 111a and 106 being really hard. 

Anyone ever take 105a and 106 alongside each other? Or can speak on 134? Any advice would be appreciated thanks.",1609331461,1,0

Just a little rant about people in CS,"I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science when I was 19 years old.

I got my degree when I was 19, I had a full time job immediately after, and am going to get my Master's at the age of 20. It requires incredible hard work sure, but it also requires incredible ingenuity which the vast majority of people at UCSC just do not have. I have seen CS students here talking about ""leetcode"" and landing a job interview at some mediocre company, as if that is some accomplishment.

It's not. I did all those things easily. I set the curves for classes I was in despite being younger than everyone.

75% of 18-24 year olds are depressed and anxious in america today: you are not alone!,"\*talks about mental health, suicide, depression, etc.

\*National suicide prevention lifeline:¬†1-800-273-8255

[https://youtu.be/PohWI97qP0Y](https://youtu.be/PohWI97qP0Y)

I started a new project titled ‚Äújust your existence is enough‚Äù (link above). Having battled a nasty case of depression my whole life and purposefully overdosing in march due to psych meds making me crazy lol, i figured its time we stop being afraid and speak up. As an engineer, I took an oath to ‚Äú practice integrity and fair dealing, tolerance and respect, and to uphold devotion to the standards and the dignity of my profession, conscious always that my skill carries with it the obligation to serve humanity by making the best use of Earth's precious wealth‚Äù and I intend on living up to it. I figure the best way to give back to my community is by sharing topics I learned in engineering school in a fun and educational way and to show others how engineering principles not only apply to the physical world but to our inner world and wellbeing as well. I would greatly appreciate if you can listen to this podcast thingy and let me know your thoughts, opinions, ideas. if you disagree with anything that I say, that is okay! do not be negative or leave a hate comment. Instead explain to me why you do not agree so I can better understand you. Remember we all perceive reality a bit differently, so while you may not understand my personal struggles because you did not struggle with the same things, we all struggle in one way or another.

Resources: If you are unable to seek help from a professional or too nervous at this time, below are resources that should guide the healing process. Remember there is nothing wrong with going to therapy!¬†

Feeling Good by David Burns: [https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-N...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFeeling-Good-New-Mood-Therapy%2Fdp%2F0380810336&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=PohWI97qP0Y&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqblFMLXB2akpDN1dhckRSbFFLU0dQVkFJeW11QXxBQ3Jtc0ttcDRaTGU2ZEZfRUZwOUNTZ01FMndGVW5RVkg4LXlyMVQ5eHZTbl9YZWFMOHdoU3hvb1JIclNjaVdRYXh6U0RlTEFEVDRzUHJ2ZS11UXRDOEVQc0E0cXlmUURGc29YZkpDZEFHTDdRRzN6TnVSeGlZbw%3D%3D) Scientifically backed ways to out train the negative thinking, depression and anxiety. This book served me wonders in addition to therapy. What science shows is if you dedicate \~3 months to processing the pain and healing, a lot of the depression and anxiety can go away. The main point being you do it now rather than later so when tough events happen later in life, we know how to properly deal.¬†

The Holistic Psychologist: [https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHolistic...](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHolisticPsychologist/featured) she explains how events shape us, attachment theory, letting go of the past, etc in a productive and helpful manner¬†

Andrew Solomon Ted Talk: [https://youtu.be/-eBUcBfkVCo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eBUcBfkVCo) \- goes over his own battle with depression and the correlation between adverse experiences and mental health¬†

And lastly:¬†If you are currently struggling, just remember, you keeping yourself alive is winning because that is by far the hardest thing to do when you are in a dark place. Even if you struggle to get out of bed, shower, or eat,¬†you are still alive and that is all that matters. Please put your wellbeing first and learn how to make yourself a priority. During the rough times, someone very dear to me would remind me that ‚Äúthis too shall pass‚Äù and I pass that message along to you.¬†Feel free to share this or the resources with your family and loved ones! Start spreading it around!!! We can and will get better if we put our minds to it‚ù§Ô∏è",1608844293,1,0

Is your internet search history viewable to the IT services?,"Hi,

So I‚Äôm currently living on campus and when I moved in I got a router. 

My thinking was that this would give me more privacy and give me better speeds. While it‚Äôs definitely given me good speeds, I recently had an a weird encounter which makes me think I don‚Äôt have the privacy I wanted. 

I clicked on a link to a website that I‚Äôve used before, just not on campus, and when I did the IT department intercepted it. It automatically redirected me to a page saying how the link I clicked could be dangerous. 

This what confuses me, if I had the privacy I thought I had, how were they able to know I clicked on a ‚Äúsuspicious link‚Äù?

If they knew I went to that site, does that mean they know all the sites I go to?

How come they‚Äôre able to see what I do, if I‚Äôm using my own router?

I'm paying 15k for college, and I want to make sure its not a one time lecture I have we're in 2020 and recording stuff isn't that hard. I understand its nice to just write on the board but just write the same thing on paper and post it on the recordings page. I had a physics prof that said classes were recorded but all I got was his voice because he wrote on the black board. **I know there are some Profs on this Sub what is their opinion as to why something like this isn't common.**

Even if I am still a proposed psych major by the deadline, can I still declare Cog Sci if I have completed all of the necessary classes?",1603559145,1,0

"Transferring to UCSC as premed, questions.","Hi! 

I'm currently a sophomore at another school (ranked \~40 - 50 by Forbes, USNews, WSJ etc., think CWRU, UW-Seattle, UIUC, UT Austin, BU etc.). 

In general, I'm struggling with classes, and feel as though I need a change of environment in order to succeed. I was wondering a few things:

1. Does UCSC have grade deflation? My  school has rampant deflation and makes it nearly impossible to maintain high grades due to brutal curving. Does UCSC have similar issues with deflation? 
2. How are premed opportunities at UCSC? The research and clinical opportunities I've had here have been crazy, and I'd hope to replicate that environment without the insane levels of stress after transferring.
3. Would you recommend UCSC for someone like me? Pre-med, struggling to handle science weeders in a competitive environment. 
4. Is it more competitive of collaborative?
5. How hard is switching majors? Outside of CS, are there any other strong majors at UCSC that are of note? Thanks!

stressed about laptop issues,"my laptop conveniently decided to break 10 days ago since the display is ruined/screen cracked, but i'm not sure how since i just found my laptop like that after i took a break away from it. i let all of my professors know about my laptop issue immediately after i noticed, especially since i do not have access to another laptop or computer, and i've gotten mixed responses (one of them gave me extensions on assignments, three of them just told me to let them know if i have trouble accessing the class on my phone but i'll still have to complete the work, one hasn't responded at all). i contacted slug support about my issue that day as well, but i only got to speak to a case manager today and they said there would most likely be nothing they can do since they are not trying to lend out short-term loaner laptops and i do not qualify for a laptop grant/loan. i requested a repair with apple for my laptop the day it broke, but i've been putting off sending it in until i got a loaner laptop to work with for the time being and i expected slug support to be a little more helpful than they were. i've been working on five classes on my phone (one lower div bio, one upper div bio, three upper div bio labs) and hooking up my laptop to my roommate's monitor when they're not using it for their own classes or schoolwork. this is a really temporary set-up and i already feel bad enough as it is for using their monitor when they'd prefer to use it, and it wouldn't work when i do end up sending in my laptop for repairs.

this is a long shot, but does anyone know of any other resources i could look to for a loaner laptop? i literally only need it during the time my laptop is being repaired (which may take 1-2 weeks with shipping according to the apple rep i spoke to a week ago) and it's been stressing me out that i had put off repairing it in the hopes slug support would be able to help because my laptop could have been repaired by now. it's getting later into the quarter when things are getting busy, so i was just hoping this problem could have been solved sooner rather than later :^(",1603485234,1,0
WRIT 2 or Writing 1 for winter?,"Just got an email about this. Should I take WRIT 2 or Writing 1? Apparently I satisfied ELWR, but I didn‚Äôt take any honors or AP classes for writing/lit in high school so I feel like WRIT 2 might be challenging. Any advice?",1603482458,1,0
Writing 1 or Writing 2 for Winter Quarter of Freshman Year?,"I took the AP English Language and Composition test in my junior year of High School and passed with a 3. This essentially allows me to skip Writing 1 and go straight into Writing 2, but I am a little skeptical about my decision because on one hand I would like to jump straight into Writing 2 and skip Writing 1. However I am also nervous that the work load would be very difficult as I do not have the basis of Writing 1 under my belt. Can some people who took skipped Writing 1 and took Writing 2 let me know how it was for them. I would like to hear your opinion of what the class was like, along with the people who took Writing 1 and then took Writing 2.

TL;DR Writing 1 before Writing 2 or jump straight into Writing 2?",1603481632,1,0

I am currently living on campus but due to everything being online I don‚Äôt see much benefits of staying on campus and want to move off campus to save money.
The housing contract is pretty vague about cancellation.
So I wanted to ask if anyone has any experience with moving out in the academic year.
I want to move out asap but I am fine with doing it at the end of quarter.

Note: I am living in graduate student housing. So we don‚Äôt have to vacate for winter break.
