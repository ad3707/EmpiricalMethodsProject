"This advice can be dangerous. Skimming is super bad for comprehension -- you end up spending processing power trying to find the worthwhile content rather than using those cycles to understand concepts and memorize details.

The ""first and last"" technique leads to similar issues and depends on a writing style that introduces and summarizes at the beginning and the end. You might find some dry scientific shit written in that manner, but I guarantee you, no fiction writer follows that pattern.

Speed reading is bullshit, kids. Don't believe the hype.

The active reading that you suggest, however, is spot on. If you're not thinking about what you're reading, you're just wasting your time. Too many people spend too much time approaching reading as a mechanical process. Get zen with your reading materials -- when you live in the moment, you remember much, much more.

My main approach to reading, whether it's technical material or literature, is to practice a technique called ""close reading."" The first time I go through the book, and I don't worry about memorizing anything. I just read and let the material soak in. When I'm done, I leave the book alone for a day or two. By that time, the material has had time to percolate in my head, and I'll have lots of questions. Having been through the material before, I know the layout and the concepts, and then I go back and read specific sections to deepen my understanding -- that's the close reading.

I just have to emphasize the part where I leave the work alone for some time. Your mind (at least my mind) needs time to process information in order to fully internalize it. I develop software, for example, and I can't tell you how many times I've been struggled with a technical issue for hours, but then I give up and go to sleep. The next day, without additional active thought, I have the answer, and every now and again, I wake up during the night with the solution. Give yourself time to develop perspective and things become much easier.

For academic and technical works, there's no way to cut corners -- the main point with that type of material is comprehension, not speed, and if you have to sacrifice something (native English speaker or not), then you sacrifice speed (and your social life).",1568355256,1,0
"The waitlst for the discussion section might be what's keeping you out of the class. When the system tries to enroll you, it must have space in both the lecture and discussion. If the discussion is full, it'll skip you and go to the next person on the list.

There are many reasons why your waitlist number might jump around. None of them are very important.

The reserved seats might be released, but there's no guarantee.

I recommend switching discussion sections. Unfortunately, the only way you can do that is to drop the class. You will lose your place on the waitlist. Then try to add the class again, but choose a discussion section that isn't waitisted. You will end up much lower on the wait list, but honestly probably have a better chance of getting it. Just make sure the discussion section has open seats. If none of them do, this won't really help.",1568354571,1,0

"&gt; If you select students who are at the top of their class (regardless of the school) who do enough things outside of school so you know they aren’t just grade-motivated robots, you will get a class of driven students who are all smart enough to hack it at almost any school.

You can also consider students with great but not spectacular grades who show significant drive and motivation outside of school.

This is based on my assertions that (a) colleges should only care about intelligence so they can decide whether or not a student could handle their classes, and (b) drive, passion, and ambition should be rewarded more than raw intelligence.

Obviously this would be subjective. So would any criteria. A raw number like the SAT has just as much subjectivity behind it as my criteria do. At least I'm being honest about that.

If you have a problem with this, then you need to argue that one (or more) of my assertions is wrong, or that my criteria doesn't produce outcomes that agree with my assertions.

"I'm around 30 myself, finishing up here after Spring. I couldn't say how my experience compares with the typical one here; I never attended college before I was already well into my 20s. With that said:

I’ve certainly noticed an experience / maturity gap between myself and most of the younger students (which isn’t to claim I’m particularly amazing, but a decade+ more life experience does that). A lot of the younger students tend to be dealing with the problems arising from the transition from childhood into adulthood; conflict with their parents, figuring out who they are and what they want, exploring relationships and sexuality (I’ve noticed this particularly amongst the non-straight friends I’ve made here). It can be easy to be sort of… dismissive towards this stuff when you’ve gone through most of it yourself by now, but resist that urge. Their feelings are real and worthy of respect, even if they are over issues that will seem a bit “immature” to you. 

Related to that: I encourage you to cultivate the ability to make friends with younger people. True, they won’t have the life experience you do, but they can still be super interesting people and make great friends. And having a strong social support network at Cal is essential, even if you are older.

At the same time, there are a surprising number of older students at Cal. Most of the (upper-division) classes I take have at least a handful of people over 23. There are some programs / groups here aimed at the older crowd (Older Wiser Learners aka OWL is one with the re-entry program). I never really explored this side of things much, being honest, but it could be worth looking in to. Either way, you will have opportunities to meet people who were alive before 2000. 

Other thing to keep in mind: your maturity will be a massive asset here. The late teens and early 20’s can be a very complicated period of figuring out a lot of the basics of who you are, and how to get by in life; but people like us have already gone through much of that. The emotional maturity to handle stress and setbacks, the life skills, the confidence that comes with age… it’s all a huge advantage here.  

So on the whole: I think it’s certainly very different being older, but not necessarily worse.",1571460559,1,0

"hey! i’m also an aussie girl who goes to uni in sydney and i’m currently studying abroad for the fall semester here at cal! i’ve done my best to answer your questions below, but feel free to message me if you have anything else you want to ask! :)

1. you probably won’t be able to live at a sorority since you would need to go through the formal recruitment process to join and then be in the sorority for at least a semester before moving in to the house. however, if you’re interested in just joining a sorority for the experience i’d definitely recommend it - i rushed and ended up joining one of the sororities here, so it’s definitely possible for exchange students! as for where else to live, a lot of international students like i-house so that’s definitely an option. personally, i wanted more of a true ‘american college experience’ so i applied to live in the dorms, and i’m so glad i did! if you’re looking for true cultural immersion, living in the dorms amongst all the local students is definitely the way to go
2. i’ve found that it’s actually a lot easier to meet people and make friends than i expected, especially if you go through sorority recruitment - even if you don’t end up joining a sorority, you meet so many cool people during recruitment itself which is really fun! there are also so many clubs, sports etc. that you can get involved in on campus which are a great way to meet heaps of awesome people super quickly. if you’re intending to come on exchange for fall semester (i’m not sure if they do it for spring semester too), golden bear orientation is also a great way to meet heaps of people roughly the same age as you and living in the same building (if you’re living on campus)
3. the campus life here is definitely very full on, in the best way! i go to a pretty big uni in sydney with a very active social scene, and i was still blown away by how crazy it is at cal. there are so many events going on, clubs to get involved in and people to meet everywhere you go. everyone here is super friendly too, and the vibe is super chill!",1569389156,1,0

"Hello chancellor! 

As a junior transfer student, I chose Cal for the level of research opportunities and resources that it has, despite the competitive ""cut-throat"" reputation of the school. My question is in regards to teaching pedagogy. Do you believe that the grading system, among other mechanisms within the school, that make courses, majors, etc. competitive is the best method for producing bright young academics? 

These standards/actions foster competition, contribute to students feeling extreme levels of stress, and force students to constantly compare themselves to their peers. I have heard a lot of students at Cal talk about mental health struggles, such as anxiety and depression, and feel as though this ""culling of the herd"" approach is in direct conflict with what the university claims that it stands for. I understand that some level of competition is necessary for science, but real-world problem solving often benefits from collaboration, rather than competition. Wouldn't having classrooms, especially STEM classes, reflect this be beneficial for students, the school, and the world at large? 

Yes, I understand that law school, medical school, graduate school, and the job market are all very high stress and competitive. However, I personally feel this approach does students a disservice. How can a student know the material well enough to receive a 90%, but still receive a B? How is it acceptable to push students to sabotage their peers? Education in this country needs a revamp and why shouldn't Cal be a leader in that? We've led the way in many other regards. We want to boast of our achievements, flaunt our rankings, and declare ourselves a world-class university, yet we push students to their breaking point all while putting these young people into debt. For what purpose? To impress the companies that ""invest"" in the school? To serve them highly skilled, but distraught and jaded professionals? To put students into so much debt that they feel they have no feasible option but to work for corporate America (the same companies which finance the school)? For a school which wants so badly to be progressive and 'different', we do a fantastic job reinforcing the corporatocracy that is America, thinly veiled by the display of a gloriously diverse student body and environmentally conscious propaganda.",1569388321,1,0

"So one of your former Haas Professors, Jose Plehn Dujowich, swindled over 300 students out of more than half a million dollars during his time at UC Berkeley. He did so by creating the Global Financial Data Project brandishing the UC Berkeley and UCLA logo and affiliating it with the school. The project was posted on both UCLA and UC Berkeley business school websites. Essentially, to participate in the program researchers would pay the research data partner, Bizqualify, \~$2500 to be a participant. (What he did not disclose was that he was Bizqualify's CEO). He then asked students to analyze his data for the benefit of the company. Although the concerns of many students were brought up, it felt like UC Berkeley brushed this under the rug. What safeguards are there in place to prevent something like this from happening again? Despite the 2 years since this has happened, how has UC Berkeley provided indemnity for the victims and rectified this situation? Many students were cheated out of their labor, funds, and opportunity cost and many of the international victims have not found recompense.",1569387957,1,0

"Alright, I'm going to dissect this line by line.

&gt; Your description outlines the entire problem with this farce:

First, you call this a farce. That'd imply there is some sort of satire or comedic situation in it. I fail to see it, but please, tell me about how funny these protests are.

&gt; It's cheap; costs nothing in terms of personal effort, risk, or time; takes only a moment to obtain; and requires zero effort or management.

Now I hope you realize that these are college students we're talking about. We don't have the money for more extravagant acts, and many of us don't have the time to formally protest. Especially during the middle of midterm season. This type of protest has worked in the past, I fail to see your point.

&gt; Basically your ""statement"" of solidarity sums up to what is basically a tweet or FB post. Might as well add a march to round out your level of outrage.

I strongly disagree with you here. There's a noticeable difference between a single post and a community coming together to do something. Sure, it doesn't directly fix the issue, but it calls attention and helps to force the hands of those who can fix it. And I explicitly said that there shouldn't be a march in my post. A march would detract from the protest, making it ordinary and thus easy to ignore. 

I think that in order for this protest to be most effective it should be totally ignored by those participating. Don't post anything, don't write speeches, don't fight those who disagree. Just go about your normal lives. It's the irregularity of the protest which would speak louder than any one person. 

Media, and the broader population of this country, would pay little attention to a conventional protest, especially one in Berkeley. I mean just look at the climate strike a couple of weeks ago. 

I digress, now back to your comment. 

&gt; And I'm sure you'll be rocking that mask and posting about it on social media. Not about the plight of the people of Hong Kong, but to get those fake internet points for yourself.

Well I think I just addressed this, but I also want to point out that I'm using an alt for this. I couldn't care less about the internet points and I couldn't care less about the fame. 

&gt; Hooray, thank you for your meaningless patronage.

Last thing, I just wanted to mention that any action is better than none. Victory is victory, however small, nor is its worth only from what follows from it. 

Say you're right (and you by no means are), say I'm the most vain person on the planet who only cares about my image and ""internet points"". So what? If that's what it takes me to get out and support people living 6,893 miles away who don't even speak my language, then is it not still a good thing?

This isn't about you. This isn't about me. Life will go on for us like nothing happened. But there are some things you can't sit by and watch.",1570432066,16,0

Does this mean that you could take all 4 in the Social Sciences category, i.e. you could use AP US History, AP World History, etc even though they more or less are in the same category?  It would be nice if the CNR websites would spell this out.

"Hey! As somebody who has no other choice but to budget heavily I can help with some tips. 

- look at your meal plan and how many meals a week you get. if you have the standard (12 a week) try to ration it how you think best. how i do it: no breakfast (I buy quick easy to make breakfasts at target- cereal, bread+ nutella, oatmeal), lunch and dinner everyday (14x) this means i have to eat out 2 dinners per week which i feel is a nice balance. If you’re really broke (like me) you can buy only one item one day for lunch that you know is too much for you to eat in one sitting, and just reheat the rest for dinner that same day. Now you only ate out once in the week and most likely spent $8. Also, try not to buy drinks too much, water is always good for you! 

- Try to realistically look at how much you spend on weekly trips. for instance, if you decide to buy snacks and breakfast stuff once a week, give yourself a limit that way you aren’t just buying a whole lot and not consuming. I’d say $7-$10 is good for this. 

- Also, it’s okay to say no to friends who invite you out. Not everybody has the same financial situation, so if you feel like you’ve already spent too much in one week maybe offer up something else to do that doesn’t involve a lot of money.",1573581379,1,0

"&gt;To lie and manipulate someone into giving you financial support under false pretenses is kinda wrong in any circumstances, even if those people/parents are dicks. Sure, you could argue that parents that will only support you financially if you follow the life plan they want for you is wrong too, but I don’t think lying and manipulating someone to get them to pay for you is ok either, even if under the circumstances it seems more justifiable.   

So this is the part where I disagree with you. I absolutely agree that the parents have a right to withhold money and are especially not obligated to provide for the kid after adulthood has been reached. However, think about these things in this specific circumstances:

- Do you think college was ever a choice for OP? If it was a choice, then yes I think exploiting someone in this scenario would be wrong. However, if they insisted that OP go to college and they still expect that goal to be reached, they know that OP can't just do it themselves. The idea of being able to save money from a high-school job and then attending University while also working to pay for all of it is near impossible today. 

- After financially commiting to someone as vulnerable as an 18 year old, saying that you will take care of their basic needs while they attain an education, it's more than ""dickish"" to pull the rug out from under them. What OP's parents did at a very crucial and pivotal time has the potential to cripple their lives for a while after. 


- Lying and manipulation aren't really things OP can do on this moment, I don't think. If the two parties we were discussing here were equal in status and financial power, then manipulation would be wrong. But OP is at a massive disadvantage versus the power of his parents. If they expect them to run home after college to fulfill some type of duty, would it be wrong to, after graduating, say ""thank you for the support through college, but you made my life hell and I do not want to come back""? Basically what I'm asking is, what is obliging OP to be kind and respectful to his parents after college, if they've done shit like this? 

I really don't think going to school under ""false pretense"" or ""manipulation"" is possible for OP in this situation. They have little tools at their service to combat the alter the game in their favor and their parents know that. It's more than wrong what OP's parents are doing, or dickish, I think it's cruel. 

Now, if OP is 18, then financial aid would take into account their parents income and probably massively reduce their financial aid. If OP could list themselves as an independent legally and provide their much lower income it would indicate a higher need for assistance. Then OP and the state and the school could work out a plan and the parents wouldn't even need to be involved or spend any of their own money. They have essentially trapped OP through their own manipulation, and forcing them into a poverty-like existence. 


I just think you're being too absolute. Yes, manipulation is wrong. Yes, lying is wrong. But they are not always, at every instance, wrong. 

If you're in a game already stacked against you, is it wrong to exploit the rules set up by the dominant party to survive?",1573525192,1,0

"Financial aid does not depend on whether or not you're a transfer. If you're not from California, you will get 0 financial aid (besides workstudy/loans, i.e. you'll still have to pay the full price). I wouldn't think it would be that hard to transfer classes, contrary to what others have said. But you should contact admissions or EECS department to actually know. The nice thing though is that there aren't many specific required courses beyond the lower division classes, so you just have to worry about transferring those (linear algebra, circuits, and our three intro CS classes, including data structures/algorithms)

Probably the highest ranked EE school that's not super hard to transfer to (as far as I know; maybe it is nontrivial for engineering?) is Purdue University. I'm from West Lafayette and have a parent who got his EE PhD from Purdue after a Stanford master's (not Berkeley, but close enough), and according to him the opportunities/strength of undergrad curriculum in EE should be comparable between GA Tech/Berkeley/Purdue/Stanford. So you might consider applying to Purdue too. They are all ranked in top 10ish, so will be approximately comparable on resumes. The nice thing about Purdue is that unlike here there are lots of people in EE and it's separate from CS. Here, basically everyone you will meet in your major (which is EECS, so combined with CS) will be interested only in CS.",1574625406,1,0

"Brother. When nobody cares about you, you gotta stand up for yourself.

I sympathize with you, I really do, but when the world around you stops following the rule of law, all rules of engagement are thrown out of the window.

Either you or someone in your group of friends should learn to deal with situations like this. Even if he was physically larger, one man cannot fight two or three. It is unlikely that he is trained, so stepping out of range and keeping him back with your legs is the best idea. Learn how to do a push kick, it's easy and keeps most assailants away. If they close in on your friends, kick them, attack their head, keep them on the defensive. These people are  not trained killers, if they just encounter a little bit of resistance, they will likely give up and start threatening you from a distance instead. At this point, stay alert and walk away.

Of course, don't initiate a fight. If you have the chance to walk away, do it. Only fight when you have no choice.

"Thanks for the detailed response.

My claim that Buttigieg’s black support is “next to none” is referring to the fact that he’s currently polling at 0% amongst black voters in South Carolina, this is a factually correct statement. If you really want to nitpick my implication that their lack of black support is why the campaign framed this announcement in such a way, fine. 

“They didn't ""fake black endorsements"" at all, and they ""doubled down"" because there was nothing wrong with the original announcement, which only sounds crazy if you only read the biased article and don't look at the original context.” 

\- fake might be a bit of a strong word in hindsight, but that doesn’t take away the fact that, at best, the endorsement list was misleading. 

Sure, the campaign doesn’t explicitly say that the signatories endorsed Pete, and they don’t say that all 400 of these signatories are black either. That’s not what I said either. But if you think that this isn’t what the campaign wants voters to think as a result of this announcement, then you’re either incredibly naive or being stubborn on purpose. The article by the Intercept also doesn’t falsely claim that the campaign says the signatories endorsed Pete for president like you said either, unless you can find the specific line saying so, in which case I stand corrected.

What the article does note is that right after the announcement, literally all three of the top listed supporters on the press release came out to express concern regarding the way the announcement was framed. This isn’t the Intercept making putting words in their mouths, they literally said it themselves. 

Tameika Devine: “Clearly from the number of calls I received about my endorsement, I think the way they put it out there wasn’t clear, that it was an endorsement of the plan, and that may have been intentionally vague. I’m political, I know how that works,” “I do think they probably put it out there thinking people wouldn’t read the fine print or wouldn’t look at the details or even contact the people and say, ‘Hey, you’re endorsing Mayor Pete?’”

Rep Ivory Thigpen: “I do think the way it was rolled out, it gave the impression, or the characterization, of them having broad support potentially, listing myself and others at the top of it,”  “But then when I know the conversations I had had, and how they used my conversation, for you to tell me there were other persons on there listed in one way, when that wasn’t really how they were, would not surprise me.” 

Johnnie Cordero: “I never endorsed that plan.”  “I wanna know who was involved in this plan such that you can claim that you speak for black America. The long and the short of it was they never sufficiently answered my questions, so I never actually endorsed the plan. They went ahead and used my name”

The email sent out by the campaign goes like this:

“Good afternoon, 

Thank you for your willingness to publicly support Mayor Pete …..

….

You will be included in the list of endorsements attached to the opinion piece. If you do not want your name included, please let us know by 4pm ET today.”

Who sends an email in the afternoon, and makes the opt out deadline (which is already some bullshit) 4pm on the same day  😂 ? They would have had less than 4 hours to see the email, and respond to it and opt out. This is a bit cheeky and inconsiderate at best, and in my opinion, much more likely to just be flat out disingenuous. 

If you can’t see, through the reactions of literally the 3 “signatories” listed at the top of the press release as well as the way the email was worded that the way they rolled out these ‘endorsements’ or whatever you want to call it was heavily problematic, then I don’t think you’re discussing this in good faith. 

You argue that this approach is commonplace, and has been done by Sanders and Warren amongst other cases. Sure, but find me a case where right after the announcement, the top signatories, or people quoted all come out and say that they didn’t approve of being listed. I’ll be happy to condemn those cases just as I condemn Buttigieg’s announcement, because its misleading. Other campaigns as far as I’m aware have not used this underhanded tactic.

You also keep saying how the Intercept is biased and often factually wrong. First I would ask you to tell me which sources you think are unbiased? Do you really think CNN, MSNBC, the Washington post or the New York Times don’t have a heavy establishment leaning bias?

This article may have upset you and you think it was a hit piece that framed the Buttigieg campaign in an unflattering light. That may be true, but I would say that what did it for me was not Ryan Grims writing, but rather the quotes of the ‘endorsers’ that never gave approval to be listed. While not perfect, the Intercept is rated ‘high’ on the factual reporting metric by mediabiasfactcheck, this is better than many establishment outlets such as CNN or MSNBC. [https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-intercept/](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-intercept/). You can choose to dislike the Intercept, thats ok, its not my favourite outlet either, not by a long shot. But by no reasonable standard is it an unreliable tabloid thats frequently factually incorrect.

I agree with you that this has little to do with Pete as a candidate. I just really don’t like him as a candidate and thought it was a funny response to this thread not expecting a full on debate in the comment section. Policy is most important, and if I agreed with Petes platform the most, this wouldn’t make me hesitate at all in supporting him (though I’d still think that its highly problematic). I think Pete’s policies are terrible, but thats another discussion entirely. 

None of my insults, if you could call them that, are baseless. This is the primary, where we choose the best candidate by being critical and scrutinizing all our options. Purity tests are not a bad thing, it merely means that you have certain standards that you aren’t willing to give up. Sorry that I care about certain issues and don’t want to support a candidate that doesn’t reflect my positions or beliefs.",1574591591,1,0

Berkeley no longer has an ABET accredited EE program, so if that's important to you, you should pass.

"Personally, I am not a big fan of how EE16A/B teaches linear algebra, but then again, I have taken linear algebra as a math class while I was in high school. However, I also think that the way that PCA and SVD are taught in 16A/B are not the most helpful things. I only had a vague understanding of these concepts before I took 127, but a solid linear algebra background, so the class was pretty easy. 127 does a good job of hammering into you the concepts of PCA and SVD much better than the 16 series, so I wouldn't take that as a sign of whether you will do well or not. If you have a pretty good intuition about linear algebra, vector spaces, and maps, you should be good. Heck, you could probably get through of the first part of the class by just thinking of every matrix as a map and using theorems and intuition from there.",1574568929,1,0

"I believe you are sincere in your beliefs here. I think your moral argument, if the facts supported you, is strong, and if the facts did support you then I would agree (with caveats, given that this is unrelated to him as a candidate or his policies). But it is just wrong. This is why biased sources hurt. It is forcing you to make a bad faith argument, not because you are acting in bad faith (you honestly seem like a genuine and caring person that stands up for what they believe in) but because your sources are.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why the bias matters is evident in the arguments you are making here. All the substantive points you are making, such as the campaign ""disingenuously faked black endorsements because they had next to none"" and that "" the Buttigieg campaign essentially admit to what they did and double down on it"", all come from the biased reporting, and not from the actual context. They didn't ""fake black endorsements"" at all, and they ""doubled down"" because there was nothing wrong with the original announcement, which only sounds crazy if you only read the biased article and don't look at the original context. This is such a bad faith argument.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's look at what actually happened, and you can go look at the actual release to see that:(""[http://hbcutimes.com/more-than-400-south-carolinians-endorse-mayor-pete-buttigiegs-douglass-plan-for-black-america/](http://hbcutimes.com/more-than-400-south-carolinians-endorse-mayor-pete-buttigiegs-douglass-plan-for-black-america/)"").

&amp;#x200B;

First, you, and The Intercept more directly, claim that the campaign faked black endorsements - when this is completely factually incorrect! There you go - the evidence you wanted. Read the announcement. They never once say that it is endorsed by 400 **black** South Carolinians. Not even a little bit. You claim this was done because ""they had next to none"", but that is obviously wrong when they didn't even do what you claimed they did, something you would have seen if you read the actual announcement and not a biased hit-piece. The only time the campaign says that the supporters are black (which again, they don't in the piece at all) is in an email that only the Intercept (the biased and often factually incorrect tabloid) has and quotes in their own article with no evidence. 

&amp;#x200B;

That kinda causes the whole race-based thing and the motive of wanting to show they had black supporters to fall apart.

&amp;#x200B;

There is also another key thing - no where at all does the campaign say that the signatories endorsed Pete for President. That is another false claim that the Intercept makes. This really is a problem of communication followed by people taking a biased source as fact.

&amp;#x200B;

Take a look at what the campaign put out around the plan. The Douglass Plan is nothing new. It is an aggregate of existing plans, in the same way as Medicare for All and Universal Basic Income are. What the campaign did is take individuals who had already fought for those policies and endorsed them in different contexts, and said that the plan was a good one because it was full of popular policies. Those people still endorse the policies, and the campaign was using that as an argument for enacting the plan, in the same way as every plan has evidence from experts and citations of popular support that don't imply that the signatories support all the rest of the plans a candidate has.

&amp;#x200B;

take for example Ranked Choice Voting. Groups like FairVote campaign for it near here. They often use press releases with quotes from various academics and political figures that support Ranked Choice Voting. That never implies that they support FairVote as an organization or the other policies they back. It is evidence, and every candidate does such (especially as support for a policy isn't related to whether you support every single candidate that proposes it).

&amp;#x200B;

This is done by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren with Medicare for All, where their plans cite experts, European politicians, academics, and political leaders (alive and historical) who support single payer health care. They are right to do that - it shows the plan has credentials. That isn't and shouldn't be interpreted as saying that all those people, who support one of their policies independent of the politician, wants the candidate to win office. Because they don't. Often Sanders and Warren cite the same people as endorsements for Medicare for All, because people realize that supporting a plan is not the same as supporting a candidate - which is exactly what is happening here.

&amp;#x200B;

Yang does it too with UBI. Look on his website - are all those pro-UBI quotes supposed to be endorsements for Yang? Are all the pro-singlepayer quotes on Sanders and Warrens' sites supposed to be endorsements for them? Are the quotes from supporters of investing in people of color in any way implied to be endorsements for Pete in all policies and for president?

&amp;#x200B;

This is such a factually-wrong bad faith argument, which really sucks. The core emotional argument, which I totally get as it is related to race - is just wrong! That is a factual error right there, as are the motives you are just making up. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that in mind, in the **worst possible scenario** here, Pete's campaign took people who independently actively endorsed the policies he was adopting and was not clear enough in communication to allow them to not endorse in the letter the policies they endorsed elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Now take their ""doubling down"" and view it in that context. As they said, """"In the HBCU Times op-ed and in communications with the press, we've been clear that not every supporter of the plan is Black, and have never claimed otherwise in any public communication. We never gave the impression publicly that these people were endorsing Pete, only that they supported the plan. After they indicated their support, we reached out to people multiple times giving them the opportunity to review the language of the op-ed and the option to opt-out. We did hear from people who weren't comfortable being listed and we removed them."" Doesn't it make a lot more sense in context? Not everything is as evil and vile as biased tabloids claim. Why do you automatically assume that the Intercept is telling the truth and the campaign is lying, especially when it matches the original article? You can't find any public communication that says all the supporters are black, like the Intercept claims, because it doesn't exist.

&amp;#x200B;

And of course, this actually has nothing to do with Pete as a candidate at all. He had nothing to do with this. It wasn't even run by his national campaign but by the local South Carolinian chapter. He didn't write it. It says nothing about him as a candidate, or about his policies. It certainly shouldn't be a reason to insult him.  


We are all Democrats here. We want to constructively work on each other's policies, not use baseless insults and purity tests. As always, target the policies. Heck, that is easier to do - I don't agree with all his policies for sure. He is my third choice. But biased and bad faith arguments just suck. They ruin the discourse for everyone.",1574564973,1,0

Especially if you’ve never taken an EECS upper div before, I strongly advise against taking 127 as your first one.

Back in my freshman year I definitely had the mindset of taking as many upper divs as possible as fast as possible because they sound cool — and in high school I could pile on APs left right and center and breeze through them. Now I definitely regret that approach — it’s SO much more worth it to take it slow, make sure your foundations are strong, and then really get the most out of your harder upper divs. Take your time, build your foundations, or you’ll just end up with some cool course titles on your resume but not having gotten anything of substance out of your classes bc you took them too early.",1574561287,1,0

"Edited to remove personal information.

There is a GSI who I really admire, he/she is an excellent gsi and does his/her best to ensure that the students under him/her are doing well both academically and mentally. That GSI is a return student: he/she had left Berkeley undergrad on academic probation, doing poorly academically in all his/her classes.

He/She is under a lot of mental strain even now. Even now I hear him/her say that ""the point of Berkeley is to teach yourself how to acquire large amounts of information in a short period of time"". He/She told me ""humorous"" stories about how once his/her professor during undergrad lost his/her and 5 other students' exam papers and thus they could only get a max of say a B- in the course. Or how due to course restructuring, a difficult course would be impossible for 1/2 of the course's students to complete because there was a prereq course that was eliminated the year before, or how a vague wording in a project cause him/her to lose like 30% of the grade, etc. Once his/her mental health plummeted after those poorly managed courses, he/she kept doing worse and worse due to depression and anxiety. And thus he/she dropped out on academic probation. 
Essentially, based off of my conversations with him/her, it is clear TO ME that he/she did badly because of course mismanagement, not because he/she is incapable. This GSI is absolutely brilliant, the way his/her mind works is amazing, and has a bright future ahead of him/her in their department. But this GSI keeps blaming him/herself for not being perfect, putting him/herself understand constant mental strain. That seriously needs to change.

"I don't think I worded myself clearly, let me try again:

No not all classes at Berkeley are poorly taught, there are some very dedicated professors/gsi's that I've had the pleasure of knowing. But when a class IS poorly taught, the burden of doing well falls solely on the shoulders of the students. There is absolutely no recourse for a poorly taught class, you can argue up to the professor or dean for individual grades, but the only real way to give feedback on a class is on course evaluations, which doesn't change the grade you've already got in the class.

If there is a class or a grade that you receive unfairly, ex there is a post on the mainpage about CS61b you can read, where basically students aren't receiving the credit for their correct work due to a quirk in autograder (I'm not in cs so if I get this wrong my apologies). This is hardly the only time you or any student at Berkeley doesn't get a grade that reflects his/her skill due to a 'management' quirk. Hence, if even the smartest or most capable students at Berkeley can't do well in a class, or if the exam average was a D- and the professor refuses to curve, instead offering heaps of ""extra credit"", then holy hell that class is to be blamed for any stress those students experience. 

Too often students blame themselves for doing poorly in a class, bc they don't understand the material, didn't do well on this or that, etc, but when the bulk of students do poorly (ex, an exam average of D-), they should stop blaming themselves and understand that seriously, that class needs to be changed for the better.

On the other hand, 182+189 will give you some working knowledge of AI if you plan to do management in that area. The people who determine your career probably care more about the leadership than the domain knowledge, but you have a few years to get leadership experience before disappointment sets in anyway.

"Physics CS double here. I disagree with the “focus on your Physics program, and the department will teach you what you need to know” approach. Physics departments  are universally terrible places to learn about programming and data science in general. Physics at Cal offers Physics 77 and an upper division Data Science for Physics course (I forget the class code). They are fine, but you will be far better equipped taking 61A and Data 100 instead. If you really want to, you can take Physics 88, which is the data science extender component of Physics 77. 

More importantly, do you know what you want to do your PhD in? I mean, what area of Physics? If you want to do quantum information, definitely take more CS classes with an emphasis in theoretical CS. If you want to do High Energy (experimental or theory), do more programming and data science / ML courses (61B, Data 100, maybe CS189 if you’re up for it). If you want to do something like experimental condensed matter, you could do well with just Physics 77 and the upper division data analysis course because most of your computer skills will involve using out of the box software packages like labview (Physics 111A teaches you this). For condensed matter theory, you probably want more simulation experience. For all of the above, you probably want some experience in Monte Carlo algorithms.
The point is, whether taking more CS is worthwhile for the specific intention of bolstering your physics education for grad school, depends greatly on what sub field you want to get into.

Get a minor if it is within reasonable means, i.e you aren’t taking too many classes that you wouldn’t otherwise take, just to get the minor. If you need one to three more classes than you would otherwise have taken out of interest in your field, then go for the minor, because you ‘might as well’. Otherwise, just take classes that are relevant to the field of Physics you are interested in. 

Alternatively, you could just take more CS because it interests you. Getting a minor (or a second major) is reasonable then.",1577763647,1,0

"I had a vague idea that I wanted to get into Quantum computing research, Cal has only made this proclivity stronger, with some more specificity (I now know I want to do theory for quantum ML algorithms). It certainly helped that my Physics 5A Professor during my first semester was a young guy who was involved in the field quite heavily. Admittedly, the neutrino oscillation URAP was not a directed effort per se. As a first semester freshman I naively just wanted ‘research’ and was willing to get into any Physics related group that gave me serious work. The project was not advertised as a computational physics project, but coincidentally, a large component of the project was computational / ML related and this fit well with the few skills I had and projects I had worked on coming into college. I work with the groups I work with now as a result of some selectivity from end as well, and I will likely stay with both till graduation. Anywho, these experiences have certainly altered my interests as well. For instance, I’m now seriously considering grad school in EECS as opposed to Physics.",1577761651,1,0

can all be used to satisfy the upperdiv elective requirements for the Astrophysics major, according to the [major requirements page](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/astrophysics/#majorrequirementstext). In fact, you could satisfy all 24 units entirely just from these CS classes. Personally I am also tentatively planning a double major in Computer Science and Astrophysics, so probably most of my upper div tech electives will be from the EECS department, as well as a couple of physics classes to satisfy the prereqs for Astron C161/160.",1577759699,1,0

C161 seems like an interesting course but it has 110B as one of the prerequisites and 110B itself is one of the electives. But I guess since 110B is also one of the recommended courses I'll mostly end up taking it. Thank you!,1577758541,1,0

"Yeah, I'm not a fan of how the 61 series is run, being honest. It's a big messy problem largely tracable to the size of the course and the need to weed, but that's another discussion. I think it's reasonable to pursue other means to actually learn coding skills (non-weeder courses, self-study, etc). 

I do believe that it's in your best interest to cut back the semester somewhat, though. If the lower division courses have given you trouble, upper-division tend to be a significant step up from them. 4 technicals, including your first 2 upper-divs, along with a fifth course, will probably be brutal. If nothing else, be prepared to drop something (probably either 110 or 110a) in the first few weeks if it becomes clear that the workload is too high.",1577756989,1,0

"First off thanks for the advice!

I'm an astrophysics major because the major is more flexible than the physics major. I only have to take 3 Astro classes and the rest can be whatever I want as long as it is in the physical sciences (including math). I'm not opposed to being an astrophysicist but I'm not any more likely to want to become one over any other physics subfield.

I took CS61A but didn't like how the class is structured (huge classes, queued OH) and failed the class. I plan to retake it but I'm not sure how I feel about adding more CS classes. From my understanding what is needed for Astro is self-contained in the curriculum in terms of programming, and it would be more working with large sets of data rather than computer science. Currently, I don't have much interest in being a software developer but I thought I would self-study CS outside of Berkeley as a back-plan. Currently, the only thing I certainly want to do is teach high school physics.

Originally I didn't plan on pursuing more math since I didn't do very well in lower-division so I took a semester off math. After reading up and watching a few videos on abstract algebra however it made me want to give math another shot. If I struggle and don't like 110 then I won't pursue it further at Berkeley.

I know the research will be important for physics grad school but it wouldn't be for a master's in education. I plan to try to get research next summer and based on my experience in research I will determine if I want to go to grad school for physics. This course load would only put me behind by a semester since I would be starting research next summer as opposed to this spring.",1577754702,1,0

"Well, probably, but generally speaking, you can't retake a class that you pass. However, if you're able to retake the class somehow, it will probably replace the old grade. On the other hand, at least one major (CS) takes into account _all_ the grades you get for all of your major prereqs, so for example, failing 61A your first semester, then getting an A- in 61A, a B+ in 70, and an A in 61B is a 2.75, rather than a 3.6, for the purpose of declaring the major.",1577753293,1,0

You'd have to ask the logic minor advisors but I do know that you can't get credit for both Math 55 and CS 70.,1577750147,1,0
"This would be my advice, for what it's worth: I think it might be a good idea to swap in more CS courses, and do a lower overall course load. Astro, as far as I'm aware, is functionally very CS-intensive. CS courses will also give you more options for careers, particularly with a bachelor's (plans can change, and it's good to have backup plans). 

Note I'm saying this as a pure math major as well; I'd say maybe pick up an analysis book (I'd go with Ross for self-study) to get a sense of how you feel about math. You might love it, but you might not; lower-division and upper-division math are actually fairly different, and loving one is not a guarantee of loving the other. 

As to why a lower overall courseload: for grad school, one of the most important things is going to be research experience. As much as you can get, as early as possible. Sacrificing research experience for more coursework is not a good move.",1577750114,1,0
