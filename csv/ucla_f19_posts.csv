HELP - Failed 1st Year Don’t Know What To Do,"Hi, so I don’t want to make a super long story and I really need good feedback on what to do. So I pretty much failed my first 3 quarters because of built up depression etc and wasn’t able to reach my academic potential I had when I was in high school. My parents are both immigrants who came alone and both passed away and I ended up making it to UCLA. I managed to get fully covered besides a small loan but because of the depression and feeling of being alone etc I couldn’t make it. I’ve taken about 5 months to recollect myself and I feel as though I can do it right this time. 

The problem is I got sent a letter in the mail that I owe 4 grand since I got a loan and failed my first year. I have no financial support since I have no biological family alive in the US and my hometown is 4 hours away from UCLA so commuting is not an option. After being dismissed or kicked out I really don’t know how I can get a second chance and I really need help. Anything helps I really appreciate it if someone can suggest any options for me.",1568352782,29,0

Class enrollment after orientation,"I saw that we get a second enrollment pass on September 17th for fall quarter. I was hoping to change one of my lecture times for CHEM 14A. However, I'm confused how the enrollment on the 17th works. That day when I logon to the class planner should I drop my original CHEM 14A lecture and then enroll in the lecture time I want? Is it possible to enroll in the lecture I want and then drop the original's lecture so I'm safe, because if I drop my original lecture and can't get the other time I want I might not get the class at all. 

TLDR: When enrolling for a second time is it better to enroll in the class you want than drop the original class you had. Or do you have to drop the class you first signed up for and then enroll in your other desired class/lecture.

Thanks in advance.",1568322125,2,0

LOST Anthropology Major Looking for Advice and Constructive Criticism LOL,"Hi guys. So I am currently a community college student looking to transfer next fall...UCLA being the top choice \*wish me luck for admissions ripppp\*\*. However, I am pretty torn about my major.... I have changed it multiple times from majors such as political science, criminal justice, etc... all within the social sciences. I've never really found a major that I am genuinely passionate about and the uncertainty that comes with that is so stressful. I definitely am not suited for a STEM major. Not going to lie, I somewhat cherry-picked anthropology just because I was running out of time and needed to choose a field with a reasonable amount of major prep courses so that I can transfer in time (because I need to submit apps soon). Not to say that I do not enjoy the anthropology classes that I am taking, but I have a difficult time believing that it will really get me anywhere in life as it is not a traditionally respected major such as CS or Bio. Ultimately, my end goal is to go pursue law school after my undergrad, in which they do accept students of all majors. BUT will the skills acquired from an anthro degree even be beneficial or worthwhile? Part of the reason I chose this major was due to how fascinated I was with an anthropologist's perspective... being able to objectively analyze situations/people/etc. and effectively communicate their thoughts. But I can't help feeling a level of embarrassment when people ask me what my major is because they are quick to make negative assumptions. That sounds extremely ridiculous because I know that I am a hardworking student who is dedicated...but society has gotten to me sadly and I try to fit into other's mold when the only person I should work to impress is myself (and my future employer of course LOL). When i do transfer, regardless if that is at UCLA or at another UC campus, I am afraid I will be unhappy and that I have wasted all this time and money... i guess the main purpose of this post is the question: **Is an anthropology degree a waste of time if I am trying to pursue law?** \- sincerely, a confused 19 yr old gal :(",1568106213,0,0

Office hours?,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the second post in a few hours, I was just wondering if there is a way to find a Professor's current office hours? I am in desperate need for a letter of recommendation due in 15 days, and I have been left in an unfortunate situation where a Professor who promised a LOR has ghosted on me. In my search for a new Professor, I still have my syllabus which lists their office hours, but they change every quarter right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way to find their new office hours besides camping outside of their office? I am now convinced that the only way I will get a LOR is to ask in person first. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if things become even more desperate, is it poor etiquette to ask for a LOR for a Professor who I'm only taking for the first time this quarter?

An open letter to /r/UCLA,"If your correctness score is below 50, it may not be because of your lack of understanding of C++, but something more fundamental: You ignored repeated admonitions in the spec and in class to avoid specific foolish mistakes, yet you made them anyway. Whatever your field of study is, you must fix this characteristic about yourself. No employer would dare hire someone who ignores repeated spoken and written directives: You'd pose a risk to the safety of yourself and others if you ignore safety rules, a risk to the financial health of the company if you ignore legal regulations, and a drain on productivity if your ignoring specifications causes you or others to devote more time later on to correct your mistakes.


What’s exasperating is that despite all that was said above, there will be people who will ask for a re-examination of their correctness score without saying which test case numbers to look at or without having tried those cases under multiple compliers or without running the Project 2 tester mentioned in FAQ #7. Those people are exhibiting the exact characteristic that may have caused them to make the mistake that cost them so many points: They don’t pay attention to what they read.",1572416271,17,0

Possible food poisoning from participating in a study ???,"I recently tested positive for a bacterial infection and according to my doctor, I was exposed to it by eating contaminated food.

I had to sit and watch a video while snacking on some candy. Then, Wednesday morning I had nothing for breakfast but the serious symptoms had already begun. I’m wondering if I should email the researchers and warn them. Then again, I don’t know their actual methods, or whether or not they actually emptied out the bowl from which I was snacking from. It’s just unsettling to me to wonder whether or not I was eating from the same bowl that other people were dipping their hands into. According to the CDC, the strain of bacteria I was exposed to can be spread from eating something that has been in contact with the stool of someone else who is sick with that strain.

Thinking of applying to be a New Student Advisor (NSA)? DON’T.,"I’m only writing this because I just started seeing postings about the recent opening of the NSA application. Trust me, as someone who has been a part of the program before (and would never willingly be a part of it again) there are much better ways to make a difference on campus. Firstly, your experience in the program really just depends on whether you’re liked by the “professional” staff which is why you may hear some people say such positive things about their experience and hear others complain about theirs. The staff has no morale. The staff works insane hours (many of which aren’t paid but are rather “compensated” through housing which is technically illegal in California but they’ve found some special wording that makes it legal in their work contract) and despite constantly working your butt off, you will hardly receive positive encouragement and only constantly be told what you (the staff collectively) are doing wrong. Although constructive criticism is great, this professional staff literally doesn’t know how to thank you for your hard work. If you suffer from mental health I am warning you, DO NOT JOIN THIS PROGRAM. They don’t care about your mental health and everything they preach all summer applies to everyone but their own staff. For example, they constantly tell the new students about how even though they’re in college it’s important to, “get 7-8 hours of sleep,” meanwhile the staff is constantly running on very little sleep. Every year they get complaints about mistreatment by the professional staff and simply just brush it off with a mediocre apology. Seriously, you’re better off working at a coffee shop over the summer (you’ll be a lot happier). 

TL;DR don’t join this program unless you want to be mentally abused and mistreated",1576570219,1,0

I've done the calculations for my final grade for the course, and I think getting those 2 points would actually make the difference between an A and an A+.

Looking for more opinions, thanks in advance! I want to take those useful classes on personal finance but am the type to feel like every class I take should go to some sort of objective.

Would either class have been better to wait to enroll in, I feel like it’s mostly first and second year that enroll in them. I was thinking that LS lab section is 20 seats since it’s only the lab but because psych 10 doesn’t have discussions, there’s 200 seats. Which should I have enrolled in?

Question about Econ 101 and mgmt 1B,"Looks like the only thing I can do this quarter is take 101 and 1B because it’s all I have left for biz Econ premajor. I also have an internship lined up that’s 15-20 hours per week, so I need my classes on 2-3 days. I’m also a commuter. Is Econ 101, mgmt 1B, and a GE too hard on top of an internship? I’m kinda out of options because I only need 1 more GE. I also need 1 quarter of French, but it’s MWF so right now that’s not an option. 

The only thing that concerns me is I got a B in Econ 11, but i did get an A in mgmt 1A. So basically I suck at calculus. My only other B is in 31B, rest of my classes all A’s (no A- either). I’m a little borderline, and probably need a B+ (maybe B in 1B) in both classes to get into business Econ. Also, I took Woo for 1A and I know ravetch is impossible and way too much work. 

I think I can go to whatever discussion I want for 101, and since it’s a new prof I assume it won’t fill up. So I think I’ll use my second pass on that. 

What are the discussions like for 1B? Mandatory? If so I’ll use my first pass to get a good discussion and then whatever GE I want. 

Also another unrelated question: is 3 Econ/ mgmt upper divisions considered too hard? Since I’ll be done with GEs this is what my schedule will end up looking like later lol.",1573490115,1,0

Yes, I signed up for all of this by choosing to go to college. But fairly said, UCLA fucking sucks because of all of the flaws that come with running such a big system. And fuck my professor. Yes, I should put my laptop away so I can try to pay attention but I'm TRIPPIN right now because of actual life issues... and I'm supposed to go to class and try to decipher this lady's English. We're at such an amazing institution and I can't even understand my professor. LIT. And I've had professors like this before. Fuck all of my friends who are going to easy colleges and enjoying themselves. I'm so jealous of them. I want that so badly right now. But I realize I need to keep pushing and stay levelheaded because UCLA will give me fantastic opportunities later in life...

Dear Undergrad Fellows,"I know it's midterms and I don't want to take a lot of your time. I don't want you guys to read all this and think ""damn I should've used this time better"". That's not my point and I'll try to go straight to the point, if possible. Sometimes I do admit I'll have to take a long detour, and it will be up to you to decide if you should keep on track or not.

&amp;#x200B;

As UCLA students you might think, if thinking is something you include as part of your daily reflection time fo the day, what's the purpose, or goal if that word suits you better, of going to a good (even though everything is relative and other ways of self education are decent) college and myself, as a Bruin, ask that question several times, at least five or six, maybe seven some days when I'm nostalgic, sometimes more than once per hour even. It's interesting the role of college in our lives and we can't deny it takes a toll on our mind or brain, with the passing of the years. It's totally worth it but sometimes it's not and even if it's not worth it, going to college is one of the things every person in their young life should at least consider and if they don't, well that's up to them, who am I to judge, right.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I wanted to tell you guys, now that you are studying for your midterms, is that an exam is exactly that, an exam, and if you are looking for some sort of strategy, well, in college there are a lot of them but I don't want to spend more of your time when you clearly should be studying, but I do want to say that it's important to at least consider everything we just discussed and even though I did them most of the talking, you as a reader are also an active mind and I am sure your take on this is as important and relevant as mine.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this and I wish you the best, or not if that's not what you are aiming for in this life.",1571429616,1,0

Good programming (or general) classes for an econ major?,"Hey everyone, I’m graduating this school year with a degree in econ and minor in environmental systems and realized I have 2 empty class slots for the next 2 quarters.

How does anyone manage to not kill the environment,"Last year I had a basic dorm with 2 frat boy roommates and we threw everything in the same trash bag because doing anything else with the state of the room and the people inside it was a massive impossible pain in the ass. I have a single this year, so I figured I would be a good person and save the planet, except...it's really hard to figure out what goes where, my lord. I tried making 3 bags for compost/recycle/trash, but what goes in which bag? In particular, the following items confuse me:

* Rendevous ""papery"" boxes, are these compostable or recyclable??
* Study boxes for things like waffles, they look even paperier? I assume the plastic top goes in recycle?
* Bags for chips/popcorn have to be thrown out, right? (Does this mean UCLA will get rid of them within a year to be ""100% eco-friendly by 2020"")
* Cardboard pizza boxes...I figured these were compostable but apparently you're supposed to take them apart and recycle them? According to a sign on the trash chute
* If there's a significant amount of food in any of the above doesn't that make them non-recyclable? 
* Receipts/classwork is paper so it definitely gets recycled??? Right??
* Technically the big black trash bags aren't compostable so can I really drop a bag full of compostable items down the compost chute??? Doesn't this defeat the entire point

I Always Feel Like the Smartest One at USC,"I decided to become a USC student after I realized how bored I was in my UCLA classes even though I suck at writing and reading and taking the SAT unassisted, and because I usually preferred to study for my USC classes instead because the material was always more interesting to me.

But it doesn’t matter how few hours I study, I am always way ahead in the class and when new material comes I’m still too busy laughing at how easy the previous week’s material was. And with some classes I comprehend the material so much that I feel like I can’t go to office hours because I don’t even know WHAT to ask. I know it’s because there’s no need to study - I never seem to need much time to do actual practice problems, because I waste too much time playing games on my phone during class that it doesn’t seem necessary to do homework if I’m going to ace it anyway (right?)

Then shit is hitting the fan now that midterms are here. I hate overhearing conversations of “oh yeah that wasn’t too bad” from people I KNOW know what they’re doing in the class when I’m over here flying through exams getting As like nothing.

I just hate always being so ahead even though I love the material.

psych 100b vibes...,"I've seen a lot of posts here asking how Psych 100b is like. I was one of those students before and I took this class so I thought i'd tell you guys how it went for me. 

First off, I got a perfect score on the final (over the summer there is only a final and no midterm, and this one exam is worth 40% of your entire grade) and yet I ended w/ a B. everyone said to take it during the summer cuz it's supposedly easier, but I'd only suggest doing that if you are an excellent writer. I actually always thought I was pretty good at writing, I've never gotten anything below an A in any of my papers throughout several years in college thus far. But my self-confidence in my writing skills is completely shattered now cuz of psych 100b. 

During the summer, the lab is worth way more points than usual, it goes 60/40 in favor of lab, while during the school years it's vice versa. I wish I took it during the school year cuz the test was not nearly as bad as everyone on Bruinwalk said, and those extra points would've helped me a lot, cuz again I essentially got a 100% in lecture. Also, during the summer, keep in mind that the pace is accelerated like crazy. The thing was, we would be assigned a big project on a thursday, and it would be due on tuesday- problem was there wasn't a single OH available in b/w those days and my TA was very bad at responding to emails. This was a very annoying problem to have for a class like this cuz everything is so arbitrary and the instructions to assignments are not clear. I swear they keep things vague and confusing on purpose or something. You'll know what I mean once you take the class- but basically almost every element to whatever instructions you get, or the ""guidelines"" to the first and second submissions are really up to interpretation. So thus due to my TA's lack of ability to respond to emails and lack of OH in b/w having something assigned and due, I would essentially be shooting from the hip on a lot of things. There's no minimum page or maximum page limit either, at least having that would've been nice so you have some gauge in how much details need to be written. There'd be instances where I'd write things the T.A. said to do, and she would still mark me off. She would even mark me off for something that would literally be addressed the next sentence, it's like she barely read my paper or something. 

The grading of these papers is very, very arbitrary. Sometimes your T.A. will mark off minute details while forgetting to mark off other parts of your paper w/ similar mistakes. Also, the first and second submissions are the biggest component to your lab grade, and they build off each other. I did not even get my first submission back until a day or two before the second and final submission was due, so I pretty much had no idea if a lot of the ideas I was writing were even accurate. From what I understand, this is usually not an issue during the regular quarter cuz everything is spaced out, and you have weeks to do assignments we have days to complete.

Oh and a big part of your lab grade is going to be your group. I had a pretty shitty group so that sucked- one person seemed to not care about anything while the other pretended to care while writing BS. So there's going to be a lot of luck involved in this class. 

Bottom line is, the material to the class is not difficult but it is poorly structured imo. I feel like they should be giving more clear instructions to the assignments, and either eliminate the group element or change the structure of it. I understand that obviously in the future many of our careers are going to involve the ability to work in groups, but I feel like for a 6 unit class like this where your grade is so important, they should allow grades to be decided by the individual. But hey, that's just my 2-cents. I also wanted to write this post so that others may be more mindful of taking this class over the summer. It seems like the general consensus among psych majors is ""take 100b over the summer, it's going to be easier!"" but it is entirely subjective and depends on your strengths and weaknesses as a student. If any of you out there have some questions or want to know more details (like the T.A. I had or grades to specific assignments) pm me, I didn't wanna write out too many details to maintain anonymity.",1571208637,4,0

"Grad student transferring to UCLA, need advice on finding an apartment/roommate","Hello, I'm going to be moving to los angeles soon to start at UCLA as a graduate student this coming winter quarter. I'm looking to get a move-in date for an apartment in early december (at least a few days before the 18th - I already booked christmas flights back to family, and am looking to get moved in before I fly back for that). My advisor can fly me out for a week to find an apartment and help set up the new lab in early november, which to my understanding is about how far in advance you want to apartment hunt in LA. I have a lot of questions to this end:

Do you guys think it would be better to hunt during the week of Nov. 3rd, or Nov. 10th?

Where's the best place to find a roommate? I'm in a bit of a tricky situation with this one. For the first 6ish months, I would be a non-full time trans woman still going by my old name, and sometime during the first year I would be looking to go full time. Maybe I'm being overly cautious (I grew up in north carolina, did my undergrad in virginia), but I need to make sure whoever I'm rooming with is going to be alright with that. It's tricky to use social media (like the facebook page) for this purpose as I can't be direct in posts without outing myself to extended family

Any tips for apartment complexes? I'm looking for a place that has a rent &lt;1300/person (preferably closer to 1100) that has a good amount of available bussing to UCLA campus, as I won't have a car. Grocery stores and such located nearby would also be a huge plus. So far what I've been looking at is the area that the University Apartments South complexes are located - I applied too late to have any chance in the housing lottery, but even without going through the university there seem to be a good number of two bedroom apartments in that area that are within my price range.

Other nice things would be if washer/dryer were located as nearby as possible (I think that in LA in-unit ones are pretty much impossible at my price point, but on the same floor would be great. Per building would also be fine, but I would really prefer to avoid needing a separate location for laundry), and if the lease/sublet was monthly as that would make it a lot easier to potentially switch into cheaper university-affiliated housing in the future.

I don't really care about roommate gender. Past experience with my current, male roommate suggests that the whole bras and boobs thing can be awkward for guys to live with. I'm pretty quiet most of the time (headphones not speakers, etc), my room is often messy, but I keep common spaces relatively clean. I tend to clean in bursts. I'm fine with alcohol / marijuana as long as it's non-smoking. I myself don't drink very often (around once per 1/2 months in the past) but have been known to get fairly drunk at times, and would probably want to try (legal) marijuana at one point or another. I'm not a fan of parties, but would be fine as long as I had a bit of notice.

If you have any tips at all for getting a good apartment for not too much money, or know someone that's subletting a space or looking to move into a new one this december, please let me know!",1571164186,3,0

Meeting Friends Around Campus,"I have seen quite a few posts about new students feeling lonely and decided to post about it. I hope you guys will find it useful.

I used to be an international student and I know all the struggles they go through (far away from families, friends, new culture, new language, the list goes on). After I graduated not so long ago, I decided to create a platform to help international students make friends at their new colleges and help them feel more comfortable.

I published my mobile app about 2-3 ago, and what I found out was quite interesting. So many local students from different universities signed up (even more than internationals), and I realized that this can be a great way for students to meet new people, make friends, go to college events together, overcome social anxiety.

I would be very happy, even if I could help one person. If anyone is interested, just comment below or send me a DM.",1570376873,6,0

This is the most insane but completely non-fiction story you will ever see. It is however having trouble getting traction, and getting censored\\banned. Some of the ways this is happening are explained in the update section near the end of the document. Media is currently ignoring this story. This is an effort to create public awareness, so that bribes, blackmail, censorship, and secret deals cannot allow these vile criminals to maintain the status quo, and remain in office.

Billions in bribes were paid to Trump, Pelosi, Schumer, Harris and others to enable a Soros, Koch, and Porter funded child raping ring to operate in the USA. Below will contain excerpts from the 84 page PDF document which can be downloaded near the end of this post. **Please download** **and listen to the links below.** **Turn up the volume and put headphones on.** **You will hear these people and many other high profile people, incriminate themselves in unbelievable fashion.**

* President Donald Trump demands $4 billion to ""take a blind eye"" starting around 1015+. Here are pieces of the dialogue:  	  
 

1018 Henry Porter: The child raping.

1018 Donald Trump: What the fuck are you talking about?

1018 Gigi Hadid: Mr President we are child rapists.

1018 Donald Trump: You cannot be serious.

1019 Donald Trump: You’re gonna need $4 billion for me to take a blind eye.

1019 Porter: People are laughing because they think four billion is too much. I think it's not a problem when you have $35 billion.

1022 Donald Trump: You better have that $4 billion or you can kiss this shit goodbye.

1033 Matthew Porter: We appreciate that Speaker Pelosi.

1033 Gigi Hadid: I think we may have to scale back a little bit though.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Gigi I think we will be just fine.

1035 Nancy Pelosi: God damn it\\! I want Kamala to get a billion out of yours, not out of mine

1035 Gigi Hadid: I think we can accommodate you but we need to find out if Monterrey will be open on the 30th of January.

1036 Nancy Pelosi: Of course it will Gigi...

1036 Nancy Pelosi: $3 billion goes a long way Peter \[Theil\\\].

* Reason for the false judgment: an illegal eviction. Illuminati want this apartment, which has been illegally broadcasting the tenant as a “Truman Show” for over four years, as a ready made child pornography studio. The Porter’s had pushed for a murder-for-hire and rape of the tenant, but had to settle for this illegal removal performed by the Buffalo Police violating the tenant’s fourth amendment rights on January 18, 2019:

* Barack Obama explains the “Illuminati” with Jack Dorsey. 	At 2:30am, a conversation is occurring on the embedded Porter camera system with Jack Dorsey, Peter Thiel, Barack Obama, Bill Murray, and the Porters. Jack Dorsey provides a statement defining who their group is: ""The Illuminati is an underground organization of child rapists and homosexuals."" Matthew Porter: ""We have to thin the herd, so Barack is going to explain a few things."" At 2:32am Barack Obama says the following: ""You people have to realize we are child rapists. The Illuminati are child rapists. As soon as you figure that out, you can decide what to do. Everybody is freaking out about what just happened \[“rape party” still continuing on\]. This is who we are."":

\\\\Please post this anywhere you can! Create your own posts with this or other excerpt from the PDF. This information keeps getting blocked, censored, 'down/voted' etc. These people are extremely wealthy and throw money to anyone who will help them cover up their child rapes , child murders, and corruption. This is usually done through a receivership transfer where you receive the funds after for or more day, and it can be pulled at the last second, which is usually the case after you've done them the ""service"" as they call it. Please help get the word out. Soon it will no longer be able to be ignored.

A word about the ""faggot"" usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control of the situation, if they were the usage would have been stopped. Everyone out there needed to see this, as it was contrary to the picture they were painting. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the telepathic headspace \[see reference item G in the PDF\], which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of B.S. in the headspace, because they would not call each other “faggot”, and in turn giving themselves away thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for those unintentionally offended. On that note, I give you former President Barack Obama in a foursome with Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and Matthew Porter. It is on page 12 of the document where you can download the video containing audio footage of the ""event"". Link for the PDF is just above under ""Full 84 page document"".

2019 did not go as planned. Hope you Bruins have had better luck than I had :),"Been single for 20 years. Decided 2019 was the year I changed that status before the new decade came around. 

Became friends with a very beautiful lady along with a group of other Bruins. Struggled through the same classes and also partied through the highs and cried through the lows. Summer school together was only bearable because she was there taking the same classes as I was. 

Decided it was time I make a move and reveal that my feelings have ignited, starting from a small spark into a huge fire. But what could I say or do? Blurting it out is no fun. I can't sing for my life nor do I have the money to hire a singing coach. Can't really play guitar as I can only play the basic chords. Hmm...

I remember vividly the day she shared her life story. I could hear the sadness in her voice, but it was the silent emotionless expression of sorrow on her face that screamed the loudest. I could rarely see the smile on her face throughout the days, yet when she did, it was the prettiest thing she wore. 

And thus, I embarked on a ruthless journey, to re-ignite my childhood passions of drawing and coloring, and draw a portrait of her, smiling. Not that I was good at drawing, but I was determined. I saved up whatever amount of money I could gather through my summer job to purchase a Strathmore 400 Series Drawing Paper Pad, some colored pencils, and art pencils for shading. Contacted my art major friend to teach me the basics and help me correct the imperfections of my lines and shapes. Fall quarter goes by, she doesn't suspect a thing. 

Through many trial and errors, many hours of preparation, I finally completed a fairly accurate portrait of her, smiling, and nice sunny UCLA background. 

I didn't want to distract her from her studies as it was the peak of the latter weeks of Fall Quarter. We got through finals and it was finally time. I tell her that I have a gift for her as a congratulations to getting through another quarter. Knees weak, arms heavy, heart pounding, I lead her to my place where I unveiled the product of my labor. 

She looks stunned and laughs, laughing with the same smile as the one I had produced with pencil and paper.  I tell her it was for her, that her smile was beautiful and it makes me happy. Was it a success?

She turns to me, laughing, and says ""Thanks bro, you can keep it though since it makes you happy and I don't have much space in my room!"" At this point I revealed my true intentions and it turns out she actually has been talking/dating someone else from a different school (a school close to UCLA, but not as good as UCLA if you know what I mean ;) ). She said that perhaps if I told her a couple weeks earlier, things would've been different but now it's too late. At least for now because she's fully committed with her current relationship.

We're still friends (rip), I have no hate towards her at all, it's her decision and I respect it. We hung out over break a couple times. I will probably smack myself for the rest of the year for trying to be a romantic fool but you live and you learn. I let her tell her friends the whole story and she let me tell the story to all of my friends. It's been weeks since it happened so we all laugh about it now and nothing is weird between any of us so it's chill.

Anyways, Bruins, don't be like me and waste your quarter learning how to draw for a girl. Just let her know asap. I will retire on my artistic endeavors and never draw again :). Press F in the chat.

Food Allergies at UCLA,"Hey guys, I applied for UCLA in November and am looking into different aspects of campus life. However, I have life-threatening food allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, and eggs. It's at the level where I can't eat anything with traces of those foods. Being in a room with those foods is generally okay. 

I was wondering if anyone knew about UCLA's food allergy policies. Is there a mandatory meal plan? What are the dining options? I know other schools have dining halls that are specifically allergen-free or accommodations that can be made for the meal plans to students with allergies, and I hope that UCLA has something like this, as it's one of my top choice schools.

Determine whether a leave of absence is warranted or not,"Hi everyone, 

Some of you may have already seen my previous post on wanting to switch into math and all that but let me expand. 

I just transferred from CC after two years and after this quarter I realized that I am not as interested in my current major as I thought I would be. Math has been something Ive really enjoyed in the last year or so and Ive realized that it is likely too late to do anything abut it here. 

The only thing I could potentially see myself doing is submitting a leave of absence and returning to CC (For about a year) and finishing the few math classes I need to take. Would this route even be possible? If someone returns after x amount of time are they allowed to switch majors? Any sort of advice would help!

I went through the 9 assignments we did and realized I had used Chegg on one out of the like 80 problems I did. I did not even use it on the code, I used it in my explanation like a dumbfuck. In addition, I honestly put in so much work - hours of work - into this class and cannot believe I was referred over one question. I also got an A on the exams and final project.

Confessing to Smallberg/Using Github,"Hey guys, I have some serious inquiry about the cheating in the CS department, so please do not swamp me with negative comments. This is also not a copypasta. I am just a CS freshman freaking out right now. It would honestly be great if a TA or anyone with prior experience share their advice or pm me. 

So a couple of days ago, all CS31 students received an email from Smallberg regarding CS31 asking us to confess if we violated the academic integrity. I did end up using Github for one function for a project since I was right on the deadline and I couldn't figure it out.  Looking back, I probably should have just taken the L. It was one of the earlier projects and I made it a point not to do it again in for future projects. I have read some past Reddit posts about CS Smallberg emails and that it is a hoax. Most of them are saying its a fluke or how just deny confession all the way. 

However, I have some reasons to believe they know for certain. I am wondering if I should just confess before they even told me they caught me and hope they will give me a light sentence or I should wait until they notify me and confess then. I really don't want to risk it by continuing denying it and be sent to the student committee. Regardless, the email said I will be sent to the dean of students. 

If anyone can tell me more about the process, especially for Smallberg, and the possible punishments and punishments handed out in the past. I read online that no matter what I do it is at least a two-quarters suspension and even expulsion. It will be great if someone can shed some light on this situation. If you don't want to disclose or remain anonymous, please just send me a PM and I will definitely keep everything private.",1577437211,1,0

Accused of Soliciting Donations in Final. What's the process now?,"Hey bruins, I've been accused of soliciting donations during my final exam (using a clipboard) by another student. I had a clipboard in my seat faced down but didn't even look at it or touch it once throughout the exam. The bossman (professor) himself said that he did not witness anything but since I've been reported by another student, then he will be referring me to the Dean of Charitable Acts for resolution. I did ask ""Scuse me boss, can I ask you a question"" to my TA, but it was about the exam, not donations. I did not solicit donations, as I would rather go broke than to do so as my integrity is priceless, but what's the process now? Naturally, I will deny any wrongdoing, but I have a few questions regarding the process now:

1. What happens when you meet with the Dean of Charitable Acts? What does s/he say to you?

2. Are you assumed to be innocent until proven guilty?

3. Is the burden of proof on the accuser/professor?

4. I know that if the Dean of C.A. determines that there is not enough evidence, then they can dismiss the case. How likely is this, especially if it's just hearsay from another student and the professor or TA didn't see anything. (https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/flowchart.pdf)

5. Would it be possible to show my donation logs or my (legally obtained) solicitation license? Would this help my case to prove my innocence?

6. What is the best way to prove my innocence, especially since it's just hearsay from everybody?

7. Am I able to ask bossmen questions or even know who the bossman is that accused me?

If you have any experience with the Donation Integrity process or have been through it yourself, please share! Thanks y'all!

EDIT: I didn’t bring a backpack to any of my finals that day. I only had my bulletproof vest, my champagne glass, and my clipboard. The clipboard kept falling out of my vest (I got a pretty huge clipboard) so I just picked it up as the exam started and put it down on my seat without a second thought and continued with my exam. At no point did I touch the clipboard or even look at it.

EDIT: I just went into my donation logs. I went back to the day of my exam and during the exam time, it showed that there was 0 activity for any donations or ATM withdrawals or any suspicious questions asked of bossmen at all. It also showed that I received zero dollars during the exam. My clipboard has every donation that I have ever received and records of every student stopped, so this is irrefutable evidence that I did not solicit donations.",1577389161,1,0

I miss my ex [vent],"I know this post is random and will be drowned out by all the grade related ones but I wanted to vent and maybe get some advice.

I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago because the stress from our responsibilities (classes, extracurriculars, work) were starting to take a toll on our relationship. I knew she'd never be the one to call things off so one night after a huge fight I decided to call it quits. At first it was sort of liberating but lately I've been missing her more and more. Talked to a couple girls to take my mind off her but over the past month I've been realizing she's the only one I want.

I've been wanting to talk to her to try to work things out but I don't think I'm worthy of a second chance. I'm pretty sure she hates me now too. It really sucks because we have classes together next quarter (we're the same major) so I have to see her 3x a week and not seeing her at all this break has already been shitty coz we're from the same hometown and everything reminds me of her.

Readmission after dismissal help!!!,"My education after high school has been a wild ride. I attended UCLA for a year, and decided to withdraw as a sophomore. I had already received a Subject to Dismissal notice because I failed two classes during Spring Quarter. My mental health took a complete nosedive, which is why I withdrew. Then I received the letter that I was dismissed. Now I'm taking classes at a communty college. It started out fine, but I changed majors and felt so completely lost. Also, I still wasn't getting help for my mental health. So I finished the semester having failed two classes. It really was not looking good for me. I've been thinking long and hard about what direction I want to take in my life. I know I can succeed at UCLA because my first two quarters were okay, I even got two perfect A's in my second quarter. I was just in a horrible state of mind. I've decided that I want to go back and will do literally whatever it takes to get readmitted. I am already getting help for my mental health, and my therapist advised that I set goals and this is one I have set. I am going to quit my bullshit and buckle down and try to fall in love with education again. How can I go about getting readmitted, because I had heard so many different things on this subreddit. Some say its noncompetitive and easy, others say it is difficult and you have to take classes at the expensive UCLA extension, etc. Is it possible for me to get readmitted? I'm aware I will probably have to take courses at a cc to prove I can succeed academically. Thanks in advance for any advice!!!",1575448212,1,0

Mental Health screening?,"Throwaway account.

I just need to know if there's any info about mental health screening in UCLA.

I recently talked to some people and when I told them about being ""lazy"" almost everyday for months they clearly told me that it's probably not me being lazy, it might be depression. So, it hit upon me very well and I really need to talk and sort this issue out.

EEB 116: Conservation Bio,"Has anyone taken this class? I just got my midterm grade back and I did absolutely *horribly* and it's been the most jarring thing because I've been doing really well on quizzes and I've been following (so I thought) the material well. I felt really good about the exam walking out but when I got my exam back I'd been docked heavily on practically every section of the exam? I think I could've achieved the same score leaving practically 1/2 the exam blank? I think some of the grading on the questions might've been harsh but I'm doubting literally every bit of material I *thought* I knew about this class so what the fuck do i know, lol. 

I haven't gotten the opportunity to look over the exam in detail but we're supposedly going to have viewing periods starting next week. If anyone has some advice or or some knowledge regarding the course and exams it'd be greatly appreciated. I've pretty much accepted that I'm probably not getting an A in the course but I'm disappointed with the score and I want to make sure the same thing doesn't happen on the final exam.

11R is too much,"Just wondering if anyone else has been having the same issue as me.

I'm wishing I didn't have to spend so much on mandatory food at this point, as it's just money down the drain.   
Worst of all, if I want to get rid of all my meals I have to wait every four hours for the fucking dining period to switch so I can use another swipe (as 11R only lets you use a single swipe every time). It's just another thing to worry about.

In about three hours i’m going to be in the shower alternately crying and coming up with snappy comebacks i’m not going to have the courage to use. 

I put two napkins in a neat and orderly fashion on the table just like always but i guess this time this gibbering buffoon was like “heehoo look free bibs on which i can wipe my drool. What a fortuitous day this is! the universe smiles upon me. It’s just a shame it’s wasted on me, a dumb stupid idiot  who can’t even understand basic social mores after eight fucking weeks.
