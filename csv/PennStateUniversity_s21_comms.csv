"How tough is it? - It's about as challenging as any other ABET accredited CMPEN major (Yes, lots of work).

Are the professor's good? - Mixed bag. Some great professors who invest in the students, others who phone it in. Most consider teaching more of a burden (their primary job is research and publishing). I think the dept. is trying to get more dedicated teachers, but they don't pay that well... If you want to do undergrad research the opportunities are excellent.

Are there sufficient resources for students? - Yes, plenty of TAs and office hours. PSU has a lot of tutoring available as well.

Are the students helpful? - Yes, but this also depends on your ability to socialize and connect with other students. Study groups are there if you want them (or just run them yourself...).",1617060093,1,0
"love: size and opportunities, tailgating, alumni network, downtown, any club you could ever want!

hate: Unforgiving freshman year (usually huge first-year classes. 500 pp + so your grades are based on assignments and nothing else with very few extra credit opportunities), greek life exclusivity and mentality, the weather during cold months (big campus means a lot of time outside in the cold walking to class)",1617059898,1,0

COM student here at the Hershey campus/med center! For our campus once students are on site they are able to get vaccinated and they have allotments for us. If you can find a place to get it before you start clinical awesome but if you‚Äôre coming to Hershey in May you‚Äôll be able to get one at that time,1617058501,1,0
"I took it with Shook and that has to be one of the worst classes I have taken so far. She seemed nice but didn‚Äôt know how to teach. Going to office hours helped but TA‚Äôs stopped being helpful half way through the semester. Honestly, if you can, try and take it at a local community college. Unless you got a bunch of friends who will help you with this class, it will be hard. It‚Äôs not worth the pain üò≠",1617058206,1,0
My input would be to avoid taking it with Shook at all costs. I'd rather I had taken it at 8 am on Monday morning than with that dreadful woman.,1617057425,1,0
"You‚Äôre avoiding the counter argument which is that the shots wouldn‚Äôt have gone to waste because there are waitlists for leftover shots. As in they‚Äôre reserved for people in phase 1A who might have missed reserving first and after those people are taken care of, you can get yours. My friend wasn‚Äôt eligible but she added herself to a waitlist and only after someone cancelled their appointment, then she got her shot. You‚Äôre acting like they would have thrown away the shots if you didn‚Äôt get it which isn‚Äôt true. 

Everyone is going to get vaccinated by May. You just have to be patient and wait your turn. If you‚Äôre able to prove that the spots were truly vacant and you were the only one there, then yes, there‚Äôs no problem taking it.",1617056589,1,0
"If those were what the two options are, I would agree with you.  But of course it is not. There was somebody in a thread here today whose aged parents still haven't managed to sign up for a shot locally because they aren't tech-savvy and the spots are being filled by cheaters.",1617056010,1,0
"More people vaccinated = healthier society. Nothing wrong with taking vacant spots.

"PSU itself currently has no vaccines but they are trying to source them, presumably for when we move to 1B. Most places aren‚Äôt checking you qualify in 1A - you just certify online that you do. Places in town that have vaccines (to my knowledge) are Penn State Health, Mount Nittany, CVIM, Rite Aid and CVS. If you go a little out of town there are some places with tons (someone posted an Altoona clinic in here the other day) and they‚Äôre trying to find people.",1617052911,1,0

"I‚Äôm actually intending on majoring in science, though I‚Äôm currently a DUS student since I‚Äôve been out of school for 9 years. Haven‚Äôt decided a specialisation yet (leaning towards Physics, Geology, and Chemistry) so I‚Äôm going to be taking core classes first. Can you recommend the best science classes for me to start with?",1617047797,1,0
"Your logic is ‚Äúthere‚Äôs bad people in the world anyway. What‚Äôs the harm in me being one of them?‚Äù So if other people are polluting and getting away with it, it‚Äôs perfectly fine for me to do it I guess. 

If you mistakenly thought you were in phase 1A and you weren‚Äôt, that‚Äôs understandable but it sounds like you knew you weren‚Äôt eligible yet you still got the shot. There‚Äôs nothing wrong in taking leftover shots that were going to be thrown out anyway, but the point is you weren‚Äôt being transparent. 

There‚Äôs actually waitlists for those leftover shots and even people with health conditions and those who fall under phase 1A still need to wait, so you just just screwed those people over. Just admit to it instead of deflecting and making excuses. My dad has health conditions and he still only got vaccinated today.",1617047172,1,0
"If you can, I would recommend SCM 200H. Prof Barton is hella chill and makes the class so interesting!",1617046706,1,0

"Graduating Microbiology Senior with Advising Experience here: 

It‚Äôs a course designed to see who can ‚Äúmake it‚Äù in Eberly courses. The material is designed to be difficult, a true ‚Äúweed out‚Äù course if you will. 

Most of the professors don‚Äôt actually like teaching the course due to these reasons, and they frequently try to restructure the course for improvement, with little give from the higher curriculum planners. 

Definitely consider this when scheduling other courses and remember the time input for each ‚ÄúEberly Credit‚Äù is about 5 hours per week. With this in mind, BIOL 110 is a 4 credit course, so you should expect to spend 20 hours outside of class EACH WEEK on course.

I remember taking this course as a first semester freshman back in the fall of 2017, and struggling to find a balance between this course, MATH 140, CHEM 110, among other entry level freshman science and general courses. 

As an almost graduate of Eberly, I look back and wish I had spent the time on the course to earn the grade I could have. 

Hindsight really is 20/20",1617043930,1,0
"i‚Äôm an ad major too and i took it last semester with kari lock morgan. i liked her, she goes a little fast during lecture so i had the slides pulled up on my phone too, but i felt like she explained everything well and was always positive and friendly. the guided study groups helped a lot for exam review. my lab was pretty useless tho but that might depend on your TA",1617043103,1,0
"I focused on Chemistry and it is absolutely a Chemistry degree with extra Forensics labs (getting a chemistry minor is a matter of adding two or three extra courses. There were a few crazy students who double majored in FRNSC Chem and FRNSC Bio and double minored in Chem and Bio). Thats why I chose Penn State, to have that second option of painting my degree as almost a Chemistry degree (and it worked out for me since Im not too happy with how the legal system has looked lately). We still don't specialize in a specific area of Forensics and I think we're better off for it, it gives us a much broader background of knowledge and more context of the whole field. Specialization can happen at the job or in Graduate courses. I think the biggest difference is the amount of time we spend in lab, some of my professors said the Forensics majors spent almost double the amount of time in lab than Chem or Bio majors, which translated to me have lots of hands-on experience with instruments like GCMS, HPLC, and Electron Microscopes without doing any undergrad research. I think Chem/Bio and FRNSC degrees definitely overlap in a lot of areas, but they each have their own place, with their own challenges and shortcomings",1617042294,1,0
"I have a BS degree in forensic science. I'm back for my second BS in SRA. I never had luck finding a job in forensics.  You're better off majoring in chemistry. You can still work in forensics with a Chem degree but with a forensics degree, you're limited to forensics.",1617042279,1,0
"BISC 003 was great. The class is super easy, lectures are interesting, and you really get to know your classmates. A lot of the assignments involve going outside and enjoying nature. It's not so much a science class as it is a philosophy class that helps you see the world differently.",1617041770,1,0
"I'm curious as to your opinion... I was a forensic science major back in '05 (not at PSU). At the time, it felt like the program was just all the science classes they had thrown at me and I didn't truly specialize in any one area. I switched my major to chemistry as that intrigued me more than some of the bio stuff and I never really turned back from there.

From the outside and a decade and a half after I was a part of such a program, it looks like you might be just as well off majoring in analytical chemistry and then maybe getting a masters in forensics or even Ph.D. work in forensics. And when I say well off, I mean more in the options that are available to you career wise.  As you said, it seems pretty competitive, but the world needs chemists in areas outside forensics too.  Just curious as to what you think.",1617041582,1,0

"Frankly, any student who has this level of anxious reaction would be better served by visiting their professors‚Äô office hour hours and discussing their concerns one on one in person. First, that time is already booked on your behalf. Second, it saves the ‚Äúuse the Starfish portal‚Äù nonsense by allowing you to schedule a meeting with them and your advisor or find out that your concerns are unfounded, which might help with the anxiety. Third, you can go straight from ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm meeting my own goals in this course‚Äù to a plan for improvement which *sometimes* may include improvements to your submission parameters with concrete, clear deadlines and other advice. Some faculty may not like office hours, but I don‚Äôt know anyone who cares about their teaching and their students who would rather have 15 hours a semester blocked out and only three of them used. Sure, planning 15 and using 30 can cause its own problems, but that‚Äôs for them to decide to change if needed...

In my view, the best first step is to explain that you‚Äôre convinced that your performance has been impacted by factors beyond your control and discuss your best approach to move forward. In particular, doing this before the last week of classes and before feedback goes out and an advisor might require their students to schedule that kind of a meeting will prevent your voice from being lost in a sea of other people‚Äôs problems. There are limits to how accommodating instructors, faculty, etc. can be without a paper trail, so create that evidence before you need it.",1617039791,1,0

Its very hands on, by the time you get to your Junior and Senior year youll be averaging between 20 and 30 hours of lab work a week, on top of your other classes. There are a lot of weed out courses (some say Math 140, Phys 211, O Chem, Forensics 410 just to name a few).

From my personal perspective, it may be worth taking the ACT. Colleges don‚Äôt prefer the SAT over ACT and the ACT was substantially easier for me. According to prepscholar.com, you are virtually guaranteed to get accepted with 24 ACT as long as you have a 3.2 GPA.

- depends on the time of year and how nice out it is. The HUB lawn and lawns in south halls are always packed when it‚Äôs nice out.
- I‚Äôm not sure about Bio majors. I was majoring in biomedical engineering (am currently chemE) and it was great
-I can‚Äôt really give an answer on this one. Try to get a dorm that‚Äôs close to your classes
-yes LEDs are allowed
-wifi is great
-it‚Äôs a big party school, you‚Äôll find partying if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into. You‚Äôll also be fine if you‚Äôre not
-I can‚Äôt testify to this, but i have had female friends say that they never feel unsafe on campus
-people are good with this for the most part. Plenty of people will only wear it over their mouth, some won‚Äôt wear one at all outside. But i imagine this won‚Äôt be an issue for much longer

"Most of the documentation for a part-time job at UP (and any job in the US) involves proving eligibility to work via a form called I-9.  I-9 documentation options can be found [here](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-acceptable-documents).   I am guessing (as I am American) that you will be able to provide proof of identity as your passport and proof of eligibility through documentation issued with your visa. 

The other onboarding process will be about taxes.   As somebody working in the US, you will have to pay income taxes on the money you make at the part time job - some to the US government, some to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and some local taxes.    They will have you do some forms about tax collection and the employer can answer more specific questions about how to fill the forms out.  You will need to 'file' your income taxes next year for any money you earn this year - but there's help available specifically for international students to do that process.  

The last thing commonly done during onboarding is information about how they will pay you.  Almost every job pays via direct deposit - straight to the bank.  But they need to know your bank information to do that.

"1. Cheap and nearby
2. Yep; my experience with a very specific program in my department has made my experience very unique and has heavily influenced my future career directions. However, outside of this specific program in the aerospace department, PSU is quite standard and comparable to any other large state school.

4. PSU is by far the better research institution, at least in my field (engineering). There is no better public school in PA for engineering. Check whether it is strong in your field.

Your not gonna get anything that nice or spacious downtown for that price. The further away you get from downtown the bigger and nicer your apartment becomes. In your case it‚Äôs so far away that it‚Äôs a townhouse (land is significantly cheaper there). In downtown it‚Äôs mainly apartments in large buildings. You could get a house a that‚Äôs like 6 min walking from downtown but most of them aren‚Äôt nice and aren‚Äôt furnished. Personally I live at penn tower and love it. Not a nice place and rents pretty expensive but it‚Äôs almost right at the center of everything. It‚Äôs just a balancing act that you have to figure out.

Negotiate, because as everyone else has mentioned, you have the upper hand.

**The Slacker -** typically someone who doesn't do work or good work, but they don't care if someone does it for them, as long as someone is at least asking them what they want to include so they don't seem to be dismissed from the conversation. While time consuming in order to ""fake incorporate"" their thoughts they don't even want to put in the first place, they're generally one of the non-invasive types of team members since they typically won't argue with anything you put in or change.

**The Learner -** They know what they don't know. They know their quality of work isn't the best and is willing to have their work changed and added to and they understand it's to the benefit of the team and not a personal attack on themselves. They try their best to learn so they aren't performing poorly anymore. They may no longer be categorized as a bad group member later down the road.

**The Ghost -**  Never appears anywhere. 

**The Statue -** They don't want to do any work and they don't feel the need to be incorporated either because they don't care, they're pretty much a ghost except you can see them. In other words, they're like a slacker but less time-consuming.

"UPS in State College is really poorly run. I have unfortunately had a lot of experience dealing with them. First case scenario, I made an Amazon order that was shipped via UPS. It never appeared. Filed a claim. They didn't even really attempt to find out what happened -- they simply paid the vendor to reship, and took the loss.  I had to wait for the new order, but at least didn't lose any money.  If this is a replaceable item, best just to get a refund which should be an option on Amazon. Second case scenario, if you feel you must have this package and there is no substitute, you will be forced to complain multiple times on their 800 customer service number, even when you insist on a supervisor when calling customer service.  This happened on a package sent from home that I could not replace, so I had to keep calling over and over.  It took a lot of time and effort on my part to get this package over multiple days. No progress was made until they finally connected me with a local supervisor. They seem to require multiple complaints before they will really help by connecting you locally.  It's time consuming. The people at the bottom level who answer your call at customer service are in the Philippines and they have no authority.

"In order to be guaranteed accommodation you would have to take a full neuropsychological assessment or have sufficient supporting paperwork documenting your issue/issues and explaining how those issues could form a disability under current (or any, depending upon the time of onset) circumstances. After SDR processes that documentation, you might be entitled to legally-mandated accommodations which would have to be provided without any further discussion of the cause or causes. However, if your professors or instructors are inclined to support their students, they might be able and willing to offer extensions without late penalties, alternative scheduling or make-up assessments, and so on. The caveat is, there are limits to how much they can stretch the policies laid out in the course syllabus, especially if they are teaching one section of a larger coordinated class, without being unfair to other students, and some people believe that students should ‚Äútoughen up‚Äù or something rather than taking into account the different circumstances which might make similar life events more or less challenging for their students to cope with, process, and move past. Self-diagnosis or awareness of possible diagnoses is not sufficient evidence to change the limits of what a ‚Äúfair but reasonable accommodation‚Äù (under that instructor‚Äôs interpretation) might be, whereas any formal diagnosis or related paperwork should be sent to the office of Student Disability Resources rather than negotiated with individual faculty, because SDR would eventually be the ones issuing the legally binding letter to your current (and possibly but not necessarily future) course faculty informing them of the reasonable accommodation (actual legal terminology this time) which you may be entitled to.",1615947105,1,0

Hey! I‚Äôm also an IST major doing 2+2 In Abington so I could help you out. I tried to get out of the 2+2 program early and they gave me some info on how it works. So basically if you decide to go to a satellite campus like Abington you would have to take 4 semesters worth of pre req classes before declaring your major and get the transfer papers ready so that you can move everything to university park. Apparently the process to move everything and declare your major takes around a month and that isn‚Äôt even putting in the time needed to choose where you‚Äôre gonna stay and university park and what classes your gonna choose for your first semester and UP. If you are maintaining a 3.2 GPA you should be good to qualify into UP.

Also it is good to get an idea of how grad school works. If you‚Äôre in sciences- you don‚Äôt typically pay tuition, you are paid a stipend that helps with rent/food. This is exchanged for services as a teaching assistant or research assistant.

"Computer Science is a degree that has enough return on investment to justify 60k of loans, but you'd be doing yourself a big favor if you could cut that number down.

60k will be roughly $700/mo, depending on the interest rate.

"Hi, there. Current honors student, hopefully I can give you some insight.

1. A variety of reasons. Mostly being able to afford PSU more than some of the more prestigious schools. But I also knew that it was somewhere I‚Äôd be happy; my parents are alum and I‚Äôve visited psu dozens of times as a child. 
2. I‚Äôm a freshman currently, so I probably can‚Äôt testify to what it‚Äôs like on campus when it is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. However, i think things are going back to normal next fall. Despite covid and the variety of restrictions, you‚Äôre still able to make friends and have a social life. I think you can probably have a fairly similar experience wherever you go. But i think psu provides a greater capacity to make friends and join clubs (due to its huge size). You also want to consider whether your prefer a city atmosphere or a college town atmosphere.
3. Not at all. PSU is a great school.
4. PSU is bigger, has better school spirit, lots of research opportunities for undergraduate students. I‚Äôm sure this is universal, but PSU is definitely a big party school. You‚Äôll be fine making friends if you don‚Äôt want to get into the partying scene, but you should know that the majority of freshman drink.
5. I would say so, but you have to be proactive about seeking help and scheduling your course load. 
6. I would say so. You get specialized advising, you get priority registration, which essentially guarantees that you get the classes you want, and it looks good on a resum√© (assuming your interviewer is familiar with PSU)

"I will be honest with you, I wouldn't see your comment in the first place. Your instructor might not see it either.  If I remember right, SRTEs only go to faculty this semester. 

Where you report depends on your goal. A dean is likely to forward the message to a department head. The department head is a start. 

This is Reddit, so you are writing informally here. If you send an email about your concern, you will accomplish a lot more if you are objective without extra commentary, etc. I would avoid things like suggesting that administrators pose as a student or your plans of annual competency tests as intriguing as this idea is. 

Department heads get a lot of complaints and take the full context into account. Your perceptions might not be shared by other students (maybe they are). If you feel strongly about this, then that objectivity helps. 

You could also talk to an advisor. They might have heard similar comments before and could have a direct route to the department head.",1617917739,1,0

A hybrid or endurance bike is the way to go. They'll have a comfortable geometry, and all the mounting points for things that you might want i.e. racks/baskets.

&gt;I know some types make it easier to go up hills so I‚Äôd like recommendations for that too. 

All bikes will go up a hill, gearing and weight make some slightly easier. Unless you're referring to an e-bike, which has a small electric motor that will help. They are pricey.

&gt;Brands? 

Anything from the major companies will be fine. Giant, Trek, Specialized, Cannondale, Fuji, Kona, Surly.

&gt;Other general things to keep in mind? Bike lock recommendations?

A bunch of stuff:

1) Get a correctly fitting helmet. You'll be happy you did the first time you headbutt the road after coming off.

2) You'll need pumps. A hand pump for your bag, and a floor pump for a home.

3) You should get front and rear lights.

4) Commuting with a backpack isn't super comfy, you might want a rack and panniers.

5) Depending on the length of your commute, you might want exercise/cycling clothes so you don't sweat up your regular stuff.

"1.  I went because I loved the campus and they‚Äôre reasonably well reputed for my program (Civil Engineering). I could do a music minor and study engineering at the same time.

"It sounds like this is new from what I know. Previously NSO was required (with some exceptions of course) before you were allowed to schedule.

 If you're confident in what you're doing, scheduling early can certainly give you a good leg up, but in the sense of first year class timings and professor choices (use rate my professors, but of course with a grain of salt). Not with respect to necessarily picking the specific courses you want. I'd you're a freshman, the entry level major courses you will take are likely quite abundant.

I will admit, I think most people go into NSO thinking they know what they want to take and actually don't really get it. Then again, once you ""get it"" it's not hard to figure out what classes to take.

Scheduling is open based on how many credits you have. All the ""good"" gen eds are generally taken already by the time you schedule as a freshman and even a sophomore.

"(I am speaking personally and not on behalf of any other entity)

It is perfectly fine to be frustrated with a course or professor. Some of your classmates might agree with you. Taking your concerns at face value, they seem like valid concerns. None of what I say here is meant to be snarky or to invalidate your feelings. To my knowledge, there is no way to connect your SRTE to you (I could be wrong). It's also not all that unique in terms of angry comments that we sometimes get. 

Knowing nothing about the course or the instructor, I think that it's important to bring up that grading is a small part of a course and having an LA do that type of work is often the point of the LA. It can take me hours to write quizzes, particularly when I decide to put a line from a Drake song in each question. Grading does not take nearly as much time. The instructor might also have other responsibilities or just generally forgetful. I have had TAs email me to remind me to do things. 

Spending class time criticizing colleagues does not seem conducive to learning or professional, but I am not sure of the context. That is certainly something worth noting in an SRTE--that you found it off-putting. If you really feel like it is an issue that merits someone seeing it, there are likely better channels than SRTEs. 

I am not entirely sure what you intend to accomplish with those comments. Assuming the professor sees them, which they might not, then they probably are not going to change anything because they will assume you are angry about other things. In the past, I viewed my angriest SRTE comments as having little to do with my teaching. I have no problem with critical reviews (I have an entire syllabus page dedicated to going through negative comments and acknowledging my weaknesses). In the first couple of semesters of teaching, those emotional comments are super hurtful. Then you develop a tough skin.  

A better review might be something like, ""It was hard to determine the professor's role in the course because I felt uncomfortable with the work she delegated to the learning assistant. Even if the LA does most of the grading, it might be helpful for the instructor to better communicate the LA's role in the course at the start of the semester. Some people might be comfortable with this level of LA involvement, but others will not. I also felt uncomfortable when she made disparaging comments about her colleagues. For example, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. I found it distracting and unprofessional, and I might take courses with those people. I would rather not go into those courses with a negative opinion. Also, kudos to Samuel. He deserves some recommendation for his work in the course. It is obvious that the professor delegates a lot of responsibility, and he seemed like a fair grader."" 

If I read that comment, I would reflect some. If I read your comment as written, I would assume you are angry more generally (even if that is not true) and that I am just a target of that. I might also assume you weren't satisfied with your grade, even if I'm completely wrong on that.  I would also wonder how you knew anything about my significant other's genitalia. 

Samuel might ask for these responsibilities. I had TAs once who asked me if I would let them handle of the lab material and topics (with my approval) because they wanted something on their vita. So the professor might be doing Samuel a solid. If Samuel is an undergrad who plans to go to graduate or professional school, the professor is going to be able to write a great letter.  I am on a scholarship committee right now and almost all of the applicants are learning assistants. I am impressed with what they have done and how much responsibility they were trusted with. 

Samuel also might have signed up for this, generally. If Samuel took the course, then there is probably no surprise that these are the expectations. You would expect them if you were the LA now that you took the course. As long as there is an understanding of the work required, I do not see the problem (without more context).",1617889658,1,0

I don't remember if you're allowed to schedule before or not, if you were, I didn't do it because they made me seemed scared I was going to take the wrong classes without the help of an advisor or something so I just waited, especially since it was my first semester ever.

Teaching duties and responding to undergraduate questions sometimes takes a backseat, like when I have to send three emails to get one response.",1617838571,2,0
"In that case... Faculty will be hit or miss at any major research university. They get hired for their ability to write papers, produce patents, or craft business partnerships, not for their capacity as instructors. It's difficult for me to judge teaching capability during a pandemic, but most professors I've dealt with here seem to be reasonable human beings with a certain degree of flexibility and less pedagogical training than would be ideal. Introductory teachers are more likely to be dedicated teaching professors with actual training, but they're also more likely to be inflexible because of the sheer size of the classes they work with.",1617837838,2,0

"This is of course all my opinion. It's generally a lot easier to pick up general programming skills and knowledge about specific technologies on the job. No one cares if you don't know git or mercurial or whatever coming in. CMPSCI and Math fundamentals are a lot easier to learn initially in a school environment for many people. Working in data science your work will involve a lot of statistical modeling, and it's better to have a really good understanding of that.",1617835938,1,0

How was the class overall? I'm looking to take this course next year but the fact that I might need to walk to Hammond every time I need to work puts me off. Would you recommend having a computer that can run Solidworks?,1617834063,1,0
"I bet you can find someone at literally every single university in the country who can say something similar. Like where I went to college, one of the math professors used to force me to mow his yard once a week. He also once stole my keys from me. He was my dad, but still...

So, you will probably find lots of people who have had one or more bad experiences. Even here, oddly enough. If you looked at my RateMyProfessor profile, you would see that some students think I'm awesome (they are the correct ones). Some think I'm absolutely awful (they have me mistaken with someone else, clearly). Only the latter group gets an entire page dedicated to them in my syllabus.

I can assure you that there is no widescale ""people are more rude at this university than other ones"" thing going on. An exception might be some smaller niche universities where their entire model is placating students because their budget is dependent on every single one of those students sticking around. Even there, you will probably find people who are unsatisfied with the personal service. **Edit:** This isn't me being facetious; I'm talking about a specific model that does not work without a small student body and large endowments. 

If every one of my students wanted one-on-one attention, that would not be possible. It's not me being ""not helpful"" as much as being but one person. You might get more of that kind of stuff at a smaller university, but you would also get that in specific departments. I know people in the humanities who make it a point to meet each and every one of their students in some capacity. Class sizes differ (they are also more social than I am).

Really, just select the right econ professor, and you'll be good.

I'm too old to answer the other question. That probably depends on what you want to do for fun. I think it is fun *because* it is in the middle of nowhere. I like to hike and to spend less than $50 for an entr√©e.  There are plenty of places to socialize. Full disclosure, I've lived here for over a decade and have yet to visit Philadelphia, New York, D.C., or Baltimore. I did go to Johnstown once.

"Nope, you‚Äôre going to be stuck at Erie or some other PSU campus until entry to major is done. You can certainly shorten the timeline by transferring credits. 

Not to mention (and solely noting on what was written), it sounds like there needs to be a quick google search on PSU Erie and Muslim. If it were done, I‚Äôm pretty sure the Muslim Student Association at Behrend would be among the first results.

Nowadays, there‚Äôs a lot of public schools that only have small, explicitly religious facilities anymore, if any. If there are, they mostly function more of a social, rather than religious meeting space. So it‚Äôs not specifically against her, but rather, the going trend. Pasquerilla is one of the biggest student spiritual facilities I know of in the country and it only is so because of donors. Even then, it is still largely nondenominational. Chances are that at best, there‚Äôs probably a prayer room in Reed, if your sister doesn‚Äôt want to use Smith Chapel. 

And about the roommate situation, it really is a tough cookie situation as there‚Äôs not enough Muslims going to Erie, unless your parents rent a place for her off campus and list it as their address, so she can live off campus her freshman year (although it solves the food problem). That or she‚Äôll have to look at the incoming class Facebook group.",1617833193,1,0
"Hang in there. Speaking from experience, when I did my first undergrad, I felt like you do and we didn't have Covid. I lost motivation and didn't apply myself. I graduated...barely. I never got a job in my field and have spent the past ten years working a job I hate. It pays the bills, but I have a maximum amount of loans from my first degree that I never used and will never use. Life was a slap to the face and I ended up back in school. This time around, I'm doing a lot better and have a very high GPA. I've networked and applied myself and am starting work before graduating...in my field. 

Find motivation, remind yourself why you're doing this, push through the exhaustion and know it'll be worth it. You can do this! I work full-time, raise my kid on my own, and go to school. My hours are typically 80 hours per week between all of this. I wish we had spring break more than anything if nothing else, I could've caught up on some sleep.

"I think the sentiment of this poster comes from a local. There is always a little tension between the students and the locals. Students come from a walks of life and different parts of the world, and some are rich and some are poor. The state college area itself is not that diverse, outside of the state college proper area. So there is a some ‚Äúsmall town mentality‚Äù. I grew up in a small college town and have lived in state college in and off for the better part of a decade and get some small town vibes here. With any where you go, there is good and bad. Don‚Äôt like the Greek scene? Then ignore it, but it does have a big presence here. Better yet, if you want to try something new, then join a club and get involved. I enjoy the outdoors and there is plenty of hiking trails and places to mountain bike.
