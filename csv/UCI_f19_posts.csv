Financial aid,"So today I got a ""final notice"" from UCI financial aid telling me that I need to turn in a document that they asked for me in the beginning of the month but they didn't notify me about it at all.

And within the document it says it was due a week ago. Will this affect my financial aid at all if I turn it in next week? Pretty annoyed that they didnt notify me :/",1571463613,0,0

Business Economics FAQ,"Hey everyone!

We're the Undergraduate Business Association, a general business club open to all majors. Lately we've received a lot of questions about business econ, and seen quite a few on this sub too. We decided to compile some of the most frequently asked questions for future reference, since it can be surprisingly difficult to get a thorough answer for some of these. Let's get into it:

**What is the difference between business admin and business econ?**

Business econ (BE) has a much higher emphasis on economics than business admin (BA), and can generally be described as straight economics with a couple business topics mixed in. The BE coursework is about 75% econ and 25% business, while obviously the BA requirements are pretty much exclusively business courses. BE is slightly more math heavy and the general consensus is that it can be a little bit harder than BA, but it's still not too bad for most people. Also, BE is **not** technically part of the business school, and actually falls under the school of social sciences (important for major restrictions and academic advising).

**Should I transfer into business econ or business admin?**

BA is usually everyone's first choice, while BE is the backup. However, less than 10 people per *year* successfully transfer into BA, while BE is relatively easy to get. It is worth noting though that yes, **BE is a valid alternative for BA**, even if it is significantly different. We'll get into that in the next question.

**Does being a business econ major instead of a business admin major affect my career choices?**

For the most part, no. Job outcomes are about the same, most employers don't know the difference between the two majors or don't really care either way. You might get asked why you didn't ""choose"" business admin (even though that's usually everyone's first choice), but as long as you give a good answer about how you really enjoy the econ side of the business world you'll do fine. Either way though, internships are really important as both BA and BE majors in order to start a successful career after college.

**Will I still be able to network as a business econ major?**

Yes. You'll still be welcome in most if not all of the business organizations on campus, which is a great way to network and experience more about what the business world is. 

**Should I get a Merage school minor as a business econ major? I.e. management, accounting, or entrepreneurship**

It's a good idea. What most people don't know is that you don't actually have to apply for the minor in order to graduate with it; if you took the required classes then you get it regardless. Most of the time there are still some spots open when major restrictions lift on a business school class (also, upper div management courses that are online do not have major restrictions to begin with), so it's entirely possible to do. There's a lot of overlap in BE and BA minor classes as well, just make sure to take the business versions of courses whenever you can since often they fill requirements for both BE and the business minors (for example, MGMT 30A fills the accounting requirement for both while the econ version does not)

Got more questions, or have something to add? Let us know in the comments! We'd be happy to give you personalized help at our meetings as well, or contact us via the info in our profile.

Do you support Andrew Yang in the 2020 election? Want to volunteer on-campus to spread the campaign? Come join the Yang Gang at UCI and help us secure a $1000/month UBI for every American (details inside!),"[SIGN UP HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRBAmgd-q3UjLwNgia26IbZFDsFDVw49Y1B804PBiguK0T9Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Hey Anteaters, I‚Äôm starting a Yang Gang at UCI in collaboration with the Orange County Yang Gang and we‚Äôre looking for motivated students who want to spread the Yang 2020 campaign on campus. Our primary activities will include: tabling, canvassing, fundraising, registering voters, and posting flyers. If you‚Äôre in the Yang Gang already I shouldn‚Äôt need to convince you any further, so sign up now and we‚Äôll send you more details shortly. DM me if you want to be extra-involved and help run the club, because we definitely need people like you! (also don‚Äôt forget to join /r/YangforPresidentHQ)

Never heard of Andrew Yang? Put simply, he‚Äôs the Asian man running for president who wants to give every American adult $1000 a month. It sounds almost too good to be true, but it‚Äôs surprisingly the best solution to eliminate poverty and prepare Americans for the future as automation &amp; globalization ramp up. He is competing for the Democratic nomination in a highly-contested primary race, and is currently between 4th-6th place depending on what metrics you look at. His 21st-century platform consists of over 100 policies, including:

* The ‚ÄúFreedom Dividend‚Äù: universal basic income of $1000/month for every American adult
* Medicare-for-All
* Student loan debt forgiveness
* Federal legalization of marijuana https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1170048318686318593
* Combating climate change
* Giving people property rights over their data
* Reducing cost of higher education
* Eliminating private prisons and reducing mass incarceration
* Much, much more at [https://www.yang2020.com/policies/](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/)

If that piqued your interest, sign up today or stop by the Yang 2020 booth on Ring Road on Thursday, October 17 to find out more. In the meantime, no one can convince you better than Andrew Yang himself, so listen to the first few minutes of his [Joe Rogan appearance](https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8) and hear why you deserve $1000 a month. Feel free to ask any questions below and I‚Äôll be happy to answer them, whether it‚Äôs about the club or Yang‚Äôs policies ;)

Welcome to Incoming Freshmen and Transfers to UCI! Step 7: Searching /r/UCI,"One of the most useful things to learn about /r/UCI is to look for prior posts that have the same information you are looking for. If using a computer to open Reddit, you will have a search bar at the top of the screen that says ‚Äúsearch /r/UCI‚Äù just click there and type a general term for your search such as: parking

If you are using your phone and a web browser, you have on the upper right corner the icon of a magnifying glass to access the search bar.

Or if you install the Reddit app, on the top of the page you will see the icon of a magnifying glass followed by r/UCI.

Question about COM to CGS,"Hi, I‚Äôm a second year U/U student, and I hope to get into CGS. I‚Äôm currently taking ICS 32 this fall quarter, which i feel blessed to have gotten into, but I‚Äôm worried about a particular requirement for CGS. My Math 2A grade is fine, but I fucked up Math 2B pretty bad, and ended up with a C-. The CGS requirement states that you need a C or above after taking in Math 2A,2B,6B, OR 6D. Did I fuck myself taking 2B when it was technically optional for COM? Or is it possible that they won‚Äôt count the C- for my Math 2B? I planned on retaking it next quarter, but I‚Äôm not sure how long it takes grades to come out, and I have to change majors by spring quarter I believe. I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt be able to change majors by then because I either fuck up Math 2B again or the grade won‚Äôt appear until later on. I really hope that they‚Äôll ignore the C- part for Math 2B since Math 2A is sufficient but if not then that is a big :-(",1572474645,0,0

"Leaving and Joining MAE projects in the middle of the year (Dropping and then Volunteering?) Has anyone tried this, and any good advice for a new project?","So pretty much I joined a new project this school year, it didn't pan out to anything I expected it to be, there's no design work available so not only is it boring but I'm getting grilled every check in for not having any actual design work completed.                    

The nail in the coffin right now is that my 2 design team groupmates pretty much never correspond to any of my messages and its getting kind of old after 4 weeks of barely being able to plan anything. I ask for available times and they obviously put only hours they'd like, and then even do a switcharoo on those times.  Take days to answer messages, asking if they can put files on the drive takes  way too long.... etc.                  

**So my first question is what luck have you guys had with getting the Dean's approval to drop MAE 189**                 

**The second is, what projects do you recommend, that :**

I can join in the middle of the year (maybe start rolling in integrating into the team this quarter). 

Give you more opportunities to be part of the design decisions of the team (rather than just a few people making decisions about design, concepts, and specifications) and giving you busy tasks may or may not be of any use and that would get you grilled every single check in by Walter  (kind of a huge plus). Anything with lots of open dialogue

 It would also be nice if there was more freedom to fail, (benefit)

You don't have to sign up for MAE 189 (optional) 

 I know that was contradictory with getting work that doesn't get you fucked in check ins, but I like the idea of actually being part of the decision making process and having more freedom to fail on something and maybe be able to explore new fields of study more (ME/AE but interested in some embedded/computer architecture stuff for example). I'm not saying this as an exact need, but an offchance benefit                

I'm interested in a lot of topics within ME/AE. This list is kind of based on my experiences on a few projects I've been on.....",1572336747,1,0

ICS 45C Thornton Project 3 Question,Yo I'm confused about one thing. The project says that a HashMap should be initialized to use a default hash function. Why is that the case ? I understand he wants all HashMap objects built with the default constructor to use a default hash function that we write. He also wants another constructor that makes a HashMap that uses a particular hash function. How are keys supposed to be hashed by a member variable function if the HashMap is initialized with no keys/values. HashMaps are initialized with some HashFunction and also 10 Node pointers that each point to nullptr. Shouldn't a hash function be used when you add keys to the HashMap so it should be a part of the add function? How/when do you access the HashFunction that is part of the HashMap object? I'm just confused about how we are supposed to use a HashFunction that is part of an initialized object rather than just a member function part of the class. I feel dumb idk.,1574576605,1,0

Strange man in and around UCI,"**PSA**\- I and two girls that I know were stopped by the same man in/around UCI on different occasions. We were asked questions by this man, he would not leave or stop talking to any of us. We believe he hangs around UTC and UCI a lot waiting for people to walk by to talk to; these events occurred in a span of two days.

One of us was stopped on ring road around 5pm, One of us on the bridge to UTC around 930pm, and another in UTC around 8pm.

Physical Description- black rectangular glasses, black nike hat, black jacket, dark blue jeans, olive to white skin, about 5'11 and early 20s

All of us were initially approached by this man by being asked what our ancestry was, then followed up with questions about Anthropology, Social Media, and were asked about our majors, and if we were single.

He told me his name was Adam, and when asking for my number I saw that there were less than 5 contacts in his phone, one of them being named 'Chicken'.

I know this may not seem like a big deal but oftentimes, sex traffickers will approach women and ask seemingly innocent questions in order to make them less afraid of them. He did not want to let any of us go, and stopped all of us when we were looking down, wearing headphones, and most importantly, walking alone.

Do people actually cheat off of others on exams?,"So... I had a midterm a few days ago, and I couldn't help but notice how the person a seat away from me was constantly looking in my direction. They even used the writing tablet that was on their left rather than the one on the right, which was attached to their chair, which provided them with the perfect view of my exam booklet. (They were not left handed either.) 

The midterm was open book and open notes. A little less than halfway into the exam, I noticed how this person was spending a great amount of their time flipping through their notebook filled with their class notes and looking at their notes. They would write only when I began writing. At one point I looked directly at their direction, and they stopped flipping and looking through their notebook and began writing. 

After I had answered every question and checked my answers, I closed my test booklet and turned my exam in; the person next to me also closed theirs at the same time and did the same.  

Do people actually cheat off of others on exams?

Taking a big L,"Hi all,

So I know for a FACT that I will fail Bio 93 this quarter. I just had a hard time adjusting to college as a freshman. I‚Äôve worked on my mental health and quit my job recently which has made things much easier, but it‚Äôs too late in the quarter to make a difference.

I‚Äôve been doing the bare minimum for this class, and I take full responsibility if I don‚Äôt pass. But it‚Äôs discouraging to say the least. Im a Bio major, and I‚Äôm failing my first Bio class. I love Bio, but I feel like switching majors now. 

I‚Äôm definitely going to retake this class next quarter, but that will put me a step back, so I don‚Äôt even know anymore. 

Mostly I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm never going to bounce back from this and my GPA will be in shambles. I know that the first quarter is rough for everyone, but I never thought I‚Äôd straight up fail a class.

Is it detrimental to work in different fields that may not be what career you are aiming for?,"I always thought just gaining experience is good, but if you‚Äôre aiming for something specific like for me I want to do something in the health field, would it be better for me to try and look for an on campus job dealing with science stuff rather than working under UCI dining?

got fucked by School of Bio Sci,"So I was put on an Academic Hold during the summer because I was unable to complete the CHEM51 series. I got an email saying I had to pass the series (including the labs) during both summer sessions or else I had to be forced to switch my major by Sept. 16th or else my Fall 2019 courses will be dropped. Either that or I had to withdraw from UCI, which is fucking stupid. 

Anyway, I worked my ass off during the summer and passed 51B, 51C, and 51LC. (Definitely don't recommend anyone to do it because learning two o.chem courses in five weeks each isn't fun lmao)

My official, passing grades were up on Sept. 19th but by then my classes dropped, including BIO100, a prerequisite to literally all of my upper divs. Basically, I can't finish my degree unless I get the class. The class has no waitlist and it is IMPOSSIBLE to find an open spot. I went to the BioSci counselors yesterday and they were SO HELPFUL when they basically told me to fuck off and keep checking WebReg. 

I get that they can't help every student and that they can't do anything with the WebReg system, but that's literally the last thing I wanted to hear and I'm so fucking tired of dealing with their shit I'm sorry. I made it this far into my upcoming senior year and I've jumped through their hoops with dealing with two back-to-back o.chem courses (and lab) during both summer sessions and I really can't deal with having 0 units right now.   


My plan rn to to see the BIO100 professor on the first day of class to see what they can do, but aside from that I'm really at a loss of what I can do. If anyone has any insight at all I'd really appreciate it :(",1569341187,100,0

Douglas' no technology rule,"I got an iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil to use this year. My plan is to go paperless if it helps the environment even a little bit.

Even textbooks.

I'm taking Anthro 41A with Douglas, and I read through the syllabus which states ""Laptops, net-books and the use of any other wireless devices are NOT permitted in either the lecture or discussion section."" Exceptions are only accommodated if authorized by the student disabilities office.

I do think this is unfair to people like me who are trying to conserve. I don't want to go out and buy paper and other tools to accompany this one class that I really want to keep when I already have these tools on my iPad.

As a senior Bio major I have the option of taking Math 2B/5B. I am very bad at Calculus, I had to retake Math 2A. I have heard that math 5 series is easier compared to the 2 series.

I know that Pluta is well recommended by many students for math 2b but the class have a common final which sucks for all. Qing Nie has bad ratings on rate my professor for math 2D, it is his first time teaching 5B I believe.

ICS 33 is v depressing :(,"I am taking 33 this quarter and it honestly has been going well until literally the last week after the third in lab which the professor just added this quarter. grades recently came out, and I got the partial points, and he added 5.7 normalization points, which was very nice of him and i really appreciate his thoughtfulness. then i checked my grade and calculated it. turns out i needed only THREE more points to get that 72.5% avg for in lab exams :') the students' ability in this class is just very skewed. seeing the grade distribution for the 3rd in lab, my takeaway is that 50% of the class are geniuses and 50% are just the normal students. so 50% of the class are stable and the other 50% is just close to or bound to fail. comparing it to the first n second in labs (which almost everyone did well), the high number of kids who didnt do well for third in lab shows that this in lab was waaay harder than usual, it would've been more fair if he provided like 6 different questions and give us options (which alfaro did for the midterm n final). i also think it's unfair for kids taking it this quarter when this new in lab is added. im sure many kids wouldn't be failing atm if there were only the first n second in labs. all this new exam did was just make it HARDER for avg students to pass the class. :( i honestly think 5.7 points isnt enough for many of us, and it would've been better to at least drop the lowest in lab like other instructors did. its just that knowing you're failing right on the last week of the quarter is extremely devastating and all these 9 weeks was just me with this false idea that im doing well... and then week 10 i just turn into trash in the blink of an eye. the finish line is literally right in front of me... 

idk... i‚Äôve just been really really really really sad these past few days... :(",1575627826,1,0

I've been constantly crying in the bathroom almost every day since its the only place I don't really feel judged. I was expecting to get out of my comfort zone when I first arrived, but I've been feeling a lot worse. I'm not really sure what I want to do major-related either so I really feel like there's not really a drive to keep pushing me forward. I'm kinda in a dark hole right now just counting until the day is over for the next day to repeat. I'm getting scared that I'm losing myself. Everything feels so suffocating. I want to give up.

Will an F raise a flag for the dean, like will they kick me out for getting an actual F or will they still let me retake ics33 without question (until I (hopefully not) fail it again)?

Status of Klefstad‚Äôs CS 122B,"Hello everybody, I'm one of the people helping with this quarters CS 122B class. I was also involved in the process of remaking the class over summer after I took it last spring with Professor Klefstad.
‚Äã
The class got a large amount of complaints last quarter and at the end some students and I volunteered to work over summer to help fix a lot of the problems.
‚Äã
I wanted to give an update to how the class is now for anyone thinking of taking it next quarter or at any future offerings.
‚Äã
If you guys have any questions feel free to leave a question and I can get back to you.
‚Äã
# Updates
‚Äã
### Homework
**Last Quarter:** The homework documentation went through a large amount of changes after they were assigned. On top of this some homework assignments gave too many tasks.
‚Äã
**Fix:** We updated all the homework documentation, removing contradictions and errors, and have since remove some of the tasks to make them more simple and manageable.
‚Äã
### Test Cases
**Last Quarter:** The test cases where either given right before the assignments were due or not at all. Usually when the test cases came out there where still problems with the test cases themselves. This also came with the tests being run on Postman making them very difficult to read or create new tests.
‚Äã
**Fix:** We created a Test Suite that contains all the tests. All the test cases are JUnit tests and can be run against the homework assignments easily. It also JUnit so its much easier to read and work with than Postman.
This quarter the tests were not provided at the very start, but the current plan is to release all the complete Test Suite at the start of the class.
‚Äã
### Grading
**Last Quarter:** The grading changed during the quarter in order to help students, this included increasing deadlines, and added additional regrades. During the regular grading schedule we had to request for regrades when problems where coming up with fail compilations or simple mistakes in our code.
‚Äã
**Fix:** Besides the creation of the Test Suite to ensure better scores we are also creating a Testing Service that you can call to grade your current assignment at any time before the deadline and will give you your score and you can request as many grade requests as you want before the deadline. This change is tentative at the moment as it is still being proceed and should be ready by next quarter. We also added a fixed date for all homeworks to be regraded so students don't need to worry about requesting them.
‚Äã
### FrontEnd
**Last Quarter:** The FrontEnd last quarter was made in JavaScript, and was a lot to work in in the week we had to complete the FrontEnd.
‚Äã
**Change:** More of a change that an actual fix is now the FrontEnd is done in React, and comes with starter code to help the start of the assignment.",1575601813,1,0

Fall 2020 Transfer,"Hello everyone!

It‚Äôs 1am in the morning as I am writing post because I‚Äôve been so stressed out and sad ever since I turned in my UC applications. I am a third year CC student and I applied to UCI, majoring in Biomedical Engineering so I just want to ask for advices/tips as well as the chance of me getting accepted. I currently have a UC transferable GPA of 3.49 so I think Im qualified for TAG? I also was an engineering intern at a medical company so i don‚Äôt know if that will increase my chance of getting accepted or not. The main reason why I‚Äôm stressed out is because I heard BME is quite competitive and Im fear for my life that my GPA will drop below a 3.4 (bc of physics and calc) by spring quarter. Another thing is that I have like 125 quarter units so I don‚Äôt know if that will ruin my chance or not. I don‚Äôt know if this might increase my chance of getting accepted but I wrote a pretty solid UC essay.

I was wondering if Humanities Core (currently 1A/1AS) had a curve associated with the grades I'll get for both courses. My seminar leader did not post a clear-cut syllabus on where grade cutoffs were, so is it correct to assume that an

 A/A+ is from 100\~92ish, 

A- is from 92-90ish

B+ is from 89-87ish, and so forth?

Because I believe I am hovering around the 89-91 range (on both 1A and 1AS) so I was hoping on finding out whether I'd have a chance of getting an A- in ""both"" courses.

How bad is Burley? People I know really did not like her class and recommend against taking her. 

So ultimately, it seems like in comparison between Burley vs. Hughes, Hughes seems to be the better option. Can someone comment on this? Which professor do you guys recommend?

Financial Aid for Graduate School,"Regarding financial aid for graduate students, i did some research and I found out that we do get financial aid. 

However, im a little confused on the max terms listed on our OFAS. I plan to take another year for my undergrad, so this will result in me having 0 Institutional Aid, but still 3 terms of Federal aid. After I looked at my Aid Reward, what exactly is the Institutional Aid. I understand its the Aid the school gives me, but I only receive Pell Grants and Cal Grant. Which,  as far I been told, arent school grants. 

So, am I missing out if I do take the extra year and I bring my Inst. Aid to 0? Will this affect me when i apply to graduate school at UCI?",1577566175,1,0

**I found a lost item. How should I report it and how much information am I allowed to give?**

State the item that was lost, where and approximately what time you found it, and whether or not it was returned to a lost and found location (e.g. UCIPD). Avoid mentioning specific details of the lost item so the person who lost it can state identifying details to confirm their ownership of the item.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is my schedule doable?**

We can't exactly say what's best for you, but you can consider a couple things: Generally speaking, GEs will be easier than Math/Science/CS courses. 8 am classes are going to be tougher on you than late 5pm+ classes, while approximately noontime is generally the sweet spot. Taking around 3-4 classes (12-18 units) is a good amount and while taking more classes is manageable, it will very likely be tough. If you are very used to studying and high workloads and want to get your credits ASAP, then go for it. Remember that since we're on a quarter systems, classes go by very quickly.

UCI Test Kitchen Recipes #6: Root Beer Floats and Ice Cream Sodas (Brandywine/Dessert),"The dining halls at UCI try their best to appeal to a lot of different  tastes and appetites with their food choices, but sometimes you want  something more filling or satisfying, but don't want to go to UTC or  another place to get food. UCI Test Kitchen serves to help that problem,  creating new food ideas with ingredients found throughout the dining  hall stations.

For this edition of UCI Test Kitchen, we'll be kicking off the weekend with ice cream sodas, including the beloved root beer float!

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

2-3 scoops of vanilla ice cream (use chocolate for the ice cream soda variant; Honeycakes station)

1/2 glass of root beer (root beer float; any soda fountain with a touchscreen)

1/4 glass sparkling water (ice cream soda; any soda fountain with a touchscreen)

1/4 glass milk (ice cream soda; various)

1/4 glass chocolate milk (ice cream soda; various)

Whipped cream (optional; Second Breakfast station)

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:**

1a.) If making an ice cream soda, fill the glass about halfway with a mixture of sparkling water, milk, and chocolate milk, then mix until foamy

1b.) If making a root beer float, simply fill a glass halfway with root beer (with an optional added flavor of vanilla)

2.) Carefully transfer the ice cream from the bowl into the glass

3.) Top with whipped cream and any other toppings

&amp;#x200B;

Most everyone has had (and loves) root beer floats, but not as many people know of its lesser tasted version, the chocolate ice cream soda (pictured here). Both have their own signature flavor profile, so try out both with different toppings and soda-to-ice cream ratios and see which one you like best! Enjoy!

*\*Note: Some ingredients depend on what options the dining hall puts out for the day, so some parts of the recipes may not be readily available for  every time of day. Most recipes/locations are based off of Brandywine's stations.*
