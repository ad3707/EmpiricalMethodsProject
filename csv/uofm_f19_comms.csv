"&gt; I've been trying to figure out how we can change this. It's a tricky problem to solve - what nebulous actions can you take to change the *culture* of a school? To make people *feel* that chemistry you wanted? 

The obvious (and unfortunate) answer is that a small group of people can't change a culture of 13,000 engineering students. It takes a large number of people to produce large-scale results. From a university standpoint, the most effective thing to do would be to start replacing professors that don't have passion or interest (Mudge, Kuipers, Durfee) and replacing them with people that do (DeOrio, Guzdial, Yarger.) But the university is already short-staffed and the bad professors are tenured, so it's pretty clear that's not going to happen.

On a club-specific level, I think getting people participating is the most important step (which it sounds like you're already doing.) Speaking from personal experience on how a good culture is created, I ended up becoming far, FAR more invested in the Michigan Climbing Club than WolverineSoft during my degree, and a big reason for that was our president during my first year. He was super outgoing, super approachable, consistently put himself on the carpool to drive people out to the climbing gym, and he had excellent endurance so he was always among the first people in and last out. Everybody knew him, everybody liked him, and everyone felt comfortable around him. In my time at Michigan, I never met anyone in WolverineSoft with the same level of charisma. One of them was so bad I had to kill him in a rap battle.",1570407355,0,0

"One further question you might want to consider is if game dev is something you want to do as a *hobby* or as a *career*. Game dev does not have the best reputation for working hours, conditions, pay or job stability - you give up a lot to work on games instead of on increasing ad clickthrough rates.

If you want to leave the latter open, a CS degree at UofM instead of a game degree elsewhere would be a good choice. (And increasing ad clickthrough rates is *really* lucrative - [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) puts entry level Google comp at $182,000)",1570407078,1,0
"Because again, it doesn't insinuate that one race is inferior to another. Can it be offensive? Yeah. But offensive =/= racist",1570406965,0,0
"I've only been to my community college and U-M, so I can't tell you anything super specific, but you might want to give a game dev degree more serious consideration. As a first-year student I thought it would be a good idea to have a more generalized education, and perhaps this is what employers want, but looking back afterward, I realized my CS degree didn't teach me very much, and most of what I do know isn't even that practical. I really, really wish I had majored in something more specific.

The ""nuts and bolts"" of CS ends up diving deep into classifications of  problems and quantifying how hard they are to solve, or if they're possible to solve at all. The first few core classes at U-M hold your feet to the fire as far as writing efficient code, but past EECS 281, no one cares how slow or inefficient your program is, no human will ever look at your code, and no one teaches you intuition about design patterns or how to organize a data structure given a problem. Racing to get a passable autograder score often leads to a pitfall where it's in your best interest to work on your spaghetti code rather than rewrite it, so you might never actually take the time to write a program WELL. And that's if you're writing code at all - many of your upper level electives are so conceptually heavy that you write little to no code anyway.

This is just the way things were at U-M, but I have talked with other people from different universities and this seems to be a common struggle everywhere.",1570405699,1,0

You probably won’t be able to finish the exam in time, but don’t let that stress you. The curve works heavily in your favor. It’s not a test that’s designed to be finished by most people.

Keep in mind that grading scales don’t necessarily stay the same year to year, but I highly doubt there was any dramatic change.

"As a current officer, I'd be remissed if I didn't mention that WolverineSoft actually has been improving this semester. I think you identify exactly the problems the club has had in the past, and those are also exactly the problems we've been trying to solve so far. Our design talks this semester have been almost wholly centered around discussion and interactivity, and we've organized a pretty neat project initiative for those who want to actually work on games. So far there's been good feedback and I hope we can continue to be more engaging than we were in semesters past.

On the other hand, you're correct I think. Michigan game development is geared almost exclusively towards bringing beginner developers up from nothing into experience with a very specific engine and then making a project in it. It checks a lot of boxes for industry hot topics but doesn't necessarily *make* you a versatile game dev - that is still something you have to figure out for yourself.

I think this extends beyond game development, to be frank. Michigan is seriously lacking in a culture of makers and doers creating new projects just because they have a reason to exist. Instead a lot of things are framed as precursors to working in industry or in research. To that end, I think we do a pretty good job in CS in general in giving people a lot of valuable knowledge, but it is still a weakness that we don't have very many individuals flexing their creativity across the board.

I've been trying to figure out how we can change this. It's a tricky problem to solve - what nebulous actions can you take to change the *culture* of a school? To make people *feel* that chemistry you wanted? I wonder if there's some incentive we can create, some organization we can form, without hampering the individualism we seek.

To the OP, though, if you see this: if you're strictly looking for a game development school and are certain it's exactly what you want to do in life, UMich is certainly not the top. But, if you are interested in a generalist CS degree and exploring game development as a part of that, it is certainly possible. Despite the concerns I have, I do think this school gives among the most valuable degrees in tech you can find, even beyond some of the #1-ranked schools. If you're interested, there *are* plenty of people here interested in game development, and opportunities to *explore* it. And if you want to truly go deep into the field of game development, while you may not find as much content focused on it - if you *just make something*, then you'll find the experience you seek and I hope we can be a community to support you in doing so whenever you need it.",1570397623,3,0
"Yea USC is my number 1 school and they have the best games program in the country so they have a great community for that and a bunch of great classes (for their CS Games Major)

"Unpopular opinion: Look elsewhere. I was in the same boat as you - I started making Flash games in 7th grade and wanted to further develop my skills by studying CS. My experience at Michigan was more of a hindrance toward that goal than anything else.

University of Michigan has one game development course (EECS 494.) In that class you spend maybe 3 out of the 16 weeks learning specific skills in Unity - the rest is self-directed, and while you do get really helpful resources, it's nothing beyond what you can get from asking other people online. The same is true for the design aspect. You get to talk about design during the class, but the same resources are available online. If you've already settled on Michigan, it's worth taking the class, but if you're still considering other universities, U-M is a pretty lousy pick for game development alone.

WolverineSoft, as others have mentioned, is a game dev club. I tried showing up to a few of their meetings but could never bring myself to attend anything other than Game Jams. The club is insular and cliquey, and most of the meetings are the officers talking about different aspects of game dev, fostering very little participation from those in attendance. It never seemed to be a very good use of my time to talk about game making when it was more straightforward to just DO it. While taking 494 I bumped into a handful of other people that had similar experiences; they'd tried to get involved in WolverineSoft, but just didn't find  any chemistry there.",1570393217,1,0

"If this is what you’re looking for, I wouldn’t try to find it here. Answers you get both here and across various other subreddits (r/applyingtocollege, r/chanceme, etc.) are going to be inaccurate for a plethora of reasons

1. Most people answering are going to be either smartass high schoolers who think they know the entire process after reading an article or parents freakishly obsessed about parenting. Except maybe u/admissionsmom, she’s a godsend. 
2. Every school is different. UofM is an in state public institution. In state kids are going to get in easier, but also in state kids who have incredible stats will come here because it’s cheaper than ivies
3. The college admissions process is rigged. It’s how the wealthy stays wealthy through legacy admissions, sending their children to feeder schools, having connections, etc. Scores aren’t going to reflect that
4. Every school is different. Your school’s reputation w UofM definitely has an impact, as admissions are taken in context of your school. 

Is what you’re going through stressful? Yeah. I went through it a year ago and was mentally in a really tough spot. Here’s what I did that helped:

• I read Where You Go Isn’t Who Youll Be by Frank Brunei. This book made me feel immensely better about the process and gave me something to do other than look at test score and gpa averages. 

• I talked to my schools counselor about my application. I printed off all my essays, scores, and my transcript and showed her. She was able to give me a better idea of what to do because she understood the contexts of everything I’d written and understanding college admissions was her job. She wasn’t some smartass 17 year old.

Bike and scooter laws vary among cities but I know that in Ann Arbor, scooters aren't suppose to be driven on sidewalks (although its hardly enforced).

"Disclaimer, I have not taken this class, I have GSI'd for this class and here are my thoughts from looking at successful students.

Understand the concepts:

While physical chemistry is a course that involves a lot of algebra, it is not a pure math course. Although some problems you can solve by just plugging into a formula, often times you will have to take the equations we learn and apply it to a new situation, and this requires conceptual understanding. Take the exam we just took as an example. Over half the exam is conceptual, in fact 39/70 points could be obtained without a single calculation, not to mention the partial credit you would get for knowing the correct equations to use, even if you did not solve it correctly. Understanding how to approach a problem is more valuable than memorizing which formula to use for a given situation, and I'd encourage you to make sure you understand why you're using an equation, not just how and when to use it.

Do the PREP:

It’s no secret the homework in this class is much easier than the exam, you must do the PREP to succeed. My main recommendation is to not look at the key too soon. Suppose a problem has three steps A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D. If you look at the key immediately you’ll recognize this pattern, but you might struggle to apply it to new problems. On the other hand struggle with it longer, discuss with other students about how to approach a problem, you may find that you know how to do parts of the problem, like A -&gt; B and C -&gt; D and maybe just not part B -&gt; C. This is much better not only because you’ll recognize which areas you struggle with, but also it trains you to think about how to solve problems you have not encountered before. Often times when you look at a new problem it’s hard to immediately see how to solve it, but being able to recognize which steps lead you closer to the solution will help you.

Seek help from the instructor and GSIs:

There’s a plethora of resources available to you. Besides the weekly 3 hours of lectures + 1 hour discussion, there are 5 hours of Q&amp;A with the instructor, 4 hours of GSI office hours, 2 hours of SLC study group, plus other study groups you can form with your peers. If you don’t understand a problem, there’s almost always someone available you can ask, and if not there’s Piazza, which usually gets answers within a few hours. This holds especially true for conceptual questions; while calculation problems have a key you can check, there’s only the solution for concepts, but you want to make sure you’re getting to the answer for the correct reason. This is also why it's good to discuss with your peers. On one hand you can check your reasoning, but also I find the best students not only understand the concepts, they can also explain the concepts to others.",1569370234,1,0

"Fantastic, thanks so much for the response!

I am from the west coast (bay area) and definitely feel the more casual dress code we have! Even when, say, my dad worked for SAP, when I visited a few times people were often in just nice collared shirts and slacks.

Last winter I did go to the winter career fair in just a nice button up, slacks, and some brown dress shoes, but felt like I was super underdressed compared to everyone else, hence me asking here for advice.

Thanks again",1569366616,1,0
Transferred from MSU (where I never had this feeling). After coming here I feel like I’m suffering from Imposter Syndrome every damn day...,1569364518,1,0
"I'll preface this to say I'm an older graduate student who has returned after working for awhile. 

Straight up, while I think everyone looks sharp as hell during career fair, it is so much overkill and unnecessary.  Why staff at the University promote this boggles the mind.  Look at the recruiters, they are often in jeans or slacks and a polo shirt.  Dress like them or slightly better.  If you show up in nice slacks, nice shoes, and a nice button up shirt - you'll be fine.  Throw on a tie if you feel fancy.

However, there are a few caveats I offer to this

* Dress standards are different across industries.  Wearing fashionable t-shirts and jeans works at many business on the West Coast.  That being said, most people dress up a bit more than their daily routine when interviewing.  
* West coast tends to be a bit more lax than the East Coast.  
* Ultimately, you should wear what reflects you and feels comfortable for you.  Do you love wearing suits?  Then go right ahead and rock it.  If you like the Navy blazers and khakis, rock that.  While the dress codes I've experienced have been pretty relaxed (software engineer from the West Coast), that doesn't mean some people aren't dressed up every day - but that tends to be a reflection of them and their fashion preference. Its also not too uncommon that people dress up a bit when they are visiting or hosting customers (so having a suit or nice getup on hand is a good idea - also good for weddings).

My additional two cents along with just wearing nice slacks or shirt are:

* It's fine to ask a recruiter or the person who is interviewing you what is appropriate to wear to an interview.  Due to your youth they will be very understanding (and even later in life, it should not be an issue.  I have done this.  Not so much for an interview, but more to suss out dress code expectations in the workplace).
* Find some people working in the industries you are interested in and ask for advice - they are going to have the best suggestions.  However, don't rely on what a Professor thinks unless they have actually worked in industry (I've found lifetime academics have somewhat skewed views of industry, mostly due to their limited exposure).

However, if you do get a suit or blazer - no matter how cheap or expensive - Take it to a tailor and get it fitted!  It will look way better on you and you'll feel sharper which will help your confidence.  

For not so expensive suits you might check Bonobos or Indochino for options.  Bonobos are  about in the mid-range but they tend to have occasional deals and sales so you can get a suit for a good price.  They also have a fitting room in Detroit where you can get fitted for the right sizes before ordering.

"For you and OP and all those others with imposter syndrome, I pass on this story I heard, it may be one of those urban legends but I'm gonna tell it like it was told to me because I think about it all the time.  

A guy gets his dream job in finance after graduating from a solid, not spectacular school, and is intimidated because nearly all of his newly-hired peers went to elite schools, seem to know what's going on, and appear to be comfortable in their environment.  It gets worse with every meeting, he's drowning in stuff he doesn't understand but everyone else looks like they get it 100%.  One day he has enough with his own anxiety and he decides to start asking questions.  He's got to start absorbing this information somehow and increasing his understanding or he'll never be able to do his job.  

So in the next presentation he sits through, he starts asking the presenters to explain what they mean, to walk him through the stuff they've glossed over.  He knows he looks like the dumbest guy in the room and its humilating to finally reveal his ignorance but it's this or quit.

After the meeting, his boss asks him to come to his office.  His immediate thought is that it will be the ""it looks like this is not working out"" conversation and he'll be looking for a new job. 
Not just new job but new career, because obviously he does not have what it takes for finance.

Nope.  His boss praises him for asking questions, says those guys are always so slick with their assumptions and no one presses them on it.  That a huge risk for the organization; you gotta pin them down, really understand the proposal, force them to prove they know what they are talking about.   Fantastic work, thank you, keep it up.

The guy was gobsmacked, he goes in there sure he's canned and instead he's the hero.  So from then on he always pledged to ask questions when he didn't know something, and not care if it made him look like a dimwit.  Because at the end of it, he'd have an answer and he'd be smarter than he was when he asked the question.

"The playing surface at the Big House has undergone several changes since games were first played there in 1927. For those of you who didn't attend games 10+ years ago this also gives you a view of the stadium without the brick towers and with the old scoreboards and press box. 

From 1927 through the 1968 season the stadium just had a natural grass playing surface. Citing lower upkeep costs and better traction for players this was torn out in 1969 in favor of artificial turf. But then 21 years later the thinking changed again, and natural grass was reinstalled. 

Natural grass was last used on the field during the 2002 season. Prior to the 2003 season the grass was again ripped out in favor of artificial turf. The high water table (depth where groundwater saturates the soil) on the Michigan Stadium site has made having a natural grass field difficult since grass does not grow as well in overwet soil. [There is a long history of groundwater causing issues at the stadium](https://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/stadium/stadtext/stadbild.htm).

"I was an electrical engineering major.

Generally I recommend early action, it rarely hurts. I believe UM gives out 14,000 acceptances each year with the expectation that 6,500 or so will actually attend. If you apply early action, you are competing against other early action applicants for as many open seats as possible. Once early action consideration is done, there are only maybe half or so of the acceptance slots remaining. If you got deferred, you would be competing against other deferred applicants as well as others who applied regular decision. Regular decision goes by rolling admissions, so then it becomes more competitive as seats get filled.",1572481885,1,0

Aero is one of the majors that freshmen are commonly interested in but then end up declaring or switching to something else (often MechE, sometimes other things).

"From my understanding, the purpose is to give students closer to graduation (and therefore have less time to take the classes they need) a better chance at getting those classes.

Those of use further from graduating have more time, and therefore have lower priority.

The question is how do you measure how close someone is to graduating? Some people graduate in 3 years, some graduate in 5 years. (Unless you’re double majoring) the only thing that’s consistent is that everyone needs 128 credits to graduate. Therefore the more credits you have, the closer you are to graduating.

The fact that people who went to schools with AP programs had a better opportunity to earn more credits is merely incidental.

Let’s define two sets of students. Set A had access to AP classes and set B didn’t. Once those in set B gain the credits that set A came in with, they’ll have the equal opportunity that A had (albeit later in time). The time difference may seem a bit concerning, but students in set B were going to have to earn those extra credits in university anyways. The registration appointment allocation system doesn’t affect that at all.

TL;DR: Inequity exists, but it isn’t amplified by this registration appointment allocation system. It does suck that your currently in last place, but it will provide you equal opportunity once you reach the point others started at. It is still effective at what it was designed for.

This is just my analysis of the system. Maybe I’m missing something (please tell me if I am, I love being less wrong).",1575657819,1,0

Your registration time is determined by the number of credits you have. The more you have the earlier you register.

"Please use this thread for topics related to the Early Action decisions that are being released this week and next week. That could be getting in touch with other admitted students, learning more about starting at U-M, financial aid, etc.

If you were accepted, congratulations! If you were deferred, make sure you send updated transcripts after your grades for this semester are finalized. You can also send your admissions counselor an email indicating your continued interest in Michigan. You may not receive an individualized response but this will be logged as demonstrated interest for your application.

Due to the heavy number of Early Action applications Michigan has to defer a high number of applicants. In recent years a large number of students that were deferred have been offered admission. More details about the application/admission process are also written up in the Wiki.

Note that the only 100% official source of information is going to be from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Please do not use this thread to post your application stats (regardless of if you were admitted, deferred, or denied).",1576702335,1,0

"First off, congrats on getting accepted! I am currently in the RC as a freshman and also a stem major. The language requirement will definitely be the biggest contribution to your workload as those are 8 credit classes and require you to attend lunch tables weekly. Also, you would take your first year writing seminar through the RC. Now, these two together are already 12 credits, so you will not have much room for stem classes while completing these. However, you will need to complete the language and writing requirement as long as you are an LSA student anyways: the RC just allows you to finish your language quicker. Personally, I have decided to leave the RC once I am done with my language requirement because I would rather focus on taking stem classes related to my major than take RC classes when there is not really a benefit of me graduating from the RC. In my opinion, I do not see any harm in you joining the RC and just seeing how you like it. If you end up switching to a humanities major, then the RC may be perfect for you to stick with for four years. If you stay as a stem major, then you may find that sticking with the RC for four years may hinder your exploration into stem courses.

"I’m a first year who was in the RC this past semester, though I won’t be next semester as I moved off campus and they require students to live in East Quad for two years.


The biggest part of the RC workload is the language requirement. If you take a language that the RC offers—these are Spanish, French, German, Russian, and Japanese—then you must take it through the RC. These are intensive courses, so each RC language course fulfills the same requirements that two LSA courses normally would. After completing two intensive courses in a language sequence, there are some other requirements to prove proficiency before you finish your language requirement.


You will probably take the Intensive 1 course of your language in the fall and the Intensive 2 in the winter (second semester). Each one of these courses is 8 credits, that means 8 hours a week, AND you are required to attend 3 language immersion lunch sessions per week. The exception is Japanese, which is a 10 credit class: 10 hours a week plus the 3 lunch sessions.


Keep in mind that, as a full-time studwnt paying regular tuition, the lightest courseload you can take is 12 credits total, and the heaviest courseload is 18 credits. Your language will probably make up over half of your courseload.


This is all assuming you fulfill your language requirement with one of the languages I mentioned. If you take Latin, for example, a language that is not offered through the RC, you CAN fulfill all of your language requirements, and you will have a much easier time doing so.


There are some other things to note; you will have to take a first year writing seminar through the RC, and there are some other classes you will have to take through the RC in your time at Michigan. I won’t get into the specifics of that here, but please let me know if you have any questions.",1577762634,1,0

You don't really hear of tenured faculty getting fired because of their teaching.

However, just because a tenured professor cannot get fired for a certain reason doesn't mean they can't face other consequences. For example, the university doesn't owe tenured faculty a salary raise or further promotion if they don't perform their duties well.",1577740058,1,0

The university does treat its lecturers, who have primarily teaching responsibilities, like crap. With a 1/3 yearly turnover rate, obviously people have other options. With the kind of tuition people are paying, they obviously have the money to afford to treat them better.",1577737040,1,0

"It varies by department. Like I know EECS tries their best to accommodate everybody who wants to enroll in their intro and core courses. For the upper levels, I think not everybody who wants a seat gets one.

Your best bet is to wait it out, and have plan B just in case. Attend class starting from the first day up until you either decide you don't wanna take the class anymore, or until the free add/drop deadline. Instructors can make you sign in the first few lectures, and whether or not you signed in can determine if you will be one of those on the wait list who will get an override if a seat opens up.",1577735503,1,0
"There’s a sign that says the lanes are organized by speed but it’s a fairly loose guideline depending on how full the pool is. If you’re getting into a lane where someone is already swimming, let them know you are getting into that lane before just getting in and ask them if they want to split or circle, I prefer circle but I’ve found some people prefer split. There’s a pace clock, and a few guff kick boards, but if you want other equipment you probably have to bring it. If you’re used to high school pools I find it not as cold, but still cool enough for not overheating on difficult sets. You can wear flip flops/crocs/barefoot onto the deck, some people bring water bottles, the stairway between the locker room and the pool can be chilly so I like to bring a towel",1577735330,1,0

Some faculty try to argue that the university means ""business hours"". At some other schools, I know that rather than making grades due X hours after the final exam, they say that grades must be turned in by 11:59pm on a certain date.

"No, there's no gatekeeping around whether or not you are in engineering. If your in CS, you're in CS (and you actually have to pay engineering tuition too).

Also, to be particular, LSA is a college and ECE is a unit within EECS (it's the electrical engineering side of things). Your comparison is between LSA and Engineering.

Really the only difference is the required general education credits (physics and calculus etc. versus a broad smattering of social, natural science, humanities, language, etc). You should at least take linear algebra as a CS major so most people do engineering (it's typically a lot less work, especially if you have AP credit).

If you're double majors (which probably isn't a good idea, spoken as double major myself) and one of them is in LSA, then you should do LSA.

Apparently LSA is also a bit less competitive (...allegedly).",1577685186,5,0
