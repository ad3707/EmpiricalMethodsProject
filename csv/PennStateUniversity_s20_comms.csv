Full disclosure, I go to this church. I stumbled upon Cedar Heights at a time when I was really searching for community and coming back to Christ after 14 (!!!) years. It’s been a true blessing finding them!

Rip when one professor says another professor is bad you know it’s really bad.

"Just got out of 311 and 331 last semester. I had 311 with Yanling Wang, who might be the worst professor at PSU. That class was extremely hard and caused great sleep deprivation for me. On the other hand, 331 with Almekkawy was nowhere near as hard as people made it out to be. His exams were challenging, but once you got the hang of Verilog and Vivado, the projects weren’t that bad. He’s also just a really nice guy who wants to see his students do well. Unfortunately he’s not teaching it this semester. Who knows if he’ll be teaching it again. Thankfully Wang is not teaching 311 this semester, and from what I’ve heard from my friends, McDaniels is a much better professor. I scraped by 311 with a B- after the curve, thanks to getting about a 70% test average and doing decently on most of the projects.

Go to class and pay attention in these classes. If Yanling is teaching, then maybe don’t bother paying attention in class because she can’t teach for shit. Additionally if Yanling is teaching, I suggest finding Carnegie Mellon University’s Computer Science 213 video lectures. They have essentially the same class (same book and powerpoints because Yanling doesn’t have an original bone in her body) but the professor is much better. I watched all of their video lectures before the final exam and actually got a passing grade on it, which I can’t say for my midterms. I also never went to 311 or 331 office hours, but your mileage may vary there.",1580006719,1,0
"Same advice as the other person. I took it (probably now) about 8 years ago. But I remember it as 3/4 questions for each exam with a main focus on getting the entire free body diagram right and then the full equations necessary to solve the problem. I regularly required about 6-10 hours a week of time to finish my homework but I never found the tests any more difficult than the homework was.

usually 4 problems each. if you understand the concepts from the homework you should be fine. still an incredibly difficult class though. my advice would be to do as many sample problems from past exams as possible!!,1579997000,1,0
"311 was a very tough class, and I think it's the first truly hard class, but tbh if you're in the right place as a comp sci major, you shouldn't have an outrageous amount of trouble with the course (outrageous being taking the course 3+ times), given that you seriously give it your best effort, which includes reading the textbook and thinking about everything for yourself (This course causes people to switch their intended majors). Office hours were so packed and time consuming I never went, but I think they would have been like 80% helpful. Got a B. Projects were time consuming and very toilsome, but the internet was a good enough resource for help. If you plagiarize code though, you're asking for 1) future troubles when you didn't learn what you should have 2) academic integrity violations. 

331 provides a lot of good information about computers that I felt like I should have known earlier. Imo, it's significantly easier than 311; however, for 331 I had one of the best teachers and for 311 one of the worst (neither still teach either course). 

465 was also stuff very good stuff for CMPSC majors. Weekly homeworks were challenging and you should spend a good bit of time doing them thoroughly and well because it's the best way to nail in the concepts. This class, imo, is kinda teacher independent, in that it's mostly just up to you to do what you need to do to understand, because the class is essentially focused on understanding, whereas the other two are more like ""you need to know about this facet of computers"" (not at all to say they're heavy in memorization). Still helps to have a teacher who can explain things in several ways though. Unfortunately, some instructors are limited by their ability to use the English language, which makes them not great resources for this type of thing.

I had 311 a semester before other 465 and 331, which was good because then 311 was alongside relatively easy classes. Content wise, 311 and 331 could be good together, but depending on how projects/exams fall, it could be very tough to manage. Both classes have time consuming projects, 311 more challenging. 331 and 465 was a good combo, as they're disjoint and 331's not too bad. 311 and 465 sounds no fun because they're both hard classes that require a lot of studying. All three together and you may lose hair but if you are determined and apt, you can do it",1579996611,1,0

"You won’t deal with that until your junior year. That class is passable either way, but it’s tough. If you already knew it I’m sure it would make you hate the class less. If you’re willing to learn data structures and algorithms on your own before coming I’m sure you like CS enough and are committed enough to do fine. I’m not trying to scare you away. If CS is 100% your passion and you’ll be willing to put all your focus on that then you’ll be fine. But if you have doubts about how much you actually like it, then things could go bad when the classes start getting harder your junior year",1581104320,1,0
What if I learn data structures and algorithms before coming ?,1581104113,1,0
"Honestly if you have background in coding your beginning years will be easy. That’s what makes the program worse. In my first two years the CS classes are pretty easy to the point that I barely learned anything that I didn’t already know from high school. And then as soon as you have to declare your major and officially be in CS in your junior year, all of a sudden you’re taking three CS classes a semester where it’s like you’re reading a different language. The first two years do almost nothing to prepare you for your junior and senior year classes, so you don’t realize you hate it until you’ve already wasted so much time as a CS major. So then if you change your major you will have to stay for extra semesters, so more money for the university. That’s all they care about, they don’t care about your success or helping you, only money. Search “Yanling Wang” on ratemyprofessors if you want to see how the CS major is",1581103300,1,0

"Because it’s true. If you are deciding to become a CS major, make sure you really, really, REALLY, love CS and programming, because even if you love it this program will make you hate it. If you don’t have a passion to code then you won’t have enough of a drive to keep going through the hell of CS. If you have even a little doubt that you don’t want to do CS, that doubt will grow stronger and stronger as you spend more time in the major.",1581101723,1,0

"I took this trio last semester, I’d try to avoid it if I were you. Got a C+ in 465, a C in 331, and failed 311. Genuinely the worst 4 months of my life. It shouldn’t be as bad if Yanling Wang isn’t teaching 311. With the curve, 331 and 465 are fairly easy to pass with a C but if you’re hoping for better grades then that it will be difficult taking all three at once. 465 gives weekly homework and a weekly recitation quiz, the homework would tend to be difficult and take a pretty long time. 331 didn’t give much in terms of homework but you’d have a quiz every couple of weeks that were sometimes pretty difficult, and the exams were even worse. You’ll also have some labs for 331. 311 with Yanling is just absolute hell, she shouldn’t be allowed to teach a class. You will always have both homework and projects assigned at the same time. She lowered the weight of exam 1 from 15% to 5% after the fact, and added an extra project because she claimed people “cheated” on exam 1. The extra project she gave was stolen from another professor word for word, except she also deleted the helper code that the original professor provided, and didn’t teach us anything to do with the project since it wasn’t even hers in the first place. That extra project is the sole reason I failed the class, I think the class average on it was about 30% because half the class didn’t even turn it in due to us literally having no idea what to do. The TAs didn’t know either, and it was during thanksgiving break so all the TAs left early and canceled their office hours as well. I’m sick of the CS program and might just switch to IST at this point.",1581069928,1,0
"I don’t know if UMD is any better, but the CS program here is pretty much a joke. Constantly cycles through new professor after new professor and none of them no what they’re doing. Some professors genuinely want to see you fail. In my experience the advising has also been terrible, the only thing they’ve done is actually give me false information or just not really answering any of the questions I had at all. They don’t care that the program is a joke, because the more classes people fail, the more semesters they have to stay for, so more money for the college. If I could go back in time I wouldn’t go here.",1581068511,1,0

I made a conscious effort to make American friends and today, almost all my friends are Americans. I love the college culture here with all the traditions and festivals. I watch the NFL, NBA and college sports with my friends, drinking as much as my body can handle. Going to parties and socializing with different people is so much more fun than I ever thought it would be. I feel more American than my home nationality now. If we try to adapt and adjust just a bit to the US of A, college can be so much more fun for us international students. 

And tbh I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT when I see a crowd of people from a certain nationality just hanging out by themselves and making no effort to make friends from here. You are an international student; you have the unique opportunity to connect across various cultures and yet they decide to only be friends with people from their own respective regions.

The average population is of young adults though, and most healthy-young adults are making a full recovery. It will also be a true test of the healthcare system since there’s a large homeless population and many who don’t have health insurance.

I get it, this sucks. I’m not happy about it, faculty isn’t happy, and the university certainly isn’t. 

But you gotta realize that this is bigger than you, and the fact that you have to do at most 6 weeks of classes online is not the end of the world.  It is essential that to be a functional adult you understand what compromise is. 

This is a compromise. NOBODY is getting what they want here. NOBODY, but they’re making the most out of what they’ve been givenX

Something else to remember is that you're spending a week with the same people 24/7, you're going to get sick of them by the end, it's inevitable. 

Other than that it's a great way to have a ""group"" going in, I'm not friends with any of the people I went backpacking with anymore on the trip bc we all just sorta went our separate ways but I wasn't super lonely like a lot of people the first 2 or 3 months. 

The type of people that go are super varied, we had jocks, nerds, rednecks, sorority girls, outdoors-y people all on my trip, i don't know if it was intentionally done this way but it was a fun mix of cultures so to speak.

For the trip itself, ABSOLUTELY water proof your hiking boots/break them in, invest in extra socks, some synthetic tshirts and even if they say not to (remember, cotton kills), try to bring 1 sweatshirt for at night, if you're taller like me it's likely the sleeping bag won't fit and your armpits up will be exposed, the sweatshirt was a lifesaver especially after all the clothes I brought were drenched and smelly from hiking in the rain with them, not to mention it can still get cold.

Overall I highly recommend the trip, you're gonna be out of your comfort zone the whole rest of the semester/year, might as well put your best foot forward and dive in head first",1587622149,1,0

"1. I am currently a freshman, I would be living there right now if it weren't for Cornavirus... so pretty recent I'd say.
2. I did not move to a traditional dorm, I really loved staying in the supplemental room. Penn State would actually actually prefer if all of the kids living in the supplemental rooms moved into traditional living, but they often find that the kids do not want to leave (if you want to stay they will never force you to move). It's really not as bad as it seems; I was very concerned when I was first assigned supplemental housing as well, but it's actually pretty great. To be honest, after people saw our room, I can guarantee most of them would rather live in mine than their traditional rooms.
3. lol

One last thing, someone else may have mentioned it, but if you really end up hating your living situation, you really do not have to spend a lot of time in there. Some days I would be so busy with classes, meetings, and homework that I would leave my dorm at 8:30 in the morning and would get back around 10:00 at night. It's way easier to do homework in a study lounge or the library anyway, and you will make tons of friends on your floor, so hanging out in their rooms is really easy.",1587615526,1,0

"Here is the info found on the PSU housing website:

"" A roommate pair where one student accepted the offer of admission before March 30 and one student accepted the offer of admission after April 1, the student who accepted the offer of admission before March 30 will need to indicate whether they want to be assigned with their roommate preference in [supplemental housing](https://housing.auth.abs.vmhost.psu.edu/supplemental-housing) (provided the student IS assigned to supplemental housing) OR be assigned to a traditional residence hall with a different roommate. If the student who accepted the offer of admission after April 1 is not assigned to supplemental housing, the University will assign the students together in a traditional residence hall. If the student who accepted the offer of admission after April 1 is assigned to supplemental housing, and the student who accepted the offer of admission before March 30 indicated that they are willing to be assigned to supplemental housing with their requested roommate, the University will assign them together in supplemental housing.""

Basically, you have two choices: either opt to live with a random roommate in traditional living, or choose to stay with them and both live in supplemental together.

In my opinion, I would strongly recommend living together in the supplemental dorms. It really is not as bad as you are imagining it, and you will likely get along with the other 2 roommates very well. Worst case scenario and they're horrible roommates, you at least have one friend there, which can make a world of difference.

One thing I found interesting during my semester and a half living with 3 other guys is that when one person is doing something annoying or not doing there fair share (AKA taking out the garage), the other 3 can usually all tell them to step up their act, and the mob mentality usually works well enough for them to start doing the right thing. It worked out unbelievably well, and I think you should give it a chance (you two can always try to switch out together in supplemental if you really hate it).

In the case that you guys are still very again supplemental, it will be very easy to switch into a double within the first few weeks. People leave and/or switch rooms all the time, just be sure to constantly check on the housing website where you can switch with other people.

"I faced a very similar situation (in-state tuition for Penn State, significantly more expensive for UMD), and I ended up choosing Penn State because the two schools are very close ranking-wise. UMD may be considered slightly better, but I don't think it's worth that much extra money.

Keep in mind that UMD's CS college is separate from their engineering college, while Penn State's CS program is within the College of Engineering. Both of these universities are known primarily for their *engineering* programs, so I like to think that Penn State CS is more directly tied to the benefits of the College of Engineering.",1587608588,1,0

"Just wanted to share my personal experience as a Penn State student (a bit biased, I know). I am finishing my freshman year (intended IE major), and it has been the best experience of my life without a doubt. Penn State offers so many opportunities for a well-balanced University Life, as you said. Any club or organization you want to join will likely welcome you with open arms. Classes so far have been difficult, but definitely at an appropriate level. My high school was very boring and not at all challenging, but classes here are very different. As an engineering student, you will likely have a lot more work to do than friends in say the business school, for example. But is is nothing that isn't very manageable, especially with any sort of time management skill at all. Every professor has exceeded expectations, many of them always willing to go above and beyond to help you out in class. The career fairs are probably the biggest reason I would recommend Penn State though. I think I've gone to 10 over the past year, and I've had a few interviews. I was offered a summer internship with a company in Pittsburgh for this summer. From what I've heard from upperclassmen, most engineering students graduate with multiple job offers (especially ones with multiple internships). As far as the IE rankings go, I feel like they are very close in actual education. Penn State also has a great rep for engineering, and like others have said east coast is something to strongly consider. 

Hope this can give some insight as to what Penn State is like, feel free to ask any other questions as well.",1587604189,1,0

You are correct. The log auditor is one of the flags and you are also correct that the other flags are just bs. He claims that during two questions of the exam canvas has it recorded that I moved away from the quiz. I didn’t do this so I have been trying to figure out how it happened. I suspect that it is there because on those questions I skipped over them to come back to them later and by clicking the next question number on the right it refreshes the page.

"Class of 2007 here. 9/11 was my junior year of HS. I had one good year of work before 2008 came and reared its ugly head. This is my 3rd major ""where were you"" moments and I'm not even 35 yet.

There's a lot of things to be sad about but I really do feel for the Penn State seniors. As someone who turned 21 October senior year, I would have been absolutely crushed that the best part of the semester was taken away from me. When I left that May, I sobbed for weeks. I'd sob singing the fight song in the shower all summer because I truly believed they were the best years of my life and they were behind me. I was a super fan of Penn State - in a sorority, a Lion Scout, an overall for homecoming (you call them executives now right? I'm so old). I had friends who I thought were going to be life long friends and I was leaving them all to take a job in Columbus OH (blasphemy, I know!)

It got easier. I stopped sobbing in the shower (although when I'd go back and visit I'd cry like a baby when I left haha). I joined the alumni association in Columbus and it was AWESOME because we had a ""us against the world"" mentality when we'd do game watches at the bar. I made friends at my job that some turned into life long friends. The economy crashed and the job I was in had massive layoffs. When the company limped through 09, 10 and '11, it was time to leave. I left for Philly, and leaving Columbus, ironically, felt like the same sort of death when I left Penn State.

Long story short, I did the same thing again 5 years in Philadelphia and moved to Seattle 3 years ago with my husband and leaving Philadelphia hurt just the same as Columbus and Penn State. But while I look back at my time at Penn State and still think they were great years, they're not the best years of my life. Your 20s are so trans-formative - I did so much traveling with new friends, still had nights almost as crazy as Penn State. I was able to travel, experience new states and countries. Out of all of those friends I had at Penn State, only four I keep in touch with. And that's OK! People will come in and out of your life and while I'm not close to a lot of people over these past 13 years, I am grateful for their friendship. 

And regards to ""who wants to work for 40 more years"" - don't think of it that way. I've gone to 5 different companies since leaving Penn State. Some I cried when I left, others I practically leaped out of the building. Some jobs you will love. Some you will hate and you'll know it's time to move on. You're not stuck to one path forever. I was an RPTM major, spent 10 years in fashion, and now work for a tech company and I couldn't be happier, even during a pandemic. 

Grieve for the time and the experiences you are losing, you are well in your rights to. But know this isn't the end, your life is only beginning, and there are chapters ahead of you that will be just as bright. Not all of them will be, of course, but I promise you will have a lot of opportunities to top your time there if you choose.",1587587751,1,0
"I'm not 100% on this, but this seems the most logical to me. They don't schedule from the last accepted to the first accepted, and housing does a meticulous job examining students' requests.

"I had the same thought as you when I came up here last year. I decided not to. Once you make your schedule, look at how far you have to walk between classes. Certain majors tend to have classes in different locations on campus, although you'll probably be taking a few gen ed classes this year. The North/South direction can be very hilly in places, and therefore not ideal for biking if you are heading North up hills. South is pretty central to the whole campus so I don't see why you'd need a bike unless all your classes are up North, like if you're a music or architecture major. There are also some buses around campus and a campus shuttle that run continuous loops. I know someone who never used his bike and it ended up getting rusty from sitting outside without use for so long, so if you doubt you'll use it, hold off. I'm also living in South next year as a sophomore and am only considering \*maybe\* taking a bike up because I'm in Blue Band and it's not fun walking 20 minutes up to the building once it gets cold out, but even then, the campus is very walkable.",1587586509,1,0

If getting a supplemental with your friend sounds worse than getting a standard double with a random person, you can select location as your first dorm priority and then roommate as your second. It really shouldn't matter either way though, as long as you accepted first.",1587585865,1,0

If you didn't make it into UP for the fall, then I don't think you'd be able to. If the 2+2 program is what you wanted, then nearly all students I've heard of move up to UP if they want to.

There are roommate transfers that happen after housing is posted, and sometimes people drop out or switch schools even before the school year begins.

Even if you do end up in supplemental for the first semester, you don't have to be in your dorm a lot if you don't like it. Meet up with friends, hang out in their dorms, study in the HUB, the library, or another building. Find clubs to get involved with, places to go, and other things to do. Even though I was in a double dorm living with my best friend from high school, I was very busy and found the dorm too distracting to get homework done in, so I was out a lot, even though I enjoyed my dorm experience. Your roommates likely don't want to be in supplemental either, if that's where you end up. You can all make the most of it and come into PSU having multiple roommates to befriend.",1587585138,1,0

There just aren't that many singles compared to doubles or even quads,and there are a lot of people with special scenarios that require it even before you think about commit order (which you will not be high in). If you're really intent on a single I would not request the most desired one (renovated), Pollock or non-renovated will likely give you more luck.

"Physics and Astro major here! Check out the department websites. Under the research and people  tabs, there’s some specifics on what labs are doing. If you have a particular interest read up on the lab/ professor. It’s good to make connections with people in the department (whether that’s your undergrad advisor, first physics professor, etc) during your first semester. They can often steer you in good directions based on your interest and if they know any labs looking for undergrads. 

I’ve found research at Penn State to be super accessible. I cold emailed a professor my first semester freshman year, met with them, had a great conversation and showed I was excited and eager to learn, then started work for them. I applied for a grant to get paid for my work that spring, and then applied for a big summer grant and got it. That experience definitely gave me a leg up when applying for REUs (basically research internships at other universities), and I got one the following summer. 

Of course I can only speak to my experience. I know it’s definitely tougher to get into labs in other departments, but at least in the physics and Astro departments, research is definitely there if you make connections and seek it out!",1588658263,1,0

I do believe that during this pandemic, oos students should be at the very least given in state tuition rates for both tuition and housing and everything else that's applicable. Whats the point in charging someone oos rates if they're not even going to be on campus? This is where a lot of schools are failing and their selfish nature is showing through.

"Sounds about right for undergrad.  There’s no out of state up charge as a World Campus student.  

I think that’s why the on-campus OOS students are so upset.  They pay about $35k/year in tuition and fees alone...and when spring courses were moved online, they still had to keep paying the on-campus tuition rate....which is like 2 and a half times higher than World Campus students.  Regardless of whether class is in person or online, student pays their home campus tuition rate, from what I was told.  

World Campus is its own campus but mostly filled with adults who work and could never afford or take part in a full campus experience.  It’s kind of screwed up.  Not sure why more OOS students don’t start as World Campus and then transfer to University Park.  They’d save a shit ton of money that way.",1589758174,1,0

Not that you can't ""handle"" Penn State's larger campus, but more that Penn State consistantly ranks high as one of the most active ""party schools"" in the nation...   so it's not just the sheer size, but the many social distractions that could adversely affect your academic performance...  
  
Now I would certainly urge you to more diligently research the comparison of Penn State's  Environmental Science program vs U Maine's...  if one is significantly better than the other, that could change my opinion...

"I had a really hard first year. I did not get along with my roommate - he partied and I didn’t, his friends would make fun of me all the time behind my back. (This was the biggest thing, I think.) I also didn’t like my major at the time. To top it off, I made absolutely no new, lasting friendships. Basically the only friends I had were the two that came from my high school that I was already friends with. We hung out constantly (and we still do)!

This year (my sophomore year), I got a new roommate, changed my major, and made a few new friends through a high school friend. I still wasn’t always 100% comfortable, but it was much less of a constant concern like it was for me the year before. I have slowly started to learn to worry less about what other people think, which was my main problem. I have social anxiety, so it was hard trying to maneuver a sea of ~50,000 peers. Ultimately, I decided to stay instead of transfer, and I’m glad I did.

You seem to be involved with clubs which is good, because it shows that you’re trying. That said, I *completely* understand not fitting in with many of the people at PSU - I still feel that in most cases. It’s not worth sacrificing your mental health/happiness/sanity to stay at Penn State if you really are uncomfortable. But, if you think you can push through, I’m sure you could find friends that are just like you! A big part of it is all about finding those common interests. I know you could find some like-minded people in your major, so maybe look into more niche clubs than a THON org (or in addition to one)!

"You need to do some more research, sir. There is no evidence that COVID-19 has the type of strength. 

&gt;An aerosol is a wholly different physical state: Particles are held in the air by physical and chemical forces. Fog is an aerosol; water droplets are suspended in air. The suspended particles remain for hours or more, depending on factors such as heat and humidity. If virus particles, probably on droplets of mucus or saliva, can be suspended in air for more than a few seconds, as the measles virus can, then anyone passing through that pathogenic cloud could become infected.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are strong reasons to doubt that the new coronavirus has anything close to that capability.

I've seen lots of people transfer out of architecture, but I only know of one person who transferred in. I know theres a portfolio requirement and I'm not sure what they want to see exactly but if you can show a little bit of design and a good chunk of art (doesn't always have to be related to architecture) then they'll probably be happy. Its 5 years (4.5 with an extra summer abroad) no matter what you do. As an AE he could probably work his way into the freshman history courses, and the upper level AE (a pain in the ass for us, but probably a cakewalk for an AE student). That wouldn't shorten his time at Penn State though, because he'd need to take a 4-6 credit studio every semester, plus the accessory courses that are only available once a year.

"I graduated with BLA 5+ years ago. I haven’t followed as much of the school but the program was and I’m assuming still is one of the best programs in the country.

Before you go, I would ask a few questions on why you want to study landscape architecture. I don’t want to discourage, but preface a few things. It’s not an easy course, but certainly doable. You will more than likely be spending more time in the studio compared to other majored classmates. I also transferred into the major the second year and the first year was not easy since (unless they have changed) you’ll have to double up on studio’s your first year to catch up with your classmates.

It is a 5 year degree so unless you do a limited offered summer course(Larch specific studio), the fastest way you can complete the degree is 4 1/2 years. That’s a long time to commit to something and regret doing and assuming added student loans too. Not saying it’s the usual but 20-30% of the class dropped out of the program after the second year while I was attending . A couple people walked away from the profession after getting the degree also. 

You’re classes are pretty small so you’ll be spending a lot of time with your classmates till 3 year and spending a lot of late nights getting to know each other well (make good friends, I personally have been in close contact with classmates as friends and professionals). Enter 4th and 5th year studio you have more options of smaller studios mixed with 4th and 5th year students. You will be studying abroad for one semester of that.

Positives for the program is that they have state of the art facilities. You have (hard to tell since I’m not sure which faculties are still there) professors whom were up to date with cutting edge technology with softwares and fab studios. Design wise you will learn a lot (ultimately up to you how much you get out of it). Also there are a lot of alums out there doing a lot of great work out there. It’s one of Penn States biggest strength.

A few knocks I have about the program is how little they focused on planting practices, but each school tend to have different focuses. Also while professors really knew what they were doing, they also seemed to stuck in the world of academia. Which is fine, but many professors having limited professional experience (current professional experiences) tends to create a gap between professional and academic work. These knocks aren’t unique to PSUs LArch program but it is worth noting.

Overall, if it’s the right profession for you, it is among the best programs to attend. More than likely, it’s not clear if this is the right profession for you or not, but I do encourage you to think about it in depth before joining (I suppose applicable to all majors really).

Things to consider 
- What kind of work are you hoping to do once graduating?
- Where can I get these jobs (cities, country side, near home?)
- Not so popular but how much will I be making roughly (compare locations, they vary drastically)
- What kind of hours do I want to work realistically at work (again this varies by firm but good to get a head start to understand what to expect)

The profession can be broad and narrow at the options on what you can do, but if you ask these basic questions it’ll clear some certainties and uncertainties. It’ll also help you be intentional on how you spend your time.

Again I’m a random person on the internet so take everything with a grain of salt!
Hope this was helpful 

Best of luck!",1586546953,1,0

"&gt;Nobody's asking for tuition to come out of your pocket. 

It will--maybe not mine, but it will come out of paychecks. The most easily disposable costs at a university are faculty and staff. 

&gt; We're disgruntled for the administration and what they're not doing to make us whole.

The thing is, you're not taking World Campus classes. You're taking UP classes online. There's a huge difference. I am substantially more involved in my UP courses than I would be in WC courses, the quality of education in UP-designed classes is simply different. You're getting more time with more qualified instructors who know you than you would at WC. It's expensive. Those costs didn't go away. Our educational outcomes remain the same. 

[Here's a pretty good breakdown of what colleges spend their money on.](https://deltacostproject.org/sites/default/files/products/15-4626%20Final01%20Delta%20Cost%20Project%20College%20Spending%2011131.406.P0.02.001%20....pdf). You want figure 5 on page 11. Note how small operational spending is. What you get by going to UP isn't the campus, it's the entire universe of services provided, and many (if not all) of those services still exist (although they're now done at home). 

&gt;And I see the actions the administration is taking as nothing but disrespect to the people who make their paychecks possible.

UP and Commonwealth students cannot meet with clubs, use the buildings we pay for, etc. It's a lot more than just the classroom. Even if it was, I'd still say pro-rate tuition to world campus. 
This doesn't punish professors at all. I'm not sure why you're taking these qualms personally. We have billions in endowment money, if $2,000 was refunded to match world campus tuition, it would cost the university a measly $2M. That's nothing compared to what the University can tap into.

I know that's not true for every professor, but at least it feels like it's true for those in my department. 

It's hard to say this without sounding accusatory, but with remote classes students are substantially more responsible for their own learning than with in-person classes. Motivation was already an issue before going remote, and it's a much bigger one now. There's very little I can do to get my students to show up now short of having a daily attendance requirement, and there are too many complications with that. You get out of remote learning what you put into it, and to be honest I don't think many of my students are able to put much into it right now =/ 

Even knowing all of that, I can't help but read the really negative threads on this subreddit as indictments of what profesesors are trying to do. I know a lot of it is just venting, but it still kinda stings.",1586535127,1,0

"Agree here - I'm a grad student here, and grad students also teach and work closely with professors (aka I am your ""junior"" professor) :-) What does the syllabus say about attendance and papers and how they are graded? If the papers are relevant to only outside of class work, like readings, they are separate grades and do NOT affect each other. If they relate to in class work, then it could be possible. That said, students who are absent for various reason often miss out on key information that can help them on interrelated,  that's why I ask students to email me in advance of being absent. Also, students are responsible for the information they miss while they are out (i.e. getting notes from classmates, meeting me in office hours to clarify material, going over the slides on Canvas). 

To me, the syllabus is contract between you and the professor about expectations, like a job contract. This comment from him sounds like a violation of both the explicit and the psychological safety aspects of that contract. I would make a screenshot and record that comment, including the time and date. That is completely unprofessional for him to say that in that tone of voice and in those words. You can absolutely get a grade audit done on the next paper (and this one). It's a pain for you, but you can and absolutely deserve a fair grade for your work. And it's the dept chair's JOB to ensure that happens. Just Google their name and find it out. The Dept chair is their boss. Check the syllabus to see if there is an official policy for a grade audit. If not, it's up to the dept chair and I'd wait until the end of the class to do it for your ENTIRE grade, or whatever grade he is the biggest jerk about, not just this one assignment. So, you would have to show up and stick it out the whole time. 

If he didn't say it in those exact words, maybe look back and see what he might have intended in a kinder light, and meet with him to ask for clarification? I do ask my students if everything is OK if they have missed three classes in a row and about this time in the semester, I send mid-semester feedback to strongly encourage my students to attend class if they haven't been attending.

"Technically true but feds aren't interested in arresting marijuana consumers in states where it's legal. 

On the other hand, state law actually overrides federal law in a way. If the executive branch was to legalize marijuana federally, it would still be illegal and prosecutable in states that want to keep it legal.",1582207490,1,0
"I haven't lived in Harrisburg for over twenty years but the area isn't very pedestrian friendly from my experience.  I took a look at some google maps and the bus looks like it runs every hour or so, but honestly, if you're about half a mile from campus it'd be easier to just walk and a lot cheaper than maintaining a car but keep in mind, there's not a lot to do in Harrisburg.  The bus route also doesn't look like it goes very close to either Campus Heights or Nittany Place or at least it's about as far to the bus stops as it would be to just walk directly to campus.

The one thing I'd be worried about would mostly be eating because it looks like a bit of a hike to the Giant grocery store.  You could always get a meal plan on campus, especially if it's a partial one where you could eat lunch and maybe dinner during the week since you'll be there around those times for classes anyway.  I can't say what the food is like at all since I never went.
