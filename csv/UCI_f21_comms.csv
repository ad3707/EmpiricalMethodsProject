"Cooking is pretty simple once you get the hang of it you just have to allocate time to prepare and cook. Rice and pasta are really easy to make, make sure you cook your meat thoroughly (if you eat), and add veggies to your meals! Ramen with egg, protein, and veggies is good. Sandwiches are really easy just make sure the bread has 3-4 grams of fiber. Canned food can be your ally if you can stand the taste of some of those cans. Snacks like nuts and fruits can also help a lot. Popcorn is an underrated snack. You can always search up quick recipes online and I hope this helps!",1631513600,1,0

"The BA in Psychological Sciences is NOT sunsetting.

It is the Psychology BA major that will sunset by the 23-24 academic year. (https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/undergraduate/index.php)

Meaning, it will no longer be a major at UCI after Spring 2024. 

The last freshman accepted as BA Psych majors were those from 2020 since they need at-least 4years to complete the major. Freshman this year (2021) were not accepted into the Psych BA major - only transfers were accepted into the Psych BA.

If you are a sophomore and decided on Psych BA, you must finish within 3 years. Once again, it is the Psych BA they are getting rid of, not Psychological Sciences :)",1631511996,1,0
"I transferred last fall during the pandemic, and at first it was hard but i was able to make some friends. Unfortunately almost all of em just graduated so I have to start fresh again. I suggest join clubs to meet new people! In just one year there i was able to do research, internships, and work for something that compliments my major. Dont feel discouraged that you transferred and know no one, first quarter just familiarize yourself with clubs, the campus, so next quarter it can lead to an internship or more opportunities! Also I suggest seek mentorship if you need advise, that helped me maintain good grades and not feel lost despite it all being online :) all my friends graduated but for my last yr I already have continuing opportunities, so you got this I promise!",1631511311,1,0

"Hmm. That would take a University finance expert to explain and that's not me. It's not a law about debit cards so much as it is about the University not being able to tack credit costs onto tuition; things go pretty rabbit hole from there.

Debit cards are all aligned with credit card agencies; you can't use credit cards at the counter either. They'll send you to a terminal to make the payment. 

If you want precision detail on this one you'd have to call the Cashier I'm afraid.",1631509379,2,0
"Definitely be prepared for some crazy hot weather until october like others said! When it gets chilly, you can prob get by with either a sweatshirt or denim jacket, nothing too heavy honestly! I’d stick with tees/tanks, shorts and jeans for sure",1631509361,8,0
"Same. I came in as a transfer and just was never fully comfortable as a UCI student. 

To me, it felt like junior and senior students who've been on campus since freshman year had already formed their own friend groups and social circles; it felt like they weren't open to meeting new people. 

I was a commuter too, so I didn't have the opportunity to stay back late on campus in the evening/nights when most clubs met. 

They also had a lot of internships and work experience under their belt and I felt like I missed out since I was in community college up until then. So that was also really intimidating, since I didn't feel qualified enough to secure internships to compete with them. 

Overall, I had a pretty shitty experience at UCI. Then again, it was because I let my insecurities and feelings of low self-worth get the better of me. I would say: you got into UCI for a reason. It's ok to have impostor syndrome but don't let that stop you from putting your best foot forward (for academics, involvement, jobs, everything). You'll be a better person for having tried. Even if it doesn't work out. Good luck!",1631508981,9,0

When I felt I was not able to fit in, I went back to a song that goes ""don't be just sitting by the side of the road.."" and it helped me, I hope you can find a way to beat your doubts and enjoy being around other students just like you..

"You just apply for it through your school, it's an online form. There are some slight differences between what the schools ask, but they'll ask for your GPA, and the number of units you want to take. And then you just wait until they approve it. They tell you what GPA you want so yeah (3.0+ I think)

I was only rejected once because I was double major and applied through school of physical sciences but I had more courses in school of social sciences so I was asked to apply through there and I was approved. So I assume if you have the GPA, and if your school allows it (i.e., school of ICS doesn't allow more than 20) then you should get it",1631501448,6,0

"Dining hall meal plans tend to cost close to $10 per meal. It's not that bad considering it's buffet style, but you'll get tired of it relatively quickly. You'll do much better learning how to cook.

I'd recommend getting a rice cooker if you don't know how to cook rice and cooking some sort of meat dish in the oven. This could be baking chicken or ribs. Or try cooking steak on a stove and pairing it with rice.

Sandwiches also work well for the non-cook, requiring just bread and either deli-meat or avocado/egg/tomato or whatever you like between the bread slides. It's still cheaper than eating out all the time and is a good start for solving what to eat for lunch.

I wouldn't get a meal plan if possible. Sure, it's convenient not having to do the dishes, but it gets expensive quickly.",1631497604,3,0

"I took this last year in my first quarter as a freshman, so my memory may be a bit foggy 🥲. And it was during the pandemic aka it was online. But, Professor McThomas is a great &amp; super kind professor! I’m sure you’ll like their lectures &amp; the content. 

As for the workload, I would say it was about 50% reading (the readings vary in length but were manageable) &amp; 50% lectures. If you know how to manage your time, take good notes, &amp; study thoroughly, you’ll be fine. Plus, before exams (if I remember correctly) she holds office hours. She explains the layout of the test &amp; answers all related questions about the content (which were amazing btw, they def helped my understanding).

"I am currently not subsidized and work two jobs to pay my rent and have extra money left over. About 45% of my gross income goes to rent and parking. Also, I'm a student, so I don't work full time. I know about the struggles of paying for rent as a part time employee.

First, I want to say that striking only hurts the students. Our supervisors already got us a raise from $14 to $18 starting pay. The supervisors are actually really cool and do a lot to support the drivers. The working conditions are very good, and there is a great community of bus drivers. I drive morning/midday N line a lot, so I am used to the crowds and having to turn people away. I don't like it, but it has to be done. Honestly, having that many people and having to turn them away is not much more stressful than normal operation. Our job is easier than most other jobs for students on campus. I have talked to many people that agree that our working conditions are much better than jobs like campus dining or transportation. So pretty much all of the drivers are happy with working conditions and the pay. There is no pushing or pulling factor to make us strike, and the downsides of striking are much worse than the benefits.

I personally am of the opinion that a full-time job should be able to cover expenses. Shocking. But I also think that it is unreasonable to expect a part-time job to fully cover expenses. I don't intend for my bus pay to cover my full-time rent expense, because instead of working full-time, I use some of that time to be a student. That is what financial aid for students is for. It is to allow students to not work full-time. I don't have that, so I just work more, closer to full time, which makes my income and expenses difference more manageable.

As a reference, the national average pay for a bus driver is $18.91/hr. I'm getting paid the ""market price"" for a bus driver, if you think the free market is real.

If I worked full time as a bus driver, $19/hr (my pay) would give me $3040 a month. I could probably get a double with someone for about $1100-1200. This would be an income to rent ratio of close to 2.5 times, which is the minimum for most people around here to rent to. For a single person, it is possible to do, but I wouldn't have too much money. Still, I argue that $18-19/hr would be around the minimum livable wage for a single person in Irvine. As a result, and especially considering this is part-time college job work, I think that the bus driver pay that we receive is an adequate wage.

All this being said, I do not think that $14/hr is an adequate wage for Irvine, because everything is more expensive here. I think that it is important for people being paid minimum wage to unionize and fight for better working conditions. I think your message is misplaced, because I think most drivers like the conditions and pay. If you want to spread the message about unionizing, tell the people that actually don't get paid well.

TL;DR: Bus drivers get paid well, conditions are good, and striking only hurts the students. I see no reason to strike.",1633560624,3,0

"""bangin pay"" is subjective.

$18 an hour in OC is ""bangin"" when you're subsidized by taxpayer-funded financial aid, but if you were actually paying for your rent/food/other essential expenses out of pocket, you'd likely not feel as positively about it. Lowest rent I've seen here is in the $700 range not including utilities (*maybe* closer to $600 in a triple), and at 19.5 hours per week at $18 an hour, you'd be bringing in about $1400 a month. Paying 50% of your (pre-tax) income in rent indicates to me that your pay is not as ""bangin"" as you think it is. And that 50% is just for bottom-of-the-line rent, not even including utilities, food, healthcare, travel, and sundry.  For those of us who are not fortunate to have everything covered by financial aid, how do you save money on that salary? How do you invest?

"So my freshman year my best friend went to UCLA and spent the whole first quarter updating me about all the shit they were doing whether it be parties or what have you, and I spent the whole time feeling like shit that UCI didn't seem to have that. And while it doesn't nearly as much as a huge established school like LA, I met some friends in classes / sports that do shit all the time and it basically turned the school around for me.

It's pretty shit advice, but find some friends that want to also party, then go to some parties. They're around, there's Instagram accounts that publish them and if you find any frat guys at all anywhere they will always tell you (as you said you're a girl lol) where the latest and greatest is.

Also good to keep in mind: Halloween is on Sunday. Tons of stuff happened Thursday-Saturday, much less on Halloween especially because of midterm season, and that's a pretty general rule for when parties happen throughout the year.

Wish you luck, find some like minded people out there in your dorm / classes / rec groups and hit the parties that are out there up! Worst comes to worst if you want to check it out walk down frat row and see what's around on Sunday night.",1635677350,28,0

"I think you’re talking about the Tabrizi Family Chiropractor. I saw the booth too and I started my treatment there 4 weeks ago. It’s amazing. It’s not just adjustments, they also do exorcises, some PT, acupuncture, and massage therapy. It is covered by UCSHIP it’s a private business and it’s super fancy. My co-pay is $20 a visit, which is great for such a nice place. Downside is having to get a ride there and UCSHIP requires you to go twice a week or they won’t cover it. So that sucks if you don’t want to go super frequently. I live on campus and don’t have a car so I rent a zip car for an hour to go to my appointments, they’re only 15-20 minutes and it’s a 10 minute drive. I’m also not sure if they’re excepting more students but you can always call and ask!

Know that it's ok to take a break from school to discover who you are and what you want to do in life.  There's plenty of routes to take in life and there's plenty of time to figure it out, except if you're dead and I don't want you dead, I want you happy and to find your passions in life.

Hi. I have also been where you are at my first quarter as a bio major. I actually felt like I didn’t belong when I came in and that I should of went to CC instead. I switched out since it is not something I wanted to do but there is tons of help that the school has to offer. There is LARC and peer tutoring for all those classes. The peer tutors host midterm and final sessions and I would suggest going to them in the future. One bad quarter does not define you and it is ok to retake those classes. A D in bio actually lets you move onto bio94 and you can always take it in the future.,1636697741,1,0

"Hey! I totally understand where you are coming from and it is really hard!

Just because you are in a rough spot now does not mean you cannot get out of it or that you aren't worthy of where you are!

I recommend you do try therapy, just call the counseling center and try to set up an initial assessment. It is hard to reach for support but just as people go to the doctor when they are sick, therapy can help when you need mental and emotional support. Therapy actually does not only do that but even can help you with finding why you are struggling with classes too and maybe even form a plan! 

For classes you can try to find out what helps you maybe study groups, tutoring..etc. Maybe even try contacting LARC. 

It is still your first quarter as a freshman! Don't beat yourself down too much! You got this...",1636697061,3,0

"I heard the best thing to do with dealing with imposter syndrome is to hear other people talk about their own experiences with imposter syndrome.

I also have the trio, a d i find that watching khan academy after each lecture helps to cement my understanding. And bozeman science videos also help as well. And practicing the mastering biology pre-lecture helps as well, since some questions are pulled from there.

And for my notes I center them around the learning objectives in each lecture, since that's the knowledge they'll be testing on. (* ^ ω ^)",1636696755,1,0
Alternative major in case you don’t get into nursing but still want to try switch major / have a career in nursing? If so you can do either bio or public health sciences since the prerequisites are the same but I kind of suggest bio since you won’t be major restricted. You can also try changing your major in your second and third year(but if you change third year you’d have to stay a 5th year at uci).,1636696204,6,0
"I totally relate although I do understand everyone’s situation is different! I’m a senior in public health sciences rn and still feel imposter syndrome sometimes. My first year I struggled with Chem and was able to take LARC. The students success initiatives offers one LARC scholarship and you can find if you are eligible by checking out their website. I also went to therapy my first year and although it didn’t help as much I was able to have a better mentality towards college. I just went back to therapy starting this quarter too. If you feel comfortable reach out to your friends and family if you can cause imposter syndrome is always there, people just don’t always mention it around you sometimes. If anything feel free to PM me too if you want and feel comfortable to do so since this platform is more anonymous. I’m happy to hear you out about your classes, imposter syndrome and mental health stuff cause I struggled with all of those before. btw I took the trio too back in freshman year and they have a curve at the end. If you do get a D the worst is you’ll be on academic probation and you’ll just have to keep your grades up the next quarter and you’ll be allowed to repeat the classes you didn’t pass in and have your grade replaced. Good luck with the rest of your quarter",1636695981,11,0

"As other students already commented, outside of actual organizations sub 20 people kickbacks are much more common in the area versus parties. However, I don't think it's fair to say that it's a boring school when you admit that you haven't made many actual friends. If you don't have friends then it's a given that you're not going to receive many invites to kickbacks or parties. 

Beyond that however, there are still options for you depending on the types of parties that you're interested in. Clubs that have fams/brothers similar to a frat hierarchy usually host parties every week. However, many of the more ""wholesome"" clubs typically have little to no drinking or smoking involved which you may or may not be interested in. If you are more inclined to those activities, less ""wholesome"" clubs or service/leadership based frats may be more in your target. Many service/leadership based frats are less of the typical ""Greek-life"" stereotype and have lesser hazing pledge periods, and are basically regular clubs with a bit more required time commitment. Their parties are less intense while still including a good amount of alcohol and similar.",1634635097,1,0

"Having taken both I would take 6d this quarter, and study some of the overlap over winter (sets, proofs, logic). The two classes overlap relatively little to be honest. You use a little 6b in proofs by induction, and then after that pretty much nothing really relates (algos, modular math, counting). 

6d will be harder than 6b, and while I can't judge gassko 6d difficulty vs hayes 6b difficulty I would imagine both are challenging courses that will require you to work. With that said 6d is almost always going to be hard. You can find who teaches what using [https://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/courses/listing-course.php?year=2021&amp;level=Lower-Division&amp;department=ICS&amp;program=ALL](https://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/courses/listing-course.php?year=2021&amp;level=Lower-Division&amp;department=ICS&amp;program=ALL)

which is helpful in planning. Next quarter you can take 6b with Gassko (who is certainly better than who I took it with, and a lot easier than Hayes) or Irani (who is often considered the best for 6b/6d). 6d will be Gassko regardless, and honestly having a more challenging 6d is probably a lot better than having a more challenging 6b in terms of what you learn. I can't speak for Hayes at all as I never took him and I don't like going by word of mouth, but given the information I have I would avoid him for 6b.

Tldr I would honestly take 6d now, 6b later, but prepare a little prior and note that 6d is not going to be easy.",1639874261,1,0

"First off, please don’t feel bad - computer engineering is one of the most difficult majors at UCI and coming in directly from high school is a major adjustment for many people. You say that you feel stupid, but speaking as an alum/older student I don’t think this has anything to do with your intelligence or aptitude for math or science at all. You received one of the most significant scholarships at this school and presumably also had credit for AP Calc BC (I’m assuming this is why you started with Math 2D rather than 2A or 2B). Here are a couple of my suggestions to try for next term: 

1. Try focusing more on solving as many problems as possible rather than merely reading the textbook. Exams in STEM courses at the university level are really just testing your ability to solve the types of problems covered in those particular courses within a timed setting. You may use solution manuals if you get stuck, but do not ever blindly copy them. If used properly, they can be a very useful teaching tool.

2. Plan out your studying schedule in advance so you start reviewing for finals as early as Week 7 or Week 8. I can tell you from past experience that Weeks 9 and 10 are when final projects and assignments really start to pile up. It is easy to become so overwhelmed with everything you need to do that you end up not doing as well as you wanted in some classes, purely out of lack of sufficient time for studying rather than not being capable of understanding the material.",1639865299,1,0

Then in the email ask what they would need of you (CV, statement of purpose draft, transcripts, etc.) It will be different for each professor - one of mine did not need any additional documents since they knew me very well while another needed a few documents.

It may be a little early but I think the overall idea is good. I would do it maybe 3-4 months out from when you want to submit letters.

"I don't necessarily think the UCs love fucking with us, right now I'm sure they're waiting to see how the situation progresses. Since their actions depends on how fast the omicron variant is spreading in California, the CDC's/governments response.

Even then I doubt the UCs have enough money to test every single student weekly, though they might have reserve funds I don't know.

The major concern of the omicron variant is that it's spreading faster than the other variants, and that the vaccine isn't strong enough to deal with it, even with the vaccines I believe. Of course still get the vaccine and booster shots, don't let anyone use this as an excuse.",1639845814,1,0

""Wow, that's really cool, how did you end up doing/learning/experiencing that?""

Be curious. Everyone is unique with an interesting story to tell and people love talking about themselves. It's only small talk if you don't care. So don't ask questions you don't care about.

The M2 series is technically more difficult but in the sense that it goes much more in depth in the same concepts that chem 1 series does and also adds additional concepts chemistry majors need to know that non-chem majors do not necessarily need. The exams are also much more short answer heavy with little multiple choice (at least the year I took it). The M2 series is also tougher because chem majors start taking labs their very first quarter while 1LC for example does not start until after finishing two lecture courses first (1A and 1B).,1640916385,1,0
"I think before going out to make friends you should focus on building yourself. If you don’t already, start exercising consistently. It will make you feel better and help you become stronger and healthier. 

Focus on doing the things you enjoy and care about. Whether that be watching stuff or playing games, keep at it. Also, focusing on studies and career. 

Doing these things will help improve the quality of life. And as you go through it, you will naturally meet people. Take classes you find interesting and you will meet people who share the same interests. 

I know it sounds opposite to what you’re looking for but really don’t focus too much on making friends and instead focus on your own self. This will help you build better relationships with people. 

Of course, join clubs and work a job bc you need to stay active socially and build those social skills. But the meaningful relationship that you might be looking to build will come naturally as you focus on your own well-being. Be kind to others but more so be kind to yourself.

"With only this to go off of, it seems that your troubles come from anything but lack of trying.  It seems to me that what you are looking for is difficult to find because there might be elements missing in your attempts at finding friends.  The advice that I could give is that, if you believe yourself to be the common denominator, concessions will have to be made (in a social context) for people to open up to you as well.  An example of this might mean asking other people about themselves just as much as you tell them about yourself, or giving their actions or words the benefit of the doubt.  I don't think that your problem is about ""lowering"" standards, but looking for new ways to relate to people that you may previously have thought that you would have trouble relating to.  Without getting too anecdotal, I have been pleasantly surprised by people when I listen more than I say.  

Don't take people brushing you off too close to heart.  Learning to understand nuance in others and yourself is part of the process to understanding others in a way deeper than just recognizing we are humans.  Keep your head held high and be mindful of others in the process of finding what you desire.",1640912456,1,0

I just flew from JWA yesterday. I arrived 1.5 hours before my flight and had plenty of time. I flew spirit and the terminal and gate number were on the ticket i got. I recommend pre checking in if your airline allows it so you have the ticket on your phone. Also terminal b TSA line is far shorter than terminal C so I would use that one. Other than that it was fairly simply. Its seems a little scary at first but its super easy just TSA then go to gate for your flight,1637783256,1,0

"I have a portable AC and so do a lot of the people I know who live in verano, as long as you get a good seal around the window it actually works well and isn’t too expensive electricity wise. I’d recommend looking at reviews and trying one out. They’re far from “almost useless.”

Retrofitting the old Verano units with central AC would be a massive waste of money tbh, most of them are small and old and they’ll probably tear them down before putting in AC just because of how extensive of a project it would be. The unfortunate fact is that despite having some heat waves where you really want air conditioning, the weather in Irvine is comfortable without it 90% of the year which makes the cost/benefit on it for basic student housing not great. I’m curious if the Verano 8 buildings theyre building now have central air…

What I don’t get is why new Verano units are the only ones with ceiling fans. Ceiling fans are amazing for getting some airflow and they’re not expensive at all! Some of the architecture in the grad housing communities is actually quite clever as far as keeping apartments cool goes (shaded breezeways/stairways stay cool during the day, transom windows that open can pull in cooler air, thick stucco walls cool down at night and help ward off heat from the sun) so the lack of fans is confusing.",1637776941,1,0

First step: find a research professor who has a research lab (ensure his research interests align with yours - otherwise the research might be tedious and laborious work)

As a result, I became more excluded from discipleship events and eventually all events. I was really attached to the group so when all this happened, it was extremely devastating.
