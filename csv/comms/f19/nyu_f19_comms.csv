"I'd go on [Meetup](https://meetup.com) and check out ReactNYC, Rust NYC, etc. Also [Brooklyn JS](http://brooklynjs.com/). One thing my new tech club Torch is considering is organizing a group trip to a meetup. So like we all go to a ReactNYC meetup. I'll let you know if that happens. If there's any conferences in your areas of interest, you can check if they have student tickets.

While on campus recruiting can be pretty useful, I've always kinda had the Groucho Marx opinion: ""I don’t care to belong to any club that will have me as a member"". On campus recruiting has the ""problem"" that it must accept every student. That's great, cause, well, students need jobs. But it also means that from a recruiter's perspective, they're not always provided with the strongest candidates. Unless the school is generally known for its CS program (MIT, CMU, UMich, Waterloo, etc.), companies aren't really gonna be enthused to interview students. In my view it's better to seek out your own opportunities away from the usual channels so you stand out a little better.",1569392720,1,0
"This ideology is flawed, people aren’t working multiple jobs at min wage without having failed some other aspect of their life. Imagine you could only work for 7.25$ and only one job. You would figure out your own personal finances to survive people must be held accountable for their own poor decisions at some point without the tax payers carrying their burden. This is perhaps the only argument Ben Shapiro has ever portrayed i would agree with see https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/three-simple-rules-poor-teens-should-follow-to-join-the-middle-class/",1569388918,1,0
"You do realize those people are working multiple jobs at min wage while living paycheck to paycheck, there’s literally no time for them to spend to better their career. The only way they can gain the training they need to improve is to get a higher min wage so they have more time available by not having to work as many jobs and then use government funded programs to gain employable skills (albeit it doesn’t have to be government funded, but that’s the easiest to implement solution). There’s no other option for most people at the bottom",1569388329,1,0
"Wait a second, the nanny state is the only people who could possibly fund improving people’s lives?? I don’t quite understand how you could believe the literal only way someone could gain experience or education to further their career requires government intervention. Also the tax cut was correlation not causation, if it was that would prove that “top down economics” works when we all know it doesn’t just a joke honestly. But this worldview the government must help other people is baffling to me.",1569387800,1,0
Tax cuts and unemployment aren’t directly correlated.

"This is literally the “bootstraps” argument that republicans have been using for years to push back against welfare programs. It’s just not feasible to suggest that people working min wage jobs can somehow become employed somewhere where they get above min wage without some sort of training/schooling, both of which require government funding to implement. btw in regards to your tax cuts argument, most people making min wage aren’t paying taxes to begin with. The only people benefitting from that are the top 1%, whose taxes go down significantly.",1569387388,1,0
Wait.. trump gives tax cuts and we’re at historical low unemployment... ??? Who cares if people work 40 hrs on fed min wage if they wanted to improve their life they wouldn’t expect to hold a nanny state job their whole life,1569386880,1,0
"[This study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25434) of minimum wage increases from 1979 to 2016 and their corresponding effects on unemployment, conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research in January of this year, states ""We also find no evidence of disemployment when we consider higher levels of minimum wages.""",1569385826,1,0

"A few thoughts:

You may be doing your search incorrectly. I've seen lots of interesting CS jobs on NYU Handshake and, through the listings, already have an internship lined up for next summer at a national fin-tech company.

Are you signed up for the emails that the math and CS department have with opportunities? They regularly send out messages with jobs, fellowships, internships, etc.

Are you actively networking?  Have you built relationships with your professors?  Are you attending ACM meetings? Going to lectures?  Volunteering to do research with CS professors? Volunteering for tech non-profits?  Talking to your TAs and asking their advice?  Are you on the programming team? Those are all great ways to get your name out there.

Have you searched for nYU alumni on linked in and reached out to them? 

Also, I think someone already has mentioned Hackathons...there are tons of them around NYC. 

The job search can be a really daunting process but, if you tackle it in an organized way and keep at it, doors will open.  Good luck!",1569356161,1,0

"Are you talking about the thing where you can submit 3 AP scores in lieu of SAT/ACT/whatever test scores? Because I'm pretty sure you can just submit whatever AP scores you want, as long as you can meet one of their test requirements. For example, I'm pretty sure I submitted all my AP scores to them, even though I also sent them my SAT scores. Hope that makes sense, lemme know if it doesn't",1569342268,1,0

"Hey! I live at UHall currently and imo it's a really nice dorm. There's a dining place (breakfast food &amp; burgers), a little shop area to buy stuff like cereal, drinks, frozen meals, etc. a dunkin donuts, two major lounge spaces (one of which anyone can access bc it's next to the dining place), and an outdoor atrium. In terms of the rooms, it's usually two doubles sharing a common space, kitchen, and bathroom. I have a nice sized living room that fits a couch, table, and TV with plenty of room to spare. The bedrooms are a decent size and you get spacious walk-in closets. The bathroom is a nice size, it's not too big but isn't cramped (it has a tub with a shower head). The BIGGEST downside is the kitchens. The stove/ovens are old as fuck, the gas lighters are kinda wonky, the refrigerator is small, and it doesn't come with a microwave. You have a lot of cabinets but like one counter to work with to prepare food. It's super cramped and only one person can cook at a time. So if you like to cook like I do, it's annoying but if you just use the meal plan or eat out, there's plenty of good places on 14th and you have the dining options downstairs and ofc Palladium is next door.  Hope that's helpful!

"I didn’t go to NYU for undergrad, but I think what I’m about to say holds true. One question you have to ask yourself is whether you like the people you’re going to school with and do you want to give up that last semester with them. After college, people scatter (yes, even away from New York), and some close friends you just won’t see that much for the rest of your life. Senior spring is a pretty fun time because typically you have your job lined up and classes matter less (or are at least easier to balance), so you’re able to enjoy spending time with these friends. Do you want to give that up? Personally, I didn’t, but maybe you do. Lastly, there is a downside risk that the study abroad program you attend just isn’t that good or you just don’t click with the people. Personally, I wouldn’t take that gamble given the opportunity cost outlined above. Good luck making the decision, either way, I’m sure you’ll have a lot of fun!",1569239151,1,0

It turned out to be a good time for growth by learning to do things just for myself (not just eating alone but going to museums, touristy things, concerts, and broadway shows alone was a really enlightening experience!!) 

By sophomore year I made friends through the exact ways you mentioned- asking people from classes to work together or hang out. It helped being in tisch that I was in class with these people 9am-5pm twice a week, but yeah, just forcing yourself to make plans or even ask to grab a meal with someone (or a few people!) is the best way to do it.",1568264274,1,0

"In my experience most of my friends are from classes but you don't want to invite people to hang out immediately to some it comes off as weird, start out by studying with them or grabbing meals after class then move to hanging out on weekends. 

I highly recommend checking out this video and reading the follow up article by the videos creator on her first year at college. They're well worth yours and anyone else who feels this ways time in my opinion.

When the RA confronted you, you complied immediately and you realize that your actions both reflect badly upon you and can have an impact on others. You should not go into any explanations.

"It’s normal — not just for NYU, but for most college students. I think I spent a lot of my freshman year in way too hard of a “fight or flight” anxiety state of bugging the fuck out about how everything in my life had just radically changed and it wasn’t until I was a lot more settled in that I could connect with people. I had the benefit of spending like 12 hrs a day, 4 days a week with the same people because of the way classes and projects were structured in my major and it *still* took me until probably mid-October to have even remotely frequent social gatherings with people. At some point I just... started following people to dining halls. Still bffs with some of the people I was originally awkward sort of pals with during welcome week, but it took time. I think the fast &amp; hard, joined at the hip for life relationships some people make early on are definitely the exception and not the norm.",1568260497,1,0

"I didn’t make friends until sophomore year, it’s totally normal, you’re not alone. Nyu being in an urban campus means there’s sometimes a lack of community.  But the pro is youll grow plenty and learn to be independent and self sufficient.

But that doesn’t mean give up on social connections, keep trying, all it takes is one friend to click with to change your entire experience and introduce you to more friends and great experiences. Freshman year I was so obsessed with making friends, and then sophomore year I magically made a few close friends. It happens when you least expect it sometimes. Every semester is a totally different experience and an opportunity to make new connections. Have fun and be bold, remember EVERYONE wants to make friends (or more friends) so don’t be afraid to take initiative and actually invite people to do stuff.",1568259543,1,0

A lot of people at Clive pursue a minor because NYU makes it pretty easy to fulfill. 

Clive is an intense program. I actually think a lot of people don’t realize how much work it is until they get here (I definitely didn’t). It’s good work, but it’s a lot. Especially if you get CME first semester haha

"Possibility of Double Majoring

Hey y’all,
 
I’m a senior in hs planning on applying early decision to the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at Tisch. 

Im also really into computer science and programming, and was hoping I would be able to pick up a double major in CS (ba at cas, not tandon) when I arrive at school. I looked at the elective and gen ed credits available for Clive, and it is technically possible, but I was wondering realistically from a student perspective: how possible is it to do this?

 I know both programs are really intensive, so I was wondering if this is a ridiculous amount of course load. I’m willing to work extensively and devote lots of time into studying what I’m passionate about, but I wouldn’t want to stay a 5th year to graduate because of tuition.

 If any one has any experience picking up a double major, or is majoring in either of the areas I described, I would really appreciate some insight. 

Thanks in advance!",1571466115,1,0

I majored in economics because I love it, and added the math major because my undergrad’s program was also only a BA. I worked for two years but decided to come back for a Master’s to eventually get a PhD. People in my cohort feel similar to how I feel: economics is very generic and companies would probably opt for someone who majored in computer science or business instead of someone with just an economics degree. I think all my Master’s is preparing me for is getting into a PhD program, which is not for everyone.",1572461797,1,0

"Far less people in LS than CAS. What this means is there are let's say only 1000 slots a year for Liberal studies students. We can assume they accept the Top 1000 students that applied to LS or GLS, are undecided, and then the rest of the slots go to those who don't meet the requirements for CAS. The idea that LS is ""easy"" to get into is *really* misleading considering the amount of students that actually get into the program is incredibly small. 

The simple answer is that if you don't think you'd get into CAS you probably won't make LS. The acceptance rate for the entire school was 15% this semester, and its gotten more and more competitive every year. There are a few hundred qualified students that already have GLS as their first choice (100% job placement rate and extreme travel is attractive to a lot of students), and the rest of the slots are chosen pretty meticulously. There's a video on the sub that was submitted a few days ago about what admissions consider when reviewing applications, but I'm afraid you're a few years too late to bank on LS accepting ""CAS rejects""",1572458836,1,0

"Depends on what you mean by easier. Math for econ covers like 90% of the same material as calculus, while omitting some of the more obscure topics, and shoehorns in some real-world economic examples. Normal calculus is more focused  on pure math and the theory behind it, so whichever one of those sounds more appealing.

However, just some personal advice, I'd recommend you take calculus just in case you want to apply to grad school or something, because it's a pain in the ass to have to explain ""no, this class is totally the same as calculus I swear"" to the person looking at your transcript. To someone who's not familiar with the way NYU econ does things, MFE - from first glance at the name - looks like the dumbed down math classes that other schools have business majors take (speaking from firsthand experience, having to explain the classes and provide the syllabus/textbook to bureaucrats). So, since you have the option, I'd recommend the safe standard route and just take calculus.",1572458425,1,0

"Paying tuition at NYU will depend entirely on your financial aid package. If you received 0 scholarships/grants, you can take out the first year limit of $5,500 (part subsidized/unsubsidized) loans in your name. You would then need to secure the remaining balance (lets say $60K) via Parent PLUS loans or private loans. If your parents are denied a PLUS loan, you are then eligible to increase your own loan to $9,500. Then the remaining balance of that would have to be done via private loans (usually with a co-signer). 

So if you are asking if you can take out the full balance of your tuition via loans, the answer is yes. That said, it depends on approval criteria and limits. Outside of loans, the other way is to work and pay your way through school at the same time. It sounds like you may have more questions or confused about a specific part of the process.

As long as your roommate isn't gonna complain to the RA, I'm convinced no one will care otherwise.

It's not unusual for dormers to sign the same person in every single day, so you don't have to worry about that part of it being weird or anything.

Even as I think about it, the most strict dorm I've heard of (Clark) allowed one of my friends live in someone else's dorm for the better part of a year.

"The price of all of them is 9.25K GBP - that’s the universal price for all UK Unis regardless of how prestigious it is.

UCL is ranked lower than Leeds (13th vs 6th place) and Southampton is just one spot behind it (14th).

School name matters in CompSci just like in most subjects - recently read a post on r/cscareerquestions where a guy said he graduated from a well regarded uni (MIT, Harvard, Yale, he didn’t specific which of the 3) and despite having no experience and projected outside of the one he completes for uni, he got accepted into a FAANG company (FB, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) purely off school prestige.

Anyway, I’m considering the possibility of going to law school several years after graduating in case CS isn’t paying quite what I’d like it to. From what I’ve read you need a BSC at least, but if I was to apply to Harvard Law with a Southampton degree they’d probably spit on me and offer me to be a janitor. That’s where the NYU degree comes in - AFAIK it’s highly regarded and even has a good law program itself, if I graduate with good grades I should at least stand some chance at getting accepted.

"&gt;... which one of the five is the most highly regarded in the US? 

Do not pick your undergraduate institution based on prestige. None of those schools are particularly well known in the United States, and NYU admissions officers aren't going to admit you based on lay prestige anyway. (Note: STEM programs are much less impressed by where you went that social sciences/humanities programs.)

&gt;... end goal is working in the US.

I understand you want to work in the US, but NYU is a pretty expensive ticket in. You'd have better odds at just getting a few years of experience under your belt working for a corporation (e.g. Google) that has offices in both Europe and the US and then transferring over. 

You really don't need a MSc in computer science to do most jobs; experience, credentials, and keeping up with changing technology is more valuable than a degree you're getting for the sake of a post-grad visa.",1575604435,1,0
"Doing well at any of them is what's important, speaking at least as an American, none of those schools really stand out as being particularly famous or well-known. They're all part of the Russell Group (outside of Surrey) but they're going to lack the cache obviously of Oxbridge or of the other top UK unis like UCL, LSE, Imperial, etc. 

Go to whichever one is cheapest and that you like the most. At the same time, why do you want to study comp sci at NYU for your masters? NYU has a fantastic CS program but it's also incredibly expensive and CS is far less prestige focused compared to other fields. There are also other prestigious options for online programs such as GT's OMSCS or UT Austin's MSCS or UIUC's, which are all much cheaper and great options.",1575594890,1,0

"&gt;Is there any reason you chose CAS CS program over Tandon?

A few. I preferred the main-campus lifestyle and the liberal-arts curriculum, I feel that my CS education didn't suffer at all and I got to explore topics I'm somewhat interested in and otherwise couldn't. Courant is a very established institute, a lot of the professors are very esteemed. The classes are more theory-based but I've had a couple very practical electives so I don't really think that's a turn-off at all. 

There's the whole Tandon vs CAS thing but the gap has certainly shrunk between 2016 and now. After NYU bought poly in 2014 there were a lot of old professors still left over and a lot of improvements to be made to bring the engineering campus up to the same level as the rest of the schools. NYU's been pouring a ton of money into Tandon as a result and I think both are a fine choice these days. That said, CAS still has a higher bar for admissions and a lot more people try to transfer to CAS than out of it. As for the name recognition, I've realized in my job search that very few people actually know the difference, especially outside the area. About half the job listings actually had a distinction between ""NYU"" and ""NYU Brooklyn/Poly/Tandon"".

It's really up to you about what you want to do, what you're interested in, and what sort of people you want to surround yourself with. From your points, I'd say real-world applicability doesn't differ all that much—and in the end, you're going to college to learn CS fundamentals, not ""practical"" stuff you can learn on the job anywhere (although it's best to strike a balance between them).",1575397182,1,0

"Hey!

So NYU SPS DAUS is a small program. Its intention was to serve non traditional students. (Aka older than 25 returning to finish a degree,  professionals switching careers, etc). The schools honor society is even one for non-traditional students. I am a DAUS student and fall into that category. However, the school has shifted from that (probably because there just aren’t enough non traditional students). The school is leaning traditional aged students now with a very high percentage of students being international. 

Now DAUS, does have a reputation of being an easier school to get into, which I would say is a fair reputation. There are also very limited majors.

As a DAUS student, I’ll tell you my classes so far have been a toss up. Some classes I have found very fulfilling and academically enriching while a couple have been easier than I would expect. 

Some benefits of DAUS include super small classes (I’ve never had more than 18 and there are no lecture hall classes) and a unique opportunity to learn alongside people who work in the field.

Overall, it isn’t the school for everyone. If I was a “traditional” college student, I don’t think it would be the place for me. However, if NYU is the dream, you can transfer out of SPS if your accepted there after a year into another school (but that isn’t guaranteed and is a calculated risk)

"Interestingly, I recently met with my screenplay writing professor to talk about grad school prospects. He adamantly recommends doing something else undergrad, and then going to film school as a grad student. Why? Because your interests are always changing, most people agree that you learn more in grad school, and perhaps most notably: nobody is going to hire a 21-year-old director. 

That being said, NYU *is* a **good** film school. You probably aren't going to get ""the same education somewhere else"" except for maybe USC. And, as this same professor noted to me, the NYU name actually means something in the industry unlike most other film schools.

Additionally, recognize that just because only a handful of alumni are winning oscars doesn't mean that those are the only success stories from this school. There is a whole world of filmmakers who don't make headlines yet consistently get jobs and make content. I recently spoke with 2 alums, one who has made documentaries for NYT and another who just animated the *Spiderman: Homecoming* titles.

"NYU does mixed merit-need; what this means is that no scholarship is given solely on merit (or at least you wouldn't know it). Transfers do get financial aid but I believe priority is on freshman students. You don't apply for a specific scholarship, you just apply and hope. 

The likelihood is very low. Honestly, from what I've seen, NYU doesn't really give that much in merit aid. My friend who got one of the Vandy full scholarships was given literally $1,000 in merit at NYU. The people I know with full scholarships also tend to come from less fortunate backgrounds (though I mean... I know very few people with full scholarships because they're so rare.

If there is 0 curve (unlikely for a math class) and if the lower bound for a C is 65 you should be okay (esp if the final is worth less than 40 and your grade is over 80).

"To answer your question, yes and no. 

Yes, the security guard must wake you up to ask for your ID if you don't already have it out. The reason they ask to see an ID in the first place overnight is because they want to make sure only NYU students/faculty/staff are there overnight. The policy says any other students from other universities and visitors/guests at Bobst must leave by 1AM. Thus, they ask for ID to kick those without ID out. 

Since you asked this question, I will take it that this was your first time sleeping/studying overnight at Bobst. Here is a tip from personal experience. If you have your ID on a lanyard laying or visible on your desk area, most will let you stay sleeping since they know you have your ID and can see it when they walk by. It is probably a sad state that I know that from the times I had to stay overnight at Bobst. Fortunately, those days are behind me.  Best of luck on your finals!",1576599889,1,0

"&gt; Keep in mind only the top 5-10% of Stern can make anywhere near that. 

If you mean 150k+ first year, yeah. but if we're talking about 6 figure salary, that's people in IB + the minority that goes into tech + top consulting which is significantly more than 5-10%. 

&gt; Most Stern kids don't even get starting 6 figures (hence the 84k average).

The average is without bonuses though it's true that most kids aren't starting off with a 6 figure salary. 


&gt; Stern is no way shape or form to get rich easy 

The average student makes more from their starting salary than the average American household makes in a year. It's not going to make you rich in the sense of Hamptons by your 30s and shit, but you will most likely have a much better life than the average person. It's important to not forget context and remember that it is incredibly abnormal in the first place to have a 6 figure salary right from the start and that the only industries where this really happens is in finance/consulting and tech. 

&gt; I feel like a lot of people reallllllly overhype the business school.

That I agree with. Business schools are business schools are business schools.

"I wanted to go into a program at NYU that's really well-renowned, so I spent a lot of time reading up on the work published by big-name professors in that department (Wikipedia's NYU Faculty page is good for this!) and then looking up what classes they taught at the undergrad level (NYU Albert has a public course search for current/past semesters). Then I spent a paragraph of my essay talking about what aspects of the professors' research I admire and how I hope to learn from them in the classes they teach (I mentioned the class and professor specifically).",1577690820,1,0
"Double majoring in CAS is feasible as long as you plan your courses carefully, but absolutely do not attempt to triple major unless you know for a FACT that your majors will have cross-listed courses. I'm triple majoring in the humanities/social sciences and I know a couple other people doing the same, but all of us have plenty of cross-listed courses and we all entered with a good amount of APs. Quadruple majoring is absolutely impossible (each major is 36-40 credits plus you have a handful of Core requirements, but you only take around 128-140 total credits in 4 years at NYU).",1577690280,1,0

Jokes aside, most people make 70-80k starting and there might be a hefty bonus, but you’re probably not making 6 figures straight outta undergrad Stern. People who make that much out of Stern probably has a rich daddy already who can seat them well. Now if you go get an MBA after selling your soul to whatever bank you get in for 2 years in Investment Banking (if you manage to survive that long that is), yes you might start getting around 150k (bonus included).",1577683505,1,0

"They are still available. If you want, reach out to their email: [bugscommunicationsteam@gmail.com](mailto:bugscommunicationsteam@gmail.com). If you want to do an open source project, read this guide as a preface to get used to it: [https://www.firsttimersonly.com/](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/). They are having a few projects in mind. But I'm not the main maintainers of them so I'll let them speak on that if you reach out. The nice thing about CS is that you can always start anywhere with any knowledge.

My first project, I make a derivative calculator using Java and JavaFX. It sounds cool but it literally just parsing string and do basic derivative, one you can do on paper. Then now, I start to experience a lot more with different framework and library. So just start with idea, a simple one and do it.

Regarding BUGS, they are as active as Tech@NYU in my opinion. However, the series of topics are not as connected as tech@NYU but still lots of cool topics. If you want to join, just come by to any of the talk or event. They usually have free food, though not much due to budget I think",1577682229,3,0
"Hi! I'm on the E-board of NYU BUGS. The e-board mainly organizes talks/events, but a few people on the eboard are working on open source projects for the NYU community:

&amp;#x200B;

* [schedge](https://github.com/A1Liu/schedge) is an open source API to NYU's course information. The goal is to make it easier for NYU students to plan out the courses they'd like to take. Right now it's owned by me, but I'm planning on giving ownership to the club once the repository is more stable.
* [The BUGS website](https://github.com/BUGS-NYU/bugs-nyu.github.io) is always open to contribution, and actually recently went through a lot of changes.

&amp;#x200B;

There were some other projects being built by tech@nyu and HackNYU, but I'm unsure whether they're still active; hopefully someone from one of those orgs can talk more about them here.",1577682159,6,0

All about networking and having a good GPA. Keep in mind only the top 5-10% of Stern can make anywhere near that. Most Stern kids don't even get starting 6 figures (hence the 84k average).

"Here's the electives I took and how I would rank their difficulty with Basic Algorithms (harder = higher rank):

1. Basic Algorithms (Shoup)
2. Applied Internet Technology (Versoza)
3. Linear Algebra (Bhat)
4. Large Scale Web Applications (Sovran)
5. Open Source Software Development (Klukowska)
6. Computer Graphics (Perlin)

All of the electives I took were pretty easy except AIT, which is not conceptually difficult, but the assignments take a while. I should note that I took Basic Algorithms with Shoup who I think is not a great teacher. I basically had to teach myself the class which made it twice as hard.",1577681679,1,0
