yeah i just really don‚Äôt want to deal with subletting and stuff like that :/ i‚Äôm just worried about whether or not they‚Äôll actually give me a spot in AV. do you think it‚Äôs likely w guaranteed housing?,1568353983,1,0
"AV‚Äôs popularity has varied the past couple years. When I applied for it under guaranteed housing (if you live on campus first year you can qualify, among other stipulations), it was a bottom choice for many and people who ranked it fifth or sixth got a lease in AV. However, this past year, I knew people who ranked AV first and instead got put in Campus Village. The nine months lease is honestly one of the biggest selling points, and there is a few other things to consider. The houses are themed, with many being Greek Housing. If you are not in those organizations, you won‚Äôt be put in that house. With the halls that are left, some are particular themes (CHP, Spectrum, Religious Studies) that cater to a very specific group of people. If I were you, when the time comes, make sure to get on the application early, rank AV first, and hope that you make it. From there, rank your theme preferences accordingly. I wouldn‚Äôt worry right now. It doesn‚Äôt seem like the least likely community to get into, but take a good look at your options and don‚Äôt let the nine month lease be your only determining factor.",1568353976,1,0

"Here is most likely the process you'll have to go through:

1) You will be accepted to UCI as Bus. Econ (assuming, since you tagged) 

2) For as many quarters as it takes, you will have to be a Bus. Econ major until you finish the following requirements: MATH 2A/2B, ECON 20A/20B, MGMT 7, 30A/30B and have a cumulative 3.0 GPA in the Management classes (\[Source\]( [https://changeofmajor.uci.edu/school-of-business/](https://changeofmajor.uci.edu/school-of-business/)))

&amp;#x200B;

My suggestion is to finish as many of the following classes that I listed at your community college. You probably have a lot finished, but whatever is left, you will have to take at UCI as your Bus. Econ major. After you've gone through your 1(+) quarters, you can submit a Change of Major request. You should also contact your Academic Advisor to let them know and if there are any other requirements. 

&amp;#x200B;

The hardest part is that as a Bus. Econ major, you will have to wait for a certain date to register for your remaining MGMT classes that you haven't taken. Often times, you might get inconvenient timings or get the class at all depending on how much it is demanded. I personally don't know how fast MGMT classes fill up, so I bet an Advisor can fill you in. 

&amp;#x200B;

i was in a very similar boat as you during my first year. although i came to uci with someone i was friends with in high school as my roommate, they dropped out pretty early into the year, so i was alone a majority of my first year. im also super shy most of the time, so its kinda like pulling teeth for me to get out of my comfort zone and interact with people. our stories are *so* similar that i also made a post on this subreddit talking about how lonely i was (crazy, right?!)

however, i can't tell you that things are going to drastically change and you'll have tons of friends in x amount of months/years, but please don't give up. it took me a while and putting up with a number of bad apples until i found somebody that i truly connect with and love spending time with. it will suck in the meantime, but its worth it when you find them!

Some professor emphasizes on essay-style that only requires you to understand/memorize certain KEYWORDS related to certain event/concept. If this is the case, I usually start by quickly reading the table of content to mentally categorize the chapters. Then as I read, I visualize as much as i can and try to make funny sentence connections where possible so they feel like a story flow. I also skip sentences that are pointless, for example: ‚Äútherefore this discovery serves as a valuable stepping stone for future research‚Äù.

For mcqs, they‚Äôre harder because they‚Äôre literally random facts and subtle conclusions, but visualizing and making connections still help. You also have to be able to predict and weed out info that have high chance not to appear on the test. Having a friend and making google docs together help as well ( each summarizes different portions of the pages ).",1570421334,2,0
"Honestly speaking, it'll only get a little better when you start talking to people. Maybe start off with small talk with people who you sit near in class that look friendly and approachable and talk to them about a hw assignment or how the class is going. This could go better if you start a conversation with someone who is alone and doesn't have any friends in the class. And then in the next meeting you can start to say hi/how are you/is it ok for me to get your number to talk about assignments etc....  From then on perhaps you guys can study at the library together too. There are a lot of people who are as shy as you are but hey no one knows that you are shy so just put yourself out there and make the best of it. Welcome to UCI, you'll do great :)",1570421225,1,0

usually, there are leaders of friend groups (the extroverts?). don't be afraid to ask them when the group will go out to do stuff, hang out in the building, or something like that. get people's numbers and join group texts by just asking for them in events with new friends. if u really care about it being awkward, the further time goes on and friend groups settle, the more awkward it can kinda get to move into one i suppose.

it's only the end of week 1. it's still the beginning of the school year. your part is to take initiative to find people and get to know people more.

tagging along is fine by the way. you aren't forced to add anything to a conversation. the next time somebody gives an open question to a group or talks about a topic generally/broadly, u can give ur own answer. that way, you'll know people more, and they'll know u more.

maybe ask broad casual questions on ur own that encourage discussion/storytelling? u don't hafta give ur own answer right away. just throw it out there and build up ur confidence as others give their answers.

"I‚Äôm a slow reader too, and I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how to do this... but I have found that usually you only need to understand the main idea, not all the minute details and examples an author usually provides. With practice you start to be able to skim and pick up where the main ideas are, write it in your notes, and skim over the details. Only read through the details slower if you didn‚Äôt understand the main idea the first time, and only write down details/examples you think will help you understand and retain the main idea.

Sometimes it helps to just highlight important points so you don‚Äôt disrupt your reading flow by taking notes, then go back after and paraphrase the parts you highlighted.

Unfortunately, I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs any quick ‚Äútrick‚Äù to being able to pick up main points while skimming, it‚Äôs just been a lot of practice for me. But I‚Äôd love to hear if anyone has any tricks lol",1570417144,4,0

"I‚Äôm a transfer chem major and I‚Äôm in my late 20s who‚Äôs graduating this year. I felt exactly the same as you when I first transferred and always felt insecure about my age when I‚Äôm around younger students. But what really helped me making friends was joining a club and research that I am passionate about. In my club, I was surrounded with younger folks and they didn‚Äôt care about my age. Tbh I was arrogant to think they‚Äôre going to act like kids but my younger friends act very mature and welcomed me with open arms. With my research, I‚Äôm surrounded by older folks, so that was perfect. I love both groups and I‚Äôm so happy that I met like minded individuals that didn‚Äôt judge me and taught me plethora of life lessons. 

My advice is to be open to meet with younger people. Find groups that you have the same hobbies/passion/major/goals. Be proactive and initiate conversations. You‚Äôd be surprised many students are very friendly. Also, give it some time. I didn‚Äôt meet my friends until Winter/Spring quarter of my first year at UCI.

"My advice would be to just swallow the feelings of being an extra and try your best to ignore the awkwardness.

It's just an unfortunate reality for many people but as you spend more time with people and acclimate to their friend circles they go away and the next thing you know you'll have new best friends and people to confide in.

Overall, just try to be aware of feelings in your own head that might be holding you back from making friends or making you be shy such as a fear of rejection.  Don't be afraid to journal about them or to see a counselor.

Just keep pushing through the awkwardness and always taking chances to meet new people.  Accept that there will be times where you will be rejected and your feelings will be hurt, and that is just the cost of making friends.  But i promise you that you will make friends.

\---

Five members of a UC Irvine fraternity have been charged in connection with the death of an 18-year-old student who died of alcohol poisoning earlier this year, prosecutors said Wednesday.

The Orange County District Attorney‚Äôs Office identified the five as Zavier Larenz Brown, 21; Jonathan Anephi Vu, 22; Mohamed Ibragim Kharaev, 21; Caleb Gavin Valleroy, 20; and Jonathan Gabriel Villicana, 21.

All face misdemeanor charges related to the death of Noah Domingo.

The freshman died on Jan. 12 after attending a ‚ÄúBig Brother Night‚Äù as part of a rush week event for his fraternity,¬† Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

The coroner ruled the cause of death was accidental acute ethanol intoxication. Domingo was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.331 when he died, according to the Orange County Sheriff‚Äôs Department.

Brown, Vu, Kharaev, Valleroy and Villicana were all members of SAE, and their names were on the lease of the off-campus campus fraternity house in Irvine where the event was held, a DA‚Äôs news release stated.

Investigators found no evidence that any of the defendants engaged in hazing in connection with Domingo‚Äôs death, according to prosecutors.

Brown, who was Domingo‚Äôs ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù at the fraternity, faced the most serious charge, a count of furnishing alcohol to a minor causing great bodily injury, the release read.

Vu was also charged with a count of furnishing alcohol to a minor.

All five defendants have been charged with a count of violating the city‚Äôs municipal code for allowing a party or gathering where underage drinking is permitted, according to the release.

Brown faces up to 18 months in jail if convicted on all counts, while Vu, Kharaev, Valleroy and Villicana each face a maximum 6-month sentence.

Orange County DA Todd Spitzer noted that current state law only allows prosecutors to file misdemeanor counts in cases involving alcohol being provided to anyone underage.

‚ÄúThe furnishing of alcohol to a minor that results in great bodily injury or death should be a felony, and the Orange County District Attorney‚Äôs Office is pursuing legislation to make that change,‚Äù Spitzer said in the release.",1572512178,1,0

Dont want to be judgemental but you should really evaluate how much time you spend studying or doing problems that aren't mandatory.

Most professors don't assign enough homework to actually learn the material if they assign any at all.

"yea the private variable is called hashFunction its type is HashFunction which is equivalent to 

std::function&lt;unsigned int(const std::string&amp;)&gt;. 

 So the hashFunction member variable is initialized to either a default or particular function depending on which constructor was called.

Wait, so when you want to use the add function for example. Let's say there's a HashMap hm and it was initialized with a HashFunction called hashFunction by the default constructor. You can do hm.add(""someone@gmail.com"",""pswd"") from the main.cpp. Then the add function in HashMap.cpp can have some code somewhere in it like: int index = hashFunction(key) % capacity? The add function can access the hashFunction member variable and since hm was initialized with the default constructor, the default hash function I wrote will be used by add() always? If hm2, another HashMap, was initialized with the other constructor that has a different hash function, then add() would use that other hash function when called using hm2? Is that right?",1574579880,1,0

"Ok so the hash function itself should be a method that you would use when you add keys, search for keys, and remove keys from your hashmap. So definitely in your add function, to get the index where you want to insert that key value pair, you should call your hash function.

Meanwhile he is profiting off speeches among other things for talking about these ideas, something the school is okay with so long as he reports what he has been paid so that they can decide what to pay him, on top of his salary, and what will go back to the school or his particular department. 

This isn‚Äôt okay because while yes it‚Äôs ‚Äòhis‚Äô research but it does not belong to him because the school is funding him. It‚Äôs a pretty standard right that they sign over when working for a school. Even my short tenure working at OIT, one of the documents I had to sign had some language stating that any discoveries or inventions I made under employment through them would belong to the school.",1575664997,1,0

"Hello, I've been spending a considerable amount of time on this and I made some progress (somehow) but here's what I've learned so far. Maybe it can help you!

&amp;#x200B;

1. [https://github.com/kahermans/PhoneBookDemo](https://github.com/kahermans/PhoneBookDemo) Look at her powerpoint slides she posted before. She basically posted all of the methods needed to get the groundwork on this project going like
   1. Reading + Writing to a Realtime Database
      1. you cant do anything with a database until you get an instance of it (the current state)
      2. and a reference of that instance (the directory of the database...)
   2. Switching Between Activities (Views of an app)
   3. Updating the interface in the List View
2. ListView is basically the portion of the interface where your information from the database will display. 
   1. The list view can populate by use of an adapter that you should suit to your needs revolving around the [message.java](https://message.java) class you create
3. Follow her slides on creating a custom adapter because you will not display any information properly without a proper adapter class!
   1. On that note, the ListView populates with multiple entries that are adapters. (e.g. a comment)

Also, someone has attempted to steal my bike by drilling through the locking mechanism of my u-lock, but they failed. All of these thefts occurred once I started leaving my bike in a high-traffic area. Prior to that, I kept it somewhere off the grid with fewer people so maybe lowering the odds of the bad guys finding it was a factor.

I also think that the only difference between a student getting an A and a student not doing well is not intelligence, it‚Äôs usually how much effort they put in. If you know you can put in effort, just trust your own ability to stick to your word! There‚Äôs nothing innately different about people who get good results. Just practice your ass off until you can honestly (!!!) say you feel like you have a really good understanding of the material. Also fuck the people who say a class is super hard or discourage you lol just practice",1577764291,1,0

"Psych Science professor here - I'll be teaching Psych 9C/PSCI 11C in the Spring.  I tell my students that they are welcome to use the 5th edition, as the 2 editions are very similar....but that ultimately they use the 5th edition at their own risk (given that the 6th edition is the official edition for the class).  Several students in my previous classes have used the 5th edition and no one has reported having any problems, so really, I think the 5th edition is just fine to use.

That being said, you should email the professor who is teaching it in the Winter and ask what she thinks, as she may run the class a bit differently than I do (and hence, might strongly recommend only using the 6th edition).

I do have a couple of extra copies of the 5th edition in my office (which I won't have any use for in the Winter quarter) - so, if you decide to use the 5th edition and would like to borrow one of mine, please just send me an email ([joanne.zinger@uci.edu](mailto:joanne.zinger@uci.edu)) and I would be happy to loan you one of my copies for the quarter.
