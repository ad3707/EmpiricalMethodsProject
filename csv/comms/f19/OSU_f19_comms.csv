I’ve only heard bad things about the mental health services here; long wait lists, waiting months for an appointment only to see an unlicensed doctoral student who can’t do anything for you, only getting a phone call after months on a waitlist, etc.",1573584172,1,0

"When I applied here, my unweighted GPA didn’t look so hot with a 3.4.

I started working over 25 hours during the week while enrolled in all my college and AP classes. I was volunteering in my free time. Yes, grades are important, but I think the greatest things OSU looks for is if you are well rounded. Can you manage decent grades while dealing with a job or volunteering? What do you do outside of school? Are you involved in any student organizations? These are important questions that I believe OSU really looks at when looking at applications. Grades do matter, but they are also looking for diversity and engagement. Really spend a hefty amount of time on your essay. That’s where you can put your personality into your application and make yourself stand out among the tens of thousands of applications the school receives every year. You got this!

"Failing a course is definitely disheartening, I've failed one, most have. Even though you think you should feel ashamed, you really shouldn't if you know you at least tried. When I failed Chem 1210 I felt pretty ashamed of myself, and started to overthink my entire existence. After about a week and a half of drowning myself in video games and Netflix, I realized that it was just a class, and that even though I did fail, I know I at least made an effort to pass the class. 

It didn't work out. Shit happens. I could either give up, or try again. When I re took the class I tried harder than I did last time, I learned from my mistakes, and applied myself. Ended up getting a 97% end semester.  I guess my advice would be to just allow yourself a bit of time to rest and keep yourself occupied with something you enjoy, remember that it's not the end, and that failing a class is not an abnormal thing to do. If you're planning on re taking the class, learn from what you did wrong last time and apply yourself the second time. 

Thinking like this is not an easy process. I still feel crushed after a bad quiz grade/midterm score, it's normal to feel this way. I just remember to keep my head up and never stop trying. And if you're having any emotional issues that may be adding to stress, I truly recommend talking to someone about them. Anyone.

"#You found the strength to write this...

...which is crazy hard to do, so __clearly__ you have what it takes to be here.

Chances are you are a high achiever and you can’t believe (nor accept?) that something (so simple sounding?) like moving away from home threw you for such a loop. Well, it did. And guess what? __It happened to all of us in our own way. __

It probably means you have a GREAT life back home with loving parent(s). My Dad was a dick, so it was _easy_ for me to move. The depression for me came later on and was over a breakup, but had the same effect as you with bad grades and depression. 

__ I GOT THROUGH IT. SO WILL YOU. THIS ISN’T THE END OF YOUR STORY. __

Get with Student Advocacy. Accept that this depression episode had a cost (financially, and maybe have to add a summer session to get back on track). SO WHAT! __Look at what you’ve gained here!__ You just learned something about yourself that is invaluable. And next time it happens to you you’ll identify it quicker and make more healthy choices about how to respond to it!

Think of it this way: you didn’t mean to do it, or want to do it, but you were forcibly enrolled in LIFE 311 lol. And this is a real class, as real as it gets. And to pass this class you have to be open and honest about what happened, and acknowledge that your high achiever ass has some “flaws” to work on (I don’t like that word, but stick with me here lol). This class has a professor (counselor) and labs (group session) and homework (practicing new, healthy behaviors) just like any other class. 

_And if you will just walk into that room and talk about your depression and take it seriously like any other class, you will not only feel better but also walk away with some pretty amazing and life changing tools._

"So freshman kinda get fucked here, when you go to pick dorms you choose by rates, meaning how much you wanna pay to live there. The more expensive usually means a nice place to live. You can go as a group of 4 but you will likely get put into the older dorms like drackett or Taylor (if you live on North side). Usually the nicer dorms get taken by sophomores but you could get lucky and get into one freshman year. It's based off a lottery and what rate you picked.

"How is it that everyone  words admissions posts in a brand new way every single time so automod doesn't catch it?

Please keep in mind the following when making posts about admissions:

* No one on r/OSU can accurately tell you if you will be admitted or not. Many things go into deciding whether or not someone will be admitted, and the admission standards can shift from year to year.
* Take a look at the ""Who gets in?"" page on the OSU Admissions website. It provides a class profile, and a brief overview of what admissions counselors look for in an application.
* Keep in mind that meeting the expectations listed on the admissions site, or having similar credentials to someone else is not a guarantee that you will be admitted. Year after year this subreddit receives a small number of posts from people who exceeded the admission requirements, but were not admitted.
* If you have specific questions about being admitted, your best bet is to contact admissions directly. Although r/OSU can be helpful, it's better to talk to the people actually making the decisions.",1570409187,1,0

Pre-majors can get into classes until they are well full and the wait list isn't possible. I was pre-major through middle of junior year. So in short, get ur GPA up above 3.2, then schedule hard classes. I became a business minor just to bump up my GPA (super easy minor imo).

Detrick in 2010 is a great professor to have! Like previous comments have said his exams are VERY similar to the homework questions.

I’d recommend skipping his lectures and watching Professor Leonard on Youtube or use OSU’s online lectures. Either are much more effective uses of your time than his lectures.",1576716079,1,0

"I had Baldwin for both Ochem 1 and 2, got an A- and A respectively. 

The biggest thing with Baldwin in my opinion is that she doesn't test you on anything she doesn't talk about. Her exams have a lot of concept-based questions and these are easy points if you write down *everything* she mentions in class, and read through your notes prior to the exam. 

Nomenclature is another thing she puts on every exam. Be sure you feel really comfortable with all the rules and be sure you know your functional groups as well.

Keeping up with your reaction notebook is also huge. Every time you learn a new mechanism in class I would take time after class later in the day to copy it over in your reaction notebook. Doing this really reinforces the concept and having a reaction notebook makes it easy to review mechanisms and reaction conditions for exams.

As for the weekly quizzes, if I recall correctly, she tells you what the quiz will be on either through a Carmen announcement or in class. She also uploads quizzes from previous semesters on Carmen so utilizing those will also be extremely beneficial. 

As for practice problems, her Problem Sets are very important. I would recommend doing every single problem set she uploads because the questions on these are very similar to ones you will see on quizzes and exams.

Finally, there's always additional help in the Organic TA room throughout the entire week. Baldwin also replies very quickly via email if you would prefer to ask her something directly. 

Good luck!",1576705429,1,0
