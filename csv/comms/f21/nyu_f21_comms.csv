"Anyone upper middle class+ will not get financial aid at top schools; they can hope to get merit aid, but none of the Ivies do merit aid (nor do S or M). So anyone who is the child of a doctor for example, or professors, etc. will likely either apply without looking for financial aid or apply without expecting to receive financial aid. The Ivies that grant financial aid for example, typically only have guarantees up until a certain point (like $65k for no tuition for example; Harvard promises that families that make less than $150k will pay no more than 10% of their income which is the highest one I've seen); past that, they promise to meet 100% of demonstrated need but there's no legal or widely agreed upon definition of that and every institution has its own way of calculating it. My friend at HYP for example, when he got his packages, received 3 Ivy acceptances and each gave him a different total cost of attendance; he told me that the spread between them was something like $30k which is huge (HYP was the most generous unsurprisingly). And those are the Ivies. NYU is really cash poor in comparison (check the size of our endowment vs. peer schools lol) and our financial aid is trash so while it doesn't hurt to apply necessarily, even middle class kids sometimes don't get any financial aid lol. 

And if you're an international rich kid (since we get a lot of those), you 

- a) don't really care about school prestige that much since it's not like it's going to change your circumstances that much, 

- b) NYU punches way above its weight in terms of international recognition (way more people just about anywhere outside of America are going to recognise NYU as a good school vs. Hopkins or Northwestern even though the latter 2 are typically considered T10/Ivy+ and are more reputable and prestigious than NYU in America), 

- c) if you aren't born in America, you likely aren't as familiar or don't want as much the traditional college experience, and NYC is one of the most fun places on Earth if you have the money 

- d) if you go to NYU, there is likely a community of internationals from your home at that school whereas at a smaller school (particularly LACs), you might be the only one from your country.",1633411969,2,0

"No, it‚Äôs competitive just like too many things these days unfortunately. Over 500 people rushed sororities alone so many people got cut/no bids since each sorority can only pledge the number of people Panhel tells they they can. Their new member limit is based on their existing membership numbers, Panhel or national quotas, etc.

There‚Äôs 3 days of rounds. First day of rush you talk to all 7 sororities. The 2nd day you talk to up to 5 sororities again. The last day you talk to 2 organizations for one hour each. You wait a week then you know if you got a bid or not. Some people I‚Äôve heard of got cut after day 1 or 2 with no sororities inviting them back.

Some sororities want philanthropy, some want personality more, and some seemingly want fashion/good looks/all of it. Each sorority has GPA requirements. Some don‚Äôt like accepting upperclassmen since they‚Äôre not going to be in the group as many years as freshmen would be.

I got a bid after all. I‚Äôve talked to several people in my rho gamma group. One girl got no bids, another 2 girls got their last choice sorority, and another girl got her top choice. Some people who rush sororities but don‚Äôt get their top choice of group drop out of rush before the process is even over, but my personal rho gamma group of about a dozen people all lasted throughout rush. One girl just didn‚Äôt get any bids. I‚Äôm not sure why she didn‚Äôt, but she was shy and also didn‚Äôt dress up for it. 

I‚Äôm not sure what the total number of people rushing vs. those who were offered bids were at NYU since they don‚Äôt publish the info.",1633227096,1,0

"That is not forward facing information, for the smaller schools within NYU you can‚Äôt find that info especially school of nursing. Ultimately though as an applicant it doesn‚Äôt really matter. Knowing the acceptance rates what will you do with this info?

If you‚Äôre not a senior, and have time to beef yourself up, just try to get good grades/make sure to be ready for SAT. 

To conclude, in the real world none of these numbers matter. When you‚Äôre a nurse in a couple years it won‚Äôt really matter where you went or what the acceptance rate was.

"I lived in Uhall freshman year and it was great. Nice distance from NYU classes (not too close to where you feel like you live on a campus and not too far to where you feel alone in nyc), apartment style and pretty recently renovated apartments. I think the biggest consideration you'll be making with dorming is apartment style vs traditional dorm style. I will always recommend apartment style for a number of reasons. 

(1) If you don't like your roommate (just keeping it real this isn't particularly unlikely) you don't need to be in the same room as them the whole damn day.

(2) You have a little kitchen area if you ever wanted to cook food.

(3) If you or your roommate ever want to bring someone home on the weekend one of you can crash on the couch in the living room.

(4) You can host a pretty decent amount of people in the living room of apartment style dorms.

The point people always make for a traditional style dorm room is that you have more space. IMO, who gives a shit. It's NYC, you're not gonna have a lot of space anyway and, again, *walls* are what give you privacy, not extra space.

&amp;#x200B;

I think UHall and Broome are the best freshman dorms. I say UHall because it's apartment style, great location close to two pretty good dining halls and nicely renovated rooms. It's also pretty centrally located between third north, founders, brittany and some upperclassmen dorms so it's really easy to make friends there. I say Broome really just because the location is so crazy. It's actually kind of a hassle to get to from other dorms and it's a bit secluded from the rest of NYU property, however, the rooms are pretty good and it's also apartment style which is a big plus in my books. Also living in the heart of Soho in *totally crazy* and something that you'll look back on later on in life as a really unique and special experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope that helped, if you have any other questions please feel free to DM me! I'm a senior now and there're a lot of things at NYU that I wished I had asked people older than me. Also people love giving freshman advice so don't feel silly for asking people you may know from highschool :)",1634513562,1,0

"Yes, OP does need to remember that the estimate does include federal loans in the estimate. 

I would be genuinely shocked if OP got a decent aid package at over 90K. They‚Äôre probably looking at huge private loans plus federal loans coming from a high income family. My EFC was $0 and my aid at NYU is still super low. I‚Äôm paying a lot in loans, cash, and taking fewer classes a semester to make it more ‚Äòaffordable‚Äô in the short-term. 

If I was OP, I would also apply to other colleges that actually have merit scholarships that are need-blind. NYU doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs hard to get merit scholarships coming from a high income family at a lot of schools, almost punishing students regardless of if their high income parents are willing to pay anything for their college or not. At my previous school, I paid for college 100% myself because of those.

""There are only two exceptions to the information above \[pertaining to Early Decision\]:  
  
1. If you are awarded a financial aid package that does not meet enough of your financial need to allow you to attend. In this case, you may request to be released from the agreement.

  
2. If you are admitted to a school, program, or campus of NYU that was not designated as your primary interest on your application, you are not required to enroll. However, you will be expected to accept or decline your offer of admission by the deadline for the notification plan under which you applied. Accepting our offer of admission under the Early Decision notification plan, even if you are admitted to a program of alternate interest, means that you have committed to the binding agreement and are expected to withdraw applications from other schools, and will not submit new applications.""",1634488023,4,0
"NYU financial aid overall is terrible for most people. At 90K family income, you won‚Äôt get any need-based scholarships and you‚Äôll be taking out loans (or parents paying) for most of your education. NYU offers very, very few merit scholarships that don‚Äôt have a need-based aspect, so the bulk of your education would be cash payment by you. It sucks that merit alone isn‚Äôt enough to land anyone much, but that‚Äôs the reality of it. Even if parents won‚Äôt pay anything, if they‚Äôre high income, you rarely get any aid.

90K is high income. I‚Äôm really surprised you ‚Äúonly‚Äù have to pay 38K based on the NYU calculator. Their offer might not end up being that good. My friend‚Äôs single mom made $24K a year living in Miami supporting 2 kids and he had to pay for over 75% of his education himself with loans. And he qualified for federal financial aid that you won‚Äôt (Pell grants). Don‚Äôt forget to factor in not just dorm costs but living costs. You‚Äôll need student loans for sure. 

Most colleges let you back out of ED if the financial aid package is impossible. NYU usually lets people.

Even if you apply to NYU, I would also apply to other colleges that are known for good aid that isn‚Äôt need-based. Also, you could consider getting a full-time job at NYU for their employee tuition benefit (a certain number of classes free each semester for employees).",1634487804,1,0

"One thing to keep in mind is that usually schools pay less to early decision admits admits in comparison to regular decision admits.

The rationale is, they are already committed so the school can take advantage of that. Whereas with regular decision folks, a school may have to do extra persuasion to win them over other offers a candidate may have received.

Additionally, most schools openly state that early and regular decision applicants are subject to the same set of standards and there is no advantage other than knowing college decision early if someone chooses early decision cycle.

If early decision folks have better admission rates it's more likely that only strongest candidates can prepare all the paperwork by the earlier deadlines, and since they decided on a specific school they probably researched that school much better and better written why the school is a great fit for them.

So, with all this said, if your financial situation is too precarious consider if early decision is the right application cycle. Additionally, if you are competitive for NYU, you may competitive for other schools with better aid. If you get better aid offer by them upon admission you may negotiate with NYU for better aid.

I have seen anecdotal evidence that can be one way of upping your aid package should you get admitted to multiple good schools.

I cannot ascertain if this is a robust strategy so l encourage you to dig deeper.

&gt;Should I be optimistic about my financial aid package. I heard there are a lot of opportunities to majorly decrease the amount students pay yearly.

This is not true. While it is possible it is certainly not a given and will depend on a spectrum of factors. I go to Shanghai which is financial more generous than NYC, and my annual aid did not budge despite some serious issues. I did receive one-off increases ( largest was $2900), which while appreciated, was nowhere enough to address my troubles.

Maybe NYC is better with further adjustments as you get further in the program, so ask this around too, but I will be surprised if they are.",1635665922,1,0

Given the limitations of the medium, an anonymous Reddit post and no proper statistics, I do not think there's any way you can find a proper answer.

And, beware that questions as these often have sampling bias. For instance, only people who did not make friends may comment and instead of giving insight will create an echo chamber.

As I go to the Shanghai and due to my own strong introverted tendencies I myself cannot weigh in one way or the other.

But I think it's better to reflect on why you could not forge meaningful connections and how it is affecting the quality of your life.",1635664566,19,0

"It really just depends, honestly there's a lot of factors that go into what your financially aid package will be. I've heard people get really great ones and people get bad ones. For me what really was great was that they gave me a pretty big merit scholarship, without that things would be tough. So depending on what school in NYU you applied to and your high school grades you might get a merit scholarship. You might also get a need-based scholarship but that depends on your parents financial situation (their yearly income etc.). I know you mentioned your Dad is unwilling to pay, so that plays a huge factor. I don't exactly remember but I think you could note somewhere when filling out the financial information that one of your parents is supporting you financially. It all really depends on your Fasfa and NYU's financial aid determination system. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I would say is that you should start looking for scholarships online. Literally anything that you fit the criteria to apply to (whether by gender, race, state, interests, hobbies, parents jobs etc). Even if its not a big $10,000 every little bit counts and there's so many scholarships out there. Also maybe this summer if it's possible you could get some sort of job and save up all that money to help out as much as possible, whether with tuition or with things later on like books and supplies. Hopefully tho, all works out and you'll get a great financial aid package, but I would say the best thing to do right now is not stress over it too much because its out of your hands. If it's meant to be it'll work out. And find other sources of money to possibly help pay for college, and hey maybe you'll get such a good package that any money you gather on your own can just use towards your school supplies or pocket money for when you get on campus",1635656408,2,0

A BA from a school like NYU should represent a basic broad University education. If you pursue a BS, masters or doctorate, the discipline you choose matters more to your future career track. But a BA? Follow your passion and have some fun. You'll stand a better chance of making it through and maybe be a more rounded human being for it in the end.

"One course of action you may want to consider is applying for a Incomplete grade if an earlier examination date cannot be arranged.

An Incomplete grade is granted under special circumstances‚Äî medical emergencies or equally serious situation‚Äî when a student has completed most of the course and upon approval by the course instructor and Academic Affairs the pending coursework can be submitted at a later date than the original deadlines set by the aforementioned parties.

The exact terms and conditions will be stipulated in an Incomplete Agreement that school will provide you with in the event you are granted an Incomplete Grade.

Until pending coursework is complete, a grade of I will appear on your transcript as a placeholder grade and later upon successful resolution of your incomplete be converted to a letter grade.

If you cannot complete the coursework by alternate deadline a grade of F will be placed. This deadline can be extended too if you situation warrants it.

If this emergency is brought up by health situation you would need to provide supporting medical documentation and this is where either Moses Center for Student Accommodation or  Health and Wellness can step in.

Please understand that mental health problems‚Äî such as anxiety, clinical depression‚Äî qualify as valid problems and if your family emergency is impacting seek medical counsel immediately.

For contact with Moses I strongly suggest reaching out to Bridget C. Betts, Senior Accessibility Specialist &amp; Global Liaison Moses Center for Student Accessibility. My experience with her is that she is incredibly helpful, caring and supportive.

And if we have more cops just on the lookout for criminal activity, that‚Äôs just them using their own discernment to see who is or seems like they are committing a crime. Anything that is led by personal discernment will have implicit bias and in the NYPD that disproportionately affects black people. There are black people who got arrested in the park for simply selling their art because they‚Äôre viewed as threats all the time.

"I'm now a senior, but I went through a lot of these feelings my freshman year. Ultimately, I still don't love NYU as a school. There are problems with socializing, class, judgement, administration, cost, and congestion. But I also have had a number of wonderful professors teaching interesting classes, and I have taken so much from just walking around the city for hours, taking everything in. It's certainly not for everyone, and if I was doing things over again I might very well go for a different NYC school. That said, there's a lot to gain from finding your niche in the city. It's a big place, and odds are that places exist within it that would feel more compatible with you.

On two of your specific points:

If you stick with NYU and plan on dorming still, look into Clark St. or even Othmer. You'd have to take the NYU shuttle or the subway to get to classes on campus, but it's a much quieter, less intense environment over there.

People dressing up for class like it's an event are either freshman with inflated expectations of how they should look, pretentious people that will be jerks no matter what you do, or just nice people that like dressing up but don't expect you to. Wear what feels comfortable, whatever that means to you.",1639865448,1,0

"Hello


I came to NYU under a state-sponsored program for broke people whose grades would be inadmissable through NYU's general admission. However this meant I had to put more work into the process: I had to attend a summer semester before freshman year as a sort of trial run, had to have a fuck-ton of support classes for freshman fall and spring semester, it was insane for me because I wasn't used to it.

In the freshman year, I gained a lot of weight. And I mean a LOT of weight. 30-40 pounds. I would go to UHall's Burger Studio (rest in peace) with my roommates sometimes and chat with them, and subconsciously eat my stress away. A lot of classes tested my patience and seeing the rest of the university return, I felt so out of place. I felt like I didn't belong.

At one point I came to the realization of a couple of things: I would hate living in Manhattan (and I'm from Queens), I haven't lost the weight and I'm literally graduating like -2 days ago, I still wear sweatpants anywhere cuz fuck that shit I want to be comfortable, but MORE IMPORTANTLY I belong here regardless. It took a little longer for me to get my degree since I'm graduating in a December but being able to get through classes one by one and sometimes being able to crank out all the work of the semester in two weeks were moments that show me I have the absolute drive to belong here and be just as competitive as everyone else.

I have goals of losing weight when I go home and have free time for myself since it's all over for me. And maybe I can start wearing nicer looking things. But it was important to learn during all of this that I belong in this university and that fuck what everyone else is doing, you are the only one that determines your future and how you feel.

I hope you don't forget everything you've done to come here. I look back at it and it gives me that reassurance, and I hope it does the same for you.",1639850304,1,0

"Current GLS student in NYU Madrid.

The community is small, and you'll get to know everyone. This can be a good thing or a bad thing‚Äì‚Äìtea travels fast, and you can't just disappear after pulling a stupid stunt. 

Brush up on your Spanish. Most people don't speak english. You will have quite a few interactions with government organs and forms, and they're all in Spanish. Covid passports, tarjeta de residencia, etc. 

Day drinking is legal, and encouraged (drinking age is 18, and is hardly enforced). However, try not to show up to class smashed. Not a good look. 

**Have a copy of your passport in a safe place.** 

Spanish courses are rigorous‚Äì‚Äìeven Spanish 1 will be taught completely in Spanish. 

You are in Europe. An average round trip ticket to Paris will cost you 20‚Ç¨-30‚Ç¨. Book flights and trains early. They get exponentially more expensive the longer you wait. Youth hostels are cheap too.   
Get a local SIM card. They're 10 euros/month. Don't pay $200+ a month for some stupid roaming plan. It's not worth it. You won't be able to order UberEats or delivery or an Uber otherwise.  
Get WhatsApp. It's how the rest of the world texts.

  
Get your student metrocard ASAP. you will be told you can only do this online, but this is false. Go to the Oficina de Metro at Moncloa or Sol (ask around to where you get a ""tarjeta de metro personal"" and you'll get there eventually. Don't forget to bring your passport, and they'll print you a card then and there. ‚Ç¨20/month student unlimited.   
Go to Kapital, once. Don't go again. It's overrated.  
Get your EU Vaccination Passport. It makes travel 10x easier.   
Get an international Drivers' license from AAA. Otherwise you won't be able to rent a car. Also make sure that the car you're renting is an automatic, unless you know how to drive stick.

If you want to explore, rent a moped for a day. A motorcycle is probably the fastest way around a european city. You can park it anywhere (like seriously, you can park it on a sidewalk). However, beyond 50cc, motorcycle license needed (Class M/MJ on your license).

"First thing I will say is that the Stern econometrics/quantitative economics concentration is amazing and will more than give you a satisfying economics experience. The frontiers in economics sequence is honestly the best set of classes I have seen here at stern (obviously biased but you‚Äôll probably agree w me there). 

That said, my only problem with Stern econ is that it‚Äôs a small department. In any given semester there aren‚Äôt more than 5 electives being offered which sucks big time bc then you‚Äôll feel like you need to have another concentration or minor to fill in the gaps. Luckily tho that has an easy fix. Courant and the Comp Sci program at NYU are amazing too! You‚Äôll probably benefit a lot from taking stern quant econ classes, comp sci classes, and advanced math classes at courant if you want to have a truly complete econ experience. If you want additional econ classes, the CAS econ department is a top 10 program with a LOT of electives available. And yes, with the stern route you‚Äôll be in a great position to go into grad school.

I obviously can‚Äôt speak for CAS econ, but I would say that you should consider that it‚Äôs much easier to take CAS classes as a stern student than it is to take Stern classes as a CAS student.

Either route you go you will be fine. NYU AND stern are both god tier econ programs.

"The why NYU essay, in my opinion, tests two things.

1) What you know about NYU?

2) Why you are a good fit for the school?

Step 1) is relatively easy, so much so it's truism but somehow I made the fatal step actually not digging too deep about NYU online when I applied.

 Step 2) is where you need to sit back &amp; reflect on what drew you to the school in the first place and how the school aligns with your future goals &amp; ambitions.

The typical advice of being authentic still goes. Avoid putting in something there that you think the school would be impressed with but really has nothing to do with who you are.

E.g : I cited one my favourite video games, BioShock, in my why NYU essay ( and no, it was not a totally random and did fit in with the argument I put forward).

Good luck!",1640902451,1,0

What I did was I just searched through the school‚Äôs websites and wrote about activities that I was interested in. Just make sure to write about things that are unique to NYU.

"The most significant difference for me is a comfortable, convenient and diverse life outside of school -- food concerts shopping etc., if you're into those kinds of things. Every decent school like NYU has quality academics, but I'd say NYU probably offers more options (eg. No. of major). Internship opportunities only apply to certain majors I think, like business, CS... yeah study abroad is a fun experience but maybe other schools have similarly good programs. Diversity wise it's certainly one of the best.",1640899281,1,0

"well he's asking about the best bank for international students and not being about to build a credit score with some US bank is worth considering.

On top of that, while getting a SSN may be easy, not everyone has time to get an on campus job or work as a TA. Those are big time commitments.",1640895194,1,0

but the \*\*EXTREME\*\* covid theater and near-total lockdowns are such an overreaction that they are ruining everyone's college experience (and its even more extreme now than it was at the beginning of the semester i.e. its getting worse).

Right now, we are expected to pay full tuition for Spring 22 semester, yet we don't even know if it will be in person, or on zoom.

Plus, nearly all social activities are cancelled, the entire university, gyms, library, everything is shut down.  Heck, you can't even have a guest (even a fellow NYU student) in your dorm room, and there are people who I have been in classes with an entire semester, yet I've never seen their face.

"just wanted to chime in about the last part


Being black at NYU hasn't affected my experience at all. I've done almost everything the white kids have done and there's really no majority here. Your race won't matter at all here, if anything what matters is class. If you're a poor kid going here on scholarship you will stick out, guaranteed.  There'll be a lot you just won't be able to experience because you're not an adult with an allowance.  So if that's the case for you I'd step back and reconsider, if not you have nothing to worry about.",1640887484,1,0
I mean OP didn't ask about credit cards or building credit scores. Even then credit scores are only really beneficial if you want to get a mortgage maybe.
