"I will say that one of the reasons I chose us over NCSU was because of the theoretical background as opposed to an application focus. Having seen the underpinnings used to derive processes and other things that I don‚Äôt even know exist yet would be far superior than just knowing the existence of some current technologies (though BOTH are necessary and I think we‚Äôre moving in the right direction).

BUT, Ive had great professors under STOR as well. Only had 4 I can name, one of whom was a PhD student, and 3 of them were/are so far very solid.

"Thanks, it is kind of a different vote philosophy than I'm used to on reddit.

I could've better expressed my thoughts by being more explicit about who I was referring to. In my head, I classified transfers as people who planned coming and people who didn't plan because they didn't like their school for whatever reason. I was referring to the latter.

Those transfers make up a lot less than the first group, but still a significant amount of people at any large school. It's not harder because you're a transfer, yes, its because you're new. But I think cases when you hear someone's transferring from like other state schools or liberal arts schools its worth being more mindful. Especially if its a prestigious school.

Say I transferred from Duke (I didn't). I actually would be more ok with someone saying, 'oh did you not like it' than the vibe 'ohh why would you transfer from there?' But still would rather not have to explain at all. 

That's more the idea I was trying to defend. No, you can't expect people not to ask, but we can be more mindful and aware of transfer students in the second camp who didn't have a positive social experience wherever they transferred from.",1632515583,0,0

When I was originally a transfer many years ago no one ever asked me if I was a transfer. Are you supplying the information in conversations?

"Hi- biostat alum here. Don‚Äôt worry about only 20 people getting in! Think statistically (ha!) - not that many people apply because a) not that many people major in math and b) not that many people know about/want to be in public health. So while it may seem like a really small number of people who get in, the acceptance rate isn‚Äôt bad. 

In general, like the other poster said, try to do well in your quant classes. You might be able to take BIOS500H, the intro class, in the fall of your sophomore year without being a major if you talk to the director for the undergrad program (Dr. Jane Monaco). That‚Äôs a great way to show that you‚Äôre interested as well as confirming for yourself that you‚Äôre interested. Dr. Monaco is also just a wonderful human, so I recommend meeting with her. 

Otherwise, I‚Äôd recommend trying to get involved in health/stats stuff in general. Look into research that‚Äôs happening at Gillings and find something you find interesting. If you can talk about that in your application, awesome. Even if you don‚Äôt get in, you can still pursue a major like stats and do research with a professor in Gillings. As someone who‚Äôs worked in biostatistics for a while, being interested in the field is more important that getting a degree in biostatistics specifically (vs stats, CS, math, etc). If you find that you enjoy it, you‚Äôre always going to be able to find a way into the field, so don‚Äôt worry!

&gt; I‚Äôm no expert but I‚Äôm gonna call BS that the soda machines aren‚Äôt ever working in lenoir because of AirGas. The actual problem is more than likely that the bags-in-boxes of syrup are empty, and they aren‚Äôt changing it. If you look closely, the stuff coming out of the soda machines is still soda water, which means it is still perfectly carbonated and therefore *i believe* that it has nothing to do with AirGas.
&gt; Source: am a Kitchen Manager at the Franklin St Chipotle. We use AirGas for our soda machines too and they just spurt soda water if the syrup bags are empty; we just have to hook up a fresh one. The syrup bags come from coca-cola or wherever (Lenoir has Pepsi products, if I‚Äôm not mistaken?) so this *might* be an issue with their supplier, but it‚Äôs just hit or miss and sometimes they do actually work so, again, it‚Äôs more than likely that they just aren‚Äôt changing them when they get empty

Also, my thoughts on why the ice cream machine in Chase never works: I am not responsible for operating any ice cream machines at my restaurant, so I don‚Äôt know how they work. That being said, there was a whole section of the ServSafe Food Protection Manager course (standardized certification for food safety; think like driver‚Äôs license) on ice cream machines, and they seemed like a bitch to clean and keep sanitary. I remember thinking, ‚Äúman I would hate to have an ice cream machine.‚Äù So, I am not sure about this, but I would imagine they just turn it off so they don‚Äôt have to continually clean/sanitize it.

"I‚Äôm no expert but I‚Äôm gonna call BS that the soda machines aren‚Äôt ever working in lenoir because of AirGas. The actual problem is more than likely that the bags-in-boxes of syrup are empty, and they aren‚Äôt changing it. If you look closely, the stuff coming out of the soda machines is still soda water, which means it is still perfectly carbonated and therefore *i believe* that it has nothing to do with AirGas.

Source: am a Kitchen Manager at the Franklin St Chipotle. We use AirGas for our soda machines too and they just spurt soda water if the syrup bags are empty; we just have to hook up a fresh one. The syrup bags come from coca-cola or wherever (Lenoir has Pepsi products, if I‚Äôm not mistaken?) so this *might* be an issue with their supplier, but it‚Äôs just hit or miss and sometimes they do actually work so, again, it‚Äôs more than likely that they just aren‚Äôt changing them when they get empty",1631501833,26,0
"huh i feel really differently. like i think the ‚Äúsoutherness‚Äù of north carolinians comes off in a way that is usually really nice and really neighborly. people i have met are really open to building community rather than being selfish or near sighted. change can be hard for sure, but i think people are willing for to do things that are for the good of the community, just some nuts are tougher to crack (if that makes sense). like i think that‚Äôs a big part of southern culture since a lot of places are really small / tight knit communities. some more welcoming than others for sure (i feel like there is definitely an anti-outsiders vibe sometimes ‚Äî just recently moved to maine and some mainers just reallllly hate anyone out of state, for good reason probably) but idk i think you‚Äôll find people like that anywhere you go and i don‚Äôt see that as a cultural/social thing in NC that much.

"North Carolinians' geographical position in the U.S. is such that they get a lot of the good and bad of the East Coast and the South at the same time. The cities are more East Coast, the rural areas more South. I'll try to sum it up in one compliment and one criticism.

Compliment: A yes means yes and a no means no in North Carolina; you always know where you stand with a North Carolinian and what they expect from you, giving you a better chance of succeeding in a personal or work relationship than a lot of places. There's a general absence of game playing here that is admirable af.

Criticism: North Carolinians have a ""get what's mine"" attitude that makes them painfully myopic, to the point that others' time and experiences are the last thing taken into account before forming an opinion or choosing a course of action. The overall result is that this population is easily, by a landslide, the most stressed out I've lived around.",1631498828,13,0

Socialism is a theory about how the framework of a society should be organized. Other examples are fascism, conservatism, liberalism, and communism (among other in between).

"Slight correction: CSTEP is a direct and *guaranteed admission program for students of low to moderate incomes.

Hamilton hall is the biggest eye sore on campus, the cheap 70s architecture has pretty much no character, the building is in a color the meshes with no other buildings on campus, and for literally no reason it is abnormally tall. Kenan/Morehead labs are cool, they are unique, and the area between them with all the crosswalks is so gorgeous. However, I have never in my life heard someone say they like the atrocity that is Hamilton hall. SMH.",1633536586,9,0

- Location is awesome! Proximity to Franklin and UNC buildings is unbeatable
- I have sink in my room which is pretty convenient. However, it is pretty small so you won‚Äôt be able to fit a lot of dishes at the same time
- There is lounge on 4th floor with TV and Xbox
- Lounge and architecture on the first floor are very pretty 
- There is laundry downstairs, so you won‚Äôt need to go to other buildings in Kenan community

- Room‚Äôs layout is awkward and as the result, there is very little sunlight. Make sure to bring lamps with you! 
- There are a lot of complaints about spiders in the dorm, but I personally never had any problems with those

"Hi. I‚Äôm not sure I have much advice, but your post resonated very deeply with me‚Ä¶ I think we probably have a lot in common. I‚Äôm on track to graduate in December but it has been a truly desperate struggle with finances and mental health. I withdrew for a few years after having a crisis, and returning has been so hard and if I weren‚Äôt really close to getting degree (which has been framed my whole life as the magic ticket to success) I‚Äôd really consider other options. I‚Äôm not sure I made the right choice by returning, and my degree feels worthless because my grades have been all over the place and I haven‚Äôt built relationships with professors or done substantial research. But that‚Äôs just me. 
Hopefully if you decided to return in person, you could look into renting somewhere you can have your kitty and a bit of peace. Feeling isolated in the dorms was absolutely soul-crushing, as was getting sucked into living situation/friendship drama and chaos in the years that followed. I have two kitties whom I absolutely adore (and worry about so much!! I totally get that!) and rent a cute house in Carrboro with pleasant, introverted, calm housemates. That has made a world of difference. I know you‚Äôre dealing with an extra layer of difficulty if he isn‚Äôt used to being indoors, but maybe it could work out. I was terrified of mine getting out/ in the road because they used to be barn cats in the middle of nowhere, so I kept them in my room for about a month and gradually let them get comfortable in the house/with my roommates, and now they have the run of the house. 
If you take a break and withdraw, you have still accomplished everything academically up until now. And outside of formal academia, you can absolutely engage with conceptual ideas and compile research on topics that interest you. For example, if you start a creative writing project or a podcast or a video essay series that overlaps with what you‚Äôve studied. Just an idea. This is easier said than done, but I wonder too if you might find an intellectually stimulating volunteer opportunity in a library or museum that could turn into a job down the line. I hope things start feeling a little easier soon. Take care, and you are absolutely welcome to DM me.",1634611797,1,0

OP, please give yourself permission to walk away. There may be a day when you wake up and know you're ready to take a journey to finish a degree. It doesn't have to be this major. It doesn't have to be at this school. If you only see one possible end for you coming back, think of the alternative that not coming back opens up a whole world of possibilities.

Surely unintended! But this framing leaves fathers out in the cold and signals that women have special access to compassion and to their kids' emotional needs.

It's also a bit off for those students who have two dads.

No sour grapes here: this was a wonderful thing. I am just glad to see the reorientation toward ""parents.""",1634595145,11,0

"It depends a lot on the program. Some of the more competitive ones will be... more competitive. In general they'll care more about classes related to the program you're applying to, as well as your major classes as opposed to your gen eds. 

Depending on what grad programs you're interested in, there are other things that can offset a gpa that maybe isn't to your liking. Going online you'll hear about people with high GPAs getting rejected, people with low gpas getting an unexpected acceptance, so gpa definitely isn't everything. If you're interested in grad programs then it's a good idea to put some effort into getting a higher GPA, maybe more effort than others who are more industry / job after graduation focused.

I hope it will remind you in the future to give extra grace to someone who could have or should have worked harder, done better, etc., because sometimes everyone just flat screws up.

"In all honesty, that is probably going to be brutal especially given that you would have the other 2 courses at the same time. I'm not sure what your major is, but if you aren't a bio major and you are just taking BIOL 101 as a general degree requirement maybe consider taking that from a community college and transferring it in. 

COMP 210 has a fairly demanding workload and so does discrete math. The two of those in a single semester would likely need to be balanced out by 2 lighter courses such as the rock climbing class and personal finance class you mentioned. My advice consider transferring in BIOL 101 and then you could do COMP 210 and MATH 381 with the personal finance and rock climbing classes.",1639852439,1,0
"I've had several interviews for software engineering internships and I've only had one recruiter so far that mentioned having a concern about the BA vs the BS, with her reasoning being that I would have less of a math background than those with the BS.

I've considered switching to the BS, but there is more freedom to take either a 2nd major or minor with the BA. You could double major in computer science and information science and then all of the math requirements you'd have to take for the BS would be filled with more technical coursework to pair with your CS classes. That's what I'm doing, but it depends really on your career goals.",1639852052,1,0

Right now even if you are registered with a disability they try to tell you that you will have to either delay your degree or move back on campus. I get the sense that unless something major happens early in the semester they will continue to enforce in-person classes. 

As others have mentioned the vaccination rate is very high so something major would probably have to happen for them to move classes back online, given that right now they won't even offer remote accommodations to students with disabilities in my experience and back when there was a faculty petition going around early in the fall they also did not want to offer remote options then either.

"I was a STEM major and did an REU in 2014, the summer after my sophomore year. I applied to like a dozen. I was selected for one (which was not an ideal location or research topic for my interests) and was an alternate for a second one. Someone dropped out of the second one, so I ended up doing that program. 

I spent 2 months at the university. They gave us a meal plan and provided housing in the dorms on campus. We also got a stipend of a few thousand dollars. There were about a dozen of us. We were divided into three research teams and worked on the project-- literature review, designing the study, collecting data, lab work, analyzing data, and creating a poster and presentation. We also attended a conference in another state. They provided lab training, professional development, research skills training, and hiking excursions.

Overall, it was a good experience. It's a pretty short timeframe to do a whole research project like that. But I definitely learned a lot and it's a great thing for the resume. It was a super helpful experience for my eventual honors thesis and grad school experience. REUs can be hit or miss based on the other people, university, professors, and projects involved. I had 2 other friends do them and they also thought it was a good experience.

They are definitely quite competitive. They also often like to prioritize underrepresented students and students who don't have research opportunities at their home university (i.e. not UNC). So they are both competitive and difficult to get into for reasons beyond your control. But I think they are definitely worth applying to! Good luck!",1639814050,1,0

"I can answer the first part. I‚Äôm a senior double majoring in global studies and MEJO. The interdisciplinary aspect of global studies is amazing.

However, I feel like I have random bits of knowledge that aren‚Äôt necessarily practical in the real world. 

Personally I think it‚Äôs better to pair a GLBL major with another one that teaches practical skills. I wouldn‚Äôt feel as prepared to enter the job market if I only had a Global Studies major (but it also depends on what you want to do). 

The language classes and classes I‚Äôve taken for my area concentration are where I see familiar faces. Mostly because those classes are in the same or similar departments.

1. Dorm neighbors. I got lucky, perhaps, but the guys on my hall were quality people.
2. I attended LOTS of sporting events and so did others. We bonded over that.
3. I played pick up basketball ALOT. So did others. We bonded over that.
4. I went to the gym at roughly the same time on a regular basis. I met some people, but in general the gym is not a great place to meet people. 
5. I joined an honors society and built my best friendships in it. Some unforgetable memories and lasting friendships.
6. I worked a few part-time jobs and internships. I made a few friends through those that I still talk to today.

The fact that they're so similar, and curriculums are so varied between institutions exactly is why it's kind of silly for employers to draw the line there. 

Another bonus to the BA is that I can get some of those elective credits from my stats classes, which is super convenient, since getting into some of the more popular electives in the CS department can be a pain.

"My department has the lowest stipend for PhD's at the university, but we are fully funded (aka don't have to pay tuition and get a stipend) and now have our fees covered which helps a lot. I've been able to survive on my just my stipend as has pretty much everyone else in my department. Its not great in terms of extras or luxuries, we all have roommates or partners we live with, and no one is really saving any money, but I don't know anyone who has had to take out loans. We are all required to TA in my department for funding unless you have external funding or a special fellowship. We don't have an option to work as a grader separate from that as TAs do all of the grading so I can't answer that question.  

The one exception is that most of us get jobs in our field during the summer to help as we don't get paid then. But we don't work outside of our TA or RA positions during the semester. I know one girl who worked retail, but that was just because she wanted the employee discount not because she needed money. A few others do tutor or teach campus rec classes during the semester for a bit extra, but its money that is nice to have versus absolutely necessary to live. The one exception is a student who is a single mother with no support from the kids father. She works a second job now that she is done with classes, but is going to graduate later than the rest of us due to that. 

As a hint, if you are looking at programs outside of UNC, make sure to factor in health insurance when evaluating stipends. UNC completely covers a really good health insurance plan for RAs and TAs, no premiums for students. But not all schools do that. And a mildly better stipend can end up being a lot less to live on if you have to pay for health insurance and student fees.",1640833904,1,0

"It really depends on what type of program you get into. All biology-related (and I think this extends to Chemistry and Physics PhDs) give stipends that are livable in the US. At UNC, the biology PhD student's stipend is probably around 30k/year. It's not a lot but definitely enough to live on, esp in the Chapel Hill area. 

There are select master's degrees that also offer a stipend but most don't. There are also post-bac programs in biology fields that do have a stipend. The goal of these programs are to give you further research experience in preparation for med school or a PhD.

I think you should consider what exactly you want to do after the degree. Consider why you want to get the MS or PhD and then decide which degree is best for that goal. I'm happy to chat if you want more info.",1640833272,1,0

"PhD student, the stipend is low (I think it‚Äôs $8K a semester before taxes). I have a roommate which helps a ton with splitting bills. I qualify for EBT on the stipend which helps me afford food. I take student loans to supplement the stipend as I have medical expenses not covered by insurance. I‚Äôm fully funded so I pay no tuition.

You can‚Äôt rely on finding that work as a grader because those gigs (at least in my experience) can be competitive, and you have to be in the know to even hear about them, but I have picked up some random cash here and there‚Äîonce I had relationships with faculty who thought of me for misc. $

I know at least one person in my program doesn‚Äôt take loans but frankly I‚Äôm not sure of their overall financial situation, support from family, living expenses etc. so you need to consider that. Will you live with a roommate, do you have a car payment, all that!

I am not sure if you mean UNC only for grad school but some programs actually ban you (in a contract) from outside work because you‚Äôre there to focus on research. I‚Äôd say in my dept. it would be frowned upon but as long as you were keeping up you‚Äôd be fine (?).

For additional perspective I worked full time (40+ hours a week) as an undergrad at Carolina‚Äîand I can‚Äôt see how I would in grad school. The nature of the work is so different (for me at least). I did homework at work in undergrad, my grad school work requires more deep thought/attention.

He's amazing, I took all his classes and 482 was the last one I took with him. Iirc 229 doesn't have TAs (not sure if it will when you take it), and he's really flexible with extensions and whatnot, you just have to let him know and ask for one and he doesn't judge. His finals aren't ""real"" (usually combined with a final project so there's less work and grading for everyone or just ""tell me what you learned"") and there are no exams. 

He doesn't want you to stress about his class, and you can get away with not attending class and not doing some of the readings. It's a very you get what you put in class and it didn't ever really add anything to my plate but I learned a lot from it in a world view sense. I still talk to him here and there and he's great. I'd say to just expect Dwayne :) 

I have nothing but praise for him and his classes and it's the only one where I've consistently felt a sense of community and that I was cared for and prioritized for who I was and not my academic performance (I've gotten so many extensions because my company suddenly gave me work with a tight deadline and he's granted it every time without question).

the dorms are okay here, they have their ups and definitely have their downs. i personally found my community through clubs and organizations, people in my major, etc rather than from meeting people in my building. so if you're considering living on campus to meet new people, i'd say being involved on campus is an even better way to meet people (imo).",1640806274,1,0

"My experience was from a decade ago, so keep that in mind. 

If you‚Äôre looking to actually play a halfway competitive game, then I suggest the competitive leagues for soccer. Competitive teams tend to be a bit more like a high school soccer game and most everyone will show up to practice and work on playing as a team.

If you‚Äôre looking to make friends with some people and just get some exercise then rec leagues is where you want to be. The key point in rec league is to not take the game seriously. 

I will say rec is a good place starting place. You‚Äôll make some friends and can figure out if people are interested in playing a bit more seriously. You can transition that into a base for a competitive team next season. Those were the best teams I was a part of. Play competitively but since most of us were friends before comp play we never held a grudge about a missed play or anything. 

This advice doesn‚Äôt apply to all sports. For example, competitive basketball has a lot of kids that could probably have played at a smaller college. Rec league there is still pretty competitive.",1640802253,1,0
