Regardless, don't let it get you down if you don't get responses - keep applying to more projects, too. And make sure you're really personalizing your cover letter emails! Professors and grad students really, really like talking about their research, so if you ask questions about the project in the cover letter, it might get them more interested in setting up an interview.

"I would also throw in my two cents on this not emphasizing polymorphism or general design principles problem. The information provided to us, either by the spec or various info sessions, seem to be serving the opposite purpose.

Euchre is a good project for demonstrating the versatility and power of polymorphism. For example, using a vector of derived class pointers in the driver program so we can invoke different functions under the same name. However, we are given explicit instruction to create a simple player class and a human player class and derive them from the same abstract class. In other words, we are given the blueprint, and we just need to follow it. It might be a much more powerful realization and a better learning experience if we are simply told to use polymorphism, but are left to design the specifics by ourselves.

On the other hand, we are given the minimum amount of information about designing the driver program. We are told that we should create a Game ADT to keep track of the play but that's about it. I wasn't concerned when I started writing the driver because I have had similar experience in the past, but I can understand how daunting a task it must seem to many. That is the part of the project where some more explicit instructions may be helpful. Specifically, what's a good way to approach it conceptually, and what are some of the good design practices etc.

Lastly, I think I speak for many of my classmates when I say that it is great to know that the instructors are working hard to improve the class and are able to evaluate the current methods critically. Thank you, Prof.Juett!",1634611561,1,0

"Absolutely no one is saying blackface is normal and/or okay, it’s just that most people acknowledge that the movie is from a time of different cultural precepts and that although it may have been a tactless choice to show the movie, that doesn’t mean it was an inherently racist act. 

It’s possible to view or enjoy old media with the contextual knowledge that certain things portrayed are not okay. And I have to laugh at your outrage over the film being presented without “criticism or reservation”. 

Reasonable and educated people recognise the problems of blackface and any other controversies that may have been shown, we don’t need to have our hands held as if we’re children. It’s a piece of cultural history and should be recognised as from it’s time.",1634594888,1,0

"Honestly I think you're good to jump into most 300 level polsci classes, there's definitely a difference in workload but I preferred having more readings and less assignments in the semester, a lot of classes don't even have exams. 

POLSCI 386 with Markovits is pretty popular and depending on if you're interested in grad school, I'd recommend 381 (especially with Mika) which is a prereq for the honors thesis and 489 with Shiraito or 498 with Fariss (I highly recommend both 498 sections, workload is very manageable). These 400 level classes aren't that hard to get into btw as a freshman or a sophomore.

If you're interested in law school, there's usually a constitutional law class and some other class with Jowei Chen that a lot of people take. A first year seminar is also an option if they're offered. 

If you're interested in PPE and/or Ford, I would look at PPE 300 and Econ 101/102. A helpful thing I learned early on is that a lot of courses in phil, history, comm (frankly any social science adjacent department) could be petitioned to count for the polsci major (ask the adviser to petition).",1634592934,2,0

It is currently the number one ranked dental school in the U.S. and fifth in the world according to two independent rankings.

The University of Michigan was also the first to provide graduate-level dentistry education. Four of its faculty members have been elected president of the American Dental Association.

"Yeah, you're welcome! Yeah, based on your interest, LSA may seem like a good choice for you (and yes to preferred admission UMSI). I just searched up LSA informatics, and unfortunately, according to [this](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/undergraduate-students/undergraduate-programs/informatics.html), it looks like they're discontinuing the LSA informatics program in April 2022, which I think is before you'd be attending. So it looks like this won't be possible to do, sorry about that :(  I think they're discontinuing it since the UMSI program has a track that sounds pretty similar.

I'm not sure what the closest program to informatics in LSA is (maybe data science? Statistics? Comp. Sci.?), but you don't necessarily need to have your program figured out right away. If you take classes like STATS 250, SI 110, a first-year writing course, and EECS 183/SI 106 your first semester, they'll pretty much all count towards both UMSI and LSA, so regardless of what program you end up taking, they'll all have been helpful.",1634585984,1,0

"From what I can tell the current percentage of international students in the law school is almost half of what it normally is. It's *possible* this is as a result of COVID. Other programs at Michigan (undergraduate and graduate) have seen drops in international student enrollment the for Fall 2020 and Fall 2021. Visa problems, travel delays, COVID being worse in the US than their home country, etc. have all contributed. 

[On this page you can look at historical enrollment data for all schools/colleges at Michigan.](https://ro.umich.edu/reports/enrollment) If you set 'Terms' to Fall and split by citizenship, you can see the specific breakdown. 

For the last 6-7 years total enrollment has held steady around 1,000, plus or minus 50 students. In past years you had close to 100 total international students, so roughly 10%. But there was a dip in 2019 and then a steep drop off for 2020 and 2021. 

I have no idea how legal licensing works. If you have a JD from the US but want to practice in Canada, how does that work? Is it possible where a student wants to live/practice after law school is impacting the decision?

It is however, likely the second hardest course you will take ( the hardest being 296), for a few years if not your entire undergrad.

"I think that will be really tough, but doable if you are organized. I wouldn’t worry too much about eecs 183. I went in with no coding experience, and I thought it was more time consuming than challenging.

There is a major project about once a month, which took me anywhere from 12-18hrs to complete. You know what grade you will get since it goes through an autograder, so your grade depends on how much time you want to put in. The exams are pretty easy as long as you do the mandatory readings. I can’t say much for the other classes, but I’m a freshman with a similar amount of coursework last semester (18 credits: eecs 183: 8hrs/week, eecs 203: 15hrs, chem 210: 15hrs, english 242: 6hrs, and bio 192: 6hrs). I had roughly 28hrs of free time each week with 8hrs of sleep, 2hrs of extracurriculars, and no job.

You will be required to get one six months after your second dose of Pfizer. If that was after 8/4/2021, you will have a short window where the requirement applies to others but not you (yet). If you received your second shot of Pfizer on 9/4/2021, you’ll get your booster on or around 3/4/2022.

"&gt; COVID-19 boosters required – We will require booster shots for all Ann Arbor faculty, staff and students and Michigan Medicine under the U-M vaccination policy by Feb. 4 or as soon as you’re eligible thereafter. The Dearborn and Flint campuses will share details soon about boosters. Each campus and Michigan Medicine will provide implementation details when they are finalized. Get a booster shot as soon as possible once eligible and wherever the booster is available. Don’t wait. We’ll announce details in January on how you can self-report COVID-19 booster status.

From the statement, I suspect it depends on which vaccination record you submit to the university. If you submitted the Pfizer one, you may need a booster only after you become ""eligible"" (ie. 6 months after your second dose of Pfizer even if the date is after 4 February). In this case, I think you would need to get another jab as soon as you become eligible. 

If you submitted the Sinopharm one to the university, I think you can try to submit your current Pfizer records and see how they will deal with this. If they reject, in my opinion, I don't think it would hurt that much to get another Pfizer shot. (I don't want to get into arguments about efficacy of inactivated vaccines vs mRNA ones).

"I agree with the other comment. Also imo, taking 425 or not depends on whether you want to take more stats classes. I took both with instructors both from the math department and worked as a 425 grader for a stats instructor. 

&amp;#x200B;

IMO, 525 is kind of awkward. It's not measure-theoretic so it compensates for that by adding a lot of special topics (random walk, dynamic programming, branching process...). These topics are fun and will definitely reappear in other higher-level classes, but personally speaking, they are a bit too specific. Also, in 525, more emphases will be placed on proofs and tricks to solve very specific problems rather than intuitions and special properties/connections between different distributions. If you take an undergrad-level stats class like 426, you don't need to sanity check the countability of disjoint events so you can safely use the 3rd axiom of probability; you also don't need to distinguish different kinds of convergence; any tricks to solve the above special topic problems you learned from 525 will neither be helpful. But knowing things like \[the many, many properties of gamma distributions, how to quickly integrate pdf with x\^(k) \* e\^(tx) terms using the Gamma trick, chi-square distribution and distributions derived from it\] is very useful in stats classes like 426. Yet these more stats-related topics are usually skipped in 525. Taking 425 with a stats instructor will give you a lot of useful intuitions that are used extensively in other stats classes but are usually not covered by a math instructor.",1636703149,3,0

Considering I'm no longer a student I don't care one way or another, happy to do what everyone prefers. But I think each time this discussion happens we get a different answer on what folks want depending on who logs in that day. 

With the current situation the new queue gets overrun sometimes, but most folks get an answer. With the megathreads a lot of questions get asked but few answered (kind of similar to what I've seen with the ticket one). But you end up with a singular thread that you can ctrl+f your way through for similar questions.

What was the research project like for Affective computing (I've heard that it has one)? Did 498 have a research project like that?,1637727314,1,0
"I’ve taken all the mentioned classes. 498 by Justin Johnson was my favorite class at Michigan. It’s 5 projects in Google Colab in numpy and torch. Pretty much the only class that taught me skills directly applicable in real life. It’s definitely more work than 445, but also less math and more programming.

Affective computing was also very good, but quite different and when I took it had a lighter workload. Professor Provost is an awesome professor. This class touches on a breadth of subjects, but doesn’t go super deep. It’s good for exposure to new topics, but not as hands-on writing code as 498.

442 is an easier version of 498 and I wouldn’t recommend it as much. It re-uses some of the assignments from 498 but uses numpy instead of PyTorch (at least when I took it). Professor Johnson taught 442 for one semester after I took the class, so that might have been fixed. 442 teaches you traditional computer vision techniques which are used very infrequently currently since everything is very ml-focused. The first half of 442 is traditional CV and the second half is a high level overview of what 498 covers.

445 was awesome for a math background of why ML works. I’d recommend 498 first to get the skills needed to actually create ML models, 445 to learn why they work, affective computing to see ways to apply those models, and 442 for traditional computer vision techniques",1637726965,4,0

The only real way to mitigate office hour queues is to start your projects extremely early. I never had issues getting help at office hours when I came the week the project opened.

This next part is probably going to feel mean, but trust me that I completely empathize with you.

You’re going to need to learn how to find the answers for yourself. People will fail out of eecs at 281. It’s a well known filter class. The university doesn’t need people to pass, the later classes in the major are packed as is. Office hours aren’t there to make sure that students pass, they’re there to answer material about the class. If you go in with a question strictly about the material then they should be able to answer it and it’s a problem if they can’t. Unfortunately there is no expectation that they will answer why something isn’t working/ how to make something work. Many TAs when I took the class would just tell me no and move to the next person in the queue. It sucked, but it is what it is.

Also I would just go ahead and sign up to retake 203. If I remember correctly professors have the ability to mark a barely pass as not good enough to count for the major if they don’t think you adequately learned the material. That sounds like what happened.",1638829082,45,0

The place out test is not a good indicator of actual proficiency IMO.

I’m glad I took it because my Spanish skills are better, but there were times I thought about how many credits my Spanish classes took up and felt sad that I couldn’t take other more diverse classes. There are so many awesome courses at UM, especially high level electives, and that’s the trade off I think you want to consider.

All that being said, language is “use it or lose it” IMO, so if you want to keep it then I’d consider doing something like PALMA or a Spanish elective or something to keep it in your mind",1638819553,3,0

"Out of state, I pay 8,500 a year due to independent status. I honestly haven't found online classes to be horrible online but I wish it was cheaper for onlnie classes.

How do you justify in person classes costing 40k a year? Hate to break it to you, but you're getting ripped off too.",1640911724,1,0
Exactly. It's like half the student body expects the administration to make concrete promises and keep them when their entire plan is in response to an ongoing and evolving global pandemic. We can take as many precautions as we can think of but if that is not enough to ensure in-person classes then why do people expect someone to be blamed?,1640911714,1,0

"If you’re in the school of engineering, CS and DS double major isn’t allowed",1640910876,1,0
The University's stance has been very confusing to say the least. I believe that their justification for in-person classes is that people will return to campus regardless of their decision. Does anyone even have the data to support this though? Did they release the percentage of people who returned to campus last year? I would love to see that figure.,1640910838,1,0

Yes. Some of my grandparents closest friends have just passed from the omicron variant. It’s not just a cold or everybody. It’s lucky that illness is typically not as severe with omicron but COVID is absolutely not a cold.,1640909894,1,0
