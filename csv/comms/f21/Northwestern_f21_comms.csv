You can also reach out to [GLAC](https://sites.northwestern.edu/glac/) or [NUGW](https://nugradworkers.org/updates-news/) to get graduate student help with resources.

"No one is going to hand you a consulting job just because of your degree. 

That being said there are things you can do to help. In addition to things other people have already mentioned - like joining organizations (e.g., ISBE), academic courses/certifications like Kellogg's undergrad certificate, or being the son/daughter of a MBB MD, etc.",1636474800,1,0
"Tbh if you want to go to law school, particularly if you are shooting for T14/T6, GPA is king. The problem is that easier majors generally have less utility professionally, in terms of the options they give you. 

Legal studies is ok - it is even easier than poli sci but it won‚Äôt give you any advantage in the application process and probably is even less useful professionally. 

That being said, what other careers would you look towards if you are not going to law school? You can get a consulting job as a poli sci major (or really any major) without being at much of an advantage as long as you understand some basic econ and math. You can also do research work (e.g., think tanks, academic institutions), work for NGOs/non-profits, work in politics, etc. Poli Sci doesn‚Äôt give you the most career options but it does give you some which pay a decent salary, if that‚Äôs what you are looking for.

But also since it‚Äôs your first year, there‚Äôs no need to commit to a major. I‚Äôd just explore your intellectual interests while you can. In some ways, gunning for a top law school is an all-consuming commitment which greatly narrows the classes you take, and one which I at least personally wish I had made later.",1636471596,1,0

"To be honest I feel like it‚Äôs a bit of a wash? I know one legal studies adjunct major from NU who did end up at YHS for law school, but she told me you shouldn‚Äôt be misled into thinking it‚Äôs a ‚Äúpre-law‚Äù major or will somehow give you a leg up compared to other majors. If you‚Äôre already planning on majoring in poli sci, I think you‚Äôre good.",1636440188,1,0
"Conventional wisdom is that your major doesn‚Äôt quite matter, it‚Äôs all about your GPA (and LSAT score). Law school admissions is very numbers-focused. I‚Äôve seen journalism majors from NU, for example, get into top-tier law schools. But basically anything from Weinberg would be a fairly safe bet in terms of majors.

If you‚Äôre interested in LOC, I think your plan sounds pretty solid ‚Äî I‚Äôd stick with poli sci and then pick up a few LOC classes to see if you‚Äôre fully interested before committing all the way. Also: Weinberg comp sci, Segal Design cert, IMC cert or BIP might be good ‚Äúpractical‚Äù programs to double up with (though I balk at categorizing some majors as practical and others as less practical‚Ä¶alas).

"It‚Äôs definitely a lot more work, but I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily call it harder.",1636435677,1,0
LOC is a good major if you want some semblance to econ. I think you should hesitate on assessing ‚Äúusefulness‚Äù only bc employers may not know what LOC is.

"Hey There,

1. We always recommend storing your e-scooter in a cool and dry environment. Weather/Temperature extremes and electronics don't mix well. If you can bring it into class, or store it inside somewhere that is preferred.
2. Kryptonite makes some fantastic bike locks, U-Locks are also a good choice. While these are good deterrents, it does not make the scooter 100% theft-proof.
3. Winter use can be tricky. Snow and ice are not your friend. Especially after you bring it inside and any excess snow on the scooter will melt. Moisture+Electronics=Broken. Realistically you could use it days without precipitation falling from the sky or on the ground. Gotrax Scooters have a waterproof rating for light rain/splashes. Prolonged exposure would harm most e-rideables

At the end of the day, just avoid moisture, keep your scooter inside when not in use, and buy a decent lock if you have to store it outside.

"I hear you, it can feel so lonely to see everyone else going out, having fun at parties and with friends.

"Hi, grad student at Northwestern here! You could definitely email or call undergrad admissions. Having multiple interests is good-- coming across as uncertain is not. I would frame it as, ""I selected a physics major on my application, but I am also interested in cognitive science and biology.""  If anything, you'll stick out to them while they're reviewing applications. As someone said above, you're more applying to the school than a specific major if you're not applying to a specific program. Cognition, physics, and bio are all under Arts and Sciences, so you should be fine either way. :)",1635651749,2,0

&gt;A spirit has floated around Tech since the 1950s when a group of professors rejected the doctoral dissertation of a doctoral candidate in chemistry. The student had spent years in Tech working toward his doctorate and was devastated when it was turned down.  
&gt;  
&gt;Overcome with grief, the young man swallowed a tube of deadly cyanide and his ghost has haunted the building ever since. During the day, Quinn says, the ghost hides in the building‚Äôs sub-basement, but at night he roams the halls, disturbing students with his mumbling complaints. People who listen often have heard him pleading with professors to change their minds and accept his work.

Northwestern Chemistry Dept: Ruining students' life since 1950.

&gt;The archivist says the oldest legend on campus is one of a student who was spurned by his fiancee and consequently hung himself in the bell tower of University Hall, NU‚Äôs first building. Now, 135 years later, his spirit still floats around the building, especially around Halloween, this year on Sunday.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In 1874 the Music Administration Building was built as the Women‚Äôs College when women first were admitted to the university.

Around that time two women students killed themselves after their fiancees left them. One jumped out the window in despair and the other ran down to the lake and drowned herself. But the two women have been keeping each other company in the building in the years since then. People in MAB‚Äôs practice rooms late at night can still hear them when they come down from the attic talking to each other or crying in the halls over their lost loves.",1635632033,24,0

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm qualified to give you advice since I still have very few friends, none of whom are the social party type.

Even if you‚Äôre weird and awkward, you‚Äôre bound to meet someone compatible if you meet enough people. The converse is also true; the most interesting person in the world cannot make make friends without making introductions.

There can be incredible psychological barriers to doing this. For me it was the idea that I didn‚Äôt want to impose on those around me. The short answer was that I just had to get over this. Nobody else was going to make the first move for me. 

A small first step I would take up is committing to talk to your neighboring classmates before each class. Doesn‚Äôt have to be a full conversation. It could just be exchanging names. It‚Äôs about getting into the habit of approaching strangers.",1635477588,28,0

"Caveat, I graduated a while ago but I'm guessing the program is somewhat the same. The MSE curriculum was the most interesting to me! MATSCI101 was the best, I loved learning about crystallography! You get such a wide scope of knowledge (ceramics, polymers, metals, etc) based in really solid chemistry and physics. It was a smaller program when I graduated (a while ago, I'm old), which I liked - less than 20 people in my graduating class. Labs were super practical and much easier for me to grasp than pure chem lab. A good mix of physical and theoretical science. Looking back, it was a challenging program but very rewarding to learn the content (like being able to say you took aka survived quantum physics). The professors are good although very focused on research. As an older professional now, I see on LinkedIn that my Matsci classmates have awesome jobs, both in engineering and professorships but also consulting and other business/strategy roles, pharma/biotech.

For instance, rather than asking what was the average amount of whatever  that flowed in from one time to another, they just ask for average value. I took the the basic math proficiency exams like two years ago, so they might be different now, but they are not that scary. If you did well in cal, the exams should be more review than anything.",1631379280,6,0

Medill mostly uses Weinberg distros with a few exceptions. We have a philosophy/religion requirement instead of ethics and values, we have an economics/business understanding requirement, and natural sciences and formal studies are merged into one distro area (four credits total, and at least one has to be formal studies, plus they'll pretty much count any CS class even if it's not on the distro list).

In my experience, Medill has also been pretty flexible about petitioning classes that aren't approved distros to count for requirements, so if a class you want to take isn't on the list you can talk to your advisor and see if you can get it to count.",1631366036,1,0

The combo of the dining hall not being good nor open past 8 is incredibly disrespectful considering how much they charge. The gyms don‚Äôt have enough equipment.

"There's an off campus roommate matching thing that Northwestern has. If you really want to live with people, that might be a good place to start.

"Two things:

1) The first thing I would recommend is emailing the admissions officers/the registrar for the MPH program and find out where your classes will be located. Chicago campus vs. Evanston campus is a bit far apart, so it will be helpful for planning/picking a good place to live.

2) If your work is remote, is there a reason why you can't continue it from the Chicago area? 4-4:30 might be early enough as a finish to take the night classes. Again, might be worth reaching out to someone form the MPH program.",1637600708,1,0
