"Hi there,

Thank you for reporting on your experience at Kaldi's. I've sent these concerns to Tech Dining and they're working this afternoon with Kaldi's management to address the issues you've described. On the topic of masks, the State of Georgia has an executive order in place that prevents Tech Dining from requiring employees to wear masks.

In terms of food safety, outside of Tech Dining management, all GT dining locations operate under the purview of Fulton County Environmental Health Services (EHS). Each on-campus dining location has to get a food service permit from EHS &amp; undergoes health inspections (you can look up health inspections [here](https://ga.healthinspections.us/georgia/search.cfm?county=Fulton) since they're public records).

Hope that information helps &amp; thanks again for reporting this. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance in the meantime.

"While we can't guarantee that lawn maintenance at 7:30AM will ever be fun, one of the benefits of electric lawn equipment is a steep reduction in noise pollution.

It ensures the campus looks great during peak traffic, and avoids maintainence when there are a lot of people around (which is a major inconvenience for the workers and a safety and health hazard for people). Overall, I think they chose this time because it's the optimal time: not too early and not too late. If they start at 8 AM, there will be so many students going to class, it'll be impossible to mow. Any earlier and you'd REALLY be disturbing people's sleep. But yeah, totally valid complaint.

"Co-opping is worth it, hands down. You get the peace of mind of knowing where you'll work in future semesters and get richer work experience versus a short term internship. Anecdotally, I did both an internship and a co-op, and the difference was respectively 1 project for the whole summer versus 2-4 at a time.

If the deal breaker is co-op, GT is better to be at than Emory. It is my experience that the schools here plan core undergrad classes to be offered most if not all semesters, which is very important for when your degree plan inevitably gets shifted back. On the other hand, Emory is a traditional liberal arts school that focuses everything within fall/spring and expects you to work summers only.

"Thank you for the additional information &amp; I've made sure Tech Dining leadership has seen this information as well. 

Here's what I was able to find out about this incident: the raw chicken incident at North Avenue this past Sunday was due to a cooking procedural oversight by a full time cook (last time it was a temp employee). 

Here's what's being done to address it: The employee at fault is receiving additional training and new cooking procedures have been introduced specifically for fried food. Before, certain batches were temperature checked on a regular schedule to ensure consistency. Now, every batch of fried food will be temperature checked to make a concerted effort to prevent something like this from occurring again.

Additionally, I would be more than happy to connect you and/or your friend directly with Tech Dining leadership (either as a meeting or via email), if you would like to express your concerns directly to Tech Dining leadership. Totally optional, but just want to offer that as an option as well.

Thank you again for taking the time to post about this incident as well as providing the follow up information that assisted in identifying the reason for this incident. My team and I are continuing to look into Tech Dining's current food preparation procedures to identify other areas of concern.

"Honestly, two things really helped me more than anything else:

1) trying new things and showing up to club meetings. It can be awkward at first, because everyone may already seem like they already have their friend group, but just start tagging along for something that seems like you would enjoy it, and you can find your place. Even things that I ended up not sticking with--like Model UN and ORGT--were full of wonderful people that I am still friends with. Then just find more things on campus and start asking them to meet up for lunch or something!

2) taking ""chunk"" classes at Tech. This may be harder to do depending on your major/major size/amount of free electives and all. My major is on the smaller side, so I see people in a lot of the same classes. However, even more helpful, I'm taking language classes (and have for the past two years). Because the classes are small and build on each other, I see the same students every semester, and I feel very close to them. Again, not all majors have the same likelihood that you'll start seeing the same students in your classes, but I recommend you try to reach out or form study groups all the same.

"Going into GT I didn‚Äôt have a good understanding of exactly what I wanted from an engineering degree. I did not have the same STEM oriented high school background like some of my peers so there was a lot of anxiety about whether I chose the right major. In the end, it really helped that ECE is a ridiculously broad field. Although both EE and CompEs need to complete a set of core classes, the scope of them gave me a good idea of what sort of problems I liked to work on. Pair that with project teams like VIP or other undergraduate led research and I was quickly figuring out what sort of academic path I wanted to take at GT. I even declared a CS minor (which I ended up not completing), just to be able to have an easier time getting into CS classes that I could use as upper level electives for my CompE requirements.  

There is also the HIVE makerspace which was built at the end of my undergraduate degree. I will always remember the late nights spent there with my senior design team working on our project. Having a ECE focused maker space as nice as the HIVE is definitely a treat for any student. 

Although I‚Äôm currently working on a PhD at another institution (needed a change of scenery after 6 years at Tech) I definitely think that choosing ECE at GT was the best decision for me 7 years ago when I was a senior in high school.

"Hello!  


Ok so I really have not had too many helpful sources, including tech advisors, on whether or not this plan is feasible so I am taking it to reddit.

  
Pretty much I would absolutely love to attend tech, however, really do not like the out of state price tag that comes with it. Fortunately, I was offered a full time manager position at a restaurant in Atlanta, one where I would start work the summer before my freshman year (proof of there for more than student reasons). I will be filing independently from my parents and get all the necessary documents changed to Georgia (income tax, drivers license, car registration, etc). Additionally I have a 30+ credit hours that I will be able to transfer in, so my course load would likely be under the full time student rating of 10 hours (additionally showing that I‚Äôm there for more than being a student).

  
For anyone that has successfully reclassified their tuition, does this plan seem like it would result in me getting in state starting my sophomore year?",1636676228,1,0

"Covid has become so politicised at this point that to even engage on this issue risks expulsion / social media pile on. Let's not engage on that topic directly.

To suggest that the decisions made either side are pure science or pure politics does not present a true reflection of the issues. Dissent is definetely not welcome.

I don't think issues will get anywhere near losing accredited status - it's scaremongering / negotiation brinkmanship - GT's R1 status is sacrosanct.

To the abuse of power enabled by this legislation - I think you're right, as I've mentioned elsewhere. However, I think it also needs mentioning that at other campuses there's been extremist actions, promoted/endorsed by extremist Profs. This is not a GT issue but having seen bonkers shit from MIT Sloan Profs and Stanford Law School Profs I would ""never say never"". STEM is not immune. Even CalTech Profs are complaining, several happy to ride it out to retirement. 

It's not a non-existent risk from the Boards perspective and in truth, academics everywhere could have done a better job promoting free speech in their classes and subtly guiding colleagues culture/actions within a less militant culture. \[I'm not asking for 1950, just 2010, even 2015\]. Perhaps I have an over romanticised view of Professors as guardians of truth - but life isn't a Disney movie.

I suspect moves are afoot to execute something along the lines of the following:

1. Galvanize public support with degrees of moral outrage
2. Draft amends with formal legal input ref right of appeal
3. Create a negotiation team to meet the Board of Regents
4. Raise your concerns and sincerely meet their concerns
5. Negotiate a compromise, both sides aware of each other's red lines

By the time this issue is regulated/litigated I \*hope\* Covid will have gone entirely and the motivation for action (in your eyes) dissipates. The issue of extremist culture remains however, and a mechanism needs to be in place to address it. It wld be a shame to make GT the new Berkeley of the south!

"My point did not come across the way I intended it to so I'm going to try again. I believe it's important that everyone, particularly Georgia Tech students, understand what is at stake here. Please go back and read the language in bold.

&gt;**A faculty member may also be separated from employment prior to the end of the contract term other than for cause as outlined here, pursuant to other policies of the Board of Regents. Such other policies shall not be governed by or subject to the following policies on Grounds for Removal and Procedures for Dismissal.**

The phrase to focus in on here is ""other than for cause as outlined here, pursuant to other policies of the Board of Regents.""

Sexual misconduct, criminal activity, fraud, academic dishonesty--those are the typical ""for cause"" cases and there are procedures for handling these cases in the BoR handbook (this is publicly available for anyone interested).

This language, however, opens up the policy that professors can be fired without cause ""pursuant to other policies?"" What are those other policies? Who knows.

We're about to find out, however, as at least one tenured professor at UGA is requiring masks in their classroom in defiance of BoR policies and has publicly stated he will go online if the case count gets too high. Could the BoR fire him for this under this language if it's adopted? Absolutely. Would this be political retaliation? Well, I guess that depends on whether you align with the percentage of Americans who think requiring masks are a political issue and Governor Kemp has indicated that he does.

Is this a violation of academic freedom case if he does get fired? Well, possibly because the tenured professor in question has chosen to take a political position (again, because masks mandates have been made political). So if this happens, even though the professor in question could pursue a lawsuit, will this set precedent for firing professors for political issues? Probably. It's an open secret in the USG system that professors have been harassed by administration for speaking out against the university and the university system. 

Does this have a potentially chilling effect on academic freedom? Well, yes and many of the professors I know have said this and are now questioning what they are allowed to say in the classroom. Since they're the ones who are feeling threatened, I'm going to take them at their word. 

You're seeing that in action already as one of the posters above said--many professors, frustrated by the BoR are looking for a way out and if this goes into effect, many that can leave will. I already know multiple professors who've jumped ship. I recently left Georgia Tech for a faculty position elsewhere and now, I'm really glad I did. 

This is where accreditation is coming into play. The BoR is not the accrediting body. I was referring to the Southern Association for Colleges and Schools which oversees accreditation. If Tech loses accreditation, which they could if SACS sees this as infringing on academic freedom and it seems like the BoR want to fuck around and find out, they stand to lose all sorts of things including federal funding. The military research money you are referring to ie DARPA/IARPA etc.--I don't even know if they are allowed to award funding to non-accredited institutions.

I hope this breaks it down for those reading.

On the English major comment, students here also don't realize just how biased professional degrees and ""prestige"" positions are towards Ivy League grads. First, Ivy League grads have huge grade inflation and can easily graduate with a very good GPA (compared to the grind that is GT). Second, if an English major at Harvard puts minimum effort into extracurriculars and research can land a ""Big 3"" consulting gig, a top 10 law school position, or a 2+2 type top MBA. Only the very best students at USG schools get those (although it's not rare for GT students).

That's why it's so important to ensure that GT stays competitive in financial aid, student recruitment, and faculty recruitment. We are perceived as a ""top"" school DESPITE being in Georgia. Maintaining this prestige is key for Atlanta and the State.

"The 1921 team claimed an SIAA title. The 1921 team suffered its only loss to undefeated, eastern power Penn State. Tech was captained by fullback Judy Harlan. Halfback Red Barron also led the team to victory, and he ran 1,459 yards on the season.

The school in general was chronically-short of funds between 1920 and 1923, and begged for money from the Georgia Legislature to continue running. GT President Kenneth Matheson was promptly dismissed for the fiasco.

"I'm going to leave a long statement below so I'm going to leave TLDR here just in case:

TLDR:

Housing is greatly flawed and your job as an RA is measured by the numbers you can report. If you're want to do nothing and BS the many online forms Housing will  support you and encourage it. If you try to actively fill the role of mentorship and help students in a qualitative fashion Housing will rarely recognize it and will only acknowledge their quantitative forms.

Intro:

I'm a former RA and did it for 9 semesters. I worked in Freshman dorms (Smith and Glenn) and upperclassman apartments (North Ave Apartments).   


The RA Role:  
As an RA your job on paper is to fill out the forms that Housing sends to you. These include duty reports, conversation logs, and planning logs. As an RA you are assigned days to be ""on duty"". These days and times are weekday nights and weekends. basically anything that's not 8-5. This includes most holidays,  this means that you will be responsible with a duty phone and access to master keys. During this duty shift you have to respond to the phone at any time during your shift. That means if someone get locked out at 4 am on a Wednesday and you have an exam the next day your job is to get up and let them into their room. I know every RA flinches when they hear the default iPhone ringtone now. Additionally, you have duty rounds you have to do where you walk around each building in your community and check to see if anything is out of place (fire extinguishers, exit signs, etc.) You may be expected to work a holiday shift and may threaten to fire you if you don't take it. They offer rewards for working these holidays. You can get paid from $15-$100 per day. The most expensive ones are New Year's, Christmas and some others that are valued at $100. I thankfully never had to work those shifts but getting $100 for a 24 hour shift on any day seems unfair let alone on a holiday. The Duty report is the form that is all about these rounds and shifts indicating times you walked around and what you saw. The next form is the conversation log. You are expected to fill out an individual form for each resident every 2 weeks indicating that you talked with them and what you talked about. When this change became implemented many residents were off put by this and didn't want to talk about things in case it was ""on the record"". This form is poorly laid out and honestly tedious because its individual submission for each resident and each conversation. The last form is the planning form which is a form you fill out saying you did an event. You need to put the names of people who came, a flyer you made, and some other descriptive info. This is all tedious and have to be done regularly. All these are used to measure how good you are at being an RA. So if you build a bot to fill out your forms (someone on my staff did this) you can look stellar despite not knowing a single resident. However, if you're interacting with residents constantly and they all know and love you Housing won't see it if you don't fill out the forms. Your success is solely determined by these forms.

Housing Structure:  
This is needed because a lot of Housing is complicated for no reason. The hierarchy from the bottom up goes Residents, RA's , Hall Directors, Area Managers, Assistant Directors, Associate Directors, Director of Residence Life. Residents live in buildings and RA's work in these buildings. Hall directors oversee these communities which are usually built up of  several buildings depending on size. Area Managers look over several communities and then reports up from there. The ones who actively make the policies and decisions are at the Associate directors level and up.  
   
Why this structure is bad for RA's:

This much bureaucracy means that when new policies are implemented the RA's have to go through several levels of bureaucracy in an attempt to understand why these policies changed or to voice their opinion. This results in a long game of telephone that rarely results in change. Examples of these unpopular policies where they added an additional duty round late at night. This made many RA's upset because they would have to walk between buildings late at night when it may be cold or dangerous. Despite these complaints the policy would not be undone because we were informed by our hall directors who were given a non-answer response to give us. After more questioning some admitted that they didn't know and were just given a non-answer response to give by their higher ups who were given a non-answer response as well. This led to us being upset and having no way to express this upwards to those who made the decision.  


In summary, if you want to actively do the job for the role its alot more effort than its worth. If you want it for the benefits and BS you way through youll be fine.",1638834575,54,0

"As a current Ph.D. student (also from South America), while the fees are big, they are not around 500 per month, but rather 400. Salary before taxes 2570 gets you 2179.76 (my case).

I would first improve your search of place to live, as that would alleviate your costs significantly. For example I live 1 block away from campus (I need a 13 minute walk to CRC, 7 minute walk to library) and pay between rent and utilities 740 USD. This is a 3 bed 2 bath shared with two other Ph.D. students.
Also, as other have said, I recommend cooking in bulk as it is cheap and healthier. I eat lots of oatmeal, rice and veggies and I cook only every two days more or less for 1-1:30 hours. I eat a lot though (-+2800 kcal per day), and don't eat anything processed, otherwise I would need less time to cook. 

After optimizing those two items you will find the financial situation more manageable, but as others have said, if it complicates you maybe you should reavaluate how important it is for you to do your Ph.D. here or do just a M.Sc. and then start working (I know from former classmates that have done it that they start earning very well very quick).

"Definitely agree that you're getting screwed a little bit here. If this was a full time job you'd get around 25k a year. 

That being said, it's not impossible to live like this. I'd recommend a few things: 

1. Change your living situation. It wasn't great, but when I lived with 4 other people in home park I paid around $700-800 a month in rent/utilities. If you're a PhD student, my guess is you aren't going to be spending a lot of time at home anyways (based on what I've heard from my PhD friends)

2. Learn to cook food. The best thing I learned from my time at tech is how to cook cheap and easy meals which allowed me to lower my cost of living. Rice, beans, and vegetables are incredibly cheap and easy to cook. Also, I don't know what you're cooking, but it definitely shouldn't be taking an hour. 

3. Really consider your purposes for doing a PhD. A Coworker of mine ""Mastered Out"" of his ECE PhD because he realized that it didn't make sense for his goals in the future. He also was getting ready to start a family and realized that a PhD didn't make financial sense for him. 

All in all, it is possible to live on this wage. In my last summer before graduation (2020), I was working for $20/hour and still managed to break even on my expenses. I wish you all the best trying to figure out how to navigate everything.",1638753497,30,0
"Many are providing very good, heartfelt advice re: cooking, but that only goes so far. Another idea to throw in the ring is to look at relying on MARTA + Tech Trolley, which opens up housing to outside the Midtown area. It only requires flexibility and patience relying on MARTA and the Trolley. Personally found both to be very reliable. There are definitely decent places near a MARTA stop that are outside of the main ATL bubble for &lt;$1000/month. No matter which way you slice it, most grad students at Tech only have about $200-300 per month cushion. It's really not a lot, and one or two unfortunate events can really throw a budget out of wack.  
The real problem as the original post suggests is that Tech needs to re-evaluate fees and stipend vs the real cost of living in ATL. Cost of living, especially in Midtown, has gone up significantly within the last five years and especially the last two years. I know a few departments were pressed by GRA/GTA to compare versus similar universities (mix of rural, urban, suburban Top 20 STEM schools) and Tech usually came out either slightly below average or far below average. At the very least there should be an option to spread out payments over the semester vs lump sum at beginning of semester. I know/knew far too many people who were hurting at the beginning of every semester having to pay so much at once.  
Flat out: advisors need to be paying more. They very well know the majority of their students are busting their asses for 60+ hours 7 days a week. It would be nice if fees could be reduced especially for graduate students where many of the fees don't make sense or don't apply.",1638752463,8,0

The food budget for one person for a month should be well below $300, maybe even under $200 or lower.

My experience and what I‚Äôve heard generally is that your time as a graduate student should not be worried about paying off debt or building huge savings because you‚Äôre still not even in your first major career job. You may have a completely different situation so I‚Äôm not gonna say you should trust what I‚Äôve heard I‚Äôm just sharing.

Welcome to real life. It's expensive. You don't borrow $400,000 to live in a house for 5 years and just decide it wasn't of value, so you you just get to not pay the loan off.

I really suspect that you never had to take out loans. If not you probably weren‚Äôt responsible for the payments. It‚Äôs incredibly stressful being $xk in debt and having to balance loan payments with car payments, insurance, rent, etc.

1. Stimulants
2. EDM without lyrics, all types 
3. Setting goals and setting rewards. This is a big one. What kept me alive in undergrad at Tech was having some sort of social outing that I would only go to if I had xyz done. It‚Äôs a good motivator
4. Get shit started. That‚Äôs the hardest part for me. Tasks seem much more daunting until you start to tackle them
5. As much as I tried, I was terrible at paying attention in lecture. Could not focus whatsoever. It was either too fast or too slow most of the time and I had a hard time harmonizing. Biggest advice I can give is to try to start on homework‚Äôs early as you can, that way the stuff in lecture clicks. You don‚Äôt even need to do the lecture examples necessarily just get down what you need to know in terms of the basics 
6. It all just fluctuates by the individual but I would try to get yourself into a habit. Get a routine started. Make it a game with clear objectives. If I do abc then I will know xyz. Planning shit out helps

I am unaware of any professor attrition issue at GT right now (but perhaps something happened in bioinformatics I'm unware of!).

GT's trajectory over the past 50yrs has been pretty remarkable. Is one poor USG policy and a few lost professors (during one of the most transient employment times in US history nonetheless, as other's have mentioned) a reason to legitimately doubt the institute's ability to succeed in future decades, jeopardizing your career?

It just seems *really* hard to believe that has or will make any significant impact. Esp seeing as how 1) compared to the most common counties we pull professors from (India I believe is still the largest pool?) GA/ USA has had access to vaccines earlier and lower death rates en masse and 2) the vast majority of professors are US citizens and those who are not still often have lives firmly planted here.

"I‚Äôm a grad student in my 30s, and I‚Äôm very concerned about attending in-person, with the higher risk of getting omicron. I work from home and have avoided all other variants, and since I have other health issues, catching omicron for me (despite having all 3 jabs) could be life altering. 

And while covid may not have as many bad outcomes for your typical undergrad aged students, vs for older folks, it will likely cause lifelong impacts for some, and could lead to very bad outcomes for professors, staff, and their families or others, and for immune compromised people. 

With the potential for an all-variant vaccine just around the corner, I feel like now is the time to be patient and do one more online/optional in-person semester, or to allow all online if professors want that. 

And to me, even if it‚Äôs only a few of the younger students who may end up with long term issues from getting Covid, while most seem ok, that makes it not worth the risk to me. I‚Äôd rather have one more online-or-in-person semester, and maybe save a few students from really really bad long term effects, and try to protect the professors and immune compromised folks. We‚Äôre so close to having a viable solution, why mess it up worse now, when waiting could potentially spare a lot of people the virus and the long term risks?

Even masked and vaxxed, with omicron, every large class could be a mass spread event. I‚Äôll be in 5 large classes, that‚Äôs 10 times a week.

"1. If you aren't already, get involved with extracurriculars - STEM ones in particular. 
2. Keep working hard on your GPA - I also transferred in and my GPA was really not impressive, but in one of my essays I acknowledged it, took responsibility (didn't just blame it on covid, etc), and pointed out how I had done much better in recent semesters to raise it. 
3. Volunteer. Improve your community, help others, be a good person. There is a ""contribution to community"" section of the application, at least on my REPP one. This isn't to say that you should only bother volunteering to try and get into Tech, but I'm framing it this way because that's what your question is about. 

Your GPA is important for your application, but that isn't the only thing Tech is looking for. They're looking for a well-rounded individual that they feel is a good fit for the institution and the school's reputation. I'm not sure when you're planning on applying, but keep working on your GPA and maybe take these things into account as well. Good luck!",1640907086,1,0

"We've been dealing with covid for 2 years now. I wear a mask in public spaces, wash my hands regularly, and social distance around strangers. I haven't gotten sick, so that tells me that doing those 3 things keep me safe. So yes, I think it's possible to never get it. And if I do get it, at least I did my best to not get it. Just because I'm young and I probably won't die from it doesn't mean I should go out of my way to get it. Because I don't know 100% how my body would react to covid. I don't know the long term effects of having had covid. If you are comfortable with getting it and repeatedly getting it that's on you and anyone else that feels the same. However trying to convince people online not to wear masks just because they aren't 100% effective is not cool. Masks, cloth ones included, do reduce transmission.",1640903481,1,0

I don't remember the banning you are talking about particularly about, and I might be confusing servers etc. but I do remember that I only really liked one mod on '24 and that's the way it has been since.

"&gt;yes there just isn‚Äôt enough ‚Äúwork‚Äù for new people to do

There are many things you can do, some of which I suggested but went largely ignored:

* Updating the [GT Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/wiki/index). Make it a good student resource. Why is it only available on Old Reddit?
* Making a more modern subreddit banner
* Removal reasons. Yall remove rule-breaking posts but without any removal reasons.

All of these beneficial features are what most subreddits have yet r/gatech, one of the largest university subreddits, does not. 

---


&gt;All I know we may decide we will do a search very soon

Imo, r/gatech doesn't need new mods. Yall just need to step up.

---


&gt;I really would like to see more IRL engagements say it be meet ups or connecting with departments on campus to our sub. However both of this requires work from not just mods but users as well. I actually have something in the works with Office of Student Life so please keep a lookout later next month.

It's good that you have a vision, and you have something in ""plan"". But, this is just talk without action. Back up what you say with action. Don't say that you have something in the works and end up either never doing it or delaying it. Because, in the past year or two, I've seen more user-generated content than a mod's.",1640886348,1,0
"This semester, Tech Dining started a new self-operated dining program on the Georgia Tech campus. While our first few months have thrown a number of unexpected curveballs, we have worked diligently to improve services across all operations and will continue to do so for the spring 2022 semester. As the semester begins to come to a close, we want to make you aware of an important meal plan change. For Spring 2022, voluntary meal plan selections will automatically roll over from the fall 2021 to spring 2022 semester, unless meal plan changes are made during the approved window. If you want to make any changes to your spring 2022 voluntary meal plan, including decrease, cancel or increase, please email dining@gatech.edu between the dates of 12/07/2021 and 01/06/2022. All spring 2022 meal plan changes must be made no later than 01/06/2021. Two reminder emails will be sent to meal plan holders prior to the 01/06/2021 change deadline. If you have any questions on this process, please contact dining@gatech.edu.

"First, What are things you enjoy doing? What are things you want to do/learn? Working out at the gym, playing video games, playing boardgames, bowling, pottery, watching movies, visiting museums, salsa dancing, even attending classes, or eating at a favorite restaurant... Go out and do them, and/or find public areas to do them on your own. Learn something new. And if you dont enjoy doing something, then dont make any extra effort to do it (unless required of course).

Then, as you regularly 'do the thing', you will notice other regulars on day 2, day 3, day 10, etc... Say ""good morning/afternoon"", ""hello"", ""how are you doing""...  talk to men and women, young and old.  Even if they are busy and dont want a conversation at first, if you run into them several times a week, they will eventually respond. But usually, it happens pretty quickly.  And BAM! You just made an acquaintance.  As you say ""good morning"" and chit chat more regularly, they can become a friend. Get each others contact info, text, and hang out.

This way, you can make a small handful of friends while doing something that you were going to do anyways. And you probably already have at least 1 thing in common. Good luck and enjoy!",1635609548,1,0
