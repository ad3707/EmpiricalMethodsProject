"1.  That may be true, but it's hard to believe that Michigan spends almost $3 billion on research annually and ""accomplishes nothing""
2. Sports do matter. University is about development; social, personal, academic, professional, and athletic (for student-athletes) development. If Cal is going to field sports teams, at least develop them. 
3. None of that matters for US News National Rankings. UCLA has 270 Olympic medals, Cal has 223 despite being 50 years older and with more sports. 26 elements? 16 and if u wanna count the livermore elements, thats 22. 
4. Bruh, Olympic Village is gonna be in UCLA's dorms. All the Olympians will witness UCLA's campus, which will definitely have a HUGE impact on not only recruiting athletes, but coaches, and will bring even more publicity to an already popular campus.

Wholeheartedly agree, have the conversation with men to combat slut-shaming, victim-blaming, etc. but to just let women be naive in the meantime is wrong.

"Again: Women are told this shit. No one needs to launch a campaign to tell them this shit. They're told this shit through and through, to the point that if they are assaulted they're asked why they didn't ""avoid"" rape well enough.

You know what isn't done? Telling men that assault is unacceptable. There isn't enough social pressure on the tiny minority of rapists to not rape anyone in the first place. The more socially unacceptable assaultive behavior becomes, the more rare it becomes and the less likely that it goes uncorrected. This isn't my opinion ‚Äî tons of research backs that up.

Instead of focusing on telling women shit they've already heard over and over again, start focusing on asking frat boys why they don't police their own members more. Start condemning people who assault others ‚Äî start insisting to the schools, the frats, the employers, the community that rapists are convicted. 

Rape avoidance isn't rape prevention. Talk to potential victims all you want, but until you start talking to potential abusers and the people who enable them, you're not preventing rape.

All that crap you repeated? You repeated it because you've learned it by heart. That's great, now you know it. Now go further. Start learning how to talk to men about what \*they\* should be doing. Should \*they\* be drinking that much? Should they be creating unsafe conditions in their own homes? Should they be ignoring/enabling rapists? Be a little more radical.

I hesitate to even say men/women because I think men are the victims of rape far more than we're yet aware of. And women can be abusers, too. But right now, in most cases we know of, men rape women. It's a tiny minority of men, though, and the vast majority of men can do an awful lot to change the culture. We just need to start talking about it as their responsibility, too.

That's all I'm going to say about this. Instead of endlessly defending yourself against some non-existent accusations, just consider what I'm saying and start thinking about this issue in a new way. How you talk about this matters. You've offered multiple strategies for avoiding becoming a victim. Now start offering strategies for preventing assault from even happening in the first place. If you stop assuming that that part of the equation is hopeless and unsolvable, you'll start realizing that solutions are all around us.",1631511404,0,0

"I'm interested in the hardware side of Quantum Computing. Physics is my main major, which I'm doubling down on; I have the undergrad and graduate courses that I really need to take to prepare myself for QC hardware research already locked into my 4-year undergrad plan (i.e. Solid State Physics, Quantum Optics, Quantum Information, the second part of E&amp;M and Optics, and Grad Level Quantum Mechanics). In terms of depth, I already planned to specialize in either EE or Physics at the PhD or masters level. 

On the CS side, I could use 2 (very relevant to QC) EE classes‚ÄîEE 120 and EE 226A‚Äîto fulfill CS reqs. I also already planned on taking Data C100, CS152, and a couple of CS theory classes, which will aid my understanding of computing in general (maybe except for Data C100). Those classes alone complete the Physics and CS curriculum. 

Linear and Abstract Algebra are a must for QC, and with the analysis classes, the Math minor is done. Taking the analysis classes is a bit superfluous, but I was interested in analysis and almost everyone I've talked to at the university has told me to take classes I was interested in. The EE and CS classes I planned on taking were in the domain of probability, so I could probably petition to use those to fulfill the two elective requirements for the Math major since the department allows classes that have ""substantial mathematical content and are offered for at least 3 units each"" to fulfill the two elective pure math req. Since I was going to take Mathematical logic anyways, this just leaves one more semi-elective (ideally Mathematical Programming) and after that one class, I've completed the math major assuming the math petition works out. If I add enough relevant research into the mix, I can stay competitive in graduate school admissions. 

To summarize, my 4-year plan includes a good amount of Physics, CS Theory/EE, and Math to realistically complete all three majors and lead me towards my ultimate end goal. Whether I should take fewer EE classes and make the most of the more software or application-based CS classes, or go with the math minor so I can take more Physics Grad Classes is something I'm still struggling to figure out, but Physics, Math, and CS are at the core of my main undergrad plan, and with the schedule I've set out for myself right now, adding 2-4 extra math classes to the minor to fulfill the major isn't a big deal (and will be a lot of fun!). And of course, anyone is free to object to my plan.",1636708219,1,0

"Tbh, Berkeley CS has been in a constant state of funding crisis for the last twenty years. Berkeley has always been on the verge of disaster but has never quite fallen in. I don't think this time is any different.

One thing to know is that the university has a long standing tradition of grandfathering in existing students to whatever new policy changes they make. In other words, the declaration requirements you see when you choose to enroll are the ones that you will get. They have not (as far as I know) retroactively changed declaration policies in such a way that the fuck over current students. So, since it doesn't look like they're going to make progress on any of this soon, odds are you'd have the regular 3.3 cap in L&amp;S CS.

This isn't to say they can't change it out from underneath you, but I remember one of the professors on the committee saying that they treat the declaration requirements like a contract‚Äîyou know what they are when you come in to the university and you base your decision to attend on them, so they do not break those terms.",1637788374,7,0
"they probably won't approve this policy again, but currently we're trying to come up with a similar policy -- so long as the university doesn't increase funding, our hands are tied, so one way or another the only solution we have is to curtail l&amp;s cs. it mostly just depends on when/whether we're able to scale to support the size of the major again.",1637788341,3,0

"61C, 189 and 162 are hard/ time consuming

189 varies by teacher (don't know how much, this is the only class in the list I don't have experience with)

127 is can be hard depending on teacher

So try to take at most 2 of these per semester + 2 non-heavy techs.

I would argue that if you are thinking of doing schedules like these you probably don't need 61c for 161

Maybe ask around what people think about whether doing 61c and 162 concurrently is doable to make this work

Are you absolutely sure you can't do any of these this year?

If you end up doing 2 hard cs classes + 2 non heavy, you are likely not going to have much free time

If you intend to do no extracurriculars, 3+1 may also be doable.

"**How would you describe the variety in the courses? Is it mostly chem, bio, physics, or anything else?**

  
There's a decent variety of courses, but due to the broad nature of BioE you're probably gonna have to take some courses a little outside of your area of interest. I mostly took classes focused on medical devices (105 - Designing Medical Devices, C106A/B - Robotics, 101 - Biomedical Instrumentation, C165 - Medical Imaging Signals and Systems) and computational    (131 - Intro to Comp Bio, 145 - Machine Learning for BioE, 134 - Genetic Design Automation).

**What careers are you looking forward to/expecting to go into?**

I did EECS as well, so I'll probably be going into software or hardware for biotech (ideally). If you wanna do actual development (research, designing devices, etc.) you will probably need a Masters or PhD. Can't really speak on the other concentrations though. Job prospects are kinda limited if you do JUST BioE but I figure most people in the major want to pursue a graduate degree or are premed anyways.  
  
**Do you actually like bioE? If so what do you like? If not, what do you hate?**

I really enjoyed the BioE department and classes, it's pretty small and close-knit. The courses are interesting and the professors are solid.  
  
**What kind of person would you recommend bioE to?**

Honestly if you are interested in the field then you can't really go wrong, but just know that if you want to go to industry direct after undergrad it could be a bit tough if you pursue only a BioE degree (no other minor/major).",1633592810,1,0

"Sorry if I'm not a bioE person. Full disclosure, I studied Mat sci/eng at Berkeley. I currently work for a biomedical device company (industry) and am currently a biocompatibility expert, not much to do with BioE. However, I have a lot of experience working with BioE people because early in my career I was mostly working doing medical device verification testing and failure analysis. 

The work I did with the BioE people was mostly biomechanical engineering. We make spinal cord stimulators so to give a concrete example, we were verifying that percutaneous leads met the requirments we set for them. 

Think of the leads as conductors that are inserted into the epidural space. We had to come up with theoretical stresses that the lead could be exposed to (think of the sterilization, transport, sitting on a shelf, the patient bending over/twisting around, etc.) how many times it would be exposed to it, and the intensity of that exposure. Then we had to design and build different test jigs to apply those stresses. Finally we performed testing on statistically significant numbers of devices. 

I'm happy to discuss industry and what to expect in terms of work much more in depth if you would like, but I chose this one example just to give an idea of what sort of work was the norm at least in my industry. 

The type of person that would enjoy this are:

\--someone who wants to work with biological systems because it interests them

\-- someone who would want to drift their career to something like a field clinical engineer to have contact with patients and work with patients and/or doctors. You can, with proper motivation and planning, steer your carrer in all sorts of directions. 

\-- someone who eventually wants to design systems/devices. You probably won't get to do this early in your career but design is something that I see a lot of the more senior people do. And I imagine that having your device that you designed implanted into people and helping them must be pretty cool!

The type of person that would NOT enjoy this work are:

\-- people who hate red tape. Medical devices and pharma is SUPER regulated. FDA and other regulatory bodies can be extremely pedantic and everything you do has to be rigorously reviewed and approved. I could tell you horror stories....haha

"Definitely, 61C/70/170 are difficult, but staff provide the resources to help you succeed. For projects, the spec is detailed carefully and you know what you need to do, even though you might struggle to achieve it.

In 169A, students are struggling because they're not sure what they need to do. The spec makes no sense, and staff don't provide the resources to help you succeed.

Tbh this class would be easier if we just had to teach ourselves everything. Assign us the final project at the beginning of the semester and have us teach ourselves.",1638819669,7,0
"The craziest part for me is that the content itself isn't altogether that intense. Like it's not like 61C or 170 where the content has a bunch of stuff to remember or a bunch of math theorems to wrap your head around. This is the least theoretical class possible, and the the amount of information it encompasses in one semester is, in my opinion, less than the amount that a course like 61C or 70 or 170 encompasses. And yet, because of how the class is run, it still manages to be difficult, not out of necessity but out of how it is run.

For example, other classes that are difficult (like the ones I already mentioned, 70 170 61c, etc.) are difficult, yes, but really it's because you need to spend more time learning the material. Like I don't get annoyed when I don't understand something in 170 because I know that the class is fair overall, resources exist for help, and even if it might be difficult to understand I could potentially understand in the future. That's how learning works, after all. But in 169 it feels like the class is not difficult because of content, but because of how it is run.",1638819424,11,0
"Yea unfortunately we didn't have anything like that this semester.

As for the professors, it seems like they're unaware/pretty removed from what's happening in Ed - that's the impression I get at least. When the checkpoint 2 rubric was released, many students argued that the coverage requirement wasn't clear.

As a response to these concerns, the prof answered ""I apologize, we did not realize it would be surprising"" and ""Okay, that's fair, I re-read the task 4 description and can see how it's confusing with the CodeCov mention"", which makes it seem like they haven't seen any of the student questions about code coverage thus far, even though many, many posts have been made about it.

The professors have been understanding about revising due dates/rubric items after these complaints, but it shouldn't have been an issue in the first place.",1638819204,6,0
can you elaborate on that? taking it next semester and worried about this,1638818685,0,0
"So sad to hear that the class is in such a dismal state this time around. 

I took it last fall and while it was a buggy experimental mess, but there were two TAs that truly went far above and beyond to rectify as many mistakes and oversights as possible so far as to spend their holiday break recording video tutorials on how to get through some buggy interactions with Codio and the like. I was fortunate to get to work under one of those TAs in 169L, but it was pretty clear to me that they were doing a disproportionate amount of work out of a passion for teaching and that once they graduate (SP21) the class would be left with the other TAs whose names I barely ever saw crop up in Ed because they almost never responded to questions. 

Unlucky, those two spent so much time overhauling the course content, it was really too messy for two people to solve in the course of a semester I suppose. I wonder where MBall and Fox are in all this, they were very reasonable and empathetic last year when it came to high-stress environments caused by poor planning/the global pandemic raging on outside; as messy as the class was you could tell they cared, just couldn't quite execute on that well enough.",1638818229,6,0

Especially the one where spacing out of projects and quizzes and stuff, that was an issue for sure for much of the class.  But by the end of the semester, I thought issues were addressed for the most part and that it was actually a good class by the very end, with a very comprehensive but fair Final exam.  To that point, I‚Äôm very surprised that some of these issues are cropping up again. 

I never thought that the workload was that bad, but then again I‚Äôm not sure if the content has changed much for this year‚Äôs version.",1638814083,3,0

Usually I wouldn't want my social group to overlap too too much with my academics, but I just couldn't help it at Cal.  The math community was so positive and uplifting, it was probably the healthiest possible social group for me.

"Simple answer: it's a measure of variance or spread, how far values tend to fall from the mean.

Detailed intuitive answer: you take each value and subtract the mean. This gets you the distance of that value from the mean. That's what we want to know, but we want to summarize it as a single value representing the whole data set, so we need to combine them and find a useful summary number. To combine, you square each value, making it a positive value (because keeping negatives in the mix could just cancel each other out in the next summing step). You sum all of those, which gets us closer to our single summary number, but an inflated total is not useful. So we divide by n-1, which is similar to why you divide an average by n (but in this case it's n-1 for technical reasons, too detailed to get into here). Last, because you squared the observations earlier to make them positive and avoid canceling each other out, you take the square root to transform it back to the original scale so it represents a magnitude that makes sense for your data set. Bingo, now you've got a single summary number that represents the spread around the mean of your data set.",1635681917,38,0

The one validation error question on the final felt out of place. I agree that 16b has too much material but i don't want 4 classes of it like some people suggest.  
Also 127 and future optimization algorithms/ML classes aren't the best courses (no matter who teaches 127, i honestly don't think Venkat/Laurent are the problems: more so the course staff (and the fact that homework doesn't have the closest alignment to poorly taught lectures). In fact I would probably say 16b staff on piazza was the exact opposite of 127 which is kinda sad). I tried phase 1ing EE120 this semester but i couldn't get in, so i just decided to take the warning message 16b sent me and forever avoid EE.  


That's my advice to you, CS classes are more fun and you don't have to force yourself to try and love them. At least that's how I feel, if you feel the same way don't force yourself to try out things repeatedly. If you feel the opposite then try out EE, we are just different people then but for people like me who really like exploring new topics, it's important to get the message when something isnt meant for you.",1639876656,1,0

"Hi:

First, things will be OK, trust this, and you will take charge of your life, with little help from here and there. Causes have effects. So let's create some helpful causes, to get some helpful effects. I am assuming you will leave Bay Area for the time being.

(1) Accept full responsibility, not blame, just responsibility from now on about everything that happens to you. 

(2) Spend few minutes quietly by yourself and try to relax. 

(3) Then ask a serious question: If I were the parent of a child who were in my situation, how would I guide that child. Be honest, calm and if possible some answers, without worrying about how right or perfect. Goal here is to reach your inner strength. Trust me, you have it, maybe you are unaware like most of us have been or are, but you do have it.

(4) You can always resume education later from various sources, and avenues will always be open to you. So, plan to return to school when you have a stronger financial base and a stronger sense of self. Now, be brave to say NO to school and yes to the work force. Berkeley has deferment options and such. make an appointment for a campus counselor,do the formalities and start with a clean slate for the future.

(5) Since you have posted here, I am sure you have access to information about emergency shelters. If that's too difficult use your savings to rent a bed somewhere cheap for two weeks or so. Food banks are also available for you to use. Many Churches and temples have free food program.

(6) While doing above, please try to apply for jobs at various locations. Retail and hospitality industry are hurting for people. Take anything to start, then you can switch. This is most important for you. Try to start a job ASAP. It could also be internship like Electricians Union, etc. Please write down the places and avenues you will try to apply for jobs and apply one by after another and check them off.

Apply at Trader Joe's, Home Depot, Ace Hardware, Safeway etc. places as well. Be honest during interview and show confidence and interest about earning money. The way I understand, you need to find your physical as well as emotional legs. Working will help with both and will give you a growth that many of your peers won't have.

As soon as you get the job, read during spare time and begin saving money.

Do this for at least two years, but keep studying at your own pace while working and if you feel like take some classes part time, so that you will be in touch with the academic environment.

Keep distance from depressing thoughts, be alert about discouragement, etc. If depressive thoughts come, accept them, and let them pass through you, rather than fighting them and engaging them. 

Now, as you can see, a lot of people are trying to help you in their own way. It's your turn to take actions. Start the causes you need, so that you can walk towards the effects you want.

Please, trust in yourself, and it's perfectly fine to seek help. Not a single person in this world lived a single moment without contribution from someone else--often directly, mostly indirectly. Hope you become a strong and capable individual, so that you can help someone else in the future with the lessons you will learn. Off to work then, jump to it.!",1640919396,1,0

"I commented this on another post, copying and pasting below: 

I just took the course, and ended with an A- and was extremely close to an A, so here are a couple of tips I would give:

1.	‚Å†Preview the course material. I would watch DeNero's lecture at least until environment diagrams, getting a good grasp of everything until then. If you can, try to get even further, but generally environment diagrams is one of the basics of 61a, and without those, 61a will become tough. cs61a.org should have everything up-to-date and under ""Playlist"" with each week you will find each of the DeNero's lecture corresponding to each topic.
2.	‚Å†Do not fall behind. It might be tempting to miss one or two lectures, but that really piles up and has a ripple effect on your other classes. I think the course begins to pick up when they introduce tree recursion/trees, and these were the concepts I struggled with most, especially  with the fill in the blank style questions on exams. Also if you have any misunderstandings, resolve them ASAP rather than waiting until the next midterm or final, it will save you a lot of time in the long run. CSM might be a good resource to check out too.
3.	‚Å†Start preparing for exams at least a week and a half before. I guess this depends on how good of a programmer you are and how smart you are, but for me I think when it got content heavy around MT2 and the final I needed more than a week to prepare on top all of my other classes. My main strategy for preparing exams would be to take as many recent exams (6-7 ish), learn from them, and keep on going. Reading over the study guides and reviewing any concepts that you did not understand fully could help as well.
4.	‚Å†Don't compare yourself to others. I guess one of the main problems I had was always comparing scores with someone around me, but its not worth it, and know that everybody comes from different backgrounds.

tldr; just stay on track, don't fall behind, and study for the exams early

Also know that it isn't that bad. This subreddit seems to just pick out the bad things and ig in a way amplify them, but the average is around a B+ in the course, which is totally doable. There are around 9-10 extra credit points offered in the course as well.  I may have just given a bunch of general advice, but feel free to PM if you need anything! There are a bunch of resources as well such as office hours, CSM, piazza, etc. that can help you succeed in the course!",1640916569,1,0

"The Berkeley covid dashbord shows that cases are astronomically climbing as of recent. 

https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/dashboard/

 Cal football for example had games impacted due to covid outbreaks. 

https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/Cal-s-football-players-were-mostly-vaccinated-16610616.php

To your point about the current situation, you must remember that we had remote instruction this semester for large classes. Delta is not as transmissible as omicron, so the measures that were in place worked as they were supposed to. So the cases being low are a bit of a catch 20-20, they are low but we did have remote classes this past semester and we also tailored restrictions to the characteristics of delta. So as of current, cases are shown to be low with the delta variant with existing vaccines and measures, which illustrate the success of our past measures as covid cases were zero and the school did not go into flames due to remote learning. The omicron changes this though. Omicron has over 50 mutations, with key mutations that allow it to more efficiently infect cells and circumvent the vaccine. Additionally, the spread factor of omicron is much more (some studies suggest up to 4 times more) which means that even if we copy last semesters protocol, cases will increase.  Lastly, omicron has shown a greater affinity to reinfect as people can get reinfected with covid due to omicron compared to past variants. Ultimately, more contact = more spread which produces a higher chance of mutation.  Mutations, infections, hospitalizations, and ultimately deaths should be avoided.",1640914171,1,0
