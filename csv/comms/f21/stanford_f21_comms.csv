"Yeah, though the Stats dept. does seem to provide a sensible middle ground by offering intro statistics courses such as Stats 60 which requires no calculus (though is admittedly a terminal course). 

There is also Stats 110 for physics &amp; engineering students that assumes calculus but doesn't officially require Stats 116 though seems to implicitly require something towards it based on the prerequisite knowledge mentioned in [https://web.stanford.edu/class/stats110/intro.html](https://web.stanford.edu/class/stats110/intro.html)

I wonder if an economics student could take Stats 110 after Econ 102A (still wouldn't prepare for more advanced things, but might be sufficient for the OP's goal -- though the question of readiness for Stats 110 is another focus). 

The Stats dept. needs to have a course which gives the level of introduction for those who do plan to learn more advanced statistics, and for that it has to be a course like Stats 116.

So perhaps the OP could clarify the reason for focusing on Stats 200; maybe Stats 110 could serve the desired needs.  If the aim is to get the background for learning more advanced statistics later, there isn't any reasonable option but Stats 200 in its current form (the standard intro statistics course as taught everywhere for those who will pursue for advanced coursework in the field).

The puzzle of why there are so many introductory course offerings is vexing: CME 106 on probability &amp; statistics geared towards engineering applications, CS 109 on probability &amp; statistics geared towards CS applications, Econ102A on probability &amp; statistics geared towards economics applications, Stats 116 on just probability, MS&amp;E 120 on just probability (Is this any different from Stats 116? If not, why does it exist?), and Math 151 (= Stats 116 with the proofs). It's a zoo.

 Why not just one terminal course on compressed probability + statistics (with a good instructor, developed with input from several departments) and the standard Stats 116 (or Math 151) + Stats 200 for those who want more depth? By allowing the latter to fulfill the same major requirement but enabling those who anticipate going further not to have to go back to the beginning, students who haven't settled on a specific major wouldn't have any worries. The Future of the Major proposal from a year or two ago made a fuss about the need for flexibility in the choice of major, and simplifying the course structure around this broadly important material would fit that goal very well.",1632539816,4,0

Whereas in stats departments the probability course and the statistical inference course are designed for you to be able to learn advanced probability theory, machine learning theory, theory of estimation, etc.",1632536928,3,0

"Econ 102A only requires Math 20, but the real power of probability &amp; statistics involves Math 21 (with infinite series and improper integrals and power series), Econ 102A must miss a lot of Stats 116 content. More precisely, many main concepts would arise in Econ 102A in a basic form, but  cannot have comparable depth.  Since CS 109 already tends to be insufficient preparation for advanced 200-level Stats courses, the same has to true for Econ 102A.  

(In general, since there are so many different departments teaching their own niche version of probability, it'd be a huge help for students if the various courses would all provide clarity on the extent to which they give enough background for further coursework in the Statistics dept., which is the natural home for the subject.  Even better would be to give clear guidelines on which alternatives can fulfill a requirement for students who want a deeper understanding on first exposure. Why students are made to choose among multiple versions of a course without such clarity provided by the university, given that it is permitted for so many versions to be taught, is bizarre.)",1632517412,1,0

"I've taken both and loved both (in fact, loving CS 157 was what made me go for the entire PHIL 150 sequence later on). But they're very different courses in structure.

CS 157 (with Genesereth, Fall 2018) is ""flipped-classroom"", so you do most of the learning on a website with some straightforward-ish exercises (with ""advanced material"" sessions in lecture time), there are no assignments, and you're graded entirely on two exams and whether or not the system registered you going over the website pages. Time commitment is low, it is pretty much entirely self-paced, and most people fail to find it too inspiring AFAICT (EDIT: to be clear, it is self-paced except for the exams, which were, for me, in person and timed, and the quarter deadline for viewing all of the material online)

PHIL 150 (with Icard, Fall 2019) is a normal math class: you learn stuff in a nice, cohesive order, do weekly problem sets with some proofs, have a final, etc. Time commitment is more than 157, but not bad (it's average whereas time commitment for 157 is below average). Quality of instruction here is fantastic, not just because Icard is wonderful, but also because the syllabus really is designed to be a very, very solid introduction to logic preparing students for further coursework. Course policies-wise, I also thought it was a very forgiving class, Icard being very considerate of students.

Neither is very practical / applied beyond the domain of logic, but 157 is slightly framed around automated logic systems sometimes so it could be a bit applied.

The upshot is I'd recommend PHIL 150, but if you're just trying to clear the requirement with minimal effort, 157 is probably the way to go. But if you think there's a chance you might really like this stuff and want to be inspired by lecture and maybe do more of it, then definitely go for 150 (or both, as I did)

"I posted this in another thread several months ago. Hopefully it helps and is relevant to your case:
-----------------------------

I'll say this: If you're going to CAPS seeking a long-term partnership with a mental health professional, you're may want to consider looking elsewhere. What they don't tell you upfront is that, because of limited amounts of counselors and a growing and demanding student base, they are encouraged to push students out of the system after approximately 10-12 visits.

This completely threw me against a wall about two years ago. I was seeing somebody there maybe once a week or once every other week for a period of several months. During this time, I felt as though I was making some significant progress and connecting with literally the first shrink in my entire life that sort of understood some of the shit that goes on inside my head, only to be blindsided by her telling me that they usually don't see students on a permanent basis, and that I'd have to arrange to see somebody new outside of CAPS.

I understand why they do this, given the need for rollover between students. But I was so taken aback by this policy that leaves people completely exposed and vulnerable after opening up and finally learning to trust another human being. It's a predicament that I sincerely wish I hadn't been placed into, because it's so frustrating and humiliating having to go through the process of finding a new therapist without any help or guidance, tainted by the fact that you had someone already. So you wade through a list of a hundred names of random therapists you find online, suffer through dozens of unanswered phone calls, bang your head against the desk because of insurance issues, only to be met with those awkward first-appointments where you sit in your stupid oversized chair like a doll on a store shelf being scrutinized for all the dumb things you're saying because all they want to do is start at zero and all you want to do is start where you left off with the other therapist. But they're just a stranger to you, and you're just a stranger to them, and the whole fucking thing is tainted forevermore. So you give up looking. Whatever.

Anyways... I suggest that if you wish to use CAPS in the future, you have an honest discussion about both what you need from a mental health professional, as well as what their long-term commitment can be. Of course, this is all from the standpoint of somebody who has always suffered with severe depression and wished to speak to someone regularly. If you have issues which may be accommodated by seeing somebody infrequently (once a month or every other month), then CAPS might be a good fit.",1632406683,5,0

"Hey OP I feel the exact same way. Not really sure what I’m doing wrong - I’m generally really friendly extroverted and great at making friends - but I haven’t been able to make more then like 3 friends since I started in 2019. I’m a super sophomore and took a year off. Frosh year in an all frosh dorm sucked because I didn’t get along with anybody. I was never included and they thought I was weird but never said anything. Now I’m in a co-op because I thought that would be better and I feel like nobody gives a fuck about me at all. Everyone is face-level friendly but I feel like an outsider most of the time.

I don’t really know what the issue is. I know it’s only week 3 and I’m not gonna find my platonic soulmate instantly but I’m begging to wonder if I made the wrong choice going here. Classes are fine, campus is beautiful, but I’m not used to people not wanting to give me the time of day.

"A few ideas to think about.

Apply to all those schools before you spent a large amount of research time ""narrowing your choices"". You may be accepted by all of them or only get into one. Early decision is a VERY small group, so don't get overly anxious if you didn't get in there.

A huge factor in picking your best choice might be the networking you will do in college that will have a heavy influence on your early employment opportunities. Yale sends a lot of students into government jobs so think living in Washington DC or Virginia. Stanford networking is Bay Area or LA. You get the drift. Think about where you want to live after school.

My daughter applied to 3 of the 4 schools you mentioned. Here was her experience. Stanford was the first ""early decision"". She was not accepted (more on that later). Yale was next and they accepted her application. She also got into Brown. Both schools tried to woo her into coming but she had applied to 15 universities and was determined to wait until all had accepted or rejected her before enrolling. 

Interestingly enough, although Stanford was the first college to decide on early decision, they were also the last to pick regular decision (end of April if I recall).

Stanford accepted her on regular decision. After looking at all factors she chose Stanford to attend. After moving in she requested in writing to look at her application review (she was just curious why she was picked). The one thing that stood out to her was the first date of application review was AFTER the date of ""early decision"". She had sent her application the very first day Stanford allowed so her theory was Stanford culled the early decision applications by some filter like financial hardship level and she was never in the running for an early decision acceptance.",1633425804,1,0

"&gt;Package center doesn't know where it is.

As I kind of mentioned in the situation above, I had a similar situation. The employee I spoke with said the shipping companies are instructed to place the packages outside and then the center goes and gets them, sorts them, distributes them. Sometimes the shippers place them in the wrong place, and they just sit outside unattended to since no one is looking for them. She had me fill out the lost package form (so someone WOULD look for it) and it was found by the next day.

What struck me was her basically implying that the shipping companies just place our packages outside. Maybe it was poor wording (i.e., maybe outside meant in some separate room or something), but if that actually means OUTSIDE and accessible to the public, it makes me a bit nervous for what can happen, especially to those packages that just sit there until their found.

"So sorry.  

Gotta agree--while EVGR-A is ""nice and new,"" the building size, wide hallways, and doors that shut automatically behind you don't lend themselves to building community in the way that older, smaller dorms do. And having no central dining facility in the building makes it harder to create community, IMO --eating together with the people you live with facilitates the bonds of friendship. I personally find smaller dorms and row houses with food downstairs lend themselves to creating a tight knit community.  Places where people leave their doors open and hang out in the halls and living spaces.   I'd look for places with those qualities.  Row houses (unthemed or themed) are great for building small, tight-knit communities.  You can even find it any of the dorms where the layouts facilitate hall hang-outs and eating downstairs together.

In your situation, I'd probably avoid the suites. Suites are good for bonding with the 4 or 6 people you live with, but not designed well to connect with the people living in the other suites.  

In the meantime, can you talk to the RAs about things they can do to build community at EVGR?  Courtyard gatherings, lounge hangouts, etc.  There are some great lounges with pool tables etc downstairs, but I have no idea why they designed them with closed/locked doors so no one goes inside. It feels like office conference rooms that don't lend themselves to spontaneous gatherings--- but maybe someone could take the initiative to create regular hangout hours there or in the main living areas for people in the building.

"It does get better, and will very soon. The classes have 0 bearing on your future research. They might be hard, but ultimately, as long as you don't fail your required classes (by the standards of your department/program) it doesn't matter. 

I think a lot of first-year PhD students put way too much weight on classes and bring with them other habits which worked for them as undergrads, but which need to go out of the door when they start the PhD. Ultimately, research is by far your number 1 academic priority, and many grad students need to become more selective with their time and attention to the extent that they need to make their research succeed. Things might seem hard right now, but you'll eventually figure it out and dial your effort into a level where you're doing only as well in your classes as you need to be. 

Maybe try forming study groups with your fellow 1st years? You might find that they're in the same boat as you. Also, see if you can make one of the classes CR/NC. Some programs allow you to take 1-3 classes CR/NC, some don't. It's worth looking into though, since I really think it'd help take some pressure off.",1633367975,7,0

"I graduated many years ago (2013), but Stanford was a very lonely experience for me. I never made lasting friendships or connections. I was in groups, I met people in class, but it was still quite lonely. I don't think I did myself any favors - I made some bad decisions early on (went from louder all-frosh that wasn't a good fit to a single sophomore year) and as time went on I just withdrew into myself more and more. I learned a lot, and am ultimately grateful for the time, but I certainly do envy others' experiences and lifelong relationships too.",1634528672,1,0

"This was exactly my situation as well.   


I cruised through high school AP sciences. I even self-studied for a few of them and got 5s on the AP test. Science was EZ for me I thought. Never made note cards, never truly ""studied"", you can just derive the equation from fundamentals and unit analysis if you ever forgot. 

Until I hit Ochem.   


First mid-term in OChem, 2.5 SD below average. I Bombed it. Literally big fat F. 

I had to re-evaluate my studying strategy, actually hit the books, and I rescued myself and ended up with an A- in the class at the end after doing well on the 2nd midterm and final. 

&amp;#x200B;

I generally find that science students have 2 patterns: 

1. Students who learn the types of problems and how to solve the problem. They learn by patterns, memorization, and heuristics around various types of problems and how to approach them. I.e. I see problem type A, i use formula type A, algorithm type A and solve this. 
2. Students who learn by conceptually understanding the fundamentals. They rarely have to memorize things, and prefer to have a understanding of how one concept relate to another. I see problem type A, it relates to foundational concept Y, and Z, which can be derived and shifted in this way and combining Y and Z.   


The challenge with OChem (and Chem in general) is that you actually need to do a bit of both. You need the memorize the reaction mechanisms and the heuristics (those are your tools), and you need to understand how fundamental concepts on how reaction mechanisms relate to each other (how to use those tools). 

Generally, in HS, you can get away with being very strong type 1 or type 2 science student. I was a type 2 science learner, and I really had to sit down and memorize all the reaction mechanics. It was VERY painful and difficult for me, but ultimately I learned a lot from the experience. I went on to graduate in ChemE, so you do get stronger from your experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, 1 B will not tank your med-school chances. Take it as a learning lesson on how to approach future science classes.",1636658295,1,0

CS229 is hard but the curve for that class is generous. If you're worried about grading then you could be fine. Something like 90% of the class gets some form of an A.,1636653230,1,0
HumBio Core doesn’t get curved this way afaik. A failed midterm probably puts one in C+/B- range with a stellar final,1636648730,4,0
"Hot take: You're actually doing fine\*

\* - asterisk because there might be additional context not communicated in this post.

Everyone has been giving study tips or saying keep trying, but you said you could get a **raw 90%** in a class by getting a 85% on the final. That means your current raw percentage is significantly over 90%. You're doing fine.

Most courses have curves (/ grade inflation) such that a raw 90% would be an A or even an A+, and it's even more favorable below that. I got a B in Math 51 when my raw percentage was somewhere between 70% and 75%. Even if you don't think this is the case with you course/instructor (and it's still probably more generous than you think it is), if you give yourself a tiny bit more slack those numbers get way less scary. Let's say you're sitting at 92% and your final is worth 25% of your grade. You could get a 72% on that final and still end up with a B+/raw 87%. And that's excluding whatever curve the final might have and most courses rounding up for letter grades (a 69% on the final would round up to B+).

Much more important that all of that though, you should do what's best for you. If your premed courses are consistently a source of stress for you, then you should consider if feeling that way for the rest of your years at Stanford (and wherever you go as a med grad student) is worth it.",1636619013,1,0

"You might try changing your studying strategy. I found that doing what you've described wasn't all that effective for me. What worked for me in biology courses was going through the slides and giving the lecture to an empty room (though an audience might make this work even better). I would start off by going through the lecture slides and making sure I understood everything on them with the help of my notes/textbook. Then I would strip all the text off of the slides and go through them, explaining what every figure was trying to convey out loud. I did this until I could tell you what was on each slide without looking at them. Doing that over the course of a couple days (or a really long night) worked really well for me. This assumes that everything on the exam is on the slides. I'd also recommend doing this over several days. 

I think this worked so well for me because it made sure I was thinking about everything we'd gone over in lecture and because it forced me to understand why everything was included on the slides. I also think that, for whatever reason, speaking out loud like you were teaching makes it easier for you to identify gaps in your understanding.",1636602899,9,0

"My chem TA had the same problem, she failed the midterm and didn't know where to go from there. She told me the thing holding her back was that she didn't try to see things multiple times. In High School, academics are a joke and you only need to see it once. In college, you actually have to understand the material so it's recommended that you try to tackle it multiple times. Give yourself several days to learn a concept. The mind is like a sieve and only so much can fit in per day so don't over do it. Play with the concept. What happens if I remove this factor? What happens if I add this factor? Question it. Why do people think this is such a big deal? Make it intuitive to the point where you can talk about in a normal conversation without coming to a roadblock. This is a very time consuming process but by the end you will feel great having mastered something. By the end of the course, you should be able to think critically about the material. You should be able to question concepts you see in the course.

As for my chem TA, she ended up doing extremely well in the chem major. She's now a Chem PhD at a top program. Your early performance doesn't matter too much, what you do later on matters much more.",1636599005,1,0

In my experience taking Psych 1 it wasn’t difficult or stressful, everyone seemed to enjoy it and did pretty well on assignments and midterms. 

Each professor decides how to grade their classes, so no, not all classes are “curved”. I do feel that the overall academic experience at Stanford is not as cutthroat as some other universities that are known for being more academically competitive. E.g. you have 3 weeks to drop a class, 8 weeks to switch to C/NC, and if you retake a course I think some professors let you replace your old grade with the new one.

So that's a huge plus! I definitely feel the other CS professors would write generic LORs which is why I'm not leaning towards asking them. On a different note, I did apply to the KHS program. It probably doesn't affect the application, if anything some of the application materials from it would be shared with the CS department",1636328408,1,0
"Listing scholarships you're applying to likely won't have a negative impact on your application; I think they consider it most relevant if you're applying to stuff like the Knight-Hennessy Fellowship. I'd be surprised if they made admissions decisions based on whether you were applying for scholarships or not, especially as many students (even those who can afford the full tuition) apply for scholarships.

As for LOR, I think the strength of a LOR is a function mostly of two components:

* (1) How positively they would endorse you
* (2) Whether they're in a credible position to endorse you

If a family member wrote you a LOR endlessly praising you, it wouldn't make a lick of difference because they're not in a credible position to judge whether you have the technical competency and genuine interest to excel at Stanford.

In contrast, if you got a fairly renowned CS professor to write you a LOR, but the LOR was very generic and full of platitudes (i.e. ""X was a good student. They took a CS class with me and got an A. I highly recommend them for your school.""), it also wouldn't really help your chances.

So for your situation, I think you should assess whether the non-CS professors would write a LOR that is positive enough to override the fact that they are not CS. (However, if they are in a CS-adjacent field such as Statistics, and can write about your passion/interest in ML/AI, it may be actually a big plus).

I also suggest you checking out this guide to the MS in CS admissions process by Karthik Raghunathan (Stanford MS CS 2010), who was an international student that got admitted and also sat on the MS in CS admissions committee. Although I'm sure a few things have changed in the past 10 years, much of the advice he wrote seems to be still very applicable: [https://nlp.stanford.edu/\~rkarthik/DAGAP.pdf](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~rkarthik/DAGAP.pdf)",1636327613,1,0

"Hey, I am a senior with diagnosed IBS and suspected SIBO (Insurance wouldn't cover SIBO test or antibiotics); here is what I wish I knew at the beginning of my time at Stanford.

A) If you are having issues with attending class, needing to dip out for the bathroom etc., talk to [OAE](https://oae.stanford.edu/students)! With a note from your doctor, OAE advisors can set you up with an academic accommodation letter to provide your instructors so that they don't question your needs and are better equipped to support your learning if and when you do have issues. Even if you only anticipate issues a few days a quarter, highly recommend starting the accommodations process now. 

B) For help with eating in the dining halls, you might find it helpful to meet with the [RDE nutritionists](https://rde.stanford.edu/dining/eat-well-stanford#special).. they might be able to help with special meal orders. Another option is meeting with the registered dietician, who can provide more general help ie low fodmap diet. For that, you just schedule through Vaden. Both these options are free for students, even without Cardinal Care. 

C) If you find that dining hall food just isn't conducive to your health and academics it might be worth a shot to ask for a medical accommodation for an apartment so that you can cook your own food. This would be something to address with OAE, your doctor and maybe RDE nutritionists. At a certain point, having a semi-private/private bathroom and full control of diet is worth missing out on the dorm experience. 

D) Personally, the things I have found really helpful in allowing me to eat ""normal foods"" are Beano, lactaid and benfotiamine. Beano is just the alpa galactosidase enzyme that helps with breakdown of stuff like garlic, onions, broccoli etc. Lactaid is the lactase enzyme, so milk breakdown. Both are easy enough to find at a pharmacy or grocery store and the generics are cheap. Benfotiamine is a synthetic version of thiamine, a B vitamin important for nerve health and proper enzyme production, and I have had a significant decrease in symptoms since taking it.

"Yes!!! I have Tinnitus. My early days of playing Socom in 8th grade on PSP messed up my hearing. My worst investment was getting that damn microphone that let me speak with people. 

Anyway, how loud is your Tinnitus? 

I tend to forget it is there. The only time I realize it is there is if I’m thinking of nothing, or before sleep at times. I tend to fall asleep quickly though. 

Does your tinnitus fluctuate in pitch?

I noticed mine does at times. There is something called “Tinnitus tone match” by Tinnitus Works, and I noticed that after listening to it at 50 - 75% volume that I hear silence. It reminds me what silence once was.

Also, I noticed I get worse symptoms when I go to a place like the club and stay for a prolonged period. Yesterday, I went to one, and I noticed that my Tinnitus was way worse after a prolonged period, so avoid those scenarios if possible. Try to avoid listening to loud anything.

One a side note I wonder if our Tinnitus is jaw deformity related? I noticed I hear another pitch of ringing when clenching teeth together...

Lastly, have you tried Lipo-Flavonoid? It does seem to make some sort of change, but it might not be majorly noticeable?

In this day and age, I am shocked when questioning people that they hear no ear ringing at all.",1637565398,1,0

"Thanks so much for your thoughtful response - are a phd student yourself or Masters?

I was initially considering applying to the phd program (I have a close friend with similar interests who is in the program and has spoken highly of it) but ultimately I think Masters makes more sense. I've been out of school a few years and my application is cookie cutter (4.0 gpa with a couple of grad courses, 1 summer research experience that my RA turned into a paper) but probably not exceptional enough for a top phd programs. Moreover I can't confidently specify an area of interest for research - hence going with the Masters for now. 

I hadn't heard of the Xtend career fair til now - it's incredible the ICME program has enough pull to create a custom platform. My hope is that the program opens up some doors to more interesting teams at a big tech company down the line, even if it's still only a SWE position. I have a great job by almost any metric, but I don't like the idea of doing webdev forever. My biggest concern is that the ICME Masters won't really put me in a different position (given that it sounds like many of the grads are trying to find jobs similar to the one I already have), but I think at the very least I'd still enjoy the coursework purely for self-satisfaction. But hopefully with a little luck and gumption, it'll open up some doors. Doing it part-time should let me hedge my bets (and get most of the tuition reimbursed).

&gt;As for cohort segregation, the PhDs are usually very close because it's a small program (6-11 ppl usually), while the MS program is bigger. So naturally ppl form their own friend groups, but apart from that, everyone just hangs out together! :)

That sounds wonderful! Hopefully if I get in (knock on wood), I'll find a group to hang out with. I miss the atmosphere of a school environment a lot - the atmosphere in industry teams are kind of boring in comparison.",1637545661,1,0

"While the Stanford introductory computer science courses are excellent (well-taught, well-scaffolded, thoughtfully designed, interesting assignments and exercises), if you are looking to pivot towards a career in software development, the full path you listed may not necessarily be the ""best"" path depending on your ultimate goal.

More specifically, the programs you mentioned + a MS program could take \~2-5 years to finish. You would gain a strong academic background in computer science, but if your ultimate goal is to go and get a job (where a good chunk of the work won't really look like your schoolwork), you probably could have spent your time and money better.

For example, other potential options you may want to consider as a career switcher:

* certain coding bootcamps: coding bootcamps have high variance in quality, but there are some that are able to more reliably place students in entry-level dev roles after \~6 months of intensive preparation
* company's apprenticeship programs: my company (along with others) have coding ""apprenticeships"" for entry-level programmers coming from non-traditional backgrounds (i.e. former teachers, veterans, individuals without higher education). These apprenticeships expect some level of coding background, but outside of that they plan to teach the trainees on the job.
* after finishing the basic courses you listed (106a, 106b, 107 etc.): start working on a portfolio of side projects, blog about them for visibility, reach out and see if you can get an internship/apprenticeship doing software work, and leverage that into a role as a programmer.

Those are just some of my ideas. My overall point here is focusing on completing a bunch of Stanford (or other university's) coursework may not be the only nor best method for accomplishing your career goals.",1637520722,3,0
"Hi! Current ICME student here.

I have no experience with Honors Coop, so I won't be able to answer any questions about that, sorry!

&gt;What kind of trajectories do ICME Masters students take? Do they tend to use the Masters as a jumping point to phd programs, or to industry?

I think the ICME is decently industry-focused, although this could be said of the School of Engineering (and Stanford) in general. There are a few MS students every year that wish to transfer to the ICME PhD program, and some who will be applying to other PhD programs. The majority of students ends up in industry, mostly tech (especially FB for some reason, but Google, Jane Street, Two Sigma, NVIDIA, Cisco, HP etc. are also common). This is also true for PhD students, but it's a bit more balanced there (70% industry to 30% academia maybe?).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm curious if ICME Masters students manage to connect with these research teams in industry, or if you need to be a phd student to get those roles.

Yes! There's the [Xtend Career Forum](https://icme.stanford.edu/get-involved/annual-events/xtend-career-forum) every year in early Nov, which is an event where you get hooked up with interviews with partner companies and organisations for internships or full-time jobs. (Basically it's like Tinder for students &amp; companies lol.) A lot of students join tech companies after their MS; see answer above.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;are the tracks ultimately that different in terms of opportunities, research prospects, cohort segregation etc...?

Not really. The ICME cohort is usually pretty close, so ppl in the same class just hang out together when working on PSets, no matter the tracks they're in. It doesn't seem to matter much either for research prospects, unless you choose, say, CompFinance but want to get into ML research, or smth else (relatively) unrelated... It mostly just determines what courses are compulsory and which aren't. As for cohort segregation, the PhDs are usually very close because it's a small program (6-11 ppl usually), while the MS program is bigger. So naturally ppl form their own friend groups, but apart from that, everyone just hangs out together! :)",1637518446,1,0

"&gt; Staff have been brought back to the office

My dept has been very flexible about wfh if you have a desk job; maybe this is on your dept or your supervisor in particular?

&gt;  there isn’t a world where testing once a week will actually prevent infected people from coming to the office

Yeah and there never has been. All it achieves is retroactive contact tracing, which is more useful for students who live in the bubble than staff who have lives outside campus as you say. Theoretically, though, the government is [stepping up and making rapid antigen tests reimbursable.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/health/coronavirus-testing-holidays.html) So starting next month we'll be ready for 2021! Of course that doesn't mean Stanford will take advantage with any kind of policy.

&gt; On top of this, staff are only notified that they had a “high risk contact” if they spent 15 minutes within 6 feet of an infected individual, without masks and indoors. I think it’s bullshit

Absolutely. For one thing, even the CDC and WHO finally gave in to all the evidence and admitted there's airborne spread, early this year, so the 6-foot thing is meaningless. They also don't differentiate between an N95 and a thin scarf that doesn't even form a seal. Realistically, though, you'd have to be in a pretty dysfunctional workplace to not even know that your coworker has suddenly gone into COVID isolation.

Also where are the ventilation upgrades? I'm not seeing any where I work. That should be a permanent change, after everything we've learned the hard way about air sanitation and healthy buildings and all that.

It does seem like Stanford is spending a lot of effort and even a lot of money to give the appearance of safety, without caring that much about the details of what would actually be safe. You'd think a university with some of the leaders in public health would be a little more serious to get its own house in order. On the other hand, our faculty also includes some of the leaders in, um, alternative public health...",1639859276,1,0
Haha yes! Especially since more lines of code isn't necessarily a good thing on a given project/assignment.,1639857316,1,0
"This is the way (and I agree with the others that this is a dumb question), although if you have a CS106A or CS106B folder, I'd suggest this:

find /path/to/CS106B -name ""*.cpp"" -exec wc -c {} \; | tr -s "" "" | cut -d"" "" -f2 | paste -s -d+ - | bc
```

which will just count them all up and add them together. If you've taken a relatively recent CS106B, this won't count the library files (in previous years, CS106B included the library in each project...). If you see a number in the millions, you probably want to do a more fine-grained approach. You may have to be a bit more fine-grained with CS106A code, too.

In the end, I'd probably use this as a guide, and then figure you wrote about 50% of the lines of code, and use that number.",1639852276,1,0

"Not a CS major so wouldn’t know anything about that. 

So you think it’s plausible that the CS department suddenly plummeted a whole letter for its median grade in one year for one of the most popular classes?

"I mean yeah exactly, you hit the nail on the head. It's become obvious that the CS department is becoming more aggressive in recent years, with all the changes they are making. Why do you think they are phasing out 110 and making [111](https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/lv2h4s/comment/gpabyh0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (basically a lite version of 140) a required class (effective this spring)?

Otherwise if this is not the case, assuming OP is being truthful, then probably the professor screwed up the grading. I mean, it's a huge class, so higher probability of there being a grade mistake, I suppose.",1639799129,1,0
Yeah I didn’t know extensions were a thing. I think the class varies depending on instructor.,1639798135,1,0
"Aren't students supposed to return to campus AND get covid tests before returning to the classroom? There's no way people fly in on the 2nd, get tested and cleared for Jan 3rd classes, thus chaos. Some students flying internationally have to quarantine (or is it 2 negative tests 5 days apart?)  so they would also likely miss the first week of class. 

Everything I've read is that it's about maintaining the existing guidelines for testing and realizing that many students won't have green passes in Health Check to get into buildings.  

Also, because they aren't reporting test results over the break, we won't know if there's a steep increase until *after* we return. 

As for flights, you can probably get away with a flight that first week, but you have to be back in time to do tests AND get results. My test this week took \~40 hours to get results, fwiw.",1639797173,1,0
Seriously? They usually have suggestions at the end of each assignment. I feel like it's not plausible that they wouldn't offer the opportunity to get +'s or ++'s.,1639796895,1,0
"There weren't assignment extensions this quarter, at least not that I remember seeing...",1639796651,1,0
"IDK what it's like this quarter, but when I did CS106A, most people (or at least a good third) did the extensions and would end up with +'s instead of just check pluses. It's not the same in CS106B, but since the assignments in CS106A were typically very simple without the extensions, I'm assuming that a lot of people would do them (e.g., an assignment+extension in CS106A took less time for me than just doing the assignment in CS106B). Getting check pluses only would then somewhat put you behind.",1639794063,1,0
"- What were your style grades? They are worth between 1/3 and 1/2 of the assignment grade.
- The check plus bucket is a range of grades. If you were borderline check/check plus on many assignments your assignment average might be lower than expected.",1639793315,1,0
"I took 106A this same quarter, and median for both exams was an A-. The professor explicitly said that if more people get A's, then they'll just give more A's, which seems to be hinting that this class isn't graded based on distributions, or else, roughly the same number of people will be getting A's regardless. 

I'm almost certain 106A did not have a B median. Going by this: [http://txti.es/stanford-grades-2020/images](http://txti.es/stanford-grades-2020/images), around 50-60%ish people get some sort of an A. Also, departments like Chemistry which are notoriously disliked for tougher grading and pre-med weedout curve to a B median. I doubt CS would be the same.",1639791273,1,0
"I would do it only in winter quarter, so I can ski",1639791110,1,0
"OP got more or less the median on the midterm and final. OP got check plus on the assignments, but so do most people. The only difference between OP and the ""average student"" is that OP missed 1/4 of the sections (2 out of 8). So OP's final grade is the median grade or slightly below. The median grade for most engineering courses is around B+. Therefore, OP receiving a B makes sense. Especially if the 106A instructors set the median grade to be a B, then it totally makes sense.",1639789868,1,0
is it very hard to get them? what are the limits usually?,1639788960,1,0
"Maybe for the final, but they explicitly said that 60-90 on the midterm is a B and 90+ is an A. Even if they downcurved on the final, OP is above median.",1639787679,1,0
"B seems really low. I did much worse (granted median was lower) and I got a B-. I would check in to make sure this is correct. I don’t agree with other commenters, and I’m pretty sure they’ve always outwardly said they would not down curve. Even if they did, since you are within the median, you should at minimum get an A- since over 50% of people get an A-, A, or A+ in 106a.",1639786690,1,0

Sorry didn’t check the quarter 111 was offered. Yeah 110 sounds like a solid choice!,1639778343,1,0
"Idk what everyone else is saying, but I read this and def thought it was a mistake. Not sure if this is always the policy, but every CS class I've taken has said they will never curve lower than what you're raw grade would have been, so I would have expected at least an A- too, maybe even an A. Even without this no curve down policy though, I would've still been expecting an A- too. I could obviously be wrong but those were my thoughts on it.",1639776795,1,0
"From my experience, the Art Studio classes have limited enrollment (with good reason because I can't imagine art being taught well to hundreds).

If you’re a prof at Stanford, the least of your priorities is some undergrad who rly wants an A instead of an A-. So while you might be successful in bumping your grade, you are definitely hurting your reputation in the eyes of that prof, which is possibly much worse than the absolute slightest of hits to your GPA.",1639763527,1,0
"TL;DR take 111 instead, drop 108.

Depends on how good you are at systems. I wouldn’t take 110, but would rather opt for 111 as the CS department is slowly phasing out the former. From what I’ve heard, 111 is a much more cohesive class than 110, which is sort of a survey of many different areas in systems. My friends have told me that 111 is front-loaded, so that can also be a plus. 

CS 108 sounds interesting but it doesn’t immediately strike me as a systems class. It seems like a more general purpose SWE class that can be applied to pretty much any domain that utilizes OOP. Given the time commitment for that class, I’m not sure if you’ll get a lot of bang for your buck, that is, if you rly are just interested in systems.",1639763328,1,0

"Don’t take an entire class dedicated to learning python. IMO that’s a complete waste of time. python is easy enough to learn that the best way to get better at it is to just get started on some python projects in your spare time. 

I also see a suggestion to take CS 224N. This might be helpful but in my experience the 224 classes are more oriented towards learning a specific deep learning librsry that is not really representative of python as a whole. These libraries might include pytorch or keras, which add so many layers of abstraction on top of python (which is already high level enough) that you don’t rly learn the language too well. But I still think that taking one of these classes is better than taking a dedicated Python course. Maybe build s game in python or something?",1639762890,1,0
That isn't their goal. Their goal is to cover their ass,1639762338,1,0
"Yeah this is the kind of class where everyone gets full marks on everything, so even a few points here and there will change the letter grade from A- to B+ to B. Actually the same for many so-called ""easy"" CS classes like 109, 145, 181/182, etc. In this case, seems like you are a student with ""average performance"" (full marks on assignments, score the median grade on exams), this will probably merit B+. Maybe your section absence will drop your grade down to B. If section is 5% of the grade, there are 8 sections, then missing 2 sections is deducting 1.25 percentage points from your overall grade, which can make a big difference when grading is so tight. Still seems a bit harsh, but I guess now you see the reason why some students literally will spend tons of effort to dispute a 1-point deduction on their assignment (I have seen this, as a former TA). I mean, it's an ultra-competitive school, don't let the fake casual-ness fool you.

The tough thing about the Econ major is that they are stingy with pre-reqs. The vast majority of Econ classes will not let you enroll unless you've taken the pre-reqs. Fortunately I think EE/CS adjacent classes like game theory and market design do not have pre-reqs.,1640832764,1,0

"That's the dilemma that faces many underclassmen. Honestly, you can go about alleviating this issue in a variety of ways:

* One approach is to take 20+ units for the rest of your Stanford career. Unless you literally are a robot or are taking courses that aren't challenging, this path is unfeasible for most students.
* Another approach is to find the most interesting, non-major courses you think you'll like and use them for your prereqs. That way you are not missing out as much while also getting you ready to graduate. 
* Finally, the last approach I can think of is to try to fit some of the classes you find interesting into your schedule when you can while also not overburdening yourself (e.g., no 20-unit quarters).

Stanford advertises a plethora of opportunities for its students. Unfortunately, you will most likely ""miss out"" in some aspects, and that's just a fact. You'll have to prioritize the most important classes/clubs/etc. you find most interesting and go from there. Good luck, and happy trails!",1640828157,1,0
"Hard to say. There’s not much scientific rationale behind these decisions, given the vaccination rate in Stanford and the Bay Area, plus the fact that The Powers That Be have lost willpower for more vaccine mandates making it unlikely that the vaccinated/unvaccinated numbers will look drastically different in a year’s time.

I spoke to someone in admin a couple months ago, and for better or worse they admitted quite frankly that political considerations are dominating the university’s pandemic policy these days. A lot of students and faculty do not feel comfortable being on campus without strict COVID protocols. I think that the university will get hell from parents if they don’t go back to the classroom, but they’ll delay this until the news cycle changes a couple times.
