"To clarify on 3.

The other 2k would go to your pocket, but understand that like any other loan, you will be expected to pay it back. I definitely encourage you to only use loans, IF you have no other choice. And if you decide to take out a loan, seek to get the Federal Subsidized option and then unsubsidized if you need it. Subsidized loans are granted to undergrads with financial need and they don't start building interest until like 6 months after you graduate.  Unsubbed loans start to accrue interest immediately. 

Also one thing that you can do is if you take out the 5k loan, be smart and frugal and keep it in a separate account or otherwise earmark it and not use it. When you need to start paying off your loans it can grant you some time and functionally lengthen your 6 month grace period if you need some time to get a job and get settled once you graduate. But again, UCF is generally affordable so I encourage you to use loans as a last resort, and if you do so, be wise, be deliberate, and have a plan to pay them back.",1633604546,2,0

"I know exactly what you‚Äôre feeling, it is a dreadful feeling. I want you to know that life has a funny way of working itself out. That we, especially as engineering students, are put under a pressure to perform and stand out and be so so smart, but you are not competing with anybody else. You are on your own timeline, finding out what makes you happy and fulfilled. If that means leaving school for a bit of time to refresh the brain or building yourself a support system to make it through the time you have left at university, that‚Äôs okay. I used to somehow think the world was going to end if I didn‚Äôt become an engineer and that pressure really got to me, I‚Äôd throw up before my exams and sometimes even during, just out of nerves. I got help, meds and therapy allowed me to feel in control again and helped me have a more positive outlook on my future. You can be anything you want to in this life, at your own time. 

The first thing I would suggest is to seek out a therapist. Learning more encouraging ways to speak to speak to yourself is key. Engineering makes everyone feel stupid, I promise. You are not alone in your struggle. 

Realize that consistency is more important than perfection. Even if you can‚Äôt make up the grades you want to right this second, you can still frequent office hours, or put in 15 minute chunks of lecture when you can. That matters. The little things add up!

I know how it feels to kick yourself for ‚Äúgetting yourself into this mess‚Äù, but try to be more forgiving to yourself. We are all still learning how to lead this life we want to live, and our paths are not always linear like how we made them out to be in our heads.

I got all my TAs numbers. I stop by office hours etc. it‚Äôs gonna take effort but you CAN do it. I know you can. If you want to talk dm me.

As far as the focusing issue, You may need to see a psychiatrist, let them know what you‚Äôre going through and how difficult it is to push through your school day. 

Also, Understand you are not alone in that feeling.. I‚Äôve struggled with this for years and still do!

But I also implemented a workout regimen so it balances me out when I have the ‚Äúadderall lows‚Äù

But all in all, my suggestion would be: 
1. Set an appointment with a psychiatrist, not just a counselor. 
2. don‚Äôt torture yourself, step. away! go run, lift, dance! anything active, eat and get back to it.. it‚Äôll help change your mood. rn you‚Äôre feeling down and out and that‚Äôs perfectly okay, so feel it. But don‚Äôt dwell in it. You got this!",1634620127,4,0

"Hello. I recently got my MA in history from UCF. I can‚Äôt speak on other universities, but for UCF, the history grad classes are in person (some might be hybrid with Covid, but I think they went back to regular mode). They are night classes as well, so typically 6-8:50, which helps those who work a regular 9-5. You can do part-time (1-2 classes per semester) or full-time (3 classes). I don‚Äôt recommend doing full-time and working full-time. Especially Historiography. That class is like 2.5 classes in one. You can be a graduate teaching/research assistant, which pays tuition (minus fees) and pays you a stipend, however you have to be full time for that. But it gives great experience. And sometimes they let grad students teach a class (AMH2010 usually). 
If you‚Äôre wanting to continue teaching with your MA, go for it. However, if you‚Äôre thinking of doing anything in Public History, don‚Äôt do it. At least at UCF. The department doesn‚Äôt really prepare Public History students for anything other than going for a PhD and staying in academia.

There's a 3D printing meetup in Orlando that I attend and meet people who enjoy 3D Printing and show off their new prints.

As for degree, think of it like an investment. Don't get something you think is ""fun"" or ""interesting"", that's the first mistake people make. Find a degree that is doable, provides job security, and a ROI for salary. You can do ""fun"" and ""interesting"" things as hobbies when you graduate and make money. When you gain experience and money, THEN you could find a ""dream job"" that you really enjoy.

College is fantastic if you make an effort to do something. If you are just going to college for that checkbox requirement or because you were told it's the only pathway, it won't be fun.

So, the good news is I think you have a good handle on the cause of your issues. And this is no small feat. Many people are quite miserable and are unable to discern a cause.

Anyway, this takes effort to solve but it's not too bad. My suggestion is to start looking up university clubs and such. And to hang out where other people are like the library and the university cafeteria. 

When I was in university, there was some club that had movies every week somewhere on campus. I also hung out in the library and the university cafeteria. I wound up knowing a lot of the ""regulars"" that hang out on campus. And as a male, I got to meet a lot of the women in the dorms due to the cafeteria.

I think if you get friends in the way I described and as your social calendar fills up, you will find university much more palatable. Sure, many people show up with friends at university. But there are many people like you as well. I didn't know anyone when I started university either. But university wound up being one of the greatest times of my life.",1637727846,13,0
"THIS WAS ME. This was me at Valencia AND this was me when I transferred to UCF. I didn‚Äôt have any friends. I went to school, work and home. That‚Äôs it. Never went out, never went to a football game, never participated in homecoming week, never joined clubs. Never dated. Literally‚Ä¶ Nothing. School, work and home. It was the most miserable five years of my life. I became severely depressed and suicidal BUT I survived.

So. Let me offer some advice: As far as friends and having a social life ‚Äî Join some clubs! That is the easiest, most convenient way to make friends. Do u have a Twitter? If so, search up #UCF(ur class year here) [ex: #UCF23] and u will see a bunch of students on there, another easy way to make some friends. Join groups on Facebook. Be social in class, talk to some people around u. There‚Äôs a bunch of ways to make friends on and off campus. Trust me. You just have to put urself out there. 

As for deciding on a major or career, do ur research! I started off as a Biomedical Science major and after four years and lots of research, I switched to Psychology. &amp; Now I‚Äôm going back for my second bachelors in Biomedical Science. Lol. I didn‚Äôt figure out what I wanted to do until I graduated this Summer. So. Trust me. You have time. You‚Äôre still young. Don‚Äôt feel rushed, like u have to have it all figured out right this second or that ur behind because u don‚Äôt have it all figured out right this second. Research different career paths, different majors, watch YouTube videos, TikToks, do some shadowing in different fields. &amp; Then decide on what u want to do. YOU. HAVE. TIME. YOU. HAVE. TIME. YOU.. HAVE.. TIME!

You got this. Don‚Äôt give up. I was literally in ur shoes so I know exactly how u feel. It‚Äôs miserable as fuck but trust me.. You got this. Feel free to msg me if u wanna talk or vent or anything ü§ç",1637727477,43,0

"I was in the same situation as you. As far as friends go, if you have any hobbies you should pursue organized clubs that are related to those hobbies. I know this doesn't sound very appealing but getting a job somewhere around campus is also a really good way to make friends and some extra money. Also student housing (on and off campus options) can match you up with other students to live with, which can be hit or miss, but I have met the best friends of my life through random roommate matching. I know its easier said than done, but don't be afraid to put yourself out there.

If you are frustrated/confused about the direction of your life I would seriously consider talking to a mental health professional about your struggles. That helped me immensely, UCF has options for students. Choosing a career path is not easy and while college is not necessary, the cards will be stacked against you without a degree.

"Do you still live with your parents? Or do you live in some type of student/on campus housing? Do you have a job in the area? If you live with your parents, that could make it pretty hard but if you have even a part time job, it forces you to interact with other people. I'm like 10 years graduated at this point but I had a great time. For me, it was easy because I liked to drink, smoke, go to parties, and I made easy friends with my roommates in student housing. I was a weird mix of introvert, sometimes extrovert, and nerd. I met plenty of introverts, non-drinkers, etc at parties and work though. People getting out of their comfort zone and I had really cool conversations with people I never would have met otherwise.

It's ok if this is not you. And the pandemic would have made things so, soooo much harder for me, so please don't give up. There are a lot of things around the area that should give you a chance. After I left Orlando, there were video and board game 'bars' that popped up and I'm so sad that I missed that, because I feel like that would have been my perfect niche. The tailgating is super fun too, even if you're not a drinker or football fan, you're forcing yourself to be among social people that will probably initiate conversations so you don't have to.

Please, force yourself to get out of your comfort zone though; you have no idea what fun awaits you. Even though I had lots of fun and wouldn't trade my time there for anything, I really wish I would have explored clubs or things related to my interests while I was there. UCF has a lot to offer, you just have to force yourself out there.",1637725223,1,0

"Hey there!

I used to work as a leasing consultant at a similar student community near UCF. We had a handful of tenants with similar issues as you with their roommates. However, we were more than happy to transfer them to another apartment, and once they reached out to us, we managed to get them situated into another unit within days- assuming we had another space available, of course. It was a little easier to find them an extra space, because I worked here right in the peak of COVID, so lots of rooms were vacant.

If this alternative is not available for you, you *might* be able to break your lease and move elsewhere. I did not work at knights circle so I don't know the specific lease terms there- but, at the community I worked it, they swear up and down that you are unable to break your lease unless you are medically withdrawing from school. But, it's not impossible like they make it seem. If you are genuinely feeling unsafe, they may be able to do something for you. I've seen it happen. Keep in mind, though, it's tedious and rare. Can't hurt to try though. 

Another poster said that subleasing is a good option as well, and I agree. You also may have the option to transfer your lease to someone else as a whole- my community did. All you have to do is find someone willing to take over the remainder of your lease, and maybe pay a transfer fee, which is usually around $200-$300. Then, you're out of the lease agreement for good. I know that knights circle is a highly demanded complex in the UCF area so it probably wouldn't be as difficult as you think!

I don't recommend approaching them on the issues regarding race. Ignorant people will stay ignorant unfortunately, and since you currently live with them, you don't want any further trouble or retaliation. I would just exclude yourself from the situation, as you have been doing and contact your leasing office. If they do anything physical to you, or hint at doing anything physical, definitely contact the police.",1639862706,1,0

"I‚Äôm a Comp Eng senior and honestly don‚Äôt sweat it. 2048 is classical physics dealing with Newtonian mechanics, majority is doing word problems and extracting the relevant bits of info and manipulating some general formulas with algebra, and sometimes basic calc, to get what you want. 

Digital systems is a weird one but it‚Äôs mostly Boolean logic and gate-level logic, I took it with Suboh Suboh, don‚Äôt recommend him but others will. This class is easier if you are relatively familiar with C programming if I remember correctly. Here‚Äôs the list of topics from my syllabus for this class: 
Number Systems and Conversion, Boolean Algebra, Applications of Boolean Algebra, Karnaugh-Maps,  Multi-Level Gate Circuits, Multiplexers, Decoders and  Programmable Logic Devices, Latches and Flip-Flops, Register and Counters, Sequential Circuits, Analysis of Clocked Sequential Circuits, State Graphs and Tables, Circuits for Arithmetic Operation
 
For studying this stuff, I honestly just googled the topic specifically and did the examples that Suboh posted and that was enough for me. 


Diff. Eq. Was, to me, the easiest of the math sequence we have to take. Once you figure out the patterns for the transforms and for the partial differentiations you‚Äôll be good. I used Paul‚Äôs online math notes to get through this class when I needed assistance. 

The others you mention, linear circuits and electronics, build off of the previous one sequentially, almost starting from PHY2049. 2049 covers the basics, and foundational stuff (kind of) for electricity &amp; magnetism, but you go more in depth on actual components, capacitors resistors and inductors, what they do, and how they affect things in the circuit with LC I. 

In LC II it‚Äôs basically switching from time analysis to frequency analysis using the Laplace Transform that you should be familiar with from Diff Eq. Then in Electronics I you add diodes and transistors to those concepts from LC I&amp;II. 

I had Reza Abdolvand for LC I, Mahdi Assefzadeh for LC II, and Brian Kim for Electronics I. While I struggled for Electronics I, I would recommend all of these professors for their respective classes. The material in their lectures, to me, was sufficient for passing the class, and learning the material. 


You‚Äôll be able to find plenty of materials to study for and prepare but I wouldn‚Äôt really stress it too much yet since you‚Äôre still taking phy 2048. What I DO recommend is that you practice and refine your math skills, especially algebra. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve seen mistakes others ( and myself) have made because my algebra wasn‚Äôt up to snuff, and it‚Äôs easy to make unnecessary mistakes as a result. 

If you do decide on EE, Reza is a great source of information and help, especially if he comes to like you and get to know you outside of class.",1639846204,1,0
You cannot really study these courses simultaneously as most rely on each other.

you could definitely get into ucf but i think you would be safer if you boosted your gpa and sat score. when you apply to honors for transfer students, if there's a supplementary materials section, i would recommend adding a personal essay of some sort that discusses your background and what you've been through. i did this and i think it helped me with winning over the honors admission committee. if you need help or advice with applying to ucf and or honors, you can always message me :)",1639808412,1,0

Invitation homes seems alright from what I‚Äôve seen. If you have $150-200 handy, get a real estate agent for your first time renting because it does make you look a bit more professional. You‚Äôd be signing one lease and splitting it with roommates , typically. If you want individual leases, go with apartments. However, apartments will be more expensive- but they‚Äôll be less work since you don‚Äôt have to calculate out bills each month and potentially worry about paying someone to mow a yard or doing that yourself. 
I started looking last July for a place to rent in a august, and couldn‚Äôt find a single place that was less than $650 a room and spent a fortune on application fees, was forced to just renew my current lease instead.

"As others mentioned, it's nationally standardized. There's a paper copy of the study guide available on Amazon, if you want the official stuff.

Otherwise, /r/organicchemistry has some advice if you search for it. Again, it's the same test everyone taking the course in ACS accredited universities will take, so lots of people across the country have made materials that can help you.

As an aside to temper expectations.

You can actually also see how other professors across the country apply letter grades based on score. You're not expected to get 70/70 on the exam (though it's possible).

Usually professors will take the national average (usually about a 32-36) and curve that to be a mid-B. Getting in the high 40s is almost always an A. That's like a 49/70, or 70%, being an A. The 90th percentile nationally is usually about a 48-50, for what it's worth.

Basically, if you get a 60% on the exam, that's actually pretty decent. When taking it, if you don't immediately know the answer, skip the question. You don't need all of them to get an A. Going in with that mindset will help quite a bit.",1638817818,1,0

for off campus, lazy moon is a must as you said. waterford lakes is nice to drive around, you can show him all the places and maybe stop for ice cream at the marble slab. marlows tavern is really nice in waterford for food too (idk how long ur staying). 

if you want to go even further off campus (like 30 mins) go to winter park and just walk around. so many little boutiques and nice little restaurants and cafes. it‚Äôs not too far off campus if he has a car and it makes for a nice day trip. i used to go when i needed a break from classes. just sit in the park area and relax.",1638816652,2,0

"Pharmacy tech here; You can make an appointment at publix pharmacy if the ucf one closes too early for u to get both those shots. Flu shot is a quick one to process so they will tell u about 10 to 15 mins to process it

COVID-19 booster, it has to be 6 mos after ur second shot if u got Moderna or Pfizer, or ur single if u had JJ. Also, depending on the publix, it would be about a 2 hr wait to process a COVID shot bc appointments recieve precedence, so appointments are preferred over walk ins. When making ur appt be careful about answering immunocompromised. Depending on the shot u want to get, there are higher doses for them which is not necessary for someone who doesn't need it.

This is all if u decide to go with publix. Other pharmacies like Walmart or CVS have different processes and wait times (each publix pharmacy has different wait times as well based on their workload for their area).",1638812095,1,0

"I seem to be the resident ABSN expert around here, so I'll try to answer your questions.  Brace yourself for some hard truths. 

1.  That's a really low GPA to get into the program.  It's too low to even submit an application (need over 3.0 to apply).  A more typical GPA for acceptance would be in the 3.6 range.  Only 1 out of 4 applicants are accepted into the program for 2nd degree BSN.  Believe me, the classes are far from easy, so you'll really want to be prepared for the struggle. 

2.  Shrug.  Nobody has all the prerequisite classes on the day they start thinking about becoming a nurse.  You can just re-enroll at UCF and declare a pre-nursing major to fill the gaps.  I did it.  It's pretty simple.  But I had to take 7 classes to collect the whole set. Going to Valencia/Seminole State would be cheaper and possibly easier.  Acing your prerequisite classes will not make you stand out very much.  Most accepted students have a 4.0 in the pre-requisites column(s).  

3.  Anybody can take the TEAS exam. Grab a prep book, read it, do the practice exams until you feel good about your score.  Pay $70, take the exam.  If your score is low, study harder and wait 30 days, try again for an additional $70.  You can try 3 times each year.  

If you've reached this point, you're probably thinking the situation is hopeless.  You will never become a nurse, right?  

That's not what I'm trying to say.  I do want to be honest and say you're not going to do it at UCF.   

There is still hope, though.  

1.  Consider going to a community college and just getting an ASN degree.  It's all you really need for an RN license.  You cannot imagine how easy it is to get hired right now, even with ""just"" an ASN.  Most hospitals will require you to ""upgrade"" to a BSN within 5 years of being hired.  They will also pay most/all of your tuition (expect to see a standard offer of $5,000 per year) for the upgrade and make a sincere effort to be flexible about your schedule to enable you to complete your classes.   

I work with nurses from both Valencia and Seminole State.  They're talented and well-educated.  

You can even get that BSN upgrade from UCF -- https://nursing.ucf.edu/admissions/bachelors-degrees/#rn once you have an RN license.  It's a different path, but you might notice there is no GPA-based admissions decision, because being an RN proves you can do hard things in a way that a GPA does not. 

2. I hesitate to mention this, but ECPI in Lake Mary is a private university offering a BS-to-BSN accelerated program (I think it's just 12 months).  They're accredited and you WILL be able to take the NCLEX-RN exam.  You're not going to like the price tag. But it is an option. You might also want to see this:  https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/nursing-overall?schoolName=ECPI+ 

I work night shift.  This is one of my nights off, but I'll be awake for a while.  I'll try to keep an eye on this thread tonight if you have any questions.  I might even consider a phone call, but PM me first.",1640913706,1,0

"Look at the different school's catalogs and review the Plan Of Study and course offerings for the Computer Science major.  See which one appeals to you most.  If you can visit the schools, it helps because a lot of people ""just know"" after a visit.

USF used to require students to finish Physics with Calc 2 before they could take Computer Architecture, which would hold you back from progressing with higher level CS coursework, but it looks like they dropped that requirement.  

UCF has the foundation exam, which is a concern for some, but honestly, it weeds out students who aren't really cut out for the program.  Information Technology is usually the fall back major.  The math and physics requirements are lighter for IT, but there are more required classes in Network/Security, and that's not everyone's thing.

I know UCF grads who've been told they were much more competent than USF grads, FWIW.

Most UCF CS students who had an internship were paid well for their time.  The CS internships that I've been told about in Tampa that were targeting USF students were low paid or unpaid.         

UCF has Hack@UCF and USF has the Whitehatters, so check them out.  UCF has an amazing, well funded programming team and I don't think USF has had anything active in that arena for a while.  Of course, you are always able to pursue projects, competitions, hackathons, or whatever on your own thanks to the internet so don't let your location ever hold you back.  

I've been told by a USF grad, ""I wish I attended UCF"".  

Personally, I think UCF is head and shoulders above USF for CS.  UCF may not be a flagship or a ""Pre-eminent university"" but it cranks out some amazing software engineers.

"It is a money scam.

They claim something like they are moving to a new place, their pet will be there before they are (staying to sell their old place or something). They agree to some absurd payment. Like $100 a day. Most students stop thinking straight.

Well, then they send you a check for like $4,000 instead of like $1,000 (watching the pet for 10 days). They claim it is for closing on the new pkace, for work to be done, whatever. The wrong check was sent to your account on accident. They ask you to wire them back the $3,000 difference. ""Honest mistake, we trust you won't keep the difference. Please hurry, so we can send the money to the correct party.""

Well, the original $4,000 check is bad. Most banks will show the $4,000 in your account before the bank verifies the validity of the check. Queue 3-4 days later when the check bounces (fake account, fake bank, etc). Suddenly the student has $4,000 removed from their account. At this point they have likely already sent $3,000 to the scammers, so many students are suddenly at a negative balance and start facing penalties/fines.

The scam preys on people that want to do the right thing. They feel guilty or concerned they have money that was sent on accident and quickly want to fix the issue without thinking about what is happening. Most people also don't want to upset someone that is over paying them for easy work.

Often these scammers are in another country, so there is no recourse. You are out $3,000 (or however much).",1632557337,37,0

"I respectfully disagree with the later part of your post. Medication should be the absolute last resort for OP (like borderline being hospitalized for a mental illness). to be honest, i think psych meds are extremely overprescribed to college kids. These medications can be incredibly harmful if misused or abused, not to mention there are messy sides like side effects, dependency, withdrawal, and SSRIs in particular have a 60% relapse rate within 6 months of trying to come off. They can very often leave patients in worse condition than they began. 

I understand you may have had a positive experience with medication as a crutch, bit please keep in mind that you are an anecdotal. Regardless, I don‚Äôt think suggesting OP get on psych meds is something redditors should be doing. These are extremely serious situations that shouldn‚Äôt be discussed over the internet.
