"I believe so.

On their website for prospective transfers, it says that unless you have 32 semester credits, you must submit standardized testing.

On their main website for admissions, it says that standardized testing is not required from Class of 2025.

Based on that verbiage, I'd assume that Class of 2025 is the only one that gets the standardized testing requirement waived.

You can ask admissions themselves to double check.",1600972569,1,0

For discounts around NYC, here's [a list from the Admissions team](https://www.nyu.edu/admissions/graduate-admissions/grad-adm-blog-posts/nyc-fun-and-events-/grad-student-how-to--perks-of-being-an-nyu-student.html) (this is applicable to all students, ignore the grad student tag). 

Finally, a few more [general student discounts from the NYU Dispatch](https://wp.nyu.edu/dispatch/discounts-available-for-the-nyu-student/). Here's a [more comprehensive list on general discounts for any US college student](https://collegeinfogeek.com/student-discounts/) from CollegeInfoGeek like auto insurance or from stores. 

Lastly, whenever you go anywhere for the first time, NYC or not, ask if they do student or NYU discounts, many places do and it doesn't hurt to ask, don't be shy if it's gonna save you some dough. Many of them don't post it super prominently around their store. 

**Potentially Useful for COVID**

- If you're **food insecure** and need help covering that, here's a [list of resources](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/history/resources-forms/departmental-resources1.html) NYU provides. I made use of the **Courtesy Meals** system where you can request dining dollars that other students who have unused credits and donate them to the system, it's pretty dope. There's also a food insecurity table with snacks I believe in the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center (KJCC, 53 Washington Square South)? If anyone else has seen it please correct me, I'm unsure which floor it's on (and also might be confusing which building it is 😬)

- Apply for a **COVID grant on Albert** (Finances -&gt; COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund) for this semester and **Financial Appeal: Spring 2021** for next semester. The COVID Relief fund is for immediate needs like food, housing, etc. and only asks for what you'll be applying it toward (money is sent to the direct deposit account linked through the Bursar) and the Spring appeal gives you space to write your reasons. IMPORTANT NOTE: the Covid emergency appeal grant can only be submitted once and I am unsure if you are able to get a partial amount if you are rejected for aid, I called fin. aid to try and get more aid (I lowballed because I thought if I went too high I'd get rejected and get nothing) and they pretty much told me I was SOL. So be careful and though it should go without saying, please don't apply unless you actually need the money. You're taking funds from students who are unsure how they're going to eat and survive right now, let alone get through classes.  

- **Mental Health Resources:** NYU Health Center has a **Wellness Exchange** text line &amp; appointments, [here's their landing page](https://www.nyu.edu/students/health-and-wellness/wellness-exchange.html), just navigate to what you need. From me, here's a [blog post from author Kristin Cashore](http://kristincashore.blogspot.com/2020/08/to-student-stuck-in-toxic-home-during.html?m=1) (*Graceling, Fire, Bitterblue, Jane Unlimited*) for those stuck in toxic home environments with resources and ideas to make it through the semester remotely. Aside from that, do your best to **reach out to friends or acquaintances you may not have spoken to in a while and try to reconnect**, it's healthy for both of y'all. Set up some Among Us and chill nights, group Netflix streaming sessions, or just times to have a group call and talk. **It's not weak or embarrassing or shameful to lean on your support network.** In the same vein, **reach out to your professors to ask for extensions or additional support if you need it**, I'm sure most of them are happy to give you some leeway given the situation. You won't get anything you don't ask for, so even if you're like me and majorly uncomfortable with asking for favors or help or support, do it anyway. It's a good habit to get into! People like helping people; just remember the feeling you get when you help out a homie with something, do a favor for a relative, or just something small for a stranger. You're giving that feeling to whomever's helping you, so don't feel like it's a one-way ""transaction"" of energy or investment. 

Hope this is helpful to someone, feel free to reply with any additional resources or strategies you feel are important to add. Cheers and take care of yourself! 💌",1603076707,6,0

I am in a situation where I have a pretty good relationship with my family and I am scared that if I were to stay in the dorms in the spring I would be very lonely due to the cold weather.

I don't know too much, but based on what I've seen/heard, I like Manhattan so much better(various factors), and I also don't want to be so distant from the main campus.

I'm a CS major, my GPA isn't very great, I'm retaking my SAT in December and my current practice test scores are in the mid 1500's. I think my personal statement is good and I'm working on my final draft right now. I haven't started the Why NYU essay yet but hopefully that will be a strong essay as well.

I want to know if I should apply to CAS instead? Do I have a chance of getting in there? Which has a better acceptance rate? Also if I get into Tandon, would I be allowed to live in the Manhattan dorms and go to Brooklyn for classes everyday? Also would I have a better chance of getting in as undecided or as a CS major?

"You make friends in classes and activities honestly. I know it’s different this semester/year, but at least for me it wasn’t about where I lived. You meet people in classes, and if you vibe with anyone grab food with them, meet before or after class, invite them to things. You’ll never meet anyone just staying in your dorm/apartment either way. And even in online classes, speak up in your breakout rooms, show you have a personality. It’ll make other people more comfortable to be themselves and it’ll be easier to find someone you click with. But don’t expect to make friends in every class either. Some classes are just about passing lol or sometimes the people are just boring. But you gotta try. Everyone’s looking for friends this year, put yourself out there a little bit. And going back to like your actual question, I’ve lived in a dorm freshman year and the last two years have been off campus, and I made most of my friends just in my classes by cracking jokes with the person next to me, or asking a question about the homework, or just realizing we have multiple classes together so might as well get to know each other. You won’t stay friends with everyone you meet in college but you won’t have any friends at all if you never put yourself out there. Good luck!",1603049939,3,0
"Hi :) I’m a student who is high risk! And I’m here to tell why this is terrible and selfish to say! 

1. I don’t have anywhere to live that isn’t campus housing. I am taking every fucking precaution possible (precautions that, it’s worth noting, aren’t accessible to everyone). I am using grocery delivery services when possible, I’m not seeing friends, I’m taking all remote classes, I’m not even going to drs appointments I need to go to. But I am still being put at risk by the actions of other students because I have to live here in campus housing. I share elevators with you, I’m coming into contact with the same staff members as you. I also know of multiple other high-risk people living on campus because they don’t have other places to live. So yes, there aren’t many people our age who are high risk, but we do exist and you are still coming into contact with us, so YOU need to be taking the restrictive precautions you say only people coming into contact with high-risk people should take. That includes doing remote classes 

2. Even ignoring high risk people like me, don’t you care about the people you’ll come into contact with going about your daily life and going to in-person classes? Even outside of the dorms, your classes, and people like me, you need to assume you’re coming into contact with high-risk people in the city. A city that has been affected enough by this, and where Black and Latinx low-income workers are being disproportionately affected by this virus. You need to think of them too. 

3. The precautions us high risk people are taking are costing us just as much - often MORE - than taking some precautions will cost you. The problem is this: If the percentage of society that is not high risk goes about their life relatively normally, still going out with lots of friends, still doing in-person classes, going out to dining, etc, then high-risk people have to lock down 1000x more than we would if you all were just doing remote classes, only seeing a few friends, consistently wearing masks, etc. As I said I’m literally putting off drs appointments because I need to stay locked down because of how low-risk people have handled this situation. I need to do physical therapy and conditioning for my health issues that can ONLY be done on gym equipment I don’t have, but I now can’t safely go out and do these things and it’s costing my physical health. I also haven’t seen any friends since late February. Literally. I don’t even feel safe going out with 1 or 2 friends because too many people are going out with 10. It is killing my mental health. I am so depressed and lonely. But you think I should lock down more so that you all can go about your normal lives for YOUR mental health. Why is yours more important than mine? Why is it okay to force us to lockdown more for your lives to open up

4. Finally, I’m not sure how assholes like you don’t realize this yet given how often it’s being talked about, but A TON of people - including people our age! - are developing severe long-term health effects because of COVID. These are debilitating, life-changing health effects that anyone is at risk of. So you can’t be this cavalier about going back to in-person classes just because it’s not killing many people our age.",1603049915,0,0

* **Incremental case change**: Hard to say exactly when these cases are coming from, but there are *potentially* 24 new cases discovered since my update yesterday. Not much more info right now because the data seems incomplete and the State Dashboard has yet to be updated

"yes they do care about your IB1 grades. If you had 4s or 5s it wouldn't look good unless your school is notoriously known for grade deflation, or your surrounding area has similar grades.  38-41 out of 42 sounds about right, but I know some people who got in with 38/45 predicted (definitely fewer though).",1602007172,1,0

"Let's say NYU goes remote. The only thing that changes is everyone is on Zoom, instead of 99%. My understanding is that even the blended classes, barely anyone shows up.

This is not the threshold to ""go home"". This is the threshold to ""don't physically go to class"".

It sounds like the restrictions and ""hard lines"" were all smoke and mirrors, and really they're just playing everything by ear.

I think those were a huge factor in contributing to virus spread, and if they’re gone (or if people at them caught it and are isolated for now), should we see a decline? Maybe

At the same time the city is going thru it’s own uptick &amp; fall is supposed to bring virus spread anyway so I think the goal is pretty much — can we keep operating at the same level as rn or lower",1601992612,1,0

It's a crazy time for all of us and I'm just as certain as you that some professors are slacking outside of the classroom environment. It's definitely unfair to have to pay for tuition that doesn't include the college experience: meeting new people on campus, dropping in on interesting clubs, and just being there.

I'm seeing a lot of people concerned about being sent back home and honestly that is almost an impossible situation. The risk of sending people back home across state lines, especially  via public transport, to spread the infection further is too high. Classes would just become remote and the quarantine would go in effect until test results came back negative. Cuomo says if there's 100 cases universities will have to go remote for 2 weeks.

I'm really sorry to know you're going through this. What resources are being provided to you during this quarantine period?",1599976161,4,0

"I don’t know why you’re being downvoted. 
Universities knew. 

To bring students back to campus from all over the world amidst a global pandemic was irresponsible at best, and grossly putting money over safety at worst. 

University staff have admitted they just need to keep students through the add/drop period to collect full tuition. I really hope they don’t send everyone back home- that would be massively unsafe and I can only hope the history books represent the colleges accurately- as greed driven institutions actively ignoring health to make their income.

Cheers to op for doing everything right- it’s not OPs fault and I hope they are safe and well. I can’t even imagine being in school right now... I would just gap year honestly.",1599974415,16,0

I freaked out, and immediately ordered a new mail-in from my current university, even though I know that the transcript I ordered last time was official as well. 

Is there anything I can do about this? I don’t know that it will be mailed until after Nov. 1. Does it even matter? Will Gallatin accept my “Unofficial” transcript? Can they view it themselves and see that it’s official and watermarked? Thank you!",1604096443,1,0

If it seems like it’s adding nothing to the discussion, that’s because that’s true — I’m just repeating myself so people don’t see CNN call an election and automatically assume Biden won. That’s all. I’ve been repeating myself because that’s how to get my point across without people going on a tangent about election fraud.

November-January can be seen as a transition period, but again it may not seem like that for this cycle because Trump has yet to concede and therefore, since we officially don’t know the president elect, there is nothing to transition to until we find that out officially. Again, this is not adding anything to the discussion but I think it should be reinforced especially given the thinking process of the typical NYU student/NYC resident.

I did the first shut down in nyc and was lucky to have a spacious apt, but outdoor space is critical and my ""big"" apt felt pretty small after a few months.

"I haven't taken classes with Professor Mead, but I suggest you look into the reason why Mead has been criticized so heavily this past year. His paper ""Poverty and Culture"" suggests that Black and Latino Americans face disproportionate poverty because they are not European and lack work ethic. Let me lay out some choice quotes from our distinguished Professor Mead.


""Whites fear to associate with groups that, on average, do not display the inner-driven, moralistic temperament that allows strangers to trust each other in an individualist society.""


""Today, the seriously poor are mostly blacks and Hispanics, and the main reason is cultural difference. The great fact is that these groups did not come from Europe. Fifty years after civil rights, their main problem is no longer racial discrimination by other people but rather that they face an individualist culture that they are unprepared for.""

Seems like intense essentialism to me. But you can [read](https://www.terpconnect.umd.edu/~pnc/temp/Mead2020_Article_PovertyAndCulture.pdf) his work for yourself.

"I'm a senior at NYUSH and I don't think it's worth it for that amount. 

&amp;#x200B;

The negative points: The campuses are pretty different and on the whole, employers haven't been that interested. It feels like they just see it as a fun, study abroad period (which it's not). The professors aren't as notable as the ones in nyc, and the classes are more challenging for what reason I still don't know? The clubs are okay, but the coolest one is TAMID where you can intern in Israel for a summer (and its less competitive than the nyc tamid chapter). If you don't know that much about china and haven't already actively planned on staying there then it's not going to change your mind. I said the same things, and 4 years later I have no intention of starting a career there. Plus, it's becoming more difficult for foreigners to get jobs there as they are trying to depend on less and less foreign talent (although another post mentioned nyush students are circumventing it through talent 4 visa). The admin is not your friend no matter what they say, and there are fewer people willing to petition for changes. I think that's due to a large majority of Chinese students willingness to comply with more difficult hoops to jump through than internationals (from my own experience). Most employers have a harder time understanding why an American would go to nyush instead of nyu (they don't realize you can't get accepted into both then choose), so it's up to you to be creative. The counselors/career center/wellness center are obviously biased towards the Chinese students and geared more towards getting jobs in China with not as much help and guidance for internationals. Right now with COVID, it's going to cost between $3K-$7K just to get to the campus (i.e. price-gouged flights due to no demand, 2-week quarantine cost at a hotel that you don't get to choose, 1 additional week of self-monitored quarantine before going to campus at your own expense, a visa/resident permit/health check to get the resident permit). 

The positive points: You pay less than the majority of nyu nyc students for a degree that both say NYU. You will definitely remember your college life. Shanghai is very foreign-friendly and an easy stepping stone into China's culture. It's pretty cheap overall and most clubs will give you free alcohol (although the quality is debatable). You definitely meet more people from other countries than in NY, and you won't get pigeonholed into an American friend group as easily. The business professionals in China (Chinese and foreigners) are really interested in the school and students. A director at Shanghai Disney partnered with a professor to start a capstone program and has been trying to filter students in the company.",1606238247,1,0

While the computer programming part isn’t difficult and you are in no way expected to know how to do it going into the class (there’s a solid amount of class designated to familiarizing students with the interface), it is still a very different class than what I expect you experienced in high school: not harder, but different.

For example, Stern career fairs are “only made known” to stern kids, and these fairs are usually where most of the really good companies go to. Having a Stern friend that is kind enough to share their networking opportunities with you is VERY vital in my option. Ideally NYU kinda makes all this career searching business equal but I doubt they would do that. Furthermore, I’ve interned at a big bank and as a peasant from CAS, there is certainly a lot of bias towards Stern kids during the interview process. The easiest way to see this is if you go an apply for a job and they have when you click on the drop down to list your university they have “NYU” and “NYU Stern”. :(

"Liberal studies, if anything, will heavily help a religious studies or anthropology major. The required core classes are based on writing, philosophy (from various religions, at least in my experience), global cultures and histories. You also don't have to worry about transitioning to CAS, as it's pretty much a given, and your advisor will make that transition easy.

Community at NYU is what you make of it. I had no issue at all, but then again, I didn't have to worry about making friends during a pandemic. I met most of my friends through my dorms, classes and welcome week, and I heard clubs are very helpful for some people as well. My guess is next fall will be relatively normal, so as long as you make an effort, I don't think you will have any issues. Just know that the first semester of freshman year, everyone wants to be friends with everyone, so I recommend you take advantage of that.

"A lot depends on the program. Some are pre-professional, which have more of a career focus. Liberal arts programs, however, are not as job oriented as their focus is more on giving students a broad education so that they have time to try  a lot of different things before deciding what they want to do career-wise. But no matter what program you are in, there are amazing career resources at NYU.  As you noted, it will be up to you take advantage of them. 

In terms of comparing Baruch and Fordham, nobody on here can really tell you that. It all just depends on the job and whoever is hiring for a particular position. That said, NYU has an incredible reputation and will definitely carry weight on your resume.

Handshake is good, OCR is mostly limited to real estate and financial analyst jobs, and the career fair is mediocre.

I would recommend applying to the jobs on Handshake first before going for public listings. Signing up for Piazza careers is good too, same deal, you get a bit of a leg up because the companies using these services actively want NYU students.

Wasserman coaches are helpful if you don't have much experience with job searching and need some basic advice, but most of them aren't knowledgeable about the tech industry specifically. Once you need more specific advice, you're better off asking professors or peers/alumni you may know who have relevant experience.

"Hmm I think after reading replies I seem to have misworded my thoughts. By rigor, I don't mean that the classes are easy. They're not. I don't have a perfect 4.0 by any means.

Those words never appeared when I took DS. I get that those are more algorithms worthy, but a brief introduction to them would've been nice. Our algorithms class doesn't cover minimum spanning trees, nor does it cover hashing algorithms which I feel are somewhat fundamental. 

But I totally agree what if you seek out workload, it'll be there. We have great professors who challenge students to learn more which is awesome. I also agree that people from NYU can get into top companies, linkedin is good proof of that. After all, much of what is needed to succeed as a software engineer can't be taught in university.

"Agreed with your conclusion that NYU CS is nothing too special and isn't worth EDing. But I have a few disagreements to make ~~in the interest of justifying what I paid.~~

&gt;The workload at NYU CAS for CS is a joke compared to any T10 school. Forget T10, our workloads and rigor would likely be a joke to T100 schools as well.

I think you're underrating NYU CS a little bit here. Sure, it is possible to coast through (esp. if you cheat—I personally haven't noticed much cheating but that depends much on who you know) but that's also the case at other T100 schools too. I've spoken to friends at state schools and other T100 programs and NYU seemed as good or better in pretty much every case. 

Ultimately, I think NYU CS provides enough rigor and ""worth"" if you seek it out. There are lots of interesting and difficult electives available (graphics, prog lang, AIT, etc) that make for great interview content and will also bump your workload significantly. 

&gt; Most companies that come to our career fair are looking for juniors or seniors, and when I went as a freshman, most of them told me to apply when I was a junior.

I'm not really sure how much this really means. The career fair is explicitly geared towards juniors and seniors, and not many companies even offer freshman internships. Given that the fairs are already established as lacking (which I've complained about before), I wouldn't read into this too much. You can always apply to freshman programs online, but yeah it does suck that recruiter involvement for those is lacking.

In the end, I don't think the program's negatives are going to hold anybody back. Anecdotally, I know plenty of smart friends and classmates who got into top companies and enjoyed their time at NYU. Nobody is pretending it's T10 but that doesn't mean it can't be a good option for people who want to study in NYC and get a good deal.

I took MCB on track like the person above^. I have a friend who was in my MCB class but ending up dropping toward the middle of the semester. They retook it the following semester (off-track) with Osmundson and said it was much easier for them. It could be that they preferred his teaching style or something else entirely. But like the person above said it’s certainly a step up from POB so understanding the concepts is key^,1609359040,1,0

There’s a drop down menu and it says SAT or 3 AP exams... so I wasn’t sure if I could even send less than 3 exam scores. I recorded it on my Common App but ya idk it should just select nothing and let them see my AP scores on the common app,1609357204,1,0
"“Tandon's incoming classes typically consist of about 700 students, with a total academic population of over 5,000. For Fall 2019, the average SAT scores for incoming freshmen was 1448.”


I suspect CAS will be higher. You should search cs tandon vs cas in the sub search bar and there are a list of posts from current students that compare the curriculums. They are pretty different in terms of rigor, so make your judgement off that. Not as a CS person, not knowledgeable about the details at all",1609356764,1,0
"it's a really good program! There's a lot of freedom in what you can take, and a lot of different paths depending on what side of environmental studies you're interested in (policy, research, etc.). Haven't ever had a bad teacher in environmental studies either. Only advice I'd have is to make sure you vary the electives you take because some of them overlap and can start to feel a bit repetitive if you take a bunch in a similar field. Also, no matter what side of environmental studies you're interested in, I'd recommend taking Environment and Philosophy because that course is amazing.

"You're right on, I started first semester of sophomore year with intro to programing and had to do a summer to graduate in time (although, technically it would've been possible to graduate without it had I taken stats, but I didn't want to kill myself.) I think second semester sophomore year is about as late as you can start as long as you're willing to test out of CS100 or take a summer/JTerm.",1609354492,1,0
"Would they have to test out of CS100 and 101 then? Data Structures, CSO, and OS need to be taken sequentially no matter what and you need the latter two for most of the CS400 electives (although you could replace two with Cal and Stats if you're up for having like three recitations per semester). That is an absolutely brutal schedule and requires you already knowing enough Java to test out of CS101. It's possible I guess, but incredibly far from what I'd call ""easy"". I started in sophomore year and had to load up an Data Structures, Linear and Discrete, with Algo and CSO the next semester.",1609354347,1,0
I am applying RD to NYU CAS. I have double legacy for STERN and a pretty strong overall application... but I only have 2 AP exams to submit so far and they only give the option to send 3 exam scores. I have a 1390 on my SAT so it is weak in comparison to my GPA... should I select no standardized testing or send my 1390? I’m not sure whether it’ll weigh down my application,1609354250,1,0
"I agree it’s a bit of an exaggeration but I definitely have met people who started taking intro to programming like first term sophomore year and wanted to be CS majors.

"I agree, it's really difficult but I wouldn't call it impossible. I know two people who switched into CS their junior year and they really suffered.

AFAIK if you wanna do cs go to tandon. keep in mind that tandon is it's own microcosm and *much* harder than the cas cs.,1609353080,1,0

In short, I wouldn't go to NYU. You'll pay more for a less than amazing education. Yes, NYU is more of a name, but UMass is a very respectable place for CS.

"Took MCB 1 and 2, but not with Osmundson as he teaches in the Spring I believe for off-track. MCB 1 is relatively more difficult than POB because the exams are all short-response with multiple-choice questions given sparingly, thus, understanding concepts and explicit details in lectures are a must. It is possible to get an A, but you would need to put in a lot of work, as just memorizing facts/info won't work as it did for POB.",1609342918,1,0
