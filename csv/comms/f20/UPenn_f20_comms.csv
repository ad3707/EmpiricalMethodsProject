"CIS 240 is another intro CIS class you could take. It's about the more low-level side of CIS if that's something you're interested in. Despite the course number you can totally take it as a freshman, you don't need to know anything more than 120 at most. It would be a lot of work taking it at the same time as 160, depending on what other classes you're taking, but if you feel ""behind"" then this is a class that you'll need to take at some point anyway.",1605206783,2,0

"Note: this is all from pre-covid testimony/experience

Dailey - great lecturer (he's super energetic and makes the material come to life); much nicer than he appears (he wants people to succeed and is sad when talented students go into medicine/consulting/etc instead of orgo); synthesis/reactions/theory is easy, but mechanisms are hard as hell (but curve is very fair!)

Percec - don't know much other than that his exams looked straightforward 

Smith - haven't heard many good things about him (doesn't respond to emails, not helpful, etc.); exams aren't too hard",1605204928,3,0
"CIS senior here, you are definitely not behind if you wait to take 121 until sophomore year. Some good easy CIS electives to take would be CIS 350 and NETS 150. Both give good introductions to a pretty wide variety of different aspects of CIS, have interesting projects and are still relatively easy.",1605204090,1,0
"EAS 545 - Engineering Entrepreneurship was by far the best class I've taken at Penn. Make sure to take it with Prof. Cassel.

"As someone who was a double major between college and SEAS, yeah there's a ""limit"" on the number of courses that can count towards your college degree, but there isn't anything that prevents you from taking the courses to fulfill your second major/minor outside of the college. The only thing is that those extra courses won't count towards your college degree past a certain point (which is understandable)...Also if you have a particularly good relationship with your advisor, they usually sign off on a couple of courses beyond the limit counting towards your free electives.",1605189459,1,0

"It's so annoying because with all of the sector/foundational courses and major courses that we have to take, we should be allowed to take more non-college courses as free electives. If a college student wants to explore Wharton or other out of the college minors they basically have no freedom to do so because most minors require the max number of outside the college credits. 

The most annoying part is that advising in the college is basically useless and somehow no one can answer basic questions. I was told by one advisor that consumer psych classes in Wharton wouldn't count towards the outside the college limit and only until later realized that it was wrong and had that confirmed by another advisor. 

Sorry for the rant. Just feeling really frustrated!",1605164322,1,0

"In terms of the actual calculus you need to know/use, it's much easier than 114. In terms of overall course difficulty, it isn't too bad as long as you stay on top of the homeworks.

Since we're online this semester there's also no midterms and the final is take-home.

"I took LGIC 010/PHIL 005 back in 2016 but if I know Prof. Weinstein (and I do, I took 6 courses with him), the course probably hasn't changed that much. If you're coming into the class without a math or logic background, prepare for to jump right into the deep end. I took the course after taking CIS 160 the previous semester and still found the class pretty difficult.

Although the material is difficult, the grading is very lenient and Prof. Weinstein will slow down and re-explain concepts if you ask. The problem sets for the class are pretty difficult so it's helpful to work in groups and go to office hours early. The notation used in the course is awful and took a long time to really understand/learn. The course has a new textbook (made specifically for this course) since I took the class and I think that will help organize the material and help the students learn the notation. I'll also say that the TAs are usually pretty great and the recitations are really helpful for doing the problem sets.

"I only took Craft of Prose so can't compare but I think overall the work is consistent across the board. Main difference is the out of class meetings with the professor and a writing tutor. It just takes up time. And in my case was a bit of a waste.

My level of writing/confidence qualified me for the class but I think I would've been fine with the other writing sems.",1605144652,2,0
"Exactly this.

@OP You _have_ to meet with a tutor at the writing center every week (took it Freshman year can't remember the deets and if anything changed).

And when I missed a session I got a bunch of emails that felt like getting Ron's Howler from Chamber of Secrets. Just warnings about missing the session even though I already communicated with the tutor that I needed to reschedule.

It could be that the content of the class is easier? But in my case we went through a lot of literature in psychology, so my literature review eneded being a bit of work. I was taking PSYC001 concurrently and some of the material was simply beyond me. But I'm dumb so my opinion is questionable.

And I can't remember who I took it with but the professor was fantastic. But unless you actually ""qualify"" for Craft of Prose (you're not a native speaker, you're writing is great etc.) then I wouldn't recommend it. Especially if you're schedule is packed. The weekly tutor meetings eat up valuable time (I think it was like half an hour to an hour?).",1605144509,1,0
"If you're interested in learning some programming PSCI 107 Intro to Data Science has been a fantastic class so far. Works really really really well in the online format and naturally touches on politics through data.

"from my experience as a student in the College (School of Arts &amp; Sciences), Wharton students come in a large variety-- ""socialness"" really is spread as a normal distribution but the only thing is the distribution curve is definitely shifted to the right relative to say the Physics and other STEM programs, which is expected from a business program....

"Oh yeah it's a lot easier because MCIT requires only like 1-2 math classes and no natural science classes so it's a lot less engineering focused and more focused on Computer Science.  You're allowed to double count as well so Wharton BS + MCIT is only 44 credits which is 5.5 cu per term which is standard here (it's also easier if you come in with a couple AP credits as well). This option is even less coursework than M&amp;T. If you want to do the full MSE in CIS, you need to take 6 CIS prereqs and then the 10 MSE classes but if you're smart with double counting and depending on your Wharton concentration it could be 44-47 classes which is still more manageable than a dual degree.",1603046882,1,0

"Any way to hold the administration accountable? No, but I’m not sure you’d even want to, it probably would make you just feel worse, not better.

Good of you to be so aware and expose your disappointment for what it is, though; as my own therapist has said, life is full of disappointments, you have to expect em. 

At the end of the day, you can only really hold yourself accountable for your own emotions. You can compare Penn’s response to other schools, but you can’t control that. You can control small things like making sure you’re still eating right, getting enough sleep, drinking enough water, maybe talking to some friends, etc. 
maybe your education has let you down but you still chose it; and you can choose how to transmute your disappointment, and express it in a way that isn’t so out of your control as holding Penn accountable for it, because that’s just gonna disappoint you even more. Maybe find a local therapist in your area or smoke some weed or something. CAPS definitely still has resources but I found it pretty shit, outside of referrals to outside help. Also helps not to put all your eggs in one basket; having friends, people, hobbies, things, outside your college experience defining your life, helps too. This can mean extended family, high school friends, so on. I would often work in downtown Philly, and read a lot of books completely unrelated to anything, so that helped me. 

As kids, we’re disappointed our parents can’t do everything for us, and aren’t what we built them up to be. As young adults, it’s the same thing with roles, institutions, schools, partners. Disappointments a fact of life, embrace that shit because you’re gonna have to get past it if you want to accept someone or something for what it actually is, and not what you want or need of it to be.",1603006130,1,0

I'd 100% recommend doing at least one if not more classes P/F. I did it in the spring and it did wonders for my mental health. And there's nothing wrong with doing a class P/F - you shouldn't feel guilty or anything about it. Lemme repeat that. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH DOING A CLASS PASS/FAIL. If you need it, you need it. Put yourself first. Also try scheduling your days if you haven't already. It's a bitch to do at first, but adding structure into your life during such an unstructured time can work wonders.

"Took an advanced econ class with him last semester. He definitely likes challenging his students and amped up the difficulty compared to his 104 class (like he said he would in the beginning of the semester, so at least there were no surprises). Not the greatest teacher but not horrible; he just definitely gives really hard exams and homeworks. The averages on the exams would be like 30%. That being said, he gave a standard curve on those (so that average would curve to like a B).",1606147425,5,0
Econ 104 with him last spring was based far more on regression’s mathematical basis and proofs than actually using regression. It wasn’t too hard and became easier when it moved online. He could be fun in class and told funny anecdotes and would have entertaining exchanges with students.,1606146888,4,0
"Decided to stay home and it was pretty good overall. To me, I wouldn't take the semester off because odds are I'd be bored out of my mind, and would possibly lose all motivation do to work. Plus, my scholarship only covers four years at Penn so I really had no option. But, if I'm being honest being at home has its downfalls too with annoying family, freedom, a lack of privacy, etc. But it does have its perks and I definitely feel more relaxed? and that I have more time to just breathe and watch a show on top of a heavy course load.

There are 10K or so undergrads and currently there are only 300 undergrads on campus. I'm not sure how much they plan to reopen because I still think it's based on who is applying and needs housing.

"Sociology portion on the MCAT is laughably insignificant. Unless you really want to take this course, using it as an ostensible knowledge prereq for the MCAT wouldn't help you much on the exam. 

For sociology and psychology whatever is in the kaplan prep books is essentially self-contained for the real exam. 

Remember: the MCAT tests one's understanding of core concepts; it doesn't test how much one knows. 


Also, a little tip for MCAT studying:

Glance over the questions at the end of chapter first and then read the relevant sections. Stuff will stick better because you know what you're looking for (and what the author, who made the questions, believed was important for you to truly understand for the actual exam). Then attempt the 'Discrete Exam Questions' for each chapter after finishing the whole book on that subject. Although, do the concept check questions for each module as you go.

"Hiya! Penn grad student/TA here. Ive seen a lot of this happening with my students both past and present as well as my boyfriend (who doesn’t go to Penn). I also had the same issue at the finish of last semester with my own classes. 

We are going through an unprecedented time in history. You did not sign up to get a virtual education. But you’re sticking with it and staying strong (that’s an accomplishment in itself!!). Try to minimize stuff outside of coursework your first and maybe even second semester, especially now. No doubt, things seem to take a lot longer with online education, even for me. I found that a lot of it came from the fact that I could pause my lectures and take super descriptive notes, etc. I’ve been watching my boyfriend work on his class stuff since 11 AM and he’s still got hours more to go. 

I highly recommend setting a schedule for yourself. Try and emulate what you would regularly do. Even better, try and compartmentalize your space so you do school work in one area, eat in another, socialize online in another. Set limits on how long you will work continuously and take regular breaks. Set a school curfew for yourself. You’ll feel a lot more in control if you strictly schedule school versus relaxation time. And really, if you have the space, try and set up a “school area”. 

First year is a really hard time &amp; I can online imagine how challenging it must be without the true social aspect. But you and the others in this thread should applaud yourself for any of the work you’re getting done, especially given the PANDEMIC (!!!) were working through. 

Hang in there &amp; reach out if you’re struggling. If you have professors who are being less than accommodating REPORT them. This includes overly aggressive surveillance techniques in Zoom to mitigate “cheating”.",1600905893,1,0

"Hi!

Do not worry at all! Zoom fatigue is a real thing. It's really hard to keep your energy up when you spend the majority of your day staring at a screen. And freshman year is hard even when we aren't all living through a pandemic. Keep your head up.

Also, if clubs are stressing you out, don't be obligated to participate! I always say that clubs should be a source of relaxation/study breaks rather than an added source of stress. Some of the joys of freshman year are applying to all clubs and then slowly weeding out the clubs until only the ones you like are left. It's okay to quit things in college!

And finally, to echo what other people have said already, mental health comes first! College is so much more than a number on an assignment. There are plenty of opportunities to make up one bad quiz grade. And in the grand scheme of things, as long as you are learning something from the experience, a failed quiz isn't a complete loss! Take time to recharge yourself. Watch your favorite tv shows, go for a walk, eat some fruit. And most importantly, take each day as it comes by.",1600885941,1,0

"Hey friend! Regardless of background or situation, freshmen year is hard for everyone! Don't for a second believe that your peers are holding it together. Literally everyone is a mess those first few months.

Some things to keep in mind:

1. Focus on you. Just you. If you did better today than you did yesterday, you're moving in the right direction. Never think of your achievements in comparison with those of others. 
2. Reach out for help! Pride is hard to swallow, and if you're at Penn now it probably means that you excelled in academics while in high school, so falling behind now is making you question yourself and you probably feel anxious, but instead of turning all that inwards and shutting down, realize that the Penn is literally flooded with people who want to see you succeed. Your professors, TAs, friends, counselors, no one wants to see you fail, so ask for help! Professors and TAs, that's like literally their job, to teach you. Don't be afraid to email them. Your friends are probably struggling with the same materials too, so try study groups! There are also so many resources like the Weingarten center that will help you figure out time-management, or just getting a tutor in general (ask around for how that works, I'm sure covid changed it up). 
3. Clubs and organizations will always be there. Freshman year is hard enough on its own sometimes, so maybe choose one or two things you're interested in, but take this year to really just focus on settling in. Then maybe next semester, or next year, when you're less overwhelmed, you could reach out to more clubs!

Lastly I'll just say, no assignment, no test, no quiz, is as important as your well being. Take moments, many moments, to just breathe and maybe do something that you enjoy. Binge TV on a Wednesday, go biking, play Among Us, read a book for fun. At the end of the day, you are doing this for you, so be kind to yourself.",1600872737,1,0
"I think the thing to bear in mind is that literally.everyone.ever. who finds themselves at a competitive school gets themselves into the same bind of feeling like they're falling behind. It's not you, it's just hard. It's OK to be imperfect and punt a few things.

Hang in there, do your best, and by your junior year, you will be cruising, I promise.",1600871351,1,0

I’d also recommend maybe taking a look at the Weingarten Learning Center because they have good resources for tips about online learning.

Personally I decided not to apply to any clubs because I already struggle with motivation learning from home, so I felt like clubs were just going to be too much for me.

For example, I have to read a lot of Shakespeare for my classes right now, so I'll ask people to read the plays with me, which ends up being really fun because we act out the parts together. 

Another thing that might help is to look into therapy. Your lack of interest or motivation could be due to depression, or another mental health issue. Even if you don't fit the clinical diagnosis for something, you could probably still benefit from therapy. I took this approach myself, and getting an ADHD diagnosis and then going on medication has made a significantly positive impact on my ability to function and enjoy my classes this semester.",1600832745,1,0

Imagine eating commons everyday, being stuck in your dorm room 24/7, some but still minimal social interaction, and taking online classes. IMO this is just as bad as the current situation of being at home and taking online classes this semester. Only reason why it'd even be worth it would be if you're a senior but really only if you're off campus.",1604155677,1,0

I also think taking breaks helps a lot. I know for a lot of classes watching the videos are essential and trust me it takes me forever to get through them, but for a few of my classes (mainly humanities) I rarely watch the videos and just stick to the ppt and the readings. You can definitely find balance. I stayed home this semester and had different things adding onto my stress but also some things were taken away (walking to class, making meals, etc) It's just a bunch of trial and error at this point, but this semester is sort of crappy.",1604154316,1,0

The only reason to come to school is to get away from your parents and sit in your dorm. Trust me, there will be A LOT of sitting in your dorm alone (basically all day and all night).

"Declaration of Independence 
The unanimous Declaration of the twelve schools of the University of Pennsylvania, When in the Course of student events, it becomes necessary for one student body to dissolve the administrative bands which have connected them with their administration, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Education and of Education’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of student-kind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all students are created equal, that they are endowed by their university with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Mental Health, Right-To-Know-WTF-Is-Going-On, and the pursuit of Learning With a Sensible P/F Deadline.--That to secure these rights, school administrations are instituted among students, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any school administration becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the Student Body to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Administration, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Learning and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that school administrations long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that student-kind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute disregard for the well-being of their students, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such administration, and to provide new Teachers for their future learning.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these United Undergraduate and Graduate Schools; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Administrations. The history of the present President of the University of Pennsylvania is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Disregard for Student Well-Being over these Schools. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

-Giving people like 2 days to leave campus in the Spring

-Optional P/F instead of another system

-Making the P/F deadline mad early

-Refusing to lower tuition

-Making Fall hybrid

-Changing their minds about fall like 3 weeks before class started

-General screwing people over with financial aid

-Class on Jewish holidays

-No fall break

-Basically no spring break

-Class on election day

-Making the P/F deadline mad early (again!)

-Mostly remote class in the Spring

-Forcing freshmen to come to campus

-tWo SuItCaSeS aNd A cArRy On

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A President whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Capitalist Pig, is unfit to be the ruler of a student body.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Administrative brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their Board of Directors to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our psychological and educational well-being here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of student-kind, Enemies in Pandemic, in Normal Circumstances Students.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the United Undergraduate and Graduate Schools of Penn, in Reddit Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good Students of these Schools, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Schools are, and of Right ought to be a Free and Independent University; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the Penn Administration, and that all political connection between them and the President Amy Gutmann, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent Schools, they have full Power to make Grades, provide Reasonable Tuition Cuts, pick Deadlines, establish Funding, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent Schools may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",1604126997,1,0

"I'm confused by the downvotes. My graduate program at Penn was far worse than my undergraduate experience. Lower quality instruction and classes, fewer resources and supports, but the same extremely high sticker price (with fewer options for financial aid). 

No two graduate programs are going to be the same though, even if they are in the same school. So your mileage will vary, as will the worth of having a Penn degree even if the quality of the actual program is low (not ratings wise, but pedagogy).

I'm doing my PhD right now in another school, but can't really compare the experiences as I'm in a different stage of life. 

I would say that if money isn't a barrier and you want to stay in Philly, go ahead at try to continue at Penn.

We didn’t have a chance to improve if we did something wrong on the midterm because they literally told us nothing. Just really sad about it all.

I’ve heard Dailey Orgo 2 is similar format to his Orgo 1.  For the exam/grading format Dailey generally has tough exams where the averages are 60-70 but can be low as ~40-50. The class is curved and about a little more than a consistent SD above the average is an A. Percec exams are a lot more straight forward from the textbook and slides and his averages are around 80. He doesn’t really curve so generally you need to aim 90+ on his exams for an A.

"I'm originally from northern NJ, and my brother has lived in Brooklyn for the last 10 years (9 in Park Slope, and 1 right by Atlantic Terminal / Barclays Center), so I have solid knowledge of this.

At your salary, you'd be looking at neighborhoods in Brooklyn that are much more like the Society Hill, Rittenhouse, and Fitler Square than West Philly equivalents (nice, but not nearly as wealthy).  So that would be Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights.  It's filled with beautiful brownstones, but it's more residential than the bustling Manhattan.  But, it's NYC, there are cool parts pretty much everywhere there is plenty of subway coverage, which certainly is the northern half of Brooklyn.

Given your probable age (mid-20s?), expected salary, and debt, I would give Manhattan a shot for 1-2 years and then reassess.  Philly is so condensed that it doesn't really matter here, but I really loved going out and doing fun things in my mid-grad school years, but once I hit 30 I definitely toned it down.  Given your probable age, you're still in peak ""do super fun things!"" mode, and focusing on my social and personal life has been great for me, even if it took me 1 extra year above average to finish my PhD.  It really does help keep you of solid mind.

My brother has been working as a front-end developer for 10 years (with a bachelor's degree) and is $260,000 all-in ($165K base, $95K vested stocks), so you're already at his base salary.  So you're ahead of the game and can afford a little higher rent in Manhattan for 1-2 years to try it out.  It's 45 minutes to get to midtown on weekends from Park Slope, so it's not crazy long but may dissuade you from attending events once this pandemic is over.  And remember, that's your daily commute each way once we're back in offices.

Depending where you live in Manhattan, you're equidistant to Brooklyn and Queens.  I've never been to Astoria ever, since it would take 90 minutes to get there from my brother's former Park Slope apartment, so living in Manhattan to start will give you flexibility to check out other boroughs and decide if one suits you better in a few years.

Lastly, if you can avoid roommates, I would do so.  I'm 34 (today actually, happy birthday to me!) and have been without roommates over the last year, and it's been amazing.  It's tolerable, even rewarding in mid-20s, but it gets old quickly.  You can definitely afford to be without roommate(s), so I would focus on getting your own place.

**TL;DR** - Brooklyn is a lot more fun than you think, but at your salary you still can afford your own apartment in Manhattan to be in the center of the action, and then reassess in 1-2 years.",1607275332,1,0

You should take the course (the course assumes only prior BC knowledge), but the course has, in my opinion, increased in difficulty compared to past semesters.

"I took Math 114 last spring (as a Sophomore). It had been a year since I took Math 104 and I had never learned about vectors/dot products, etc. and a lot of the content that people already seemed familiar with at the beginning of the class. Unless they decided to change the material from last year (like they did in Math 104), I’d say it’s very doable to get an A in this course if you’re willing to put in a decent amount of work. Do consistent practice, make a good formula sheet, and study hard for the first exam (because the first unit is probably the easiest).

"If you’re looking for a professor who cares about his students, steer clear from Smith. I took Orgo 2 with him last Spring and can say with confidence that he was one of the worst professors I have ever had at Penn. Every email I sent to him with questions throughout the semester was forwarded to a TA instead of being answered by him directly. He decided to go on a fishing trip during our first exam, so he wasn’t available for any review, questions, etc. His lectures consisted of breezing through pre-made lecture slides from the textbook (made by other professors) and he often cut lectures off 20-30 mins early (kind of a ridiculous thing to do for a class with so much content).

Also, I get that Penn students are among the best in the world, but they aren't all math people. They weren't all accepted for their extraordinary math skills and love for the subject. Some people aren't just built for that. Since math104 is one of the most common courses for the math-related requirement and it is an introductory course, many people who take it aren't these types of math-driven people.

"Respectfully, I completely disagree. Penns application process is vigorous and for the most part only allows entry to most talented and hard working kids in the country and world. There’s nothing niche about Taylor series or even big O. They’re concepts necessary for understanding more complex math, which is the point of an intro class. If kids are just taking it to check off a box for med school or their major or gen ed, then I’m sorry but that’s their problem. They should expect to not do well if they don’t take it seriously as a class in and of itself.",1602049557,0,0
"Here’s the thing. This is an intro level course. At any point in time, a non negligible portion of the class doesn’t understand the material. On top of that, assigning niche material makes it harder for these kids to catch up, look for external stuff like Khan Academy to help, etc. in fact, the approach adopted by ghrist could cause students to learn even less compared to their peers at other universities (as some student may not even have the prerequisite comfort with math to absorb the material in a meaningful way). 

Having a good textbook that is established with practice problems of various levels of difficulty helps solve the issue and give people an opportunity to catch up if they fall behind.

"Not in math 104 but I’ve seen some of the videos and Ghirst’s content in general. First off, I respect the quality of the videos, his energy, and the 3D animations.

However, this idea from some of the professors about “virtual video textbook” is a bit ridiculous. Seems more like some professors think they’re too good for the existing plethora of teaching resources that they must make their own. Granted, someone has to think they’re too good or there’s a current gap in the market in order for new textbooks to be produced. But if your only audience is the students, who you’re forcing to watch the videos, then maybe you really aren’t as good as you think you are. It’s where the distinction between virtual lecture and virtual video textbook come into play. Yes you’re the only person to lecture us but please give us another option.

For upperclassmen I guess there's a lot more to gain since people probably already have friends here. Also it's cold as fuck and it gets dark and gloomy second semester. It's probably going to be even more depressing as you're going to actually be stuck inside all day.

2. I recently started using Google Calendar, great for planning out events surrounding classes or such.

"Reflecting on the past helps us inform the future, but dwelling on the past is a waste of our time. You always have the power to change your trajectory right now in this moment. No level of ruminating over the past will help you achieve freedom from those things that haunt you. The best way to achieve freedom is to focus on your now and realize how much power you have in improving yourself every single day.

We are so young and still learning so much about the world and people really. I use to ruminate on the past expectations that myself and others imposed on my time on earth. I’d feel anxious and stressed about not living up to where I thought I’d be right now. But then I just realize how fluid this world truly is. I look at the news and see how many people rise to the top from nowhere. Look at Bernie Sanders for example. The mother fucker ran for president in his 80s.

Anyone who suggests that life is a linear timeline of checking boxes to advance in happiness is wrong. When I stress about the shit in my life I sit down and remind myself of the people, places, and things that make me most happy and aren’t connected to my career, education, future. Why? Because these are the things that will continue to make me happy if my life completely falls apart. Reminding myself that no matter what happens I’ll always have X, Y, or Z calms me down. It helps me to remove the materialistic annoyances that plauge us.

There are people who survived the holocaust and were able to find light and happiness after experiencing the pure evils of humanity. I believe the answer is to radically accept the trauma that effects ourselves. Acknowledge that it changed your life, brought on significant harm, but ultimately accept that there is no way to change the fact that it happened. Only after truly radically accepting these facts can a person rid themselves of the daily darkness which clouds happiness in the present moment.

 It is so much easier said than done. Especially given the structure of life. I said earlier that life is not at all a timeline with designated checkpoints, which is slightly antithetical to my solution of finding radical acceptance to move forward in life. Though in my view they are still compatible beacuse I believe radical acceptance is ever-evolving. Some days you may find less acceptance of your pain and past than others. Thats ok. It is part of how our brains and souls work. Long story short, in my time I have found this mindset has given me more freedom of the dark sides of my mind.",1601991504,1,0

But just my 2 cents: as you already know, online degrees do not come with F-1 visa and the subsequent OPT, and this lack of OPT will not just ""have a lot of doors to the US tech industry closed"" - it will effectively close *all* the doors.

If you are going to do another master's in CS after MCIT (MCIT, online or not, is basically a compact version of BS in CS so getting a MSE after MCIT actually makes sense) or even aim for PhD programs, I guess the online version is a viable option.
