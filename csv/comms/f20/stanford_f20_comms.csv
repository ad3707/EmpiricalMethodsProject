As other posters have mentioned, though, it is important to be intentional about finding a lab -- not just one that does interesting work or publishes well, but one that has a track record of mentoring undergrads. You may be able to do computational or clinical research virtually. Be forewarned that research takes a lot of time, and often gets put on the back burner when you have a problem set to do or a test to study for. Thus, you'll make the bulk of your progress over summers. I personally struggled to balance coursework, activities, and research all through college.

"I would wait. Your high school teacher is well-intentioned but has no idea what he/she is talking about. It may be a good idea to find a summer research experience (whether through summer research college or at your local med school) but doing this before summer would be disadvantageous. And even summer research isn't strictly necessary at this point. Right now you need to work on getting adjusted to the college workload and figuring out how much time you need to commit to your classes to earn good grades. Research can be really time-consuming and will interfere with that process. Once you figure that out it will be much easier to balance your academic and research commitments.

"Former Stanford bioscience PhD student here. My other grad student friends and I have mentored a variety of undergrads. Your experience will vary GREATLY depending on the lab you join, so it‚Äôs worth taking the time to find the right fit. I recommend NOT taking the very first lab that will have you as a fall frosh. You‚Äôd likely be doing very boring grunt work that won‚Äôt help you very much for getting into MD/PhD programs.

Tbh, I‚Äôm not sure how all the undergrads made their way into our labs... I‚Äôm sure there are programs, and you can always informally volunteer, but ideally you‚Äôd be getting paid or some kind of credit at a minimum. 

Think about what scientific topics interest you and also what type of actual work you want to do. What type of work do you want to learn? Wet lab work? Imaging? Physiology? Cell culture? Mouse/rat behavior? Human subjects? Computational work? Clinical work? There is SO MUCH research going on at the med school, you can and should narrow your search to what you‚Äôre interested in.

That said, sometimes a scientific topic is interesting, but you find you don‚Äôt like doing the day in day out work (which takes literally years and year for one interesting finding that you‚Äôll read about in less than 2 minutes). Sometimes you prefer the day in day out work of a topic that is not your favorite. PICK THIS ONE!!! You can always read about your favorite topic. Pick the WORK you prefer, since that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll actually do. 

Practical advice: Since you want to do MD/PhD, go find the list of current MD/PhD students at Stanford, and see what labs they are in. See if any current undergrads work in those labs and if you can talk with them about their experiences. I find these labs to be generally (strong emphasis on GENERALLY) well run and efficient at doing science, publishing papers, getting projects done, etc. Plus there will be current MD/PhDs to advise you towards your own goal. 

Final note: yes, the PhD students are often very stressed. PLEASE don‚Äôt make their lives harder. DO take detailed notes when they are teaching you something. DO follow protocols EXACTLY. Undergrads often get ‚Äúdumped‚Äù on grad students who had no interest in mentoring, so also, my apologies if you get a crummy mentor. A lot of the time, it wasn‚Äôt their idea.",1600898703,2,0

"an extremely common way to go about this is to do an REU - every single department in the School of Engineering has one (including bioengineering).

"I hate flipped classrooms with a passion. I would probably not take a class at this point if it's a flipped classroom. All the flipped classrooms do is force you to learn the material on your own and then you get to see the material again in a watered-down confusing fashion in lecture, or worse yet, sometimes professors bring in guest lecturers to talk about distantly related topics.

"Talk the professor in your class during office hours to get some guidance. Also look up the PhD students doing research in areas you are interested in. You can browse the directory for your department, you can look at the authors on publications in your area of interest that are coming out of Stanford, etc. In fact, you may have a better chance of getting involved in research by contacting PhD students since PhD students are stressed and always looking for extra help and so are more likely to respond. A professor is very busy and probably doesn't have an immediate idea about how to involve you since they're not doing most of the research themselves, so a professor is less likely to respond.

Also, it's really silly and possibly even toxic to suggest that you need to get involved in research during freshman fall. You should try to get involved as soon as you can, but you have plenty of time to get involved. I got involved during sophomore year in my area and I had really good options for PhD programs. I'm sure you're very smart, but you're 18 and don't know much yet about your subject. Research groups focus on creating new knowledge, so most either aren't going to take you on yet (which is why I said the suggestion is toxic, since your teacher set you up to experience anxiety and distress) or if  a group takes you on, they may not be very good and are desperate for labor. Just take things as they come, look around at the groups, and jump in when you're ready. I have full confidence that once you take the intro courses, get up to speed, and find a group you are happy with, you will do incredible research and will be very happy with your graduate school options.",1600895650,1,0

"I seriously second this. The CURIS opportunity is a great way to get involved in super cool research. Otherwise, there are other research opportunities with other labs or groups that need someone with a CS background (even to automate data entry.)

I recommend talking to PhD students in a lab that you‚Äôre interested in, and then having them direct you to a professor. Often, PhD students know of a CURIS opening (especially if it‚Äôs not competitive) and can even give you an offer before you apply. They can also give you informal research opportunities during the school year. Luckily for you, the CS department has a ton of funding to get more students if needed.

"OK, since it seems like some of my comments gained some traction, here's my story in the form of a wall of text:

\------------------------------

I was the little boy who couldn't.  I was constantly in trouble.  I couldn't sit still.  I was the kid who was picked last in gym class for kickball teams.  I was the kid who nobody wanted to share a table with.  I was the kid the others bullied.  

My teacher and principal told my mother that I might have ""some form of mental retardation"" (not my words; this was the 1980s), that I was ""uneducable,"" and that I would never be able to graduate from high school in any meaningful way; let alone go to college.

One day in third grade, the teacher stepped out of the room.  The other children told me to get down on the floor and bark like a dog.  Seeking their acceptance, I did.  What followed was a beating.  The principal happened to walk by as it was going on and broke it up before I had suffered any serious injuries, but I was dragged to his office and my mother was summoned.  ""Get him out of my school!""

My mother, for all her flaws and narcissism, was not going to accept this.  To her credit, she did not ignore the issue and just beat me.  She took me to a psychologist and then a psychiatrist.  The latter diagnosed me with ADHD, which was pretty much unheard-of in the mid-1980s.  He started me on a medication called Ritalin, a strange name, I thought, for a medication that had nothing to do with riddles.  

My mother got me into a different school, now on medication, and the teachers refused to believe there was anything wrong with me and didn't think I needed medicine.  My mother got tired of this feedback and sent me to school unmedicated one day...and then they believed.

I did fine through elementary school, now that my impulsivity and hyperactivity were controlled, but once middle school hit and I had to juggle more classes and homework, my grades got worse.  My mother expected straight As.  I was not producing them.  ""Consequences"" began to ensue.  I had to do extra work, extra tutoring, extra math problems.  I hated it.  But I progressed in school.  Even as a Freshman in high school, my grades were so-so.

On the first day of 10th grade, aged 16, riding the bus to school, I had a talk with myself: ""Self,"" I said, ""you are smart enough.  You have no problems understanding the material.  You have no problem taking tests, but your problem is that *you don't turn in all your homework*.  So this year, you are keeping an assignment book and you are going to track your grades and you are going to *turn in every assignment*.""  And that's what I did.

That fall, I took the PSAT.  I bubbled in the bubble that allowed ETS to send my scores to colleges and universities.  I scored in the 99th percentile in both Verbal and Math.  I thought nothing of it because after a life of hearing nothing but negativity, my response was: ""Meh, doesn't everyone score in the 99th percentile?"" 

A couple of months later, all sorts of mail started coming for me from colleges I'd never even heard of.  I told my mother that if she got to the mail before I did to just throw them away.  

The end of the first semester came to an end and my plan, cracked on the first day of school, had worked.  I had my first straight-A report card.  A couple of weeks later, I was invited to join the National Honor Society.  And now, I realized that because I'd done it once, *I had to get straight As for the rest of high school.*  I was terrified, but now that I had found my rhythm, it got easier to maintain.

And then one day in April of that year, my mother came to me with one of those recruiting letters from colleges.  ""I know you said to throw these out, but I think you should read this one.""

It was from MIT.

""Dear MikeGinny (there was no MD yet),

""You gave yourself an edge on the college admissions process when you decided to take the PSAT early, and when you *nailed* it.  Obviously, you got my attention...""

The letter went on to basically tell me that, should I apply to MIT, I might have a fighting chance at admission.  Remember, *I was the little boy who couldn't.*  I didn't believe in myself.  I was the kid who would never go to college.

And yet, standing there in the kitchen, I saw my straight-A report card proudly stuck to the fridge next to the PSAT score and the invitation to join the National Honor Society.  And now, I was holding a recruiting letter from MIT.  It was too much contrary evidence.  

**For the first time in my life, I saw what I really was and what I could do.  I could go to MIT.**

The next year, while taking AP Biology, it all came together.  I wanted to be a doctor.  I wanted to work with other children and adolescents with ADHD.  I told my doctor, who is still a trusted friend and mentor to this day, and rather than brushing me off, he told me that I should go for it.  And so I did.  Full speed ahead.  I did the extracurriculars.  I took the tests.  I did my schoolwork.  

Well, come time to visit colleges, I had one look at MIT and decided: ""Nope!""  There was a different school next door to MIT that was interesting to me, though.  We all know which one it is.  I wound up applying to six Ivies, Northwestern, and Williams in addition to my state school, a competitive state school that I'd once thought I'd never be able to attend.  It was my safety now.

My mother told me to apply to Stanford.  ""It's too far away, mom.  I'd rather eat my spleen than go there.""  But I recycled some essays from my other applications and mailed in the application on the deadline.  And yes, because I wanted to go to medical school to work with other kids with ADHD, I did disclose on my application.  Later, I disclosed on my medical school applications and my residency applications.  ADHD is why I wanted to be a doctor, so of course I disclosed.  

One day, I got called to my counselor's office out of AP Calculus class.  My counselor dialed my father, who told me that a letter had arrived from Stanford.  ""Dad, is it a small letter or a big letter?""

""It's big.  It says 'Congratulations!' on the back.""  

I didn't get into Harvard, which had been my first choice, mostly for the prestige of being ""the little boy who couldn't"" who then went to Harvard.  I had decided to go to Yale, but my mother insisted I go to Stanford's Admit Weekend.  ""I'd rather eat my spleen than go to..."" ""Just go.""  I went.

My father was driving me down Palm Drive when I took in the sight.  I'm from Michigan, you see, so palm trees are a big deal.  They mean no snow.  ""Dad, I am starting to think I might want to go here.""  Everything that happened that weekend affirmed my decision.  I loved the other kids.  I could sit outside at Tressider at 8 PM eating pizza wearing nothing more than a windbreaker in April.  I felt for the first time like I fit in.  I realized that even if Harvard wrote me back and apologized for the error and told me that I had been accepted, I'd probably politely decline them; Stanford was the perfect fit.  On the day I left Stanford, I was heartbroken.  But I was buoyed by one thought: ""I can come back and spend *four years* here!""  

I spent five.",1599931241,3,0

2. You state if ‚Äúyou or your parent pays out of pocket with their taxed, earned income‚Äù on ‚Äútuition or qualified expenses‚Äù that is eligible for a tax credit. Stanford financial aid, even full financial aid, does not cover all qualified expenses, such as course equipment and technology. Thus even low income students ‚Äúpay out of pocket with their taxed, earned income.‚Äù
3. Thirdly, full financial aid does not necessarily imply $0 expected contribution. The opportunity fund, meant for first generation or low income students, is available for people with an expected contribution of about $4500 or less. The reason for this is that personal expenses and travel expenses are included in the financial aid letter, so people mostly consider anything that covers everything else to be ‚Äúfull financial aid.‚Äù Some of this remaining $4500 can be used for the tax credit, depending on how the financial aid office itemized the bill. (This is a less rigorous argument, but I included it mostly for the sake of increasing the understanding that even low income students on full financial aid have expenses.) 

The reason for my lengthy response is that your post seems to have the intention of baiting people into contradicting what you think is true, so that you can spread your version of reality in which we are all ignorantly committing tax fraud. While I was trying to be nice and give you hope, you responded accusing me of tax fraud. Now, as a Stanford student, moreover a low income student who is very wary about putting myself in situations where I may have to pay a sum of money I do not have (such as an IRS audit),  I am capable of correctly inputting my information into TurboTax and making sure I do not commit fraud by reading the IRS website. If you knew the answer to your own question, which it seems you think you did based on your response to me, why did you ask it?",1604107283,1,0

"I agree with /u/TinderForMidgets on the ~25% acceptance rate. I was part of CS198 for four years, and sat in on/gave feedback for a lot of interviews. In my experience, about 50% of candidates make it through the teaching interviews, and the debugging interviews also cut that group down by about another 50%. However, you should know that the final hiring decision is based on your performance in both interviews considered together.

The debugging interview is, in my opinion, much easier than the teaching interview. It can be easy to get flustered if you spend a long time trying to fix the same bug, but it's not expected that you completely fix everything.",1604095456,3,0
"The teaching interview is super tough to pass. I did pass it, but it was never clear to me what the criteria was or why I passed.

The debugging interview was significantly easier to do pass.",1604094696,3,0
"Try to look things up online before posting to Reddit. The answer to this and much more can be found in older Reddit posts or just on the Stanford Financial Aid website. 

Depends on both your parent's annual income/assets, dependent status, number of children,  your personal savings and income, and any extenuating circumstances (i.e. lots of your income goes toward medical expenses). 

[Look at this chart.](https://financialaid.stanford.edu/undergrad/how/index.html)

You can appeal your award letter if you don't believe it's reasonable. I know several upper-middle-class students that didn't get quite enough aid and they took out loans (that they are confident they can pay back after graduating). Even with full-aid, expect many additional expenses--books/software can be expensive, everything from food to gas to cigarettes is more expensive in the bay area, and many things at Stanford have a price tag (parking pass, printing, greek life dues, events,  taxes on your financial scholarship, etc.). Many students on financial aid also have a student contribution that's fulfilled through summer employment or a work-study during the year.",1604094003,3,0

"I'm pretty sure these credits you claimed were education credits. Based on what you said, you don't qualify for these credits and would have to pay this money back to the IRS or hope you don't get caught in an audit. You need the following to qualify:

1. You, or your dependent, must have paid qualified educational expenses for higher education during the tax year.
2. An eligible student must be enrolled at an eligible educational institution.
3. The eligible student must be either the tax filer, your legal spouse, or an eligible dependent that is listed on the tax return being filed.

If Stanford or the government or any outside scholarships gives you money that was used to pay for qualified expenses (tuition, but not room and board), this money is tax-free and not earned income. This money does not qualify for education credits, if you claim these credits you are ""double-dipping"" according to the IRS. If your scholarship was used to pay for non-qualified expenses (room and board, travel, etc.), these are taxed and cannot be used for education credits. 

Essentially, unless you or your parent pays out of pocket-- with their taxed, earned income-- for tuition or other qualified expenses, you cannot claim education credits. I'm not sure how loans work. This is my understanding from reading the IRS website and other tax advice websites, but please correct me if I am wrong! 

If you are on full financial aid, you don't qualify for any education credits, unfortunately.",1604090299,1,0

So even despite supposedly owing all this money, i actually got like $1200. Some of my income had already been taken out of my paycheck so I probably actually netted 0 but I didn‚Äôt need to pay anything out of pocket

"My first quarter I received the second-worst mark in chem 32 (back when that was a thing) and walked away with a B. After graduating high school with straight As it was pretty deflating to come home for winter break with straight Bs. I continued to get mostly Bs and some As (and a C+) until my senior year, when I picked up a minor I was a lot better at, and pulled straight As. Still got into a top-5 professional school.

I suspect your grade in this course will probably be better than you expect, but you won't be getting fantastic marks. When you get your grades, I'd recommend honestly evaluating why you've performed this way. Is it a study skills issue? Are you unmotivated by the subject matter? Are you not adept at this material? If I had a time machine and could do it over again, I'd change my living situation which contributed to my poor grades (hard for you to do right now), change my major, and go see an academic counselor for advice on study skills.

"As a transfer student, I definitely noticed this as I was answering the questions on TurboTax and was freaking angry about it because it was the third time I felt like Stanford didn't directly tell me something I needed to know! I ended up paying it the first year and then the second year, I tried a different software (H&amp;R Block) and it didn't calculate it the same, so I didn't end up paying it.

In my head, it's pretty gross that money the university ""gives"" us to give back to themselves is taxed, so I'm not morally opposed to shirking it atm when I don't have the money (which is why I was ""given"" the money in the first place!).",1604039728,1,0
"I'm just curious to know if students evade these taxes or are just unaware--why does financial aid not talk about this with students? 

No one talks about this and it's basically non-existent on the fin-aid website. 

Loan-free award packages are sold as ""no-strings-attached"" but $3,000, or even just a couple hundred,  is a good lump of money to pay in taxes every year for an independent and low-income student.",1604036892,1,0
"I'd assume most students, especially low-income students, work during the school year and at least during summer. Personally, between part-time work during the academic year and full-time work in the summer, I exceed the standard deduction.  I am also given health insurance and student contribution in aid as part of my award, which makes my taxable scholarship more than $28,000/year according to my 1098-T. That's easy $3,000 in taxes given I also work--which I expect almost every low-income student does. 

From my understanding of [this form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1098et.pdf), educational institutions are required to file a 1098-T for the student and directly to the IRS linked to your social. I'd imagine $10,000 in unpaid taxes or $50,000+ in unreported income after four years would be incentive to go after a student.  I'm sure many get away with this, but unpaid taxes can haunt you 3-6 years after you filed.",1604036158,1,0

"&gt; This would mean that the $16,000+ (full fin aid package) on our award letters set aside for room and board, would be added to our annual gross income and we would need to pay a couple thousand in taxes on.

More like a couple hundred, after the standard deduction. Assuming that you have no other income. 

Anyhow, the IRS doesn't go after students because 1) the amounts are way too small to bother, and 2) while the IRS does automated matching against W-2s using the AUR system, I'm not sure if they do the same against 1098-Ts. There's even IRS guidance out there that explicitly says to not use the 1098-T and to tabulate the expenses yourself instead, using the actual charges/payments for the tax year. In our case you would find this on Axess under financials.",1604030944,1,0

"I think the answer is yes, but in my experience most tax software does a shit job of surfacing this information and as a result a lot of people end up not paying it. They'll ask something like ""Do you have any additional income to report?"" and if you aren't aware that room and board scholarships are income, you'd end up not reporting it.

"me



I had an absolute horrid time last winter. I was taking CS 110 and CS 161, which are the two culminating courses in the CS core sequence. As far as CS majors go, I'm like, in the range of incompetent to below-average, so it definitely was *not* a good decision. I'm not a super emotional guy, and I kinda pride myself on being able to deal with stress; that being said, I cried every single time I worked on a CS 110 pset. CS 161 wasn't hard, but it was a large time commitment. CS 110 was horrifically difficult *and* a massive time commitment, and was also a subject I didn't like or care about. Additionally, I was taking PWR 2 that quarter, as well as 2 other 3-unit classes (20 units total). 1 of those 3-unit classes ended up being a pretty big time drain as well, which really didn't help at all. 



My grades ended up being fine, but that quarter was the first time in my life I had an adverse physical reaction to stress (vommiting and severe panic attacks). I felt like such a failure all day, every single day for 9 weeks (week 1 wasn't so bad lmao). The worst bit was that I felt like I was giving it my all - I often procrastinate, and I literally didn't (not even once) that quarter. Even with the internet at my fingertips, and the help of the TAs, and the help of the professor, and the help of my friends, my stupid brain couldn't figure out how to code the damn thing. I was just so so so so sad, *all the time*, and I couldn't figure out to stop being sad - my entire self-worth was tied up in how well I was doing at school. I was the smart kid in high school, and my freshman year was epic - I got all As in some classes that other kids thought were hard, which made me feel good (because I'm an arrogant jerk). Last winter quarter really brought me down to Earth, to put it lightly.

&gt; My chem TA had the same problem, she failed the midterm and didn't know where to go from there. She told me the thing holding her back was that she didn't try to see things multiple times. In High School, academics are a joke and you only need to see it once. In college, you actually have to understand the material so it's recommended that you try to tackle it multiple times. Give yourself several days to learn a concept. The mind is like a sieve and only so much can fit in per day so don't over do it. Play with the concept. What happens if I remove this factor? What happens if I add this factor? Question it. Why do people think this is such a big deal? Make it intuitive to the point where you can talk about in a normal conversation without coming to a roadblock. This is a very time consuming process but by the end you will feel great having mastered something. By the end of the course, you should be able to think critically about the material. You should be able to question concepts you see in the course.
As for my chem TA, she ended up doing extremely well in the chem major. She's now a Chem PhD at a top program. Your early performance doesn't matter too much, what you do later on matters much more.",1603941608,4,0

"First I want to point out that I am not downvoting you. I think discussion about this kind of stuff is always a better alternative to reddit's popularity contest. That being said, I think you're mistaken and would like to respond to both parts.

For point 1, Palumbo-Liu has made **exactly that kind of institutional critique throughout his career** -- arguing for divestment from oil in the natural science departments, for instance. This essay was a critique of the HI, but you can easily find the kind of institutional critique you are looking for.

As to aspirations, we will just always disagree with each other on this: I believe that guiding statements, missions, and goals matter. I believe that people set aspirations and try their best to achieve them. When your reality doesn't match your goals, I believe you should try to realign the way you work to get closer to meeting those goals. Aspirations, in my mind, are vital guideposts for our most important institutions to measure their own success and constantly improve.  Stanford certainly makes mistakes trying to fulfill its goals, but I believe the best response is to try to address those errors and fix them, not rewrite the mission statement. We should balk at HI trying to infiltrate classrooms, for instance, and critique any other force that limits researcher's academic freedom &amp; responsibility to objectivity. 

As to point 2 -- I understand where you are coming from now. The whole ""School of Resentment"" deal. I have to ask though: how much ""humanities research"" do you read? I won't go through my own CV except to say I am an academic in the humanities, fleeing higher ed for totally unrelated reasons -- perhaps that will help put this in context.

I do want to keep talking in good faith with you, but your representation of the humanities reads more like a mass-media culture-war thing than a reflection of how research works. When you say the ""bulk of humanities research"" concerns itself with judgement... I mean, that's just absurd. Research in the humanities is not really interested in praise or blame. Most research (e.g. in literature) is trying to look at texts in new ways and learn more about it or us -- not trying to disparage its author. Historical research is about seeing the interplay of systemic forces and individual action (and more, e.g. climate, resources) to better understand what it has meant to be a person and how we go about it -- not about judging people. Art history looks at how we make sense of the world through art and how we respond to pieces -- not judging art. Conversations about race/gender with these texts can help us better understand how the creators saw their world or how we see ours. These are all things to study and talk about. 

Discussions about deconstructing the literary canon (something you are probably alluding to) have more to do with understanding how such canons came to be created, and then what we can learn about ourselves and the books armed with our new knowledge of the social pressures to call poet X better than poet Y. Like, when I note that U.S. slave-owners really like Aristotle's argument that some people are naturally born slaves -- that's not praise or blame for Aristotle's idea. That's a part of that idea's history, and when we study *why* we read Aristotle, it's important to note *why* people have liked his arguments. On sort of the flip-side, when scholars argue for more diverse voices and canonical inclusionism, they aren't praising creators for their identity, they are responding to the fact that many creators were wrongfully kept out of classrooms / ""the canon"" because of their identity. The texts are meaningful on their own, irregardless of the author. When I say something like ""we should teach more African literature,"" the underlying assumption is *not* that African-ness makes it good, but rather than its African-ness previously excluded it from a canon that rigidly enforced certain beliefs about ""goodness.""",1603923175,3,0

"‚ÄúMany governments have instructed the population to wear simple mouth-and-nose covers or surgical face masks to protect themselves from droplet infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in public. However, the basic protection mechanisms and benefits of these masks remain controversial. Therefore, the aim of this work is to show from a fluid physics point of view under which circumstances these masks can protect against droplet infection. First of all, we show that the masks protect people in the surrounding area quite well, since the flow resistance of the face masks effectively prevents the spread of exhaled air, e.g. when breathing, speaking, singing, coughing and sneezing. Secondly, we provide visual evidence that typical household materials used by the population to make masks do not provide highly efficient protection against respirable particles and droplets with a diameter of 0.3‚Äì2 Œºm as they pass through the materials largely unfiltered. According to our tests, only vacuum cleaner bags with fine dust filters show a comparable or even better filtering effect than commercial particle filtering FFP2/N95/KN95 half masks. Thirdly, we show that even simple mouth-and-nose covers made of good filter material cannot reliably protect against droplet infection in contaminated ambient air, since most of the air flows through gaps at the edge of the masks. Only a close-fitting, particle-filtering respirator offers good self-protection against droplet infection. Nevertheless, wearing simple homemade or surgical face masks in public is highly recommended if no particle filtrating respiratory mask is available. Firstly, because they protect against habitual contact of the face with the hands and thus serve as self-protection against contact infection. Secondly, because the flow resistance of the masks ensures that the air remains close to the head when breathing, speaking, singing, coughing and sneezing, thus protecting other people if they have sufficient distance from each other. However, if the distance rules cannot be observed and the risk of inhalation-based infection becomes high because many people in the vicinity are infectious and the air exchange rate is small, improved filtration efficiency masks are needed, to take full advantage of the three fundamental protective mechanisms these masks provide.‚Äù

Yes, N95s are much better, but scientists still say that surgical masks do help slightly.",1603058216,1,0

"entered as a prospective cs major with high school java/js/html/perl experience under my belt. got to 106a, found it challenging but made an A, bombed 103a, REALLY bombed 103b, dropped out of 106b, and had to repeat math51 for a C+. eventually ended up switching to psych, found it a lot easier and genuinely more interesting, and am now in the medical/hr field. 

if you're enjoying the assignments, that's great. some people can still succeed in the cs field even after performing poorly academically. you just have to ask yourself: are you struggling because of anxiety/mental health, or are you struggling because it's a field you're not naturally suited for? how is the math/physics portion of the major going?

for me, i switched majors because my programs were ""unconventional"" (i would solve things in really strange ways that got the job done but frustrated my TA to no end) and because it felt like dragging rocks uphill for two quarters; it simply wasnt fun for me to pour 100% of my energy into trying to figure this out when i could be less stressed and more satisfied in a different major.

even if you find that you're not naturally much of a coder, there's nothing stopping you from succeeding in cs anyway -- dedication goes a long way. try 106b and see how it goes -- it might be that you get more used to the coding mindset and it flows more naturally for you later on. but if you try cs for a while find that it's just pushing rocks uphill and not fulfilling, perhaps consider branching out.

also, if you're into the tech field but find that youre not really a solid coder, there are ways to still have that part of your brain scratched without being a dev. i did tech support/light sysadmin for a multi-clinic operation in addition to medical duties, and i found it challenging but VERY satisfying (and it also appeased my asian parents lol).",1603056599,1,0

Assuming your high school experience was anything like mine... remember how unhappy people (and possibly, you) were by trying to be who they weren't and trying to fit in? Trying to major in STEM because someone else (parents, the job market, etc) wants it is the same thing. It will make you unhappy.

I can't speak for how exactly your parents will respond but what I can tell you is that most parents are just worried for their children. The market is much less certain for humanities majors. You're worried. They're worried. That's understandable. But you know, if you like it and like something matters to you right now, focus on that. Because if anything, pursuing what you are interested is going to be what makes you an interesting person. Some time down the road, you will have the chance to switch careers if grad school, law school, and humanities are no longer for you.

Sorry this is kind of ramble-y, hopefully you go my point. A lot of this is just stuff I wish I had told myself when I was in college. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk, proud of you for reconciling what you think you've been telling yourself with what you've  actually been telling yourself :)",1605158618,1,0

"I undertook a very similar route to you, with only one difference: I didn't figure out that STEM wasn't really my thing until mid-junior year when I was already pretty locked in.

My biggest regret is that I didn't figure this out a lot earlier, because I really didn't enjoy most of my Stanford experience. A couple Bs won't preclude you from going to a top law school, but 4 years of Bs and generally being miserable at Stanford could close off some options.

"Everyone has good ideas. Here's what you need on top of that:


Money, and preferably lots of it - you need to invest in your business for it to grow.

Proper credentials and subject matter expertise - so you can assure investors &amp; clients that you actually a have a thorough understanding of the market/subject matter, have a competitive advantage over those who don't, and have a passion for the subject and won't easily drop it. This usually comes in the form of years of experience in industry or academia.

A compelling reason for employees to join. A combination of a powerful mission, good financial compensation, and good company culture. You cannot get and retain good employees by paying peanuts, especially not Stanford students.

A legitimate demand for your product or service - you may think of something like ""I wish this existed, I would totally use it"" - but when you bring it to the real world no signs up. You need to conduct real-world market research to validate your idea.

I'll be honest, your post seems kind of laughable - what would you think if a random middle school student messaged you saying he had a good idea, and was wondering if you wanted to work for him, without mentioning anything about the idea.

Trust me, many people in 229 do not even put enough thought into their project to do anything novel, which you did. Lots of people just re-implement an existing paper, or tweak some hyperparameters on a SOTA model, then copy paste some fancy words/equations into their final paper and call it a day. You will be fine, I certainly don't think you will get a B, if your PSets and midterm averages to an A/A+. (But dont quote me on that, i do not want to plant any false hope)

"EE major here. 

The problem with 40M is that its not really a EE class but rather a class designed as a engineering fundamental requirement for the entire engineering department (including CS). As a result the class became this weird mish-mash of complicated concepts poorly summarized to a group of people with different backgrounds.

It also doesn't help that professor Plummer isn't known for his ability to teach introductory courses... As a result EE40M is a pretty mixed bag in term of its reception. Those who really enjoyed the labs, at least when the class was still in person, tend to gave the class a favorable review while others said it was just a waste of time. 

Which subjects are you particularly interested in? Since EE consists of many different tracks, here is my general review of each.  

Hardware/Software -  This is my main track and what I believe is the highlight of EE. Great professors and great courses. Essential even for some CS majors.  (EE108, EE180, EE282). 40M hardly covers this area.

Information/Stat/ML - Another great EE track with many famous professors and great classes. Very mathematically intensive but extremely useful. Its classes are taken by people from many different background- econ, chem, neuro, and ML guys from CS. (EE263, EE364A/B, EE276). Also unrelated to 40M. 

Circuits - Arguably the most 'disliked' track. Notorious for its poor introductory classes like EE101A and EE40M. The higher level classes are more well received and much better taught.

Signals - Much better taught than the circuits track. Another track whose very popular with other majors due to its versatility.

Physical Sciences and devices - Mostly taken by people who have a background in physics and material sciences. Not sure how good its classes and professors are since as I am personally unfamiliar.",1606068509,6,0

"‚ÄòBasically zero hospitalisations‚Äô among the student body, maybe this is true.

My questions to you with regards to this flaming hot take would be:
- How many hospitalisations and deaths is an acceptable number to you?
- Do you really believe that only students matter here?  The death and hospitalisation rates of staff are certainly going to be worse
- Do you think that coming back to campus for heavily controlled and restricted socialisation and likely no actual in person classes is socially worth the risk of flying 8000+ undergraduate students from around the world, and from around the country, all to congregate together, bringing whatever form of this disease they might?

After however many months of covid we‚Äôve had, you still don‚Äôt get that it‚Äôs not just about the individual.

There's also frustration that older, generally higher ranking doctors got the vaccine first, but that's a little more understandable if you accept that using age as a factor is morally okay.

"Hmm this is a hard question to answer because at first I thought the courses at Stanford were altogether more difficult. But after talking to grad students that went to Stanford for undergrad, I learned that the grad school courses were simply significantly harder than undergrad courses (due to the amount of work per hw and the math intensity). Once I took an undergrad level course (CS 161) I believed this because this course was on par with my undergrad courses at UCI in terms of difficulty.
So I‚Äôd say that at the undergraduate level the courses are on par in terms of difficulty but at the graduate level Stanford courses are more difficult than UCI grad courses.

If you do the readings‚Äîand you definitely should do the readings, because they're fascinating‚Äîit shouldn't be too challenging. Go to office hours if you need help.

As for grading, don't worry. In the fall, if you got less than a 90% on any major assignment, you could correct it and get points back (capped at 90%). There were also several opportunities for extra credit. They really want everyone to succeed, and the course policies reflect that.

"I was in a somewhat similar position during my undergrad (now an ME PhD student), and I think the right choice for me was to stay in ME. 

It‚Äôs important to think about career paths here. If you want to switch into the areas you describe, it seems that you would need to get a PhD and ultimately work as an academic in these areas. 

Beyond the PhD requirement, an academic career comes with a lot of specific challenges, especially since what you describe is not a particularly ‚Äúhot‚Äù field. You would probably find the competition for these academic jobs, and for research funding, is a lot more than you‚Äôd expect. 

I‚Äôm not trying to dissuade you from changing paths, but make sure you understand fully what direction it is that you‚Äôre heading before you make the change. 

With an ME degree on the other hand, your options are extremely broad. Whether you want to work in sustainable technology development, product design, software, etc. you can get there from an ME degree. Some of these paths could be somewhat related to your other interests as well. 

You also need to consider what kind of day to day you want for the rest of your life. I‚Äôm not particularly ‚Äúpassionate‚Äù about engineering, but I deeply enjoy the technical work and the math on a day to day basis. Ultimately I think this is more important.

"I think ultimately only you can answer this question--but you don't have the necessary experience yet to figure it out right now. Nor is it important that you declare a major right away, and it's probably best that you don't.

The good news is that you've identified a few things that sound interesting. Go take a class in each of these subjects and see whether you're adept at the material, and more importantly, whether you enjoy it. 

With engineering, unfortunately there tend to be a lot of prerequisites to fulfil before you can actually take core classes, but CS106A, ME 30, and ENG 42 are all options that have no prereqs and will give you some insight into whether mechanical or electrical engineering is a good potential fit.

"The other answers are great, I""ll give some meta- points.

* Major does not define you. I have seen software engineers who studied CS pivot to law or medicine. I know two EE majors who are doing management consulting.
* Are you an international student? If you want to stay in the US after graduating, it would be better to have a STEM-classified degree (as recognized by USCIS). You see many internationals study CS but take a minor in humanities (their actual interest).
* Do you have any immediate family financial obligations after graduation? (i.e. send money home to support parents to pay their livelihood/medical bill/pay younger sibling's college tuition/etc). Then for the sake of your own sanity and to keep your stress levels down, it could be beneficial to study a major which leads to an immediately stable career
* You might become more interested in something after you become more proficient in it. For example, I know some engineering-related majors who liked their subject more after they got a good grasp on the fundamentals. Compared to the humanities where there is a relatively lower barrier of entry to studying those subjects
* If you feel forced away from engineering because you went to an under-resourced school and don't have the fundamentals, there are resources like ACE sessions which can help you. FLI office has big/little sib programs for mentorship. (The new major unit caps might not alleviate the problem btw.)",1601991590,1,0

"OP please please listen to the two commenters above. Too many freshman (including me back in my freshman year) fall into the trap of taking 20 units, no matter how much upperclassman warn them about it. 

You‚Äôll probably survive the quarter fine, sure. But beyond what‚Äôs listed above, what you‚Äôre really going to miss out on is the chance to synthesize class material and learn it. When I did 20 units, I ended up getting the same high grades as my peers taking lighter course loads, but what I realized later is that I actually learnt far less than them in the grand scheme of things. If you‚Äôre only doing the psets and midterms in a class, you‚Äôre not really getting as much as you can out of it - especially in these intro classes for majors.

I‚Äôm guessing that part of the reason you‚Äôre doing 20 units is because a lot of other freshman are doing it too. If that‚Äôs the case, then please don‚Äôt follow their example. Every freshman I know who took 20 units fall quarter regretted it later in their Stanford journey, and there‚Äôs no need for you to make the same mistakes we did.

"That sounds pretty symsys-ey, but the symsys major doesn't have a great reputation, and you might only enjoy it if your interests really are more broad than they are deep. What classes are you taking this quarter? I'd recommend using your frosh year to knock out requirements and try out intro-level classes (or introsems!) to find an area of study that suits you. There are some courses that you'll have to take depending on your field (e.g. 99% of STEM majors will take CS 106A/B, so it might be worth taking one/both of those within the next year if you're interested in STEM) and other courses that are just very popular in certain circles ‚Äî I've heard great reviews of STS 1 from majors and horrible reviews of it from non-majors, so trying to find those classes could help you narrow down your interests.

"Perspective from someone who dropped 61CM:  

As the other commenters have stated, it's not necessary to take 61CM. I found myself in a similar boat to you and decided that it wasn't worth it to tank 61CM. It's my opinion that 61CM is *built* for  
(1) People who did IMO  

(2) People who are already familiar with proof-based math  

(3) People who are willing to dedicate an entire quarter to one class  

It seems that you probably don't fall into (1) or (2), which most people don't. It's possible you fall into (3), but if that is so you can *not* be taking 20 units and get through this quarter.  

Regarding your concerns about proof-based math, I'm a math major who has progressed at a reasonable pace through the courses I'd like to take. I also plan to graduate with honors. I think the three weeks you've spent already in CM will do you well in terms of proofwriting so if you jump into one of the more introductory 100-levels I think you'll be fine (107, 108, 115, etc). It's totally reasonable to do the 50 series and end up getting through the sequences of analysis and algebra by the end of your sophomore year.

I don‚Äôt regret my decision at all because it pushed me a lot mathematically, but I also want to echo what other people are saying about not viewing 61cm as a class you have to take, and it‚Äôs not worth it if you‚Äôre not having fun.

Not having those things and trying to work through 20 units your first quarter ever as a student will burn you out fast. Really fast. It is way more important to find and set a healthy baseline for yourself your first couple of quarters rather than try to do everything now. You have 11 quarters to do things, 15 units/quarter to finish. 

It is not a shameful thing to drop class levels or switch to credit/no credit, so I second the other poster, but also very deeply consider how much you really need the other classes.

"My friend in DM last year got (IIRC) ~50% on the the midterms (and estimated he did similarly on the final), and ended up with a B- in the class. Given that last fall didn't have coronavirus influencing grading curves, I wouldn't really think that *anybody* could fail the class this term (C-'s, maybe D's, but no straight NP/NC on the transcript).



Another note: there is **absolutely no shame** in dropping to 51/51+56. *Plenty* of math majors start in the 50 series and graduate with honors; don't feel pressured to take this class, either for social or academic reasons. Please please please don't compare yourself to the other kids in your class - lots of kids at Stanford come in having done exceptionally well on the international science olympiads. If you have no olympiad/college math experience, you won't be able to touch those other guys in mathematical maturity, and it is not worth comparing yourself. I can only imagine how much your brain has expanded in the last few weeks coming into 61CM with no linear algebra background, and how difficult (although fun and rewarding!) it must have been. This was a fact I had to come to terms with at Stanford as well: at this school, there are kids that are sometimes just way better than you are. 


Back to curves, I did manage to end up with an A in the class (I took DM), but it was exactly the kind of painful experience you described - lots of feeling behind, lots of struggling, but fulfilling nonetheless. I received an 80% on midterm 1, an 85% on midterm 2, high grades on the homework (everyone in the class did well on HW, we all worked together). The final felt *really* bad - I definitely did not get more than an 80%. Given that my curved grade was evidently above a 93%, and my actual grade would have given me a solid C+/B- in the class, I would say last year's curve was easily a net 18-25% shift upwards; I'd expect it to be even higher this year bc corona. If I were to go back again, I'm not super sure I would do 61DM again (I'm a CS major now).


Nobody can tell you what to do except for yourself. If I were you, I'd switch to 51.

"This is a much better opportunity than a club. Sounds like an opportunity to show alums with real experience what you can do, and to learn from them. You're much more likely to advance your career doing something like this.",1601827034,1,0
"I think the application-based clubs may be taking on an outsized importance right now, since it's hard to meet people casually and make friends on campus. However, they have no impact on your long-term career success and ability to make lasting friendships. Furthermore, I think that rejecting prospective club members is just a way for the club leaders to feel more important. This isn't the Yale skull and bones we're talking about.

You should focus on things you can control--and things that do have longer-term impact: good grades initially, and later trying to get an internship at a real company (not a student club...) or research in a professor's lab. Hiring managers will care about these things, not some club that rejected you fall quarter freshman year.",1601826582,1,0

"I'm going to get so downvoted for telling you this, but tiny capped extracurricular programs like WICS are scripted for outcomes which might not always have the students' best interests at heart. On  balance they're spectacular, but in the same way top 40 music gets over-produced. I should probably leave it at that.

Join the ACM and IEEE, and get involved with their women student programs. Complain to their leaders that WICS is tiny relative to demand and they need to compete. Volunteer to make it happen.",1601822809,1,0

"Don't worry. Back in my freshman year we had a thing in our dorm called ""the rejection wall."" The people who you thought were just ""getting into everything"" were also the ones who had been rejected from SO many things. It really sucks that you were really looking forward to getting into WICS but I promise you'll eventually find some community within another club (or maybe WICS another time).",1601801970,1,0
"This is my first quarter doing proofs and I‚Äôm in both CS103 and Math 115. Math 115 assumes you can get up to speed with proofs in the first week through optional readings, whereas in CS 103 the entire class so far has been learning the building blocks of proofs. If you aren‚Äôt familiar with proofs I would highly recommend taking CS103 or Math56 before any 100+ level math courses, but if you have extra time to dedicate to learning proof techniques during weeks 1 and 2 it‚Äôs definitely doable",1601800445,1,0
"i know that feeling :( my frosh year i got rejected from public service clubs.. like i literally got rejected from volunteering lol. 

it's tough, but just know that it will get better. Stanford creates a really crazy environment where everyone seems miles ahead, but in reality everyone is just on their own path. try not to compare yourself or feel too down about rejections. what helped for me is daily meditation and avoiding social media, especially instagram and linkedin.

if you still want to join a CS related group, look into She++ :) there are also groups that don't require an application - for example, one of my fave things i've done at Stanford is running a SPLASH class! it's where you create a class for bay area middle schoolers and SPLASH will fund you for materials to teach it.",1601800370,2,0
Don't equate your self worth with acceptance/rejection of a club or job. There isn't a lot of reasoning that goes into these decisions and the best thing you can do for your self is to keep exploring. I can guaranteed that there are so many amazing opportunities at Stanford in CS that you don't have to worry about missing out.,1601800289,1,0
"You‚Äôll be just fine!! We‚Äôve all been in your shoes where we‚Äôve been rejected by clubs and classes, it definitely sucks, but it‚Äôs also something that‚Äôs totally normal and not at all representative of your qualifications for being at stanford. I was probably rejected from like 90% of things I applied for at stanford (currently a senior). But honestly, the best and most formative lessons I‚Äôve had have come from things non-application based. 

In terms of missing out on opportunities, there are definitely a ton of other ways to get experience that aren‚Äôt through clubs. If you want to get better at CS, try to find a professor you like and ask to do research with them, join one of the coding clubs that tutor kids in Palo Alto, set up study groups with other cs people in your dorms, do hackathons, etc.

Introsems can be competitive simply because all frosh apply to them, and they‚Äôre limited to 15 students. That doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not good enough; the professor simply doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to take on so many bright students at once. But there are so many other cool classes to take, and you can always take that introsem or something similar another year. 

Finally, I would encourage you to try clubs that you don‚Äôt necessarily have to apply to, and/or clubs you wouldn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd normally do. My best communities have come from places I never would have thought of, so try to keep an open mind and apply for things that are out of your comfort zone!",1601793403,4,0

"Congrats on recognizing that you‚Äôre having trouble now and trying to fix it! The first year can be rough for everyone, but it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre being proactive about this. 

Talk to an academic advisor immediately ‚Äî they want you to succeed at Stanford, but it‚Äôs a lot easier for them to help you now than it will be later in the quarter. (I‚Äôd recommend Katie Phillips; she‚Äôs really nice and great with freshmen.) They should be able to help you figure out what all of your options are (and if it‚Äôs still possible to take a leave). 

If you do remain enrolled, get in touch with the academic coaches. They can help you with time management, as well as connect you to other resources. There are also study sessions that can be helpful for staying on track (both CTL &amp; Schwab offer a few times per week). 

I‚Äôd also recommend signing up for any big sib/lil sib or mentor programs that you can. Even if you aren‚Äôt super close to your match, it‚Äôs a good start, and they can help guide you to student groups and activities where you can make friends. 

Good luck!",1601788230,2,0
"Four years is not an insignificant percentage of your life. Sadly, for at least a few kids each year it's around 15-20%. The problems some folks (including myself when I was a student) are problems you'll find at most if not all elite schools. You can choose to focus on these problems and be miserable, or you can focus on other things that make you happy for those four years. One thing is for sure, though: the students will not change the university and fix these issues. You just need to find a way to get the best value for your time and money.",1601778276,1,0
