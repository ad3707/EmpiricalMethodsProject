"So you spend your shifts in the resident‚Äôs room where all the residents look at their patient notes in between each patient. Sometimes you‚Äôll have other volunteers with you during shift (2 other max) and sometimes you‚Äôll be alone. You sign up for shifts at the beginning of each quarter. Typical shifts usually have 5-8 residents with you. 

During your shift you‚Äôll go shadow residents where you will follow a resident into the patient room and observe as they go through a wellness check for a patient. Patients can be children or adults. After they are done with the check up residents will then go to consult the attending in charge (bc residents are also in training too) and you‚Äôll be left alone with the patient. During this time you‚Äôll ask patients about their history and connect them to any resources they may need that the hospital may not necessarily be able to connect them to i.e assisting with unemployment, education, housing, insurance, etc. Afterwards, the resident comes back with the attending and you will observe the attending and resident consult with the patient. 

Every volunteer gets the opportunity to be in clinic but in addition to being in clinic and assisting patients you are asked to be on a project. Projects vary widely and depend on your interest but they are meant to supplement your experience being a patient health advocate and diversify your perspective and how you look at healthcare. 

As for outreach there‚Äôs a ton of things we do.

"Hi u/JTD783, I want to clear up a misunderstanding in your post.  You mentioned racial/ethnic quotas as the method in which affirmative action will be achieved. Luckily that is not what the voters of California are being asked to implement.

**Racial quotas are a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, they are illegal, and cannot and will not be ever used to admit applicants (*****Regents of the University of California v. Bakke*****).**

It is **incorrect** to say that if Proposition 16 passes, racial quotas will be implemented in the UC's and CSU's.

Our courts have determined that there is a compelling government interest in achieving diversity in our universities, and have, under strict scrutiny (the highest level of judicial review), allowed them to **use race as one factor of many,  and not the only, to admit students in a holistic admissions process.**  With Proposition 16, students can signal that they are persevering despite hardships due to their race or ethnicity, and are in need of a helping hand; they are not receiving a free pass. **There are many legal safeguards to ensure affirmative action is executed in a way that is fair and uncumbersome.** 

Affirmative action seeks to begin to repair the effects of centuries of overt and perverse discrimination in our society, and does not try to exclude anyone, but instead provide opportunities to those in the past would not have received them",1603098079,1,0

"&gt; Levinsons: Are there other ways, maybe economic based affirmative action is the main way, but there are other ways that you've studied to try and achieve some of the same goals but not use race and or sex?

&gt; G√°ndara: Well of course this is the question that we asked ourselves upon the passage of 209 and we put our heads together in the university and we actually ran the numbers because of course the very first thing that comes up is we'll just use socioeconomic status (SES) since these groups that you're concerned about tend to be disadvantaged. Running the numbers we saw that using SES was not going to solve our problem. In fact we have a great deal of diversity in the state we have a lot of immigrants. We have a lot of immigrants with good educational backgrounds but look like they're poor because as people are introduced from outside into this economy they oftentimes uh are not able to get credentialed and people look poor but uh it's just another way I think that uh professor Kennedy was indicating that it's not the same race and poverty are not the same and we realized that using that as a proxy was not going to get us the diversity that we needed.

This answer is confusing for two reasons.

&gt; Running the numbers we saw that using SES was not going to solve our problem.

What is ""our problem""? Prof G√°ndara says ""using that as a proxy was not going to get us the diversity that we needed"" so it seems that achieving diversity is the problem that Prop 16 is trying to solve. If that's the case, I would say that's not a problem worth solving. There's no intrinsic benefit to having a student body look one way or the other. The benefit of diversity comes from the effects it has on other parts of society. A racially diverse educated population may solve problems a racially homogenous population wouldn't think about, etc. So saying ""get us the diversity we need"" a misleading way to measure success and is itself a proxy. What good is a racially diverse college if minorities that don't go to college are still struggling to build wealth? I'm interested in seeing the full results of the study Prof G√°ndara cited but right now I'm unconvinced.

&gt; We have a lot of immigrants with good educational backgrounds but look like they're poor

Is this study by Prof G√°ndara not considering immigration status as a factor in socioeconomic status? Immigrants, even educated immigrants, face problems associated with finding work, learning a new language, and not having a social support group. Simply saying ""some immigrants are educated but we can't measure that"" seems like a poor argument against using SES when there are so many obstacles due to being an immigrant that you can measure. 

&gt; Levinsons: Is there an argument that affirmative action does not work as intended, and specifically in this question now or later could you address what we mean by reverse racism?

&gt; Kennedy:  Sure, so one of the there are many arguments against affirmative action, and certainly in the courts the attack on affirmative action usually takes the form of a person who has not gotten, we're talking about the educational affirmative action, we have a person, typically a white person, who has not gotten into a school and they're they're complaining and they say you know but for affirmative action I would have gotten into the school, therefore i am a victim of racial discrimination. You know if I would have got, if if I was not white, if I was a person of color I would have gotten in,  but I'm white therefore I did not get in now I'm being discriminated against. So, you know the argument is that that person is a victim of what they say reverse discrimination. Now what do I think about that? I'd say two things. Number one, do I think that there could be reverse discrimination? Yeah, I think there could be reverse discrimination. I think there's a big country, lots of different institutions, lots of different settings. Are there settings in which a white person could be discriminated against? Sure. Are there settings in which I think that people of Asian ancestry could be discriminated against? Absolutely. You know the state of California a long history of discrimination against people of Asian ancestry. I think that discrimination can take a wide array of forms and any group could potentially be the victim of discrimination. So I think that it could happen. Let me say one other thing, however about reverse discrimination. Every effort that has been made to elevate a racial minority has been met with the claim that it was reverse discrimination. So the first federal civil rights law, the first federal civil rights law in the United States was the Civil Rights Act of 1866. It was the act that said that people, all persons in the United States, should be able to own property, should be able to testify, should be able to enter into contracts that sort of thing. Fundamental civil rights on the same basis as white people. That first civil rights law was vetoed by the president of the United States Andrew Johnson and Andrew Johnson said that that law gave ""discriminating protection"" to the negro. That has been the case over and over and over again. If you take a look at the debates over the Civil Rights Act of 1964, black people were simply trying to you know get a foothold into employment markets. That was called reverse discrimination. So I think that in these discussions, I've said, you know, one has to be careful. I don't want anybody to be the victim of invidious racial discrimination.

I don't think Professor Kennedy answers this question well for two reasons. The first is that I simply don't think he answers the first part of the question. As I said previously with Prof G√°ndara use of the phrase ""our problem"" I'm curios what the objective of affirmative action is and if Prof Kennedy thinks if it is or isn't solving that problem. 

&gt; Is there an argument that affirmative action does not work as intended

So does it work or doesn't it? The potential side effect of reverse racism is part of it but, Prof Kennedy largely skips over this part of the question. 

Prof Kennedy also presents a bit of a red herring in addressing the concerns of reverse racism. Specifically in saying 

&gt; Let me say one other thing, however about reverse discrimination. Every effort that has been made to elevate a racial minority has been met with the claim that it was reverse discrimination. So the first federal civil rights law, the first federal civil rights law in the United States was the Civil Rights Act of 1866. It was the act that said that people, all persons in the United States, should be able to own property, should be able to testify, should be able to enter into contracts that sort of thing. Fundamental civil rights on the same basis as white people. That first civil rights law was vetoed by the president of the United States Andrew Johnson and Andrew Johnson said that that law gave ""discriminating protection"" to the negro. That has been the case over and over and over again.

The difference between the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 1964 and Prop 16 is that the allegations the Civil Rights Act sought to give equality while Prop 16 is asking for preference. The claims of reverse racism against Prop 16 are not as tenuous as those against the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and 1964.

"I think you're still misunderstanding what I'm saying. Let's consider a very simple model of the college admission process where the SAT is the only determining factor.

Suppose UCLA says that a score of 1200+ on the SAT is the qualification for admission. However they can only accept 100 students and 300 students with scores higher than 1200 apply. So UCLA takes only the top 100 students. This means there are qualified students who weren't accepted.

Now California passes a new prop that says UCLA can now consider GPA as a factor in admissions. Using this new criteria UCLA may reject someone with a 1600 SAT and 3.0 GPA in favor of someone with a 1400 SAT and 4.0 GPA. Under this new system a student who had a 1600 lost their admission on the basis of GPA. 

This is basically the argument I'm putting forth. There is currently a set of criteria, test scores, GPA, essays, extra curriculars, etc. Now Prop 16 is proposing adding race to that set of criteria. UCLA can now admit students who were still qualified but wouldn't have been accepted  under the old system and the only difference is race. Worse yet is when admission of that student comes at the expense of another student of a different race. This is inevitable since a college's resources are finite.",1603087875,1,0

"Just saying, data collection for submission to the federal government is not the same as classification for affirmative action. It's important to remember...

Affirmative action hasn't been practiced within the UC for admissions for 22 years. The UC doesn't really have a document lying around about what it will look like. 

But what we do know is that affirmative action in admissions cannot be automatic nor mechanical. That's been determined by the Supreme Court. It has to be done as a part of an individual and comprehensive review that evaluates merit and other factors. In this sense, many members of subgroups can benefit from affirmative action including many AAPIs and ""whites"" on this list. 

Like in a clear example, a Syrian refugee would likely not be seen as ""white"" in admissions processes.

"&gt; If you‚Äôre a rich dude in 1780, it‚Äôs rational for you to own slaves and run a plantation. That has no bearing on what is moral, and what I would support. 

Morality doesn't exist in a vacuum. You can make the argument that owning slaves as white dude in 1780, or owning slaves at any point in time regardless of your race, is irrational. Why? Because the productivity of an enslaved population is less than that of a freed population. Slavery essentially held back progress for the benefit of a few. In this view slavery is both immoral and irrational. 

&gt; So what I‚Äôm saying is: maybe as the world/system is currently set up, UCLA rationally would not consider race in admitting students. 

Like I said in my comment

&gt; So why care about admitting poor people at all if the rich can almost always out compete them in terms of resources?

&gt; Improving the lives of people also increases the brand value of a university. A school wants to strike a balance between getting top tier talent and improving society by helping the poor.

There is a rational motivation to helping poor students. A school's reputation is a linear combination of the value it gains from having successful students and the value it gains from being known for doing a social good. But let's take a look at two extremes.

School A only prioritizes having very successful students and as a result never accepts poor ""risky"" students. As a result they have very high returns on all their students. But since they never accept poor students, they are seen as elitist.

School B only accepts poor students. Some of those students go on to be very successful but not to the same extent as school A. As a result they are applauded for doing social good. On the downside, they get less grant money because they are not as competitive as school A.

AA is basically telling the school to fine tune how much value it places on high return students and doing social good. There is a rationale behind both options but in the rat race of funding and recruiting talent, focusing on top tier students pays higher dividends. AA is a way of reorienting a school's value system. But as getting funding is the main priority for a school, they still want high value students who add to their mission of doing social good. That's why your argument of ""people who live a harder life should get priority"" argument doesn't make sense because having students who lived hard lives doesn't do anything for a university. Having students who lived hard lives but will also do great things does matter though.",1603086986,1,0

"From the video description: Should public schools and agencies be allowed to consider race when making decisions about hiring, admissions, and government contracts?

"I think you're looking at one specific scenario that doesn't exactly include a lot of information. Like on the converse, there very likely can be an AAPI student who wouldn't have gotten in without affirmative action (in a future system with it).

As I said earlier too, it's important to keep in mind... AAPI students can and often benefit from affirmative action efforts in admissions. And such considerations of race and gender aren't going to suddenly make or break a case for admission. Academic qualifications and/or skills will continue to be the most important factor. And because of how narrowly tailored any such considerations have to be used, it won't even make a difference for a vast majority of admissions. Several UC regents have said similar statements. Sorry to repeat so much, but as Dr. Poon said, checking the box does nothing for admissions purposes. No affirmative action is automatically or mechanically given on the basis of race or gender.",1603085968,1,0
"Hmm, I‚Äôm not sure that your argument actually addresses mine. I‚Äôm not really concerned with what is rational for the university to do. If you‚Äôre a rich dude in 1780, it‚Äôs rational for you to own slaves and run a plantation. That has no bearing on what is moral, and what I would support. 

So what I‚Äôm saying is: maybe as the world/system is currently set up, UCLA rationally would not consider race in admitting students. However, that fact is independent of my conclusion about morality. Therefore, either UCLA should act against its own interests, or the system should be changed. And that may be a pipe dream, but a morally justified pipe dream is still morally justified. 

&gt; For the sake of argument, lets say you could definitively prove that one person's life was harder than another person's. You argument is basically the gap between where someone starts in life and where they are at the time of applications is their measure of potential. But that isn't how a school defines it. 

Yea, I think you understood my argument correctly, and perhaps this isn‚Äôt how schools define it. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs how schools *should* define it, because I believe it is the correct definition. And Prop 16 allows schools to more accurately asses who‚Äôs life was harder, by including race in their consideration. 

I don‚Äôt believe that you countered my claim that this is the correct measure of potential. If you did in your comment, my bad, I‚Äôll read it again more carefully, just let me know",1603085863,1,0

You can still have competition and loss in a zero sum game.

"Recently transferred from UCSB and I gotta say I somehow relate to you friend.

UCSB was never my first choice (UCLA was!) , and ended up going there made me feel bad about myself. I felt inferior to my high school friends who got into better colleges, and I was so troubled by the thoughts that they‚Äôd laughed at me behind my back (which obviously isn‚Äôt true). I had to deal with my sense of insecurity, so I often told my friends how ‚Äúrigorous‚Äù UCSB was to show them that this place was not a academic dumpster, and I occasionally invalidated my friends too by saying their schools were just being too easy.

After a few quarter I finally fit into UCSB. I found that people were nice there and professors were also super dedicated to research. Then I stopped making those harsh comments about other school being ‚Äúlenient‚Äù because I felt comfortable studying at UCSB (though I still submitted my transfer application lol).

I realized that I was being a total jerk to my friends and that I was just transforming all my negative feelings towards myself into insults on them and their schools. So I just apologized to them and told them about all the hard feelings I had when I was a freshman. Luckily, they were really understanding and never took my insults too seriously (as they told me).

With all these being said, I really don‚Äôt think your friend meant it when they said UCSB was better than UCLA. I think they are just trying to find confidence and get over their disappointment towards themselves somehow. And as you said they are close friend, so I don‚Äôt think you should just arbitrarily unfriend them because I believe the environment they‚Äôre in also matters! 

My suggestion is that maybe you should give them some time and see if they will eventually grow up and figure out the root of their issue. Or if your friend continues to make harsh comments, you can just tell them directly how you feel about this; they might realize they are expressing emotions in a negative way and it needs to be changed, or they might still be a jerk and then you can unfriend them for sure!",1602059490,1,0

"People like that are usually super insecure and frankly annoying to be around. They're trying to seek validation by one-upping people.

Their classes may be genuinely hard to them, but that doesn't mean anything other than that they picked a hard schedule for their first quarter (and IMO that's on them for choosing a difficult courseload). All large public schools generally have low average GPAs compared to private schools with more pronounced grade inflation. Cal, UCLA, and other large publics have similar average GPAs, and I'd reckon UCSB is in the same range as well. It also depends heavily on department as well. But in the end, course rigor is only one part of the undergraduate experience, and there's more to college than working on homework all day and complaining about how difficult classes are.

If they are happy that they didn't get into UCLA, good for them I guess? It's great to be content in their decisions, but I sense that most of that attitude is rooted in jealousy. You don't need to put people down to feel content with your decisions. Major also doesn't matter when it comes to L&amp;S decisions. Statistically, it's harder to get into UCLA as an engineering or an art major, but most of the STEM Majors are in L&amp;S anyways. I also don't see why that's relevant, given that they're also non-STEM? It sounds like they're just looking for ways to put down your admission to UCLA.

"I'm assuming you already clicked the checkbox for the ""This phone already exists, replace it?"" (See [https://imgur.com/a/Z9HZjdZ](https://imgur.com/a/Z9HZjdZ)) and it didn't work?

You can ""reactivate"" your device to switch from your old phone to your new phone.  Here are the steps:

1) When you start to log in on MyUCLA (for example), before you authenticate, there is a link that says ""My Settings and Devices"". See this screenshot (the link below the ""Add a New Device""). [https://imgur.com/a/QFruh9T](https://imgur.com/a/QFruh9T).

2) You'll need to authenticate. If you can't use your old phone to authenticate, choose a phone call to your cellphone number (since that won't matter if it's the old phone or the new phone). Answer the call, push any key, and the phone call will disconnect after the authentication goes through.

3) You'll see a list of your devices - click on ""Device Options"" for the device that you want to change. Then click ""Reactivate Duo Mobile"". You'll need to authenticate / verify again, either with a text or a call. 

4) It'll ask you what kind of phone it is, and tell you to install Duo Mobile.

5) Then the QR code will appear. Using your new phone, scan the QR code with the Duo Mobile app. That should set up Duo Mobile on your new device.

I just tried the steps above now and it worked for me. I don't think I unlinked my old phone (I just stopped using it) and haven't had any issues with it.",1602047432,2,0

Where are the cops in crime prevention? what are we paying $21 million for? they have shown that they are completely incompetent. their budget should be contingent on improved results. Not to mention his emailed lie about not giving the cops permission to use the jackie Robinson field. He [definitely](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-04/ucla-chancellor-calls-lapd-use-of-jackie-robinson-stadium-to-process-arrests-a-violation) gave them permission. Like why lie about that? Just be honest. and then at the same time he's crying about prop 16. btw most minorities think affirmative action is condescending, white liberals don't need to get offended on their behalf. where are the emails about tuition? Is he lobbying the board of regents for tuition reductions? Is he lobbying the governor for increased funding? CA has a $11 billion budget surplus right now, so we definitely do have the money. they want us to focus on random culture war BS and not the actual economic issues ie tuition that affect all of us, and minorities disproportionately anyway.",1607298075,2,0
"My prof did that spring quarter and I was so fed up I sent him this:

""Hello Professor ------,

I appreciate how passionate you are about \[subject\] and very much enjoy the content of your class, especially as my first \[subject\] class. Professors who share their passion in their area of expertise have always been the best professors in my experience. However, I just wanted to email you regarding going over the 1 hour and 15 minutes allotted¬†for lecture as well as having us watch videos that you would usually show in class on our own for the past few weeks. I do not believe this is particularly fair as you are not only treating the amount of material we cover as if instruction were taught normally, but you're also including more time commitment in an already straining time for many of us. In my other classes this quarter, the professors have lessened our load as a courtesy but have also ended class early if they had gone on for too long in the previous lecture or would save the¬†last few minute¬†for questions in live classes. I've noticed many professor¬†have a timer to tell warn them of the end of lecture time. All I ask is that you be considerate of our time.

Thank you for your time,""

"I am also a phy sci major and I took MIMG 101 last winter with Bradley and Das. I took 153A a few quarters before and also didn't think it was that helpful. MIMG was probably one of the most information dense classes that I have taken outside of 107. Bradley was pretty good and engaging so I would recommend taking it with him if possible. Das not so much. Also, they did not have any homework or readings assigned, which helped me a lot so that I could just focus on learning the material from the lectures. I know other professors that teach the class can assign a lot of other quizzes or worksheets which seems to make the class harder. Overall, I do not regret taking the class at all. It was a LOT for someone like me who didn't have a strong background in molecular bio but the material was interesting and adds a depth to my understanding of biology that I would not have gotten if I did a different UD. Just get ready to study your butt off for it. Also, not sure if this applies to you but I thought knowledge of MIMG helped me a lot with the MCAT.",1607294609,3,0

Another thing I do is sort of schedule ""billable hours"" for myself. Like essentially I write down what I need to do and assign a time in hours of how long it would take me to do that task.

"Zaller is a very dry lecturer. His focus is in his research which is very famous among political scientists. You will be reading or have read some of his work in other American Politics courses.

I took Tyson for Authoritarian Politics. I think I liked him more than the rest of the class did. I wish I could fit him again into my class schedule. With that said, after bombing my midterm, and an unenthusiastic group, I really had to work for my B+ in his class. You‚Äôll have daily readings along with CCLE quizzes that are due before every class plus a midterm, group project, and final. If I remember correctly, two quizzes are dropped so you can miss or Bomb two and still get a good grade. Most of the readings are from the Dictator‚Äôs Handbook along with scans from other scholars that he posts online. The DH is available on Audible.

"You‚Äôre going to be reading studies and articles from Zaller, Bawn, and Vavreck. Make sure that you take at least one class from each of them. Zaller is a very dry lecturer (he talks like the guy from the clear eyes commercial), but he‚Äôs a brilliant mind and instrumental in the theory of group politics. 

Take Matt Barreto if you‚Äôre interested in Latino politics. His class introduces you to Stata for the final project which will be helpful if you want to do polling or analyze data in the future. 

Michael Chwe teaches game theory. Take his intro class. It‚Äôs easy and really interesting. I made the mistake of taking his upper division game theory class without having any experience with upper level math. It‚Äôs an incredible class if you have taken calculus. Otherwise, stay clear away. He made me wish that I had taken more math so I can take more game theory classes in graduate school. Alas. 

Take Branstetter eventually to fulfill your political theory requirements. He‚Äôs a good lecturer who‚Äôs passionate about his work. He hosts optional talks in the sculpture garden that other professors have unsuccessfully tried to emulate. The material for this class is dense. I thought reading Plato was boring.

This class is very experimental based, so going into it with some knowledge of experimental methods and what they do may give you some advantage. I don't think this class is similar to 153A at all despite covering details about the ETC. I did really well in this class, but I also made a point to go to office hours every week and put in a lot of work to clarify concepts.

"Econ 11 is notoriously difficult and very much a weeding out class in my opinion. No need to beat yourself up, or question your acceptance. If you got in to this school, you belong for a reason, and not just in some abstract, philosophical sense, but in a practical one too; you‚Äôve clearly demonstrated high academic performance if you‚Äôve been admitted especially as a transfer with college level work, so with a few adjustments, there‚Äôs no doubt you can find your stride. 

What‚Äôs best now is to focus on the solution. From what you‚Äôre describing, it seems like you‚Äôd need a perfect final to scrap away with a C, so your best course of action will likely be to drop the class. You‚Äôll need to file a petition since it‚Äôs already week 9, but as someone who‚Äôs been in your exact predicament, I‚Äôll always recommend people to take the withdraw notation on your transcript and retake the class over a flat out C any day, especially if you have plans for any post-graduate school. Contact a counselor ASAP and they‚Äôll instruct you through the process. 

As someone above mentioned, one or two W‚Äôs is really not the end of the world, especially if you‚Äôre able to bounce back the following quarter you retake the class and perform well.

"These are all great suggestions and ideas.

There are a couple major hurdles:

1. The University very much follows a principle of academic freedom regarding how professors teach their classes. There are pros and cons to this, but they really try not to interfere too much with forcing too many policies and procedures on the faculty. A lot of faculty members would probably feel that having someone looking over their should to see how quickly they are grading as an infringement on their freedoms and will likely resist having additional oversight.

2. Having an incentivized system requires administrative oversight and additional bureaucracy. You'll need to assign the task of monitoring the grading to a staff member in the department. While keeping track of grading deadlines isn't a huge burden per se, it will be a few to several hours of work each month depending on the size of the department and how many assignments are being assigned. One of the biggest complaints against universities is that there are already too many staff members and administrators (ultimately costing students tuition money) while staff members feel like they are already stretched thin and not being compensated enough.

I'm not saying this couldn't work or that it isn't a good idea, but it would require a significant push from the student body to bring about changes and buy-in from all parties involved - professors willing to be monitored, staff members to take on the task, and students to pay few extra dollars for the additional work being created.",1608344078,4,0

UCLA will mail the transcript by USPS for free (even to an overseas address).  If you need the transcripts expedited or sent through Fedex, then there is a fee.

This has been the case since 2013, when UCLA instituted a [one-time document fee](https://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Fees-Residence/Fee-Descriptions/Other-Campus-Based-Fees) \- this fee is designed to cover the cost of transcripts that a student (or former student) will request over the course of their lifetime.

"it isn't paid by units.  summer they give you aid based on how many units you're taking, but not necessarily solely based on ""you're taking x units so we're giving you (and anyone else with a potentially different financial background) y dollars.""

financial aid calculation is essentially mostly based on need, BUT some forms of financial aid like calgrants require you to take at least 12 units per quarter (full time student status).  

one of my friends was taking 36 units in one quarter, and he wasn't charged any differently that quarter.  i think your financial aid status only changes if you breach the 218 unit maximum, which people usually don't do.",1609377112,1,0

it's essentially what you would expect of a spanish placement test; there's listening, writing, and conjugation/grammar.  if you pass that part they could place you in span3, but you could also attempt to do the exemption exam to get it over with. i think what most people underestimate after taking HS spanish (\~3 years) is the speaking part because you need to be able to converse about something given a random prompt.  the placement test is just a suggestion, so if you're confident in spanish but havent passed the exemption exam, probably do span3 but if you aren't confident period do span2.",1609376529,1,0

I think you‚Äôre talking about the max units you can take for your respective college. Engineering can take up to 21 units while Letters and Sciences can take up to 19 without petitions.

"retake it.  100%.  there's a certain amount of units that you can retake, and although the original grade will show on your transcript, UCLA won't count the original grade when they calculate your GPA.  i think the retake units are like 12 units, if you want more info talk to an actual counselor, not a peer mentor.  i've gotten unreliable info from some peer mentors so i always insist to see a counselor (not that all of them are super amazing but they should know more about units and dropping/retaking). 

you can also talk to a counselor about taking a quarter off for your mental health if you need it.  a lot of people on reddit and a lot of people i've spoken to have said it's the best thing they've done for yourself.  before making the final decision to take a quarter off, also speak to the financial aid office if you need to. 

if it comes to a point where your mental health is really bad at the end of the quarter, and you know there's no way to even pass the class, just withdraw.  i've had to withdraw due to health problems partially caused by school.  you will probably be able to explain to whatever employer or grad school what was going on if you need to.  having multiple withdrawals probably won't look the best, though so use the withdrawals sparingly.",1609373324,1,0

"Hey, I would heavily advise against buying this. It‚Äôs an older generation product that has been previously used. If you can squeeze out a bit more money then I would recommend you buy a refurbished or open box newer gen (regular) iPad, an android tablet like the Samsung galaxy tab ($120-200) or wait until the rumored iPad air comes out for the current generation to lower in value. 

The problem I have with this one is that it‚Äôs only 16gb which may be too little for what we need in our daily lives. If you end up buying a separate hard drive for it, it may cost $40+ and be a huge inconvenience. The recommendations above come at memory sizes that will serve you better for storing school files and related apps. Not to mention that the product you have listed is an older generation product that may not be compatible with certain apps and features and has a slower processor. It is also listed as grade B instead of A which makes me think that it likely has noticeable cosmetic defects. 

There are other reasons why like the camera, screen size, etc that I would also list as disadvantages for this model but really the reasons above are the most relevant to using an iPad for school.",1599441128,1,0
