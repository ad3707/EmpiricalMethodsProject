Untrained policing is what is wrong with this situation. It‚Äôs not objectively a racist act. Untrained police = unnecessary death and minorities represent criminal populations because of generations of low socio-economic status. Which was caused by redlining and other forms of systemic racism. It will take many more generations for this population to rise out of poverty because of the low economic mobility of the United States. Furthermore, economic mobility is not a linear rate, it becomes exponentially harder the closer you are to poverty.

"Just actually asked a friend in law school about if this is a valid lawsuit. In this case, the rules WERE pretty clear‚Äî it‚Äôs against Massachusetts guidelines, too. The argument most likely doesn‚Äôt have any legal standing because it‚Äôs irrelevant how the school characterized the students, and they DID break the terms of the contract. Even if they were trying to say this is ‚Äúdefamation,‚Äù that would only apply if they released the names of the students, which they did not. 

It seems like the lawyer for the students is trying to argue that the terms of the contract were unclear, but it really doesn‚Äôt seem like this was the case with this specific rule, even if OTHER rules for NUin may have been vague. The legal case would only refer to the specific term in question. 

The only thing could be breach of contract for Northeastern (as the contract between students and their university is: student provides tuition, university provides education), but they can easily argue that the students breached their own contract first, which makes Northeastern‚Äôs breach valid. 

So it‚Äôs almost 100% not going to go to trial, but it‚Äôs very likely that they WILL get some money from settling (as it costs Northeastern money to fight the case, and settling might save them money overall).",1599951299,2,0

"I don't think it's too light on the CS classes, the core of CS/Bio is similar to the core classes of a CS major. You still need to take Fundies 1 and 2, OOD, Software Development, Algo, and Theory of Comp plus at least one other CS elective. Then you take an integrative class (bioinformatics 1 makes sense). Personally I will have room for 2 or 3 more electives past the requirements and will probably take Bioinformatics 2 and another CS elective.

For Bio I had to take inquiries, Gen Chem for Bio, Orgo 1 and 2, Genetics and Molecular Bio, Bio Project Lab, and will need to take Biochemistry and Bio capstone. Plus 2 bio electives.

I'm on my first co-op right now, it's a pretty standard cs co-op. I think most CS/Bio majors aren't that interested in the research/pre-med track (I assume) so to me it makes sense to go for CS co-ops then after you graduate look for CS jobs in the medical/bio research sector.",1599932969,2,0

"As someone who has bounced around through several majors and ended up in DS + BNS, I have to disagree with everyone else here. 

For AI, a DS path is much more relevant to your career in terms of acquiring useful skills than CS. I know they overhauled the DS track this past year and it actually looks even better than the one I am on at the moment.

Other benefits of being on the BNS track are that the combined major makes you appealing to pharmaceutical companies which are currently investing heavily in computer vision (basically let me walk into a job at J&amp;J). And there are plenty of Bio and Chem + ML work study jobs that pay really well compared to the more typical IT jobs you can get with the non combined.

Edwin is solid. He‚Äôll let you know exactly what to expect for the exams. His teaching style is fast paced if I remember correctly, but still thorough. The textbook he uses for electronics is really good too, so that helps.

&gt; It is a complete joke, you learn about Jira tickets and UML diagrams from an elderly professor who doesn‚Äôt actually know how to code and reads slides that he downloaded off the internet. It is a free A (it must be one of the lowest workload 4000 levels possible) but you will lose brain cells.

I just read the the trace report comments and I think they are accurate descriptions of how I felt the course was: it is not a very good or well thought out course at all, and there are a lot of ways to make the course better that probably won't be done. But like I said above, it is not very much work and with only a little effort you can get an A. Combine that with my opinion that there aren't any better options (or other options at all!) for software-based CE tech electives, and I would just recommend taking it and getting over with one tech elective.

I agree with this comment from the trace report:

&gt; My main frustration is that this course has so much potential because it is so open-ended, but it sort of feels like a culmination of the disappointment that I have felt time and time again in this department. It also is frustrating because if history tells me anything, nothing will be done about this course after several semesters of students complaining about it.",1606181210,2,0

"May be an unpopular opinion given the current panic about fundies grades now but in no way is fundies 1 a weed out course in the same way other colleges handle their intro to cs courses. If you pay attention in lecture and go to office hours when stuck I dont think you will have trouble. Not to mention in the spring and summer the infamous exams wont be written by Ben Lerner (love that man but those exams were rough) so its unlikely to end up like it did this semester.

To answer your question directly yes it is probably easier but note that the goals of the courses are different. DS intro series is very practical, while Fundies is notoriously abstract. IMO fundies gives a better foundation for programming in general but hey if you‚Äôre only ever going to only use Python, DS isn‚Äôt a bad substitute!

In the end though, your degree, major, and GPA only really affect those first couple jobs. Beyond that nobody cares too much.

Even if it's not for US News, some rankings use loan repayment as a metric, which this would also raise as far as external metrics are concerned.

Beyond those, the indirect effect of reducing loan load on students is more success in the future, which indirectly will affect many ranking indicators.

Basically, the 0% APR and 15% off principle seem much more sensical when it's Northeastern essentially paying their way up the rankings. The amount they will actually eat here is chump change compared to that value.",1609348152,1,0

For the main project, it was a group project where we had to code a plagiarism detector. It focused on both the front and backend. The professors and TAs were very helpful and I honestly recommend the class!

I also took DS 4200 (Information Presentation and Visualization). It was a pretty easy course. The assignments were pretty straightforward and the second half of the course mainly focused on the service learning project, where you design a data visualization for a partner (like an organization or professor).

"The advice everyone else has posted here is great, so I don't really want to repeat what they've said if possible.

As a now fourth year CS major who resonates with your post over the first couple years of college, the things that I have learned that have helped me the most are

1. Don't compare yourself to others. This is really just general advice, but in the context of social relationships everyone is different - and thinking about things you don't have is only going to make you feel worse. Try to avoid this! Focus on what you can change! 
2. Just get out of your dorm! Being cooped inside for days at a time alone, doing HW or whatever else, does nothing good for your emotional wellbeing and mental health. Go outside, go on a walk, go visit somewhere, whatever - even if it is by yourself, a change of scenery does wonders for me when I'm down.
3. Just ask to hang out! One of my personal theories on how friendships are formed is simply repeated interactions with people you get along with. I know it is hard being around people you don't know, but all new relationships have to start with meeting someone you don't know - just take the plunge and ask someone! Like right now before you overthink it - just text an acquaintance if they're doing anything tomorrow. Then if it goes well, do it again. Then again. Etc. Hopefully something comes to it!
4. I'm not sure how this plays out in the pandemic since I'm currently on co-op, but if there are other people in your in person classes - I would recommend going. Chatting with people before and after class in person is a good way to gain acquaintances - and therefore friends as mentioned before.

If you also would just like to talk to someone, feel free to DM me! I am also big of SU and similar shows!",1600918047,2,0

"hey, i‚Äôm a secind year cs major strongly considering going home. I was 200x happier at home, and my classes are hella hard so even though it‚Äôs spoiled, it would be so much easier to just eat the food my parents make for my younger siblings. housing would have been a waste of money, but i‚Äôm sure the therapy i will needing i stay here all alone (i have friends we just don‚Äôt really see each other more than once a week) will start to add up. Yea, you could stay and stick it out and explore. The city will always be here while you‚Äôre in college though. If you have any pets, siblings, or a good relationship with your parents, or something you love (for me it‚Äôs a banh mi place) then honestly it‚Äôs worth considering. It‚Äôs not giving up on anything, it‚Äôs putting yourself first! it will get harder in the winter too, sadly for all of us even the people with friends we don‚Äôt live with. If you live within 3 hours I‚Äôd say go for a week to get a break, if you live far then wait 2 weeks before making a decision.

"A lot of the really important stuff has already been said, but here's my take: provided you cover all the classes you're required to take, schedule around planned co-ops, and graduate on a semester of classes (not co-op), you can do whatever you feel like with your schedule. Initially I was on a 4year/2co-op plan with co-ops scheduled for fall starting my third year, but I've since switched to a 4.5year/3co-op plan on the spring cycle. All it took to change this was a brief meeting with my advisor who confirmed my switch to spring co-ops. Note that I'm in Khoury College of CS and things might be different for other majors.

Additionally, though my advisor and I wrote up a plan of action--- basically a big schedule with prospective classes written up for each semester up to graduation--- in my first semester, I've deviated from that plan a handful of times during course registration. It's all really very flexible.

Please feel free to dm me or reply if you want to ask anything else :)",1600913677,1,0

"Stop and Shop on Calumet and Tremont, or either Star Market. Note that the Star Market in the Pru doesn't have machines and the one in Fenway I think locked their machines up, but you can still redeem bottles from their customer service people. 

By Massachusetts law, ANY retail business that sells bottles must accept bottle returns of at least the same brand and container size that they sell. In reality, if you try to return your bottles at say, Wollys or CVS, you'll probably be told to F off.

"I felt the same way you felt too at some point during my first year. I have some personal issues regarding past friendships that make me feel insecure around my friends; sometimes I can't help but feel that they're planning to do things without me, even though that is most likely not the case 99% of the time. Despite this, I still made more friends than I'd have expected, and I believe you can too!

I think one way of connecting with your fellow peers more is if you went around your res hall to see if people are working on CS (assuming you're in the CS LLC) and see if you can just jump in and work with them. It sounds like you do know groups of people already, so I say try to balance the time you put into Fundies and the time you spend outside of class.  I'm a CS major myself too, so I understand how it might be extremely time-consuming to do all the assignments. Even if it's just walking with them to the dining hall, it helps to have these small moments and to build your relationships slowly if that's what you need.

Let me know if you need someone to talk to!",1600912308,3,0
