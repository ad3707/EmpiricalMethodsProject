"I would say low. Vast majority of people will never need to code in their lives. Companies utilize people based on their best skills.

"This has happened to me three times within the last month, two times at Target and once on my way to RPCC for surveillance testing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first time, I had stepped away from my roommate to look at the jewelry section at the front (right across from the checkout counters). I was not paying much attention to my surroundings, but then all of a sudden I saw this individual (I'm positive it's the same guy) emerge from the LITTLE GIRL'S CLOTHING SECTION and make a beeline toward me. I tried to ignore him at first, and, like the original post, he acted like he knew me at first and I thought that I had just not recognized him. He asked how I was, what I like to do for fun, and, eventually, my name. When I told him, he gave me his name and said,""You know how they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder?"" ""Yes...?"" ""Well you are looking very beautiful today."" At this point, I was visibly uncomfortable and he was well within the 6 foot bubble. I quickly and awkwardly thanked him, and retreated into the adjacent section to find my roommate, check out, and leave as quickly as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next time, about a week later, I was back in Target standing in the dollar section at the front of the store with my roommate. We were in separate aisles, so I was isolated but she was only a few feet away and was able to see the majority of the interaction. I bent down to look at something, and then when I stood up he was in my aisle right beside me. He greeted me exactly the same way as before, with a familiar ""Hey, how are you"" but still proceeded to ask me my name despite our previous interaction. This only reinforces the idea that he does this to so many women that he can't possibly keep track of all their names. I was freaked out at this point and my roommate rescued me by entering the aisle with the cart and I said a quick goodbye as we started to walk toward the grocery section. I glanced behind me as we walked and he was following us into the store. We ducked into the tampon aisle hoping that he would not follow, and he did not. I thought it was safe, so I broke off from my roommate and went to grab something from another aisle. As I was choosing a product, he approached me again in the same aisle, and started his whole script anew. I was over it at this point and just said hello and goodbye before actively weaving through aisles in such a way that he could not see me until I was back in the crowded section with my roommate. We got our groceries and headed back to the cashiers, but my roommate quickly pushed me into a side aisle and told me that he was behind us. He continued past, but I was really terrified at that point. Eventually we saw him leave the store and left quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later, I was entering the RPCC upper doors to get COVID tested when I met this individual as he was walking out the door. He started to give the EXACT same speech, but I pushed past the doors and did not engage. Thankfully, he did not follow.

&amp;#x200B;

It is insane watching all these other women give their stories where they have endured so much more than I did at this man's hand, but I felt it was necessary to add my experience to the list in order to emphasize the breadth of his influence.",1605206823,3,0

Regardless, I highly recommend reaching out to professors via cold-email and state your interest in their research. Ask if there are opportunities for undergraduates within their lab.

Also, there are summer research opportunity programs (SROPs), notably Research Opportunities for Undergraduates (REUs).

"You're fine. Seriously. Grad schools care about research experience. So long as you're above some GPA threshold you're fine. That's typically 3.5 (even for top programs), and even then, people from here have gone to top programs with GPAs below 3.5 (of course they had stellar research experience and good letters of rec). Generally, GPA can really only keep you out, not get you in. 

You got a C as a first semester freshman. No one will care. On top of that, it's your first semester *and* it's COVID. That's double the amount of no one caring.

Start getting research experience ASAP. 

What kind of grad school? CS? Physics? 

For CS, a Carnegie Mellon admissions prof said this about grad school admissions. Read the whole document. It's really eye opening:

""When applying to a Ph.D. program in CS, you‚Äôd like your grades in CS and Math and Engineering classes to be about 3.5 out of 4.0, as a rough guideline. It does not help you, in my opinion, to be closer to 4.0 as opposed to 3.5. It‚Äôs a much better idea to spend your time on research than on optimizing your GPA. At CMU the mean GPA of students admitted is over 3.8 (even though we don‚Äôt use grades as a criterion), however students have also been admitted with GPAs below 3.3, since research is what matters, not grades. A GPA of 4.0 alone with no research experience will not get you into any top CS program. Keep in mind that GPAs are evaluated in the context of the undergraduate program. A 3.4 GPA from a topranked CS undergraduate program like CMU counts the same as a 3.8 or 3.9 GPA from a less well-known CS undergraduate program.""

"**We should abolish the EC**, have the national popular vote determine the president. Been thinking about this a lot lately though I'm by no means well informed enough to be authoritative on this topic. Please call me out on improper assumptions and let me know why you think we should keep the EC.

Pros:

* **Everyone's vote counts equally** ... big democracy vibes
* **The minority's votes still contribute to their candidate of choice.**  Currently, if a state leans heavily in one direction or another, the minority's votes have no impact on the presidential election because of the way electoral votes are assigned (winner takes all in most states). Examples: republicans in California, democrats in Alabama, etc. Instead of abolishing the EC, instituting ranked-choice voting could alleviate this issue as well.
* **More people might vote!** Directly follows from the previous point, if people feel like their votes count, they might be more likely to vote.
* **Campaigns for president will no longer be able to win by focusing solely on swing states.** Currently the votes of the majority of Americans are taken completely for granted by both parties. This is fundamentally undemocratic, and leads to candidates tailoring their platforms and policies toward the small minority of the national population that actually has the power to decide the election. 
   * Example: fracking was considered a major issue during this election. However, this wasn't because it is a controversial issue nationally or effects a large segment of the population. Fracking was a major issue because both camps believed Pennsylvania would be the decisive state. Even within PA, the fracking industry is only prominent in a few counties in the northeast and southwest corners of the state. 
   * With the current system, neither political party has any incentive to care about people who wouldn't contribute to their path to victory, or whose votes are already assumed to be in their favor.
* **No more minority rule.** The current ruling party represents a minority of the people.
* **De-politicization of industries such as agriculture, energy, etc.** Currently, many industries are heavily politicized, partly because the people who work in them make up powerful voting blocks in their states. Farmers, union workers, etc. These states also tend to be swing states (WI, MI, PA, etc.) so there's a lot of political energy directed towards winning their votes. However, this politicization of vital industries is damaging because politicians make objectively bad moves to appeal to those people. 
   * Republican reliance on these states and industries has adverse effects: subsidies for unsustainable and environmentally damaging agriculture, subsidies for dying energy industries such as coal, politicians who are tools of corporate intersts--many of which harm the people of their states. 
   * The Biden campaign was clear that they wouldn't ban fracking despite the fact that we should probably be transitioning away from fossil fuels. 
   * Establishment Democrats have similar issues with the financial sector and other big business interests. 
   * Eliminating the EC could help reduce the politicization of food and energy production because those **states** wouldn't be important anymore--the focus would shift to winning individual people's votes. Winning over coal miners or farmers would just mean getting their votes, not all the electoral votes that come with their state. 
   * These industries are essential to the success of the nation and everyone should be interested in their future. However, they have been heavily influenced by partisanship because the states where food and energy are produced are also vital for presidential election strategies.
* **Both parties will need to make a good-faith attempt to appeal to the majority of Americans**, rather than engineering paths to win while neglecting the geographical regions of the country that historically don't like them. The EC is a tool of political division and facilitates polarization.

Cons:

* **Elections become significantly more complicated, and more difficult to win.** The number of potential paths to victory would increase drastically. If electoral votes are off the table, support in individual states becomes less important. Instead of having to convince 51% of the population in swing states while relying on a base of states your party is historically strong in, you would have to convince 51% of the national voting population. The Republican party might need to expand their current base (which is a minority of the voting population, see 2016 popular vote margin). Depending on how that goes, the Democratic party would also need to broaden its base as well. Ideally both parties would be encouraged to compete for everyone's votes.
* **A loss of power for small states and rural communities.** Currently, the electoral college vests enormous power in mostly rural states with small populations. A Wyoming voter is ""worth"" many Californians, giving Wyoming residents a lot of (relative) power in electing the president. Abolishing the EC would undo this power, and potentially lead to both parties abandoning the rural areas of the country to concentrate on densely populated urban and suburban areas. 
   * As of the last census, roughly 20% of the US population is considered rural, while 95% of the land area is considered rural. This number is expected to drop as more people leave rural America. As mentioned in the pros section about minority rule, a lot of the relationships between government, industry, and rural states exist for political reasons. 
   * If farmers, or union workers cease to be a powerful voting block because of the elimination of the EC, much of the support/attention they currently receive could disappear. I don't know what the numbers look like regarding how many votes are represented by farmers, unions, etc., but there would still be 20% of the national vote to be won from rural areas so appealing to rural voters could still be worthwhile.
* **Rural vs. urban divide could worsen**. Follows from the previous point. Less power in rural areas, increased division between rural and urban as parties look to appeal more exclusively to urban voters who represent the majority.

You might be thinking (if you've made it this far) ""isn't this great for the Democrats but bad for the Republicans?"" The way things currently stand, probably. But this would likely only be in the short term, since the Republican party would probably change to become competitive. Frankly, neither party currently serves the people. Change is probably for the best. But isn't this unfair to the Republicans, who've remained competitive all this time despite changing demographics and population movement? Maybe. But the current system is unfair to all voters who don't live in swing states or are political minorities in their own states. Regardless of political affiliation, everyone's vote should count. The Electoral College, originally meant to preserve the balance of power between the states, risks becoming a tool by which the minority rules over the majority. And it has roots in slavery but that's a whole different thing..",1604521729,3,0

"You can't prescribe your reason for voting Trump on the millions that did.

At the point where your vote went to someone who refuses to denounce supremacists, I'd argue that your priorities on racial dynamics in this country are wacky.

However, he isn't openly racist, hasn't refused to denounce white supremacist groups, he hasn't had a vast history of sexually violating both adult women and underage women (Trump has said several times about his history with women ""on the younger side""), he hasn't been associated (to my knowledge) with rapists and pedos like Jeffrey Epstein, in recent history he hasn't been purposefully sewing division, hasn't been lying to his audience about COVID, and has an actual plan to address the COVID crisis. 

I didn't vote for Biden because of what he is, I voted for him because of what he isn't.

Much of my family voted for Trump, and I've watched/read stories about people who vote for Trump. Trump has made farmers like him because of his stance on water politics (lowering water prices/restrictions, for better or for worse).  Trump speaks to uneducated whites because they think he stands up for the little guy who has been ignored by Dems (and the Dems have ignored uneducated whites, which is shitty). Trump won Florida because of the agrarian vote and because of Cubans and Venezuelans who are afraid of Biden being a socialist (even though that's completely untrue) and bc they like Trump's stance on immigration (even though Trump has done little to nothing about immigration other than enforcing laws already passed by the Obama administration -- the kids in cages/immoral immigration laws were present far before Trump ever became president). My grandparents, and people like my grandparents who are voting for Trump, only receive their news through Fox News and refuse to believe anything that opposes the ideologies spouted from Fox. My grandparents and my aunt and uncle are brainwashed. I was a Trumper in 2016 because I was brainwashed into thinking he stood up for the little guy, when all he was, was a classless populist who couldn't give a damn if my grandparents died from Covid or not, as long as he stayed in power.",1604512458,2,0

"Ahh so you operate all on emotion. 

&gt;You can, however, look at statistics, and at the recent events happening esp over the summer, and see that Black people are disproportionately targeted

Proof - give me the statistics, cite your sources. What I see is conservatives like to use certain statistics and disregard others and liberals like to do the exact same thing to reaffirm their confirmation bias. You aren't giving me the full picture. But regardless you still haven't told me how this instance with Derek Chauvin SPECIFCALLY was racially motivated. I brought up his record of police brutality and it was against all different races. He had a history of violence - Klobuchar (a DEMOCRAT who endorsed JOE BIDEN) didn't prosecute him, one can argue this was kinda her fault for being negligent. 

&gt;you can't prove something like that

And exactly. If you can't prove it, don't say it. What happened to George Floyd was very terrible, everyones in agreement with that. We need police reform - conservatives believe in more funding, liberals believe in defunding and most African Americans want police to retain local presence. In FACT only 19% of people want LESS police presence.
https://news.gallup.com/poll/316571/black-americans-police-retain-local-presence.aspx

&gt; No one is gonna come out and say ""Oh I shot someone because I am racist"" 

Yes many people do actually and they take pride in it. Margaret Sanger - founder of planned parenthood -was a proud eugenic. I'm assuming you mean many NORMAL people don't but I'd argue Derek chauvin was a psychopath. 

&gt;Its about voting people in who will actually try to reform the system, and who understand that black lives matter, which trump does not.

Conservatives don't believe in shutting down the government. Thats a fact. They believe in the threat of covid and that older people / people with pre-existing conditions should stay home and safe. But they don't believe young people and able bodied people should be forced to stay home. There's a huge problem with mental health now ESPECIALLY with younger people since covid started, people don't have jobs, LESS people are going in to check if they have cancer and etc. Covid has a lot of side effects that aren't often discussed. Yes getting covid is bad but so are all these side effects of shutting the country down. 

&gt;Trump supporters are the ones who went out to protest a literal virus....

This annoys me because you don't realize your own bias. This is like me saying liberals want communism lmfao. Yes there are QANON people that happen to be conservative. Yes there are communists that happen to be liberal. But they aren't the majority, they just get more attention because of how polarized the country is. Pinning all 200k deaths on Trump is just so wild to me as an independent. Did you know Andrew Cuomo sent ELDERLY patients that were DIAGNOSED with covid back into nursing homes to get treated?  https://www.businessinsider.com/cuomo-nursing-home-deaths-coronavirus-covid-independent-investigation-death-2020-8
No one could've expected the magnitude of covid. And these deaths aren't 100% because of Trump. Blue states and red states both struggled and actually blue states got hit waaay harder but I'd argue its because of density in the states.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; If conservatives don't want people to get abortions, they should advocate for free birth control, NOT for planned parenthood to close

Conservatives advocate for that, the problem with planned parenthood is that its the leading abortion clinic. 97% of their operations are abortions. Let me guess you're the type to ALSO believe ICE only deports people and should be abolished or defunded? If you do hold this belief btw they also do other things just like planned parenthood does.

&gt; If the fetus cannot survive outside of my body, is it really alive?
Yes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A16gzm9eaa8 

&gt; If conservatives were ""prolife"" like they claim, they would care about the kids that literally GO MISSING at the border

They do. I don't know where you're getting that conservatives don't. Trump said many times they were trying to find their parents but the parents aren't reporting for them. They can't find their parents not because they separated their parents from their kids and then lost the parents and kids. They can't find the parents because coyotes and other gangs bring them over without their parents by the way.

&gt;lets look at your ""doctor"" argument. If anyone is in the health profession and doesn't think that everyone deserves a right to free healthcare, the right to SURVIVE without drowning in medical bills, they shouldn't be in that profession

???????????????? lmao. I have no idea what this argument is debunking. Your argument is that conservatives are not entitled to you're body. So through your logic you are not entitled to other peoples money. They worked for it. Doctors work 16 hours shifts to get that bread. Using YOUR argument NOT MINE YOURS, you're not entitled to it. I can throw other reasons for why taxing the shit out of high income earners is a dumb idea but I really don't need to. My point right now is pointing out the hypocrisies that lie within your argument.",1604135908,1,0

--No one is gonna come out and say ""Oh I shot someone because I am racist"", you can't prove something like that. You can, however, look at statistics, and at the recent events happening esp over the summer, and see that Black people are disproportionately targeted. Its not about ""realizing that police brutality is an issue"". Its about voting people in who will actually try to reform the system, and who understand that black lives matter, which trump does not. 

Okay, polls say conservatives think covid is real. But isn't trump the one who holds INDOOR rallies, does not order a national mask mandate, and reopened the economy way too quickly? Trump supporters are the ones ATTENDING these rallies. Most people who are anti-mask are trump supporters. Trump supporters are the ones who went out to protest a literal virus.... They can think its real, but they don't act like it, and they support a man who does not gaf about the 200k+ lives that have been lost because of it. 

If conservatives don't want people to get abortions, they should advocate for free birth control, NOT for planned parenthood to close(which does way more than abortions). Everyone has the right to life? If the fetus cannot survive outside of my body, is it really alive? And lets not go into the fact that you basically implied survivors of rape shouldn't get an abortion. wow. If conservatives were ""prolife"" like they claim, they would care about the kids that literally GO MISSING at the border that trump gives zero shits about. But no, they just enjoy having control over women's bodies. And lets look at your ""doctor"" argument. If anyone is in the health profession and doesn't think that everyone deserves a right to free healthcare, the right to SURVIVE without drowning in medical bills, they shouldn't be in that profession. And the thing between trump supporters and people voting for Biden is that the ones that are voting for trump support him no matter what. I would never call myself a ""Biden supporter"". I acknowledge that he is the lesser of the two evils. However, Trump supporters do not do that, they don't acknowledge all the racist things he has said/done. Thats what gets me. For me, if someone I supported said something racist, I would never call myself a supporter of them.",1604127603,1,0

"Thank you for your opinion! I actually posted this because I wasn't sure if I'm doing worse than other classmates/spending more time than others since being online made it so hard to meet and talk to fellow classmates and get an estimate. I haven't taken any longer than the average time on all the other assignments, and I only studied an extensive amount not cause I didn't understand the topic but because I wanted to give it my best/really liked studying, so I didn't question my abilities/talent before the current assignment. It's a new one this year so I guess I'll have to wait on what the average hours/grade would be to really get a sense of where I am. That being said, I was wondering if 40 hours is a concerning amount of time whatever the assignment is, so thank you for answering that!

I actually went to a crazy high school where it was actually much harder than any course in Cornell so far, so I definitely understand what you mean by competing with those with talent or aptitude. I was actually really amazed after getting to Cornell to find out that you can do well if you study hard enough. (My high school's average was always under 60/100 cause they made it extremely hard and impossible to succeed unless you really had talent.) 

So I guess that's where my anxiety comes from--I had a great experience in terms of academic life this semester but I was wondering if hard work only pays in the intro level courses and won't go a long way if I pursue a CS major. 

I tried many different areas of study and it took me a long journey to get here and I have a very strong reason/motivation to pursue CS, but I wanted to know--\*DO you have to be talented to be a CS major or can hard work compensate?\*

So I'm glad to hear your opinion that having a passion may not be worth the struggle. I will keep that in mind as I go along.

"Hi everyone! I am very interested in applying to Cornell‚Äôs M.Eng. program in systems engineering. I graduated from Texas A&amp;M a couple of years ago and I‚Äôm looking into applying for the fall of 2021. In preparing my application, I ran into some questions that I was hoping someone could answer. Any response would be greatly appreciated!

1. How competitive is the application process for the on-campus program vs the distance-learning program?

2. I saw that many of the students in the program are employed by large companies that have established relationship with the systems program. Are there fewer slots allotted for students who are not associated with a company-leadership program?

3. Is there an interview process?",1602036660,1,0

"I have lived here awhile but am not a student, and feel pretty good about being able to walk near students and researchers and teachers and staff, with all their energy and knowing and specific interests, attentions and distractions, burdens and highlights. I trek the same routes as they, and in the older buildings, the same steps of many thinkers before, have been intrigued by the same views and sometimes by possibly the same little construction errors--like cracks in the tile in the barton bathroom or those giant glass cupboards in the plant science building (how long have those objects been there?). 

Try talking to some people that have been around--maybe there are more spots in the physical world or some books that you've never heard about that still sit in the same spot in a library that once amazed them.",1602035771,1,0

"It's sometimes called ""black ice"" because it blends in with the asphalt of a road. Another name, ""glare ice,"" better describes what OP is saying. It's transparent and you can only tell it's there from the *glare* of the sun or other lights reflecting off of it.

Just keep a look out, wear sensible shoes/boots, and avoid running right after a freeze. You will find it more in the shadows of buildings where it isn't melting. Weather reports will also often warn you if a storm was likely to produce black ice, and freezing rain (winter rain that quickly freezes when it lands) will almost always make it.",1605714408,5,0
