2. i haven't actually done any research in mathematics because most of the undergrad stuff is not the stuff i'm interested in (i like smooth manifolds, probability, and dynamics) but here's a list of current proposed research projects you can do an independent reading on: [https://www.math.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-research-projects/index.htm](https://www.math.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-research-projects/index.html)l

Absent a formal complaint they can pretty much delete whatever body cam footage they want. They are not accountable to anyone, certainly not students.",1603096470,1,0
"From your perspective, how big does EPD need to be need to safely secure the entire Evanston area? From public statistics Evanston has a large police department for a town its size. So there is a point in downsizing.

But also bear in mind that Northwestern's campus itself is not small. And in an emergency scenario, the campus itself has a lot of surface area to cover (examples are the libraries, Tech, etc). I'm no public security expert, but in shooter events (and even in the 2018 hoax) one of the prominent issues is pinpointing the perpetrator(s)' location. Ofc if you have more manpower you can cover more ground and save more lives in such scenarios. 

Even in the scenario that NUPD is gone you'd still likely have police patrols on campus by EPD. Why? Because to be able to properly respond to such events, police would need to be familiar with campus buildings, routes, etc. Also response time to other emergency events, etc.",1603089904,1,0
"My hot take is that there is a lot of anger spilling onto campus right now, in part because of racial inequalities in policing, but in part because people are upset at NU for ‚Äúunrelated issues.‚Äù NU has botched its covid response through and through (firing workers, last-minute plan switching, inadequate testing, etc...), so Morty isn‚Äôt very popular these days. This enables people taking action against a school they just don‚Äôt see supporting *them.*",1603089897,1,0
"Someone mentioned that in another thread and the numbers worked out such that black students were 1.65 times as likely to be stopped by campus police, but this is a perfect example of something that we can change due to us having control over the actions and protocols of nupd. Also I'd be willing to bet that if we didnt have police presence on campus, i.e. relying on epd to come anytime they were needed, crime on campus would legitimately go up. Plus, I dont think it's realistic to call epd anytime theres some small issue to be handled, like I've seen campus police in my dorm building a few times in the two quarters I was at NU for things like a missing student or dispute turned somewhat violent and they just needed to come kind of yell at the students.",1603087922,1,0

"I know now I'm going to regret engaging but if one fake incident a couple of years ago is the reason to have 2 very armed police departments then this isn't a very good argument. If this is the only reason you feel we need cops, then we definitely can cut the NUPD and massively defund EPD so they can come for that incredibly infrequent situation.",1603087636,1,0
"Pretty sure the Daily published some statistics a while back that showed disproportionate stops of black/brown students by NUPD. I can‚Äôt say that EPD would be better, but I also can‚Äôt say that EPD would have as much of a presence on campus as NUPD if NUPD were to disband.",1603087251,1,0
"Have a much faster response time for one thing, and already be familiar with the campus and have training for this exact situation in this exact location. In general though I'll be honest, I dont really get the whole abolish nupd thing because I dont think nupd is comparable to a normal police department. For instance, one of the main goals of the abolish police movement is to reallocate resources to make crime no longer necessary for people, but nupd primarily protects against people who are unaffiliated with nu and may want to harm students for whatever reason.  So it's not like reallocating resources can address the root cause of the problem in this case. Also as far as police departments go, nupd is incredibly unproblematic and we have complete oversight with them, so I'm not sure why we'd want to get rid of that and replace it with epd or cpd. That, and that there are so few recorded cases of nupd acting inappropriately. Like dont get me wrong, if there are problems then we should fix them, but the reason why we _can_ fix them in the first place is because they're essentially under our jurisdiction. So idk.",1603087123,1,0
"the petition circulated by the organizers of the recent protests (I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs who you‚Äôre referring to) demanded the disbanding of NUPD but only ‚Äúcutting ties‚Äù with EPD.

"I am 100% in support of the greater goal of defunding the police and reallocating funds towards social services that are proven to prevent crime. Whatever the literature suggests keeps people safest.

I present the following concerns though, and would appreciate some feedback!(with relevant credible sources)

1) Wouldn‚Äôt the lowest risk plan be to implement major funding/support for the social programs (mental health, education services, drug rehab services etc) first, and reduce crime before getting rid of the police?

2) NU is not a bubble. The crime that occurs at/around NU campus is largely driven by social injustices woven into Chicago, Evanston, and surrounding areas. And there is a LOT of money on that campus, from students to facilities. Thus, would it be fair to say that Reducing crime at/around NU would require a MAJOR overhaul and revamp of crime preventative policies in Chicago and Evanston? And if so, why is there so much stress on abolishing NUPD? That seems like it is missing half of the puzzle piece, right? 

3) NU is driven by money and their reputation. Not only are there federal grants to be upheld but donors and parents to please. Like i said, I‚Äôm all for divestment and investment, but I can assure you my dad would not have let me ED NU, committing to paying over $300k, without NU at least giving the impression that they are keeping crime out of NU. And I‚Äôm sure tons of parents feel the same!  So what is the plan to reconcile the goal to abolish NUPD with NU always trying to win over the most money and best students?",1603083769,1,0

"&gt; I never said one group was as bad as the other. I said that neither group has their hands clean. You keep trying to downplay the actions of one group to make them seem as clean as possible. That is dishonest.

Yeah, that's what I thought. Also, no, I don't think the protesters are ""clean."" The mask was burned, some trash was burned, a window was smashed, some shit got tagged, and I assume the smashed Chase bank sign was a protester. So some property got trashed. Meanwhile, Breitbart and the cops (not sure exactly which you're talking about) advocate for or actively bring about the destruction of actual human lives. Simplifying this to ""neither group has their hands clean"" is dishonest.

&gt; Stop trying to claim the cops out of NU group just ""writes letters to incarcerated folk.""

I never did. I was referring to the Rogers Park Letter Writing Coalition, the people they retweeted. 

&gt; They are openly advocating for death. The good of writing letters does not an argument make that they aren't a violent group.

Funny syntax does not a better argument make. Graffiti and vandalism don't justify clubs and shields. ""More dead pigs"" is not a death threat. Grow up.

&gt; I do not think that setting fires and calling for death is either a good way to achieve those goals nor a way those goals will actually happen. 

Guess what? Neither do I. That's why I don't do it. But as a pretty privileged dude, I'm mad about the shit happening at the hands of cops everywhere and I can't imagine how angry I'd be if I were directly impacted. So I can see why someone would wanna break shit or burn shit, and I don't think they deserve to beaten, hauled off to jail, or killed for it. And sure, this is bad optics and won't convince admin or whatever. Neither did the petition and months of emails and meetings. I think NU admin are too scared to make any meaningful change, regardless of what students do. That doesn't mean I think they should give up.

&gt; Stop trying to make it seem like anyone that doesn't agree with setting fires is some right-wing extremist.

Did I call you a right-winger? If you care so much about what I think, I think it's concerning that so many liberals are more concerned about a stupid piece of cloth than the safety of their fellow students.

"I feel like a lot of people have been commenting that the police are useless bc crime still happens even tho they exist. I think this is misguided bc like, crime isn't a binary impact like you can have more or less of it and having more is bad and having less is good. Maybe the cops didn't stop *you* from being mugged, but their presence deterred would-have-been crimes and stopped a bunch of other people from getting mugged. 

Just like economically speaking, if you make something easier to do and there's benefit to be gained from doing it, then people will do it more often. Theoretically, (and this is like not reflective of our conscious thought patterns but holds true often enough that ""on average in the long run"" human behavior trends toward this) somebody about to commit a crime weighs the potential benefits of committing it (getting money or valuable shit in this case) against the potential costs (getting sent to jail, arrested, etc etc) and then tries to make a judgment about what the expected value of that action would be to determine whether they'll be better off it they commit the crime. So, I do think we need to have *some* sort of way of keeping criminals accountable to achieve a deterrence effect and do think crime would overall increase on campus w zero police, but it also probably wouldn't be like hell raining down from the sky necessarily. 

That being said, without a way to report and record crimes, we'd never be able to track how much crime increases in a world absent police.",1603075283,3,0

I‚Äôm no master statistician but the math seems simple enough. Still, other ppl putting out stats might be doing more sophisticated things than I am.

Another prevalent concern I've read is that NUPD is one of the (relatively) least harmful police forces out there compared to EPD and CPD, and that NU owns and has complete control over them, so we can morph them into anything we want.

Is it understandable why this backlash occurs? I mean, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. But I was replying to the idea that if you don't disrespect other people's existence, then you will be ok.

"The problem is that it is difficult to NOT mention identity politics when we get into this, because my identity has become politicized. I wish it wasn't, because I would like to vote based on issues other than 'which party might deny me healthcare due to my identity', but at this point I can't actually do that. It is in a sense privileged to be able to ignore identity politics. I agree they're not ideal. But I entirely disagree that they're not objective. There is no objective way for me to reply explaining why members of certain groups take people voting for Trump personally WITHOUT mentioning how I, as a member of a certain group, take it personally. The very statement  of ""politics has become 'I think this group hates me and if you support them you hate me'"" isn't subjective, because you're assuming the opinion of a mass group of people and then saying that I, replying to you as a member of said group, am making it difficult by introducing my identity.

For the record, you're totally allowed to disagree with me and not be transphobic. You don't need to walk on eggshells.

"We also tend to view the political spectrum as a straight line. If one is not left, they must be right. Yet many of the issues we face today are not this black and white.",1605123356,2,0
"I agree with everything you‚Äôve said; I do still think this is a problem though. When politics becomes as personal as it has in modern times, political disagreement is often considered some form of a personal attack on one‚Äôs beliefs or identity. For instance, replying to this comment became 1000x more difficult because you introduced your personal experiences, and so I find it hard to respond to the ideas without also responding to the sentiment, even if that is not my intention. Even if I were to reply completely objectively based only on the ideas behind your comment, there is still the chance that you take my response the wrong way, or maybe just a piece of it, but that is enough to ruin the actual debate and devolve into identity politics and accusations of something-ism, which is often a way of saying ‚ÄúI have determined you hate me/my people and so your ideas are no longer valid‚Äù. At this point, 9 times out of 10 the discussion is over, both parties are upset, and both are even more divided than they were before the discussion started.

I think it is also true that we have developed a sort of ‚Äúvictimhood culture‚Äù where people prefer to paint themselves as a victim to in an effort to gain credibility. For instance, because I‚Äôm not a black woman, I cannot possibly imagine what a black woman has to face in her day to day life, and so I cannot debate with her because she will always be right about her own experiences. This example also makes it clear how this victimhood culture transitions quickly to subjective arguments, which are nearly impossible to address (as described above). 

I think the abortion debate is a good example of my aforementioned claims. It is commonly said that pro-life advocates are only pro-life in an effort to control women‚Äôs bodies. This makes women the victim and pushes the subjective argument that the pro-life person hates women and so that person is not worth talking to. Yet, there are arguments for pro-life that do not focus on this aspect at all. Many pro-choice people will never hear them. 

I strongly believe that political discussions are more fruitful if both parties maintain objectiveness. The introduction of subjectivity in such discussions makes it difficult to disagree with the idea while still respecting the person, as the two are often so closely linked. I believe that if political discussions were more objective in nature, we would have less hatred/claims of hatred and more actual debate.

For the record, I do not support Trump. I am also not pro-life. Furthermore, I support the right of transgender people to 1) exist and 2) thrive.

"The thing about that last paragraph is that generally from our perspective it does feel like that. Trump, for example, ended a non-discrimination policy for trans people. So it's now legal, if I want medical care, for me to be denied because of my gender identity. This is obviously pretty frightening because if I'm in an emergency, I don't want to jump around from doctor to doctor finding one who will treat me. And granted, in Illinois I'm unlikely to find one who WON'T, but in the rural Midwest where I'm from, I'm extremely likely to.

Now, nearly no one who voted for trump this go around really paid attention to that, and it's certainly not WHY they voted for him. But it's difficult to look at someone and know, the reason why I can be medically discriminated against is because of people like them who voted the way they did. For that reason, it is difficult if not impossible for me to be friends with someone who voted for Trump because regardless of their intent, they have harmed me, and are generally unapologetic about that.

This is me just speaking from my own experience, but sub in transgender protections for any other protection that trump has overturned--DACA, endorsing the proud boys, putting a pro lifer on the Supreme Court - - and that's why people tend to be cagey. Not because we think you hate us, but because you supported someone who harmed us and don't care that you did. (general 'you'. Not you specifically)",1605119282,2,0

DO NOT take the economics of the World War class. Robert Gordon is a nice guy but he is VERY boring. Maybe it's different for a small class, so if you're really interested in the topic then go for it. But otherwise, nah.

Sara Broaders, the professor for Psychology of ""Weird"" Beliefs class or whatever it was called got rave reviews from my friends, if I remember correctly. No personal experience.

And then the Plays of Sophocles class with Robert Wallace, well that's a weird one to recommend/not recommend. Good ole Bob is pretty full of himself, but he knows his stuff and I actually learned a lot in the class I took with him. We did a lot of reading in his class that I took so that may carry over to the seminar though? It's up to you but I think I'd probably recommend him.",1605101677,1,0

My take on the letter is that the NIPAS think the Evanston police are too permissive. NIPAS expect to be able to do their jobs as they have been trained to.

With COVID, Ogawa did his best to make sure every test/quiz was fair, but that did come at the cost of sometimes tedious work. Taking tests he made us use Lockdown Browser as well as buy a phone stand to record your desk setup where you would join Zoom via your phone. There, a TA would watch your desk setup to make sure nobody was doing anything sus. It was nice knowing that nobody would cheat, but it did make the class a \~bit\~ stressful at times with the setup. Ogawa probs not gonna teach 310-2 until maybe Summer earliest? (He told us that he's going on paternity leave) So hopefully by the time you take it classes will be bit more normal, but also that depends on COVID :( 

As for Econ electives, I remember getting an email that like halfway through pre-registration pretty much every elective was filled except the 300 level Econometrics course. So yeah, I think it can be a bit hard to get higher level electives as a sophomore, but definitely try to pre-register.

"MENU and MMSS are relatively different in focus ‚Äî MENU is a pure math track aimed at exploring topics in math from a logical, abstract, conceptual viewpoint, whereas MMSS is a very specialized curriculum in applying calculus, statistics, linear algebra, and differential equations to economics (and some other social sciences here and there).  Even within MENU (for freshmen), there are two tracks: 290, which is a mix of computational questions and non-rigorous proofs, and 291, which is a more formal, conceptual, proof-based look at the same material. 

If you‚Äôre interested in the Kellogg Certificate or grad school in the social sciences, MMSS is a great choice. I believe that it also has a leg up in terms of employment, if you‚Äôre interested in going into finance. 

MENU 290 is a challenging but not completely unfamiliar course in multivariable calculus and linear algebra ‚Äî it is a good choice if you‚Äôre interested in learning the reasoning behind computations, and it‚Äôs popular among math, physics, computer science, and economics majors. I took this course, and I‚Äôd recommend it to the quantitatively curious. 

MENU 291 makes sense if you *love* mathematics, are going to major in it, and plan to go to grad school for math. It is known to be extraordinarily difficult for most students, and leads well into the 300-level MENU courses. Every student I knew personally who took 291 had previous preparation in multivariable calculus and linear algebra.",1606174526,1,0

I don‚Äôt have a problem balancing my social life with my three majors, but this is dependent on which classes you take and what a social life means to you. 

Math is more theoretical so I do not recommend if you want a more applied focus into your field. That being said, making sure you have some kinda math focus can make yourself extremely marketable in the field. The econ major at northwestern itself is incredibly good in itself.",1609343480,1,0

"2 big things I would say for any NU applicant:

1) There are many successful forms for a ‚ÄúWhy NU‚Äù essay, but one easy formula is find a way to personalize how you embody the ‚Äúand is in our dna‚Äù spirit and how northwestern will help you do that, write about how you want to do lots of things and how NU will help with that

2) try and style your extracurriculars to be focused on a particular path, while still being well rounded.  Try to do lots of different things, but really show that there is at least one area you have gone in depth to that should stretch across multiple ECs use your activity essay (if it is still a thing) to explain this.

Of course this isn‚Äôt a sure fire way to get in and many people get in without these things (in b4 ‚Äúwell actually I got in without those things).  However, especially for a student without any hooks, these will certainly help make a strong case for admittance",1609235848,1,0

"Even if this is true, I can see the incentive to ditch it. 

Feinberg has a 3.9 median GPA. For each HPME kid sliding in between 3.7-3.9 that they can't turn away, they have to find someone to matriculate with a 3.9+ and the requisite MCAT. Someone probably did the math that they could get better MCAT/GPA combos, increase their metrics, and be more competitive in the rankings if they dropped HPME. 

I also know there is some animosity from regular NU folks against HPME folks. You might be killing it with a 3.88 GPA at NU but your MCAT just isn't good enough (HPME folks don't even have to take the MCAT). You can give NUPSP a shot, but you still might not get in. Meanwhile, your 3.72 GPA friend gets in because for some reason at the age of 18 they were dubbed the special Wildcat. Oh, and they get to graduate a year early. If we're going to do any of this early acceptance, NUPSP just seems like a better program. Let's not fast tracking kids at 18. But, if after 2-3 years of NU they show that they have Feinberg-level potential, let's interview them and give them a shot (not make it an auto accept if over some minimum threshold). 

As someone applying outside of HPME or NUPSPS (maybe you take a couple gap years), you also know that your shot at Feinberg is just worse, because every medical school is going to have some cap on admitting their own graduates and HPME folks likely already take up a good chunk of Wildcat admissions for Feinberg. 

I just don't really see any big pros for Feinberg. It's not like the school has a hard time attracting top-notch medical school students.",1600930423,1,0

"Making good friends especially your first year is a lot of luck. I would say that a lot of people do settle down on a friend group freshman year and that becomes pretty ingrained especially in Greek life, which idk if you‚Äôre into but as much as people shit on it, is a quick fix that plops you into a pretty well established and fleshed social place. If that works out it‚Äôs probably the easiest way to meet your people but if not it‚Äôll probably be harder especially with covid. Maybe look for niche groups? I know there‚Äôs a lot of ethnic clubs. Theater, music, student government, big clubs, etc? Hope it works out for you bc I honestly would not know what to do in your grade‚Äôs situation.",1600912513,1,0

"real talk man, i made literally 0 friends at northwestern my freshman yr and it wasn't like fun per say, but it probably would have been fine except for that on top of that i got rejected - kinda brutally - by the only girl i've ever asked out lmao.

Ppl already say - and this seems to be true - that almost nobody stays friends with their freshman friends, but I would imagine that to be *especially* true now that you're not even actually seeing these people.

I too was very concerned with like ""omg i need to find my niche"" when i entered, but now im just like eh fuck that shit, if i can get good grades and make money and hang out with my at home friends during breaks that's close enough for me.

To be fair, I am from around here, so I had my at home friends visit me at school while they were on break and NU wasn't, but that was still only 1 or 2 times last year. And then I also had a couple of friends from Loyola who I connected up with 1 or 2 times.

&amp;#x200B;

Just generally, my view has come to be that making friends and finding a niche for yourself are things you're mostly gonna have to do yourself. Only a privileged few can sit back and be accepted by mainstream society. That's not to say don't try out clubs, definitely do that, but more so don't take corona too hard either because clubs wouldn't have been a miracle cure for your social life even if the pandemic had never happened.",1600905291,3,0

Just overwhelmed by my classes, nothing is particularly wrong, but just feel so out of control. Limping towards the finish line as you said. I'm highly considering dropping one because I just am so stressed out. The crippling eye strain is not helping. I'm home so I get to go to the barn to ride my horse most days and see some friends, which gives me a couple hours of peace and escape from this hell. but I can't believe we are only a week in. Spring quarter was manageable because it was pass fail, but now that grade count, I can already tell my mental health is heading in the wrong direction.",1600904429,3,0

"I'm not an expert, but I always heard that Medill was quite a bit harder to get into than the other schools. I had also heard that if you wanted to transfer schools, if you were going anywhere except Beinen or Medill, it was a formality. Beinen of course would require an audition, but transferring into Medill I think was rare. I was in the sciences though, so I didn't have any direct experience with either of them.",1600901477,1,0
"Hey, firstly, sorry your first year is starting out like this. It‚Äôs never happened to anyone quite like this and people are very unprepared for it. It sucks, and it‚Äôs okay to be anxious about the problems it‚Äôs created for you. 

Secondly, take a breath. While it might feel like this pandemic is going to go on forever, it will not, and all those clubs, greek life (meh), and people will all be back almost certainly by next fall. 

Lots of people don‚Äôt make it into any of the clubs they want their first year because they‚Äôre not ready for the level of competition. NU students, like yourself, are really talented, so a half-assed application or try-out won‚Äôt cut it at a lot of places, and even really good applicants get cut from clubs sometimes. So make the smart choice and apply to lots of places! It‚Äôs very easy to drop out of a club, much harder to get in once you‚Äôve missed the cycle. There are also still lots of clubs that aren‚Äôt as selective, for example things like Wildside, our school spirit club, the Poker club, which is just a group of people who get together to play poker, or various environmental, baking, and academic clubs that I can think of off the top of my head. 

You can improve your chances at the clubs you really like by reaching out and talking to leadership and members after the org fair, pay attention and find out exactly what they‚Äôre looking for in tryouts, ask if there‚Äôs anything different the NU version might be from your high school club. You can also ask people to review your application. As someone who‚Äôs reviewed a few across a few clubs, stupid mistakes and late applications are common, don‚Äôt be one of those people. 

Finally, and sorry for the long reply, there are 2,400 first years that are in the same position as you. At the end of the day, clubs do not have to make or break your first year experience. Reach out to the friends you made in your PA group, if you didn‚Äôt make any, reach out to random people in your classes or seminar, if you don‚Äôt want to do that, I would be happy to talk to you about some other options, dm me. 

I know this is stressful, and I won‚Äôt give you some bullshit about things magically working out, you‚Äôll have to work hard to make friends and that sucks because it‚Äôs something that should come naturally. That being said, it‚Äôs the hand you‚Äôve been dealt and you just have to play it. I am sure you can make the most of it. Best of luck.",1600901231,3,0

"NU, Duke, and UPenn are all top 10. I have done extensive research on all. From all these amazing schools, it is hard to choose, so my eyes go directly to ranking. I want a degree at a university that will teach me how to use it in a way that I can apply it to global health. Student life is a factor to a certain extent; however, I cannot attend a university to simply party nor can I attend very highly ranked schools if I will be unhappy. I am attempting to find a middle ground, so although ranking is a significant factor, I posted this to gain an appreciation for NU beyond its top 10 ranking.",1599878196,1,0
You said in your post that you were contemplating which to choose for early decision... maybe you need to do some more introspection on what you really want. Unlikely you get into any of these schools without a hold on what you want out of them,1599877828,2,0
