"First of all, from personal experience: People are very well spaced out on campus and there should really be no concern about spread. It's easy to social distance on a beautiful, mostly quiet campus with endless different paths and trails. **However**: Where it gets really crowded is on the sidewalks off-campus. The other day I was on College Ave and there were a ton of people close together, waiting in line to get food, walking on the sidewalk, running, etc. You won't see that on campus. Campus is a significant chunk of the Berkeley area and closing it to the public will force people into a smaller geographic area.

Second, prepare for a hOt tAkE:

This reminds me of COVID restrictions in general; it becomes an illogical game of whack-a-mole. By implementing draconian restrictions on whatever they can, local governments can look like they're really dedicated to *taking action* and stopping the spread. In reality, they are only inconveniencing and hurting people by preventing them from doing beneficial, low-risk outdoor activities--while much riskier activities are impossible to regulate. Why are those riskier activities impossible to regulate? Because you can yell at anyone who dares to go outside during this endless quarantine, but you can't make people care when it comes to socializing in their own lives. 

Note that I don't at all blame public health experts--they have been saying for a while that the chances of catching corona from other masked and distanced people outdoors are slim to none, and that it's important to allow people to safely get fresh air. But somehow, that gets lost in translation, and all too often we hear from non-experts that we must ""Stay indoors! Shelter in place!"" which is completely illogical.",1600981971,2,0

"&gt; Totally different.

My argument was that the state of CA doesn't get to claim a moral high ground for paying for the UC system when it contributes a pittance.

&gt;But you all should quit bitching about having to pay more, that was your choice.

And CA residents should quit complaining about in-state tuition increases and increasing enrollment of out of state students, while not giving the UC system the funding to actually solve these problems. ""[T]hat was your choice.""

Edit: here's some stuff I saw that I don't agree with:

&gt;Federal dollars received by the university are for specific research, grants, infrastructure improvements, etc.

Grants always have an allowance for ""overhead"", siphoned off by the University to pay for other things.

This does obviously put perhaps an undue burden on those who are obese through the fault of the big sugar industry and potentially their own personal poverty which drives them towards consuming fast food, etc. I think we really do need to hold everyone here accountable.

Now the adverse health effects of sugar, and its addictivity, are at this point very well-known. So I would say that a government in principle should try to minimize peoples' dependency on it.

Now this particular piece of legislation is orders of magnitude weaker than this principle. It's not even impinging on choice at all. Anyone who walks into the store who wants to buy a candy bar can still do so (and pay the same amount of money). There's 0 limitation on that.

"For SWE internships for next summer, the recruiting period typically can start as early as August and can last until as late as April/May, though peak recruiting period is definitely Fall semester. You don't want to wait to start next semester since by the end of this semester most companies will have filled up their internship slots already. You should make sure you have your resume ready for applying online and for career fairs. Here's a good [list](https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/Summer2021-Internships) of companies to start -- I think these lists are pretty common every year. Many companies have already released their applications online through their website or LinkedIn, or any other job search platform. 

For career fairs, do some research about the companies you're interested in before talking to the recruiters. It's best to prepare some sort of 1-2 minute elevator pitch (talk about yourself, your experience, and what you're looking for job-wise) for talking with recruiters. I would aim to try to talk to recruiters at the non-FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google) companies, since recruiters at these large companies simply tell you to apply online (so you're in the same pipeline as every other applicant), whereas for smaller companies if the recruiters like you they might fast-track you in the interview process. 

I would also make an Excel spreadsheet just to keep track of the companies you applied to, when you applied, if you've heard back, if you got a referral, etc.",1599951586,2,0

"If you‚Äôre a freshman and attempting to declare cs, I would recommend dropping the class and redoing it next semester to build confidence (hugely underrated and VERY important early on at the brutal academic experience here) and to fill in gaps. Hug talks about this quite extensively in 61B, but repeated exposure to material will let you do much better. Additionally, what type of programming experience did you have in the past? Students that do very well in lower div cs classes usually have extensive competitive cs/math backgrounds which is quite unlike general programming experience you would get from online courses or even something like AP cs - they did that material in middle school.


I think an important aspect about Berkeley is realising where you are in the pack, and adjusting accordingly. If you‚Äôre EECS or already declared (is pre-declaring a thing now? I heard there were plans for this but I‚Äôm not sure), it isn‚Äôt too much of a concern and you can adapt moving forward. If not, it‚Äôs important to realize what you are doing wrong. You got into Berkeley and you must be incredibly smart, but you must learn to adapt to this testing environment and the classes here. How much are you understanding the material when you take practice tests? How many practice tests are you taking? Do you study without looking at the answer sheets, and do you do all discussion worksheets yourself without help? Do you need to be personally walked through solutions? Because there are options for that through CSM/tutoring sign ups/OH that I would push you to attend. 

Coming out of high school, the experience at Berkeley the first few semesters is insane. I remember thinking I was working my ass off and I would barely get median or slightly below median on tests. But now I‚Äôm in much harder classes and perform well above the median because I‚Äôve learned how to study and what works for me. Before midterms for my technical classes, I generally review notes and discussions/homework/problem sets then I do all practice questions I can get my hands on, and I review whatever holes I have in my knowledge as I do those problems. Work smarter and harder, because you can. Once you do, you‚Äôll know these feelings of inadequacy were only temporary and just something you needed to overcome. Always remember that you belong here, and that performance on a test or two means nothing in the long run, but it‚Äôs important to consistently seek improvement. You got this.",1604159590,1,0

"For anyone who's struggling, if you're open to telling your faculty members about this, we can help expedite getting you into mental health care.

However, all faculty and staff have the ability to help. I know this is a shitty scenario. I've been a lecturer at Cal for a long time and I am also frankly struggling with mental health this semester too, and I'm making mental health a priority for my students by giving lots of flexible deadlines and minimizing work load as much as possible without minimizing what people learn from the classes I teach.

It's been hard with Covid and the pace of life feeling slow, pointless, and isolating.

But also, I've always felt a bit lonely at school even before covid so I feel like I've built a bit of tolerance of not minding being lonely. 

The way I am dealing with my feelings is to either take a break by sleeping, eating, hydrating, talking to a family member I trust, exercising, watching tv, etc. Anything to get me to stop thinking in a sad cycle. This helps me take a step back and analyze my feelings. By kind of journaling or interviewing myself about why I feel what I feel, it feels kind of better. If I feel like I am lonely while studying I will reach out to someone I know is struggling too.

I'm writing to ask about the campus' response to animal agriculture and UC Berkeley's current support of animal related products throughout campus. Does UC Berkeley plan to or have any comments about divesting from inhumane practices such as slaughterhouse suppliers for meat in campus eateries (Cal Dining, Bear Market, etc.), transfer to software based lab experiments instead of using live animals (rats, etc.) to test on, and so forth? Animal welfare concerns me greatly, and I know it does to many other students too, so I'm hoping to hear how UC Berkeley addresses this growing issue inside our campus.

"Course staff here.

This was a hard midterm. The averages were lower than usual (most semesters anyway). Professor Sahai is gonna talk about the distribution tomorrow, so you'll know soon enough. Remember that the professors take all this into account while assigning the grades bins at the end of the semester. So if the semester was an exceptionally hard one for all students causing a drop in the total raw score then the final grade bins are likely going to reflect that too. If you really didn't do too hot, just remember that the midterm is only 15% of your grade. Don't stress about this!

"P/NP was designed to allow students to explore different curriculum for the reasons you listed, but it gets a little fuzzy when you factor in law school. different grad programs treat P/NP courses differently, to my knowledge many of them consider them to be a low GPA/failing grade, while very few just ignore them. be sure to fact check that point, because if that's not the case, then P/NP will be your friend.

among stem classes, while there are a lot of difficult ""weeder"" courses, you can still explore using the foundational curriculum set up to prepare people for those weeder courses like CS10 preps for CS61A, Data 8 preps for literally everything data, and \[insert third example here from a department that i have no knowledge about because lists are better in threes\]. 

you can use [berkeleytime.com](https://berkeleytime.com) to view classes via grade distribution and go for ones that are both interesting and relatively ""easier,"" just know that those tend to be popular ones (people like their GPA boosters) and so you gotta phase 1 just to get on the waitlist when they have reserved seats. 

if you're having a hard time selecting a major you can consider auditing classes and just sitting in on a few lectures to get a feel for some of the content. i'd also recommend talking to an advisor about course planning because assuming you're a sophomore in L&amp;S now, you should have plans to declare something by the end of this academic year to stay on track with their general guidelines. even if you have a major all set, if you're considering multiple majors you gotta plan that stuff out with a proper 4 year plan so you know what reqs to fulfill when.",1603100345,1,0

"you can take any major prereqs P/NP, look at the info [here](https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/policies/late-change-class-schedule), but the econ department made up their own specific policies this semester, they haven't posted them online yet but they sent an email to the prospective students email list which I got. I'll just copy and paste the text of the email.

""Below is the Economics major admission policy modification for the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters. Please read through carefully.

Students may elect the P/NP grading option for any of the prerequisite courses taken in Fall 2020 or Spring 2021, to fulfill the Economics major admission requirements.
At the end of the term, an instructor determines a letter grade for each student, including those taking the course under the P/NP grading option. The letter grade you would have received is called the ‚Äúletter-grade equivalent.‚Äù Students who elect the P/NP option receive a P if they earned a letter-grade equivalent of a C- or higher.


The letter-grade equivalent (as reported by the instructor) for any P grade earned in Economics prerequisite courses completed Fall 2020 or Spring 2021 will be used in the GPA calculation for admission to the major
Example: A student chooses the P/NP grading option for ECON 100A in Fall 2020. This student earns a letter-grade equivalent to a B+, which converts to a P under the P/NP grading option.This B+ grade will be used when confirming that the student meets the GPA requirement for admission. (NOTE: students who completed prerequisite courses in Spring 2020 should refer to the adjusted GPA policy to determine their GPA requirements).


The time frames to apply to the major remain unchanged.
Students who entered Berkeley as a freshman must apply for the Economics major by the end of their 5th semester or prior to the accumulation of 80 units, whichever comes second.
Students who entered Berkeley as a transfer must apply for the Economics major by the end of their first semester.
Further instructions on how the letter-grade equivalent information will be obtained by advisors during the admission review process will be shared at a future date. As a reminder, the Fall 2020 application for admission is due December 11, 2020. Deadlines found here.


In the event that an NP is received in a prerequisite course in Fall 2020 or Spring 2021, it will have no negative impact on a student‚Äôs application for the major. The course may be taken again and the first attempt will not be factored into the admission review. Only the second attempt will be used in calculating the prerequisite GPA for admission to the major.

‚ÄúWhat happens if I do not meet the GPA requirement, even with this P/NP grading?‚Äù
Students who do not successfully meet the criteria for admission to the major may still be admitted after further review by the Economics department. See our admissions policies for additional details.""",1605199622,1,0

"Alum here with a few thougths:

* Use career center services to do a resume review and get advice for making it sound stronger. Looking at your LinkedIn page, you could use a little ""marketing"" help to enhance descriptions of your experience. You can talk more about your club experience (especially if you've organized something which shows your ability to work with others and lead). Also, I had to look up UAV -- looks super cool but don't use acronyms (or at least explain them) as a lot of employers will have no idea what this is. It looks like a club that aligns with your major/minor so play it up more. Finally,  be sure your resume uses strong, interesting verbs and describes the outcome/impact of your work. Even an office assistant has an impact.
* You can also work between now and graduation to add more things to your resume. Consider using your winter break of 4 weeks to do an independent project, volunteer for a start up (maybe see if you can connect with one of the Berkeley Launch start ups as they all have Cal connections). I don't know if DS has something like OpenSource projects for CS but that's an idea. Or, get involved in an industry organization outside of Cal and do something like volunteer to help organize a virtual DS conference. Or, organize a speakers panel for DS students at Cal (with Zoom, the possibilities are wide open!!). Employers are looking for people who are go-getters with a broad range of skills so the addition to your resume doesn't have to be something technical.
* Seems like some companies still hire seniors into an internship, rather than a permanent position. Maybe that's so they can see if there's a fit. But, be sure to check out those opportunities too.

Hang in there, you're in a field which is expanding greatly and has opportunities in an incredibly broad range of industries.",1605195814,1,0

The exams were fair, mostly questions from the homework or slight variations, and I get the feeling that everybody did quite well in the class. Although I don't think final averages were ever released, the test averages were quite good for all the exams.

Sethian just thinks that there are basic things that people should be able to do to pass a class. Ie. if half the class can't do a simple triple integral, then they shouldn't pass just because of a curve. Honestly I can't really argue with that. I was initially scared by looking at Sethian's past grade distributions, but I took the class because it was the only time slot that worked.

"In terms of workload, for me, CS61C &gt; EE126 &gt; CS170. In terms of difficulty, EE126 &gt; CS170 &gt; CS61C. I think workload wise, for me at least, the problem sets for EE126 take comparable amount of time to CS170 for the most part (at least the standard length 170 ones). The extra workload is just because EE126 content is definitely pretty hard, so it takes more time to understand compared to say, CS170, which for the most part, is relatively straight forward. Also, EE126 tests take a solid week of studying for me to do decent since there's just a lot of content and tests are hard. CS61C still feels like more work though just because of everything going on in that class, from projects to homework to labs to clicker questions.

That said, I did well in CS70 and felt like I had a solid understanding of the probability that was covered in CS70 coming into the class, so that probably helps. EE126 definitely moves very fast and zooms through all of CS70 content in about 3 weeks (MT1 is basically like a CS70 final, except just with the hard probability questions) before moving into new content.",1605166986,1,0

"&gt;I hope you are getting the love and support you need.

To those in the back of the class who don't know how to be on the giving side of this, here's a brief primer:

1. Give this to whoever you know and care about, regardless if you feel like they're a suicide risk. Very rarely does your assessment of others line up with what they're actually experiencing, especially something so hidden as this.

2. Give this CONSISTENTLY and PERSISTENTLY. Messages will be ignored, and it's personally socially convenient to give up and stop putting in effort to nonreciprocating individuals (**I am calling out all of you on this right now. I guarantee you've done this in the past 7 months.**). And your singular messages are up against a sea of internal thoughts pulling them down - increased volume is important to cut through the noise.

"to start: EAT MOTHERFUCKER EAT

physical health is the FOUNDATION to everything, no joke, full stop. 

Here is a way to conceptualize depression. 

Most people start the day with a full tank of gas. Depression is like starting every day with like, a water-bottle's worth of gasoline in the tank. In other words, to be able to make it, we are talking about energy management. This is true for everyone, but **especially important** for those of us with small energy tanks.

On a daily basis, you want to do the following:


- DO things that increase the energy in the tank (short term - this includes physical movement, seeing friends, staying hydrated)
- DON'T do things that decrease energy in the tank (poor sleep, poor hygiene, not eating)
- And with whatever energy is in the tank, *spend it on fewer things*. 

And this last point is pretty important. In your last line, you mentioned:
""I feel myself falling behind on all aspects at Berkeley. schoolwork, extracurriculars, and socializing.""

This is where you have to make a decision - what is the ONE thing you would choose to focus on and spend your limited energy to strive to be good at? Of course, you will be sacrificing opportunities with this decision, and it will suck, and it will feel like you'll regret it down the line. But having been through this hullaballoo, the worst regret of all is not achieving ANYTHING due to trying to achieve EVERYTHING by spending my limited energy in too many places. (Too many, being, like 3 things. Reduction to a single thing is important).",1602063403,1,0

Here is one perspective to try. Send an email to professors/GSIs at least to start the conversation and let them know what's happening - because down the line, when it's the end of the semester and it's time to talk to professors to ask for partial credit or otherwise to help you pass, you'll have a paper trail dating all the way back to October that you have been struggling and trying different solutions the entire time. 

One unfortunate reality is that you either need to be a mean green Terminator machine mowing down everything you need to do with power and sheer fucking will (unrealistic), or that there are simply no good solutions to solving the current situation. I have a list of things that I know work for me to help me improve, and COVID-19 causes me to toss out pretty much the entire list, replaced with shitty substituted compromises like ""work in the living room instead of your bedroom"" or ""call your friends (who are also too depressed to call back) in order to stay socially healthy"".",1602062254,1,0

I think most EECS upperdivs is curved to a 3.3. So the mean in an exam is a B+.

"Hey, I was one of those freshman year kids that nearly slipped through the cracks (forgetting to eat, my desk was such a mess my roommate had to yell at me to clean it before I realized how bad it had gotten, isolating myself in my room even before corona, on track for low GPA first sem, just wanting to sleep all the time to ""skip"" to the next thing). And honestly, I really did nearly slip through the cracks - I'm not here to tell you that it will get better because it genuinely could end up that you need to take a gap semester or that you end up with a ""bad"" freshman year first sem GPA. It won't necessarily get easier soon and there is a real danger of slipping through the cracks in Berkeley, especially as a first sem freshman without a solid community yet. I'll also confirm from personal experience that I had a measurably tougher time getting access to certain resources (certain internships, clubs etc.) because of a poor first sem GPA compared to some of my better performing peers. (The lesson here is to not compare but easier said than done. Obviously comparing yourself to people who are doing relatively better means you are doing relatively worse, which only marginally helps you motivate yourself in the short run but damages your self esteem in the long run). 

I will say I had a far better second semester once I started making friends with my floormates and joining some chill clubs. As for GPA, bluntly it matters a lot for for a lot of post undergrad opportunities.  I'm not sure what you're interested in, but I would definitely start browsing around to see if there's an online forum for the industry/grad school you at least want to have the option of pursuing later on. The anxiety of commiting myself to something I had no idea if I would be able to do, let alone enjoy was real, but finding out I'd missed the boat on pursuing some of them because I didn't even know about them was even more stressful.

I've basically struggled with poor focus and study habits for 3 years straight until I started therapy and got diagnosed with ADHD this summer. Things have improved drastically since I got medicated, but even (especially) now I get stretches of weeks where I don't feel like doing anything, especially studying. A sense of apathy to the future, that there isn't anything to look forward to even if I studied really hard. What I do then is force myself to sit in a chair until I'm ready to start whatever is due. Sometimes I sit in a chair doing nothing for 30+ minutes before I even start working on a single question on a pset. The boredom of doing nothing will always eventually surpass the anxiety of starting school work even if you think it's impossible to do. Sometimes I medidate but mostly I just sit and wait (no phone, no distractions). For me, the feeling of literally wasting time - not even procrastinating but literally doing nothing is more anxiety inducing than starting the work itself.

My advice for finding accountability buddies for classes is to message 2-3 people you see/hear actively participating in sections/lectures and ask if they're down to grind out a pset or study for a test remotely.

It seems like you have a different blocker than I have so I'm not sure how relevant this advice could be, but this is what works for me when I absolutely can't get started on something. This post just reminded me a lot of stuff I felt freshman year first sem.",1602055015,1,0

"Typically there's 2 rooms per apartment suite. One room was built for 2 people. The other was built for 3 people. Both rooms share a common area that has a kitchen and a bathroom. Regardless of the capacity, currently 2 people are placed in each room. It's complete luck of the draw which one you'll get placed in.

For the size?  I'm kind of surprised that 5 people lived in these apartments pre-Covid but then I remember people probably only used the place to sleep and were on campus the majority of the time (not anymore though). Fridge space is small, storage space is alright. If you come, pack light to start with. You can always order more stuff later after you see how much space you're working with.

As for flex dollars, the apartments have a kitchen so you don't need to get them if you don't want to, but you can. You'll have to buy a meal plan though since it isn't included. The dining area (The Crossroads) is pretty close by so you don't gotta worry about that.

As to whether it's worth going there are some points to consider.

* Classes are online, so you're going to likely spend a significant chunk of time in the apartment studying/taking tests/doing homework/attending Zoom lectures. Would you prefer your room at home or your shared room at the apartment? As far as I know, all the libraries and traditonal study areas are closed. So your other options for places to study would be outdoor areas on campus and cafes with outdoor seating.
* If you come to campus you'll have to schedule Covid tests twice a week.
* You'll have the opportunity to interact with/befriend other students if you come to campus.
* You can explore campus and the city if you want.
* It seems some freshmen don't care about Covid regulations so make of that what you will.

If you want to explore a bit into the different possible topics of CS, taking Data 100 is one of the best ways to bridge between lower-division and upper-division. The first third of the class is Tables, mini-probability, and programming. Then the last two-thirds is linear algebra theory, which will dip your toes into EECS 127 Optimization and CS 189 Intro to ML. Then there's a small sliver into Parallelism and Data Management in the form of Spark and Big Data.

If you like the Tables and Programming, feel free to try courses like CS 186 Databases and CS 160 UI Design.

If you like the linear algebra theory, go for EECS 127 and CS 189

If you like probability, CS 188 is a good bridge class into Machine Learning IMO (even though some say it's not needed for industry, but dips your toes in it). EECS 126 is very difficult, but it's an option

&amp;#x200B;

You can also find the different research areas listed here that may get you started: [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/)

List of CS classes here as well: [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html)

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, don't fall for the overhyped train of classes like CS 170 and CS 162. There is a lot of mix of people that say these classes are important for industry and interviews, but I only hear it as word of mouth. I don't hear industry saying ""You MUST take these classes"", unless of course, you are pursuing the theory and security route, respectively. If you have a genuine interest in these classes, go for it! If not, don't force yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Data 100 is a good bridging point. Look at the links above to see where your interest lies. And don't fall for the overhype train of taking CS 170 or CS 162, unless you like theory or security, respectively.",1609384365,1,0

I find that when I'm busy with real commitments (meaning clubs/jobs/classes etc instead of a ""commitment"" to myself to study) I have more pressure to get work done since I have less free time.

"If you are aiming for good grades, then best advice is to just do as many practice exams as possible and to do it as early as possible. Take advantage of OH not right at the last second and you can have a 30 min one on one session with someone.

If your goal is long term retention, you should be not cramming everything at the last second. Research shows that the more times you repeatedly see material over longer periods of time, the more you will remember it in the far far future. 

Personally recommend doing both as best. Speaking from experience, really painful to cram 1/3rd of a semesters content in 1 week and did below average on a final lol.

I found that assisting/trying out a undergrad research with couple different groups (did a roughly one semester with one group and one with another before I found something I enjoyed) helped me find a direction that I really enjoyed (Ugrad research also helps immensely to get an interview; it shows that you can actually work for someone on a team, and perhaps do something useful). I also took a lighter load one semester and (possibly without as much pressure to just churn out HW/class projects) realized that I really enjoyed one class; ie I would get very engaged with the HW, lots of discussion w/ prof in office hours. CS here has probably double or maybe triple the amount of people that were in my EE class though, so these could be more difficult here.",1609378589,2,0

"hey there, i'm currently a sophomore so about half my experience with berkeley has been in-person and the other half has been online. when things were in-person, i genuinely enjoyed it so much more than i ever thought possible. despite what people tell you, the people at cal are super friendly and not as competitive as the stereotype. also, take advantage of the slc (student learning center - basically free student tutoring for certain classes), join clubs you want to, and attend OH for particularly difficult classes or classes where you want a LOR from the professor. 

some downsides i do want to note from my experience being a pre-med student is that lower div weeder classes are super difficult for no reason, but since you are a transfer you won't have to deal with that. upper divs are generally much less competitive and more interesting, so i am sure you will do great! another downside is that even though you have plenty of people attending the school, it can feel a lot more alone if you don't try to make good friends from the start. and in terms of classes, it's kind of easy to feel like you are all on your own especially in bigger classes. this is why it's important to form study groups or at least know one person in each of your classes that you can contact outside of class. if you are planning on living in berkeley, just be prepared for some very nasty smells LOL the surrounding area does not smell great and there are sadly lots of homeless people around campus who basically live there. i haven't been to berkeley since march, but i'm sure the nightlife has died down because of the pandemic which sucks because there are a lot of cool restaurants and places to visit within walking distance. even though those aspects of the actual location are pretty shady, the campus itself is super pretty in my opinion. i love the buildings and architecture and the libraries. overall, i've really been enjoying my time at cal although it is a lot less enjoyable virtually :( 

it may probably help more to speak to other transfer students since i don't have direct experience dealing with that transition, but i wish you the best no matter where you end up! go bears :)",1609378259,3,0

"Econ alum here. I freakin love this school and had hands down the best 4 years of my life at Berk! From an academic standpoint, we are blessed with a world renowned econ department with some amazing faculty and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the upper div classes for my major. The community here is phenomenal and I really miss being able to interact with some of the smartest, driven, friendly, and interesting people you will meet on a daily basis. Berk the town itself is quite the gem - many diverse food places to try, easy access to SF, and lots of recreational areas close by.

Being a Berk graduate also sets you up well for the real world. Nothing will be handed to you here as classes, organizations, and recruiting can be downright competitive and taking initiative is absolutely imperative to thrive. But once you make it through your Berk experience, you will feel that you can take anything on post graduation.

"Im not a CS major but I took mostly CS/EECS courses, and changed my path once. Im about to graduate next semester so I have a lot of experience. If I could go back to when I first started taking CS/EE courses, **I would tell myself to look at the course catalog for things that are interesting to me (grad courses included**, because many of them are accessible to undergrads). Your interests will develop as you take more courses, but you'll never know if you like something without some sort of experience. You will then be able to plan around these courses in advance, because there are obviously prereqs and things that you might want to focus more on (computer architecture, robotics, pure software engineering, ml, etc..). I did this a little too late, which prevented me from taking a class or two that I would have wanted to take, which I regret. If your planning on taking courses like 189 then that might take a semesters worth of prep if you want to get the most out of it, so plan accordingly.

**The next thing I would advise is to obviously take a wide breadth of courses early to give yourself more of a feel for what classes you like**. There are the obvious classes you should take, like 61c, 170, and 162, but the earlier you take these courses the more you'll know what you like! For example, say you really like 61c, then you might be interested in taking EECS151 and CS152, EE105, etc. If you like probability and a course like CS188, then you might be interested in 126, 127, 189. There are tons of these sorts of paths available, and if your really feeling a certain topic then you might be able to do grad courses that are very specific. So, if you figure out what pace your able to take courses at and narrow your options down early, the more you'll be able to get out of the phenomenal CS/EECS program we have. 

Lastly, and this is more of a personal thing, I feel that many people new to the CS/EECS program shy away from EE/EECS courses. I suspect this is because 16a, and especially 16b (aka literal trash) give people a poor image of those courses. The EE/EECS courses are actually super dope, so I would advise you to give them a go if your interested. CS and EE are heavily intertwined below the software level, so if you like 61c you might want to check out more EE courses as well. For example, there is fantastic support for signal processing courses, information theory courses, and robotics (106a is my favorite class at Berkeley so far!). Just wanted to plug that department :). 

So yea, there are lots of options, but just to reiterate, make sure you get as much exposure to as many topics as possible early so you know what you'll like, and then narrow it down eventually by looking at the course schedules:  ([https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html)

"1) This is just my opinion as I don't know how admissions officers weigh GPA vs. experience/projects but I'd personally try to focus on securing a high GPA first before delving into experience/projects. From the [transfer admissions data](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/transfers-major), the admit GPA for CS is quite high, so it might be that the probability of getting in with high GPA/low extracurriculars is higher as opposed to the other way around.

2) As for a strategy on how to write personal statements, and I'm not sure if this is the best game plan, but [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6qx4mk/do_any_of_the_transfer_supplement_questions_hold/) is how I approached it. Though, it's always best to start early and have others proof-read!

One more piece of advise is to complete as many pre-reqs as possible. If your CC doesn't offer a pre-req, you can check [here](https://cvc.edu/) for ones that do that you can take online. They say it won't hurt you during admissions if your CC doesn't offer a pre-req but having more can only help as they're trying to make sure that students are able to graduate on time. iirc, Berkeley holds workshops/seminars where they talk about how they select students. You could probably call them to ask when the next ones are held. That'd be a great place to ask all the questions you have about admissions. Hope this helped and good luck!",1608334442,1,0

"Hi! I completed the study abroad app and honestly they just want to see that you did some basic research on the institution and country you wanna study at. My essay was pretty unstructured and I still got accepted because I noted that I was passionate about learning a new language and culture, and that my my experiences study abroad will help me grow as a person :) Pm me if you want to see an example of the essay I wrote",1608330803,3,0

"Sorry for your loss.  The rest of your post is a good story given all the ‚Äúbad‚Äù threads these past few weeks.

Just to play devil‚Äôs advocate here, do not get into the ‚Äúrob Peter to pay Paul‚Äù syndrome. Make sure you allocate enough time in Spring Quarter to finish whatever needs to be completed (the earlier the better) and to prepare for your final.  DO NOT make the mistake of procrastinating until the end, it makes your Spring load way harder than it would have if you had spread out things.",1608329736,2,0
