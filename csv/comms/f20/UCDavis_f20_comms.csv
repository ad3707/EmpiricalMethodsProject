You can see how I get less aid in my second year after rejecting loans. I don't know why I'm getting more this year, but I'm not complaining.

Edit: One possible explanation on why I get a lot back is because of my VA benefits. It's my understanding that they legally cannot include my VA benefits as a factor when calculating my financial aid. So they calculate my aid without the GI Bill, and then it gets added in afterwards.

"While functionally useful, if you read through the full auditor report, you'll notice that their summary headlines are pretty sensational and don't really match the content. 

* When the auditor says ""campuses"" they don't actually mean ""all campus"", they single out the campus with the problem. 
* When the auditor says ""Campuses Have Not Established Adequate Criteria for Their Admissions Decisions"", the auditor explains that there are a bunch of criteria, but X, Y, Z should be better.

Here's my key take-aways--

* 4 campuses (LA, Berkeley, SD, SB)
* 6 years audited
* 600,000 offers of admission
* 64 clear cut cases of fraud

I'm stunned the fraud is so low. I would have assumed more given that Berkeley and LA were involved. (LA gets ~110,000 applications per year and admits ~15,000.) Time to find out who facilitated the fraud and throw the book at them.

Regarding the ""suspicious admissions"", the campuses simply need to document their exceptions better.

First year: get your CHE2 and MAT17 series out of the way. I also completed PSC1, 41, and sta 13

Second year: start CHE118, BIS2 and PHY7. I completed a few upper div psych classes as well.

Third year: BIS 101, 102, 103, and NPB101 should be your core science classes. They will be important for the MCAT. Also throw in a few more upper div psych classes.

Fourth year: I‚Äôm going to be taking a writing class each quarter since many med schools require a year of English. Then just fill up your schedule with prereqs you haven‚Äôt completed or any interesting classes you want to take!

Plus there‚Äôs benefits of living on your own. You will learn to manage your time better, learn to cook, do laundry, and do the adulting stuff.

So keep working on your study routine and habits and see what works for you.

So I started to work on my study habits and I had a routine going but I still ended up with a 1.7 gpa after fall.

"I totally get you, I live in Sacramento but decide to live in Davis. I had people telling me I should of stayed in Sac to save money because it‚Äôs smart. Well they don‚Äôt really know that my home environment is hard. It‚Äôs not toxic to say but it‚Äôs hard to get anything done because I don‚Äôt have my own room or a place to study. I had to sleep on the couch my last 2 years in high school. I also have nephews I had to take care of and it‚Äôs always loud so it‚Äôs hard to focus. My dad would force me to help around even though I had to explain to him the I have homework and studies I need to finish and he told me I‚Äôll have plenty of time to do it because school shouldn‚Äôt take up a lot of time (and we both know that university life takes a good amount of your time). And when I tell him no, he goes on a rant about how I am lazy and don‚Äôt care about helping (I do help but I can‚Äôt help on a 24/7 basis) and this annoys me so much. So I moved to Davis and while it‚Äôs expensive, it‚Äôs worth because my mental health has improved and I don‚Äôt have to deal with my home life and I can focus on school.

Now here‚Äôs my advice: you should definitely move out, it just sounds like your home life is toxic that it‚Äôs not benefiting your but only hurting you. I would still ask your step mom about moving in with her and you know her answer and sometimes you can be suprised. Now if she does say no, you can always move in with someone or find a sublease if you can afford it but there are some cheap places you can find if you oook well enough. And I get the part about thinking you won‚Äôt be able to live on your own because you can‚Äôt cook or do something but trust me when you move out, your going to learn to become independent pretty quickly. Also, your gonna live on your own eventually so you might as well learn how to live on your own now instead of later. Trust me, I didn‚Äôt even know how to cook or do laundry or clean until I live on my own but I do have roommates so it helps to work with each other. Now I wouldn‚Äôt say living in the dorms is a off the table option but with covid going around, I wouldn‚Äôt be too comfortable but that‚Äôs my opinion.",1603090203,1,0

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having to go through this, and but hopefully it would help a little.",1603089553,1,0
"Okay so I might not be able to answer everything so bear that in mind. 

So the first thing I want to say is that you shouldn‚Äôt always be in a rush to finish school, you should go at a pace your comfortable that won‚Äôt sacrifice your mental health. Like for me I will be spending a total of 5 years at Davis (I will talk to my adviser about financial aid for my 5th year since I‚Äôm pretty sure they can work with you at getting a grant or something). Now graduating in 3 years you can potentially save money but spending 4 years in total gives you more time to think about what you want to do and gives you the opportunity to get into research or internships which can help you go for a masters program or get a job right out of college. Like I hear stories of people who rush to graduate college but don‚Äôt do any internships or projects or research and they struggle to find a job (disclaimer peoples experience will differ but that‚Äôs what I heard) so just by getting a degree may not be even enough. Also, I do t think your cal grant can go into masters or PhD but I‚Äôm not too sure.

My best advice is to go at a pace your okay with but also realize that you wanna leave college with some experience. I would talk your adviser about your situation but some adviser can only do so much. And your a freshman, take it easy, you have some time to think about these things.",1603089306,1,0

"As someone that was in a similar situation I am going to be completely honest. Even if it cost more I would try to get out of that environment asap. Family problems are extremely hard to deal with and with the stress of education; dealing with both could have dire consequences. No joke I almost failed out because of my abusive mother. It was not easy to maintain my sanity and grades while watching my mother's mental health deteriorate and destroy what was left of my family. School is hard enough. work your hardest and be sure to get through so you dont need to rely on these people. Everything will work out.

"Can I make an honest and brutal comment without getting downvoted into oblivion? 

College might not be right for you at this point. If you are already failing a class or two, you have to decide if you can get motivated for the next quarter, let alone four years. Don't fool yourself. Ask the real question: Can I do it? If you are not sure, start contacting your advisors to see how you unwind everything, then go to a community college. The last thing you need to do is feed into your depression by failing more classes. 

There is no shame in going to a community college. In fact, I think it's smarter than wasting money at a four-year college. You take your lower divisions, then when you are ready, transfer to a four year. Also, it gives you the opportunity to discover what major you really want to proceed with.

The class was always taught in C++ but decided to teach it in rust for some reason, and it wasn't a pleasant experience by any means. The lectures were informative for sure, but the assignments and exams were alllllll over the place and many people struggled. 

What I can say to answer your question about Butner is that he is much, much better in terms of class quality. His teaching and expectations are very clear and the class is very organized. Office hours are extremely helpful. BUT, his classes are not the easiest by a long shot. You'll have to put significant work because he doesn't pull punches when it comes to assignments. But you will learn A LOT if you are able to keep up with the class. 

I'd definitely recommend taking Butner first before making any decisions about the minor as a whole, as it will give you a whole new perspective on CS classes and how (I think) they should be.",1605173771,1,0

"For me, taking tests/quizzes from home instead of in a quiet classroom environment has had a *big* effect on my scores. 

For example, when I took my CHE2AH midterm last week, I kept losing focus because I was distracted by the sounds of (a) my cat meowing at my door, (b) my dad teaching his own class in the adjoining room, (c) my brother playing video games in the living room, and (d) some dude playing *mariachi* music RIGHT OUTSIDE MY WINDOW. If I had been able to take it in a classroom, I probably would have been able to score a letter grade better. 

Besides the noise factor, I just feel like I perform better on tests in a classroom setting because my brain only associates a classroom with learning/test-taking. 

Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that you might be performing poorly on exams because you're taking them from home instead of in a classroom.

What was your CC,1605142858,1,0
"There is nothing wrong with switching to community college. I'll tell you a story about me for you to relate to.

I first graduated high school in 2013 and took a year off because I just wasn't sure if the university was my thing. Then I started university at San Jose State University after moving to California in 2014. Though I did really excellent, I switched to community college as I needed to work to maintain my costs and well-being. I didn't have mental health challenges but had to shift to community college because my first year made me take student loans costing around 20k. Now in your first year, taking 20k sounds very expensive, so moving to community college was the safest bet compared to a 100k student debt in undergrad (20k\*5). 

Community college allowed me to take my time and completed the required coursework to transfer. I hated calculus, which was the biggest challenge to transfer but I passed with Cs in math and able to transfer to UC Davis. Now entering Davis was another challenge but I'm going to be happy when I graduate this December. 

You're an adult now and growing up will be difficult. I would highly recommend taking community college to overcome coursework that would have been difficult. For mental health, like for me now, I only take 13 units each quarter/semester to not get overwhelmed. Plus saves you money, builds responsibility, and personal finance stuff. Also, if you just graduated high school, California community colleges guarantee you the first two years free, so take that advantage. 

That's my feedback and go ahead because life is a journey and this part of your life will make you reflect on how you persevered to succeed.",1605141423,2,0

I cried twice, once on my first night in the dorm and once right after I said goodbye to my parents.

I‚Äôm extremely awkward and overbearing so it‚Äôs hard at first (and you won‚Äôt get along EXTREMELY well with every person you meet) but as I‚Äôve been finding people that I vibe with, they are making me feel at home.

"From the SHIP webpage:

What do I do when I need care but SHCS is closed (like on the weekend, a holiday, or in the evening)?

Answer: You have several options. You can contact the Student Health Advice Nurse at (530) 752-2349 and discuss your situation with a Registered Nurse and get assistance determining if you should seek care at an Urgent Care center, the Emergency Room, or if you can wait until Student Health and Counseling Services is open again.

You an also go to Sutter Davis Urgent Care or Emergency Room which is located at 2020 Sutter Place off of Covell Blvd, just two miles north of campus.

You can also go to Davis Urgent Care located at 4515 Fermi Place, #105 on the east side of Davis across the street from Target.

If you are out of the Davis area and need care, simply show them your UC SHIP ID card and pay your office visit copay. You will need to contact the Insurance Services department when they are open and advise them that you received care outside of SHCS so that they can issue a referral so that your claim is paid.

Yeah, having a shitty personality isn't a liability until you start approaching your 30s and your peers start to actually appreciate things like kindness, humility, and responsibility.

But a shitty personality is practically an asset if your peers are mostly self-centered, arrogant, irresponsible 20 year olds. Takes time and a few mistakes to learn and internalize that shitty people are, you know, shitty.

Length does not matter as long as there's at least some sort of an intro (mine was 2-3 sentences long with the thesis statement at the end), evidence (body paragraphs: using examples off of the prompt and/or personal observations), and a conclusion (quick summary and maybe some insight).

"&gt; How hard is it to remember to opt out?

It really doesn't matter. The school cannot just tack on student fees without approval from the student body. It's as simple as that. 

And also, they've been marketing this program heavily and freshmen/new parents believe this program is saving them money. Some believe that it's ""included"" in the tuition because that's how EA tried to present it in their emails.

"I never used the book for CLA, Same with Nut 10 since all the info you need is posted on canvas",1607294501,1,0
"&gt; Why would you send a letter to the Congressperson in Davis?

Because there are laws that specifically govern these types of programs, and they are lacking. For example, it is written that these programs must provide ""below market prices"" for textbooks, but since the textbook market is controlled by three companies, and these are the companies behind this program, this clause is essentially useless since they can manipulate the prices to make it seem like people are ""saving"" money.

Also, Florida's laws specifically prevent these predatory programs from automatically opting students in. California doesn't have this. McGraw-Hill &amp; other publishers actually hired ""student advocates"" at Florida universities to petition 
them to change the law and it ultimately failed because lawmakers cannot see the advantage for that. 

&gt; It clearly helps some people. Don't ruin it for them.

I've actually researched this. Most of the time people are only saving money because they need to opt-in to complete their homework. If their classes only require textbooks, they will almost never save money. Also, students in some classes have seen the prices for their digital textbooks/homework increase regardless of whether they opt in or opt out. You essentially have a system where students are subsidizing each other's textbooks, so it helps very few people but raises prices for everyone else.",1607294174,2,0

I think it is helpful for some students but largely unhelpful for most, yet we are automatically enrolled. I know many students who don't spend 200 on books and a handful that do. 

We should not be opted in automatically and have to go through THREE websites to opt-out.

Also there have been email issues a lot of students didn't get notified?! Some were re-opted in?! That's bullshit in my opinion. Also they pushed back the deadline to opt out which may have made some people not opt out. 

You may claim ""laziness"" for those who didn't opt out but thing is students are stressed as hell and have enough on their plate. This adds to it and is annoying as hell.

I think you're on the right track with an opt-in program, buy the way this program started is problematic.",1607290839,2,0
"All my homies hate Equitable Access.

The administration also doesn't really seem to give a single fuck, unsurprisingly, even though the Academic Senate and faculty have expressed issues with it.  UC Davis cares about students! But it cares about money more! Yay!

The person behind the program (and our executive director of student affairs) Jason Lorgan also seems to be a wonderful person so, so concerned about students and their views: My personal favorite take from him is that fears and concerns about Equitable Access are just because we don't understand the program well enough (God, wonder whose fault that might be). From [the Aggie article](https://theaggie.org/2020/08/07/new-bookstore-program-equitable-access-receives-backlash-from-students/) published a few months ago, he says (my personal favorite quote from him), ""Complaints about textbooks have been happening for over 100 years. So the fact that students are complaining about textbooks is absolutely nothing new.‚Äù

So weird that students have been complaining about textbooks and access to them for so long. It's almost like it's a for-profit industry, and that UC Davis Stores are interested in making money off of us all trying to get an education. Also, love that current student complaints don't matter, because students have *always* been complaining. What a nice guy, this Lorgan fellow is, so glad he's the executive director of student affairs, love that for us students.

Even if Equitable Access is somehow fundamentally misunderstood, for Lorgan or anyone else to act as if it's not a cash-grab is naive and silly, based solely on the fact that it is sneaky opt-out program than an opt-in one.

"hi! i actually transferred as a sophomore to UCD, albeit from community college and not from a UC or private university. thought i‚Äôd throw in my two cents here anyway in case it helps any. 

like other comments have mentioned, i went through the TAG program and had 60 semester/90 quarter units completed by spring freshman year. essentially i was a junior in standing when i transferred but i was entering year 2. i had submitted my TAG application a few months prior and the actual UC application in november. once you get accepted to TAG, you just need to maintain your end of the agreement (GPA, courses, etc) and youre basically in. 

a cool site that might be helpful in comparing what classes youve taken vs their corresponding UCD classes is assist.org! you can also see what classes you might need to take to transfer here.

"Yeah, keep in mind the Feynman Technique is most useful for complex concepts, and shouldn't be used for everything. Additionally, if it is possible and easy to memorize a quick formula here and there or how an example is done, just save the time and do that. A lot of what I said in my original comment is not something I do for every class, just difficult ones where I really feel like my grade is going to get screwed over if I don't study like this lol.

\&gt; For going through concepts/material sections, do you have any preference of going from older material to newer, vice versa, or do you just jumble everything up?

* Basically all the material you learn in these types of classes are going to build-off on previous concepts, so you sort of have to start from the beginning. I personally study concepts in a linear fashion (wherever the material starts for the exam to where it ends), but I just skim the easier stuff, most of which happens to be at the beginning.
* For reviewing material, because I make cheat sheets, I want my cheat sheets to be easier to read when I study which is why I start from beginning to end.
* For doing practice problems, I do hardest concepts to easiest, and that doesn't necessarily line up with the chronological order of when you learn the material.

 \&gt; How do I know when I've practiced a problem enough?

* You figure out how difficult you find the material you're reviewing and start with practice problems based on that (you find the material incredibly hard? Start with an easier practice problem and work your way to the harder ones). In lecture notes/textbooks, the easier example problems tend to be at the beginning of the lecture so you can generally find them like that.
* Pay attention to what problems you're doing. If you're finding variations of a problem, see what is different. For example, if you just did Prob A, and Prob B conceptually looks like A but the numbers are just different, it's not worth doing Prob B if you did Prob A quickly and correctly. However, if Prob A and Prob B both go over inelastic collision in physics, for example, but B involves a much more complex inelastic system, it would be helpful to do both problems since you will have some training in viewing a single concept from different angles. Also, if you have access to solutions, you can see what you did wrong. Depending on if you messed up on something very important vs. some algebraic errors, you'll know whether you should find another problem to do. In general, it's hard to say what is ""enough."" I never feel prepared ""enough"" walking into any test, so you just gotta think about it more in terms of being able to cover as much material as possible when studying.
* Also read the questions carefully. Sometimes if they're wordy or incorporate a ""real-life application"" sometimes you might think ""wtf? idk where to even start"". In physics for example, having a ""real-life application"" might make the system in the problem seem super complex all of sudden compared to what you've practiced because there seem to be so many variables. But if you can take a step back and pinpoint things like ""what are the known variables, what are the unknown variables, and which equations relate all these variables to each other? can I manipulate an equation I have into something that will fit the problem?""... you can strip away the narrative and reduce the problem to its bare system.

 \&gt; Do you follow any kind of study schedule, or do you find gaps in you day to fit in studying times? 

* I personally don't really stick to schedules I make lol, and it really depends on the person whether they like having the schedule or not. I don't like switching between tasks, or studying in between classes if there's only a 1 hour break or something. I need long blocks to study so usually in the evening/night. If you have problems focusing you can also check out the Pomodoro Technique? I personally don't do that though, I just try to keep my phone away from me lol.

 \&gt; Should I be studying everyday?

* By ""studying"" I assume you mean like how you would study for a test? Then no, I don't study everyday. I only study like this a few days to a week before a test. Honestly, a lot of my time is spent doing homework or assignments so it's hard to find actual studying time unless it's before a test. My professor mentioned some good advice; before homework, try reviewing your notes briefly and do the homework in one sitting or two as if you're taking a closed-book exam. That can serve as ""practice"" for your studying too. I find most students just look at their notes or copy similar example problems in lecture when doing their homework so the concepts don't actually stick in the long-run.
* Definitely take breaks throughout the day, I rarely take a whole day off because it becomes harder to start my work again the next day. I motivate myself by taking a 30 min-1 hour break or something after finishing homework or an assignment that takes like 3-4 hours. I do things during this break, whether it's eating, taking a nap, showering, or just doing nothing lmao. Again, this really depends on you; some people need longer or shorter breaks. Most, if not all days, I never do all the things I plan to in that day, a lot of my work gets pushed back and I squeeze a lot of things in right before the deadline. I'm okay with it now, because I still finish all my assignments so worrying wouldn't have done anything to help.
* Also, it might help looking up some YouTube videos or reading about passive vs. active studying/learning. I know people who still read the textbook for every class (and I did this my first-year) and depending on the professor that can be such a HUGE waste of time. How you study should be dynamic and change for every class because it really depends on how the prof teaches, how you're doing in the course, and what kind of material you have access to in the class.

Last advice, I know some people who do everything (class, ECs, research) and get all As and people who struggle while just taking classes; just don't compare yourself to others, that'll mess with you the most. It's okay not to get all As, especially if you know you tried your best. Also being able to just chill or meditate for an hour and not stress about productivity will also help your mental health. Plus, if you get involved in clubs or research, I feel like you'll be better off having some more real-world experience as well. lol I hope you were able to get something out of all this rambling.",1607249580,1,0

"Nope- I have spent plenty of time researching Christmas- it was originally a pagan holiday to celebrate surviving the winter. Christians then picked it up and added Christ to it but it is distinctly secular.

"Yeah, I really enjoyed reading it. Since it's written in Lewis's own words it already feels like listening to him tell his life story; combined with the lavishly illustrated format and narrative pacing of a graphic novel, it feels almost like actually being there with him.

I just finished reading it‚Äîit covers the history up to and including the march from Selma to Montgomery and the success of the Voting Rights Act of 1965‚Äîand holy wow it has filled in a LOT of the gaps in my knowledge with plenty of detail.

"&gt;Christmas, despite what Christians will have you believe, is a secular  holiday. Sure some people associate with Christ but that was simply  attached to the holiday after the fact.

None of that is even remotely true. Please read some history. Certainly there are some non-religious people who love Christmas (myself included!) but it is absolutely a holiday with a specifically Christian origin.",1609368268,1,0

They either moved it for COVID or they forgot their own policies (extremely common at Davis).",1609367891,1,0
