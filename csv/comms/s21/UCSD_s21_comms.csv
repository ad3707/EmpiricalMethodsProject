"I was a homeless student during a rainy season quarters ago. I had a classmate who was involved with a homeless advocacy group and wanted to know where I slept at night. I cycled through different areas of campus that had lower foot traffic. Planning for weather is important because some of the more hidden spots don‚Äôt have overhangs to keep you dry. I had to get up before sunrise to evade getting reported. I wasn‚Äôt comfortable giving anyone my sleeping locations because I was tired enough as it was and didn‚Äôt need police waking me up in the middle of the night.

"Highly recommend Cog Sci ML if you are interested in AI, Data Science. It goes over most of the same content as CSE or ECE majors would learn, but intro courses are with python not java and there's a greater focus in properly understanding how the brain works (which is great for AI!). There are also a ton of project based courses like Cogs 108 which is culminates in a data science project.

If your interested in a more of a SWE job, Cog Sci Design and Interaction / HCI is also a great choice for learning frontend development and / or UI/UX design. Cog sci also has the best project courses for frontend coding. The CSE equivalents are ok but focus a bit more on software engineering in general, whereas Cog sci does more designing.

Unfortunately, anything related to more backend stuff, Cog Sci won't have the courses for you but also just note that companies literally don't care what major you are, especially if you projects showcase the appropriate skills (Many Cog Sci majors land jobs at the same companies CSE majors do). You usually can pick up relevant skills for other roles in computer science via participating in workshops by clubs on campus (like ACM, IEEE) or learning it yourself online",1617999054,1,0

"Hi, I hope this isn't too late but I finished ICAM music a while ago so I can probably share a thing or two. \*Nvm, I realized it turned into a long post so hopefully it will still be helpful for anyone thinking about majoring in it.

*(we'll call it ICAM from here but excluding the vis arts department)*

So a little bit about myself, I was admitted to UCSD as undecided, declared Cog Sci for a while but then decided it wasn't for me, then became an ICAM major in my sophomore year when I officially flunked my screening course requirements for the CSE lottery. I remember I switched to ICAM just so I can enroll in a class on Ableton as I was deeply invested in music production at that time, then decided to stay because it is somewhat related to computing and has arts and music as well which both I consider myself to be pretty decent at and also interested in.

**Do students get to collaborate with others?**

Absolutely! It happens all the time in and outside of class, there's even a quarterly event called the undergrad forum where students can sign up for musical performances or showcasing personal projects.

**Does the major help with the listed career paths?**

Quick answer: Yes and no. 

As I am still in the process of job-hunting so this will be based on my countless intern rejections and also seeing what other ICAM friends are doing post-graduation. ICAM to me feels like a double-edged sword in the sense that it's good for being very open-ended and diverse thus allowing students to learn a bit of everything, but when it comes to employment it's the very same thing that hurts because most students aren't particularly strong in any field. 

Take sound design jobs you mentioned for example, you are competing with people of pure music background from top schools who specialize in that craft and the industry favor them because their program is very practical whereas UCSD is highly theoretical and research-oriented. As for audio plugin companies, if you want to pursue a career as an engineer, ICAM is probably one of the worst ways to do so. Those jobs require a solid background in science and engineering (specifically math, physics, and EE if you want to do DSP) and ICAM covers none of that. If anything that came close was MUS 170 which I took with Miller Puckette (one of the leading figures in the department and industry known for being the author of Max/Pd), the class was kinda meh but it's a whole other story. 

However, what I can conclude is that when looking at ICAM as a fine art or design degree, building a portfolio is all it matters as it will speak for itself and truly prove your skills. ICAM gives you a fair amount of free time after class and is prob one of the less stressful programs at UCSD, but you would probably want to use the time for personal projects and also to keep learning by yourself.

**Are there any notable internship opportunities?**

I'm not exactly sure what you mean by ""notable"" so I'll leave that out and talk about internship opportunities in general for now. They do exist, but you probably won't find one that wants ICAM students in particular though, so this goes back to what I was saying about competing against people whose backgrounds are geared towards those jobs. Most people I know started out wanting to intern specifically at a recording or sound design studio, and these opportunities do exist but they are very scarce and not likely in San Diego. So I guess we all later turned to shotgun approach whatever looks like a fit.

**How are the vibes?**

I'd say it's pretty chill as it is a rather small and compact department. People are very diverse in what they are interested in learning / doing. Most TA and professors are also very knowledgeable in whatever field you might be interested in so do talk to them during office hours if you feel like you want to learn more. (Albeit most are pretty bad at teaching in a class setting lmao)

I can't think of more for now, but if there is anything you want to know in particular do feel free to DM me. Good luck!",1617992519,1,0

Either way, I disagree. If it's the former, then please share an image. I checked the online OED through my UCSD account, and I didn't find such a mention. Perhaps you have another edition or another publisher. If it's the latter, well, I'm fairly certain Mexican, African, and other minority societies have law enforcement? Do you hate those cops too?

"As someone who has taken personal finance classes at a community college level I would say there are definitely a multitude of basic skills in all of the things you mentioned that would be very helpful to students. That being said, such a class would need to be paired with concrete action on addressing what happens to students who stay past 4 years (who enter as first years) or 2 years (who enter as transfers). Right now students who stay longer are HEAVILY penalized by the university, even though quite a few majors are infeasible at best for students to complete on time (particularly for transfers) and the statistical time to graduate is longer than they‚Äôre trying to enforce due to that. Adding more required courses - even if it‚Äôs just one - will increase workload and stress to students struggling to complete programs on time. Extending the time students can take by another year (or removing quarter maximums entirely as there are other ways to incentivize graduating on time) could make that space for a class like this and overall decrease student stress and workloads.",1617987768,1,0

"if you can't find a club, you could buy the supplies yourself online or at a hardware store. A decent 15W weller solder iron is like $15 and should come with a small amount of solder to work with.

If you need more solder, a decent spool on amazon costs like $9. Just make sure to get rosin core solder as that's for electronics (soldering is also used for plumbers to join pipes, which uses different solder so avoid those products). Also try to get lead-free solder instead. Lead solder is very nice because it's easier to work with, has a lower melting point, and just plain looks shinier when used however the whole cancer aspect of lead isn't very cash money so avoid lead.

Then to actually practice, read up on wikihow or youtube videos to get a basic understanding of Do's and Do Not's. They sell Solder-able Breadboards which are just circuit boards with an ass ton of holes. Buy that alongside some components(cheapo resistors, LED's, Op-amp) and/or some thin guage wire (probably something like 18 awg) to solder onto the circuit board.

Practice in an open ventilated room with safety glasses (don't wanna breath melting metal stuffs, even if it's lead-free it still isn't good for the noggin) . You can use thick steel wool to clean the tip of the solder iron to prevent excessive oxidation of the tip (a hot metal tip oxidizes fast af and it makes soldering more difficult so avoid it), but if you're on a budget I've found a moistened kitchen sponge and good tip tinning practices to be enough.

You could probably snag everything I mentioned for like less than $40 pretty easily online. But definitely try makerspace or a club first, makerspace has most of supplies open for use if you complete their basic safety training online.",1615997297,2,0

"I think this is a really nice viewpoint for us undergrads. But also, I do feel like the quarter system and the ways professors teach (at least in physical science lecture courses) isn‚Äôt conducive to learning; it‚Äôs more about how well you can memorize a shit ton of information. So much emphasis is placed on exams, when honestly, weekly quizzes/assignments instead of a huge final or midterm would force students to learn more over the quarter and be more likely to retain it. For example, in the chem 40 series, most profs just assign literally every textbook problem to do on your own time for no credit, and then have a midterm (or two) on a bunch of chapters and a bigass final. I think if we were able to genuinely focus on one chapter at a time instead of trying to do a ton at once for an exam would actually enable kids to get through ochem without wanting to die. Idk I just don‚Äôt think a lot of students here retain much info once the quarter is over",1615997182,1,0

"I wish I could send pictures here - I have a full on convo with someone else I helped explaining ever little detail. 

But the jist:

Don't go over 150 completed units; if you do, you won't be eligible for the ICT request. This doesn't include work in progress units. 

Units for each quarter in each college need to be consistent and also need to be full-time. So you can't say you will take 16 units in one quarter at Marshall, and only 12 units in Revelle that same quarter to help your argument. It needs to say you will take 12 units in Marshall one quarter, and 12 units in Revelle that same quarter. 

You will need to prove you can graduate two full time quarters sooner (this was the technicality I got rejected on the first round, and they were more lax about it the second round) at the other college). Since I didnt need classes to fill units or my major for some quarters, I added ""Elect for financial aid"" in the revelle section, since full time student status does impact financial aid eligibility.

You need 180 units to graduate. Try filling these units with her major requirements, and the university requirements. 

The university requirements are a DEI course, an American History and Institutions course if no community college class fulfilled that requirement or a 3 on an AP history test, and the analytical writing program course if they didnt count any CC courses towards that or an AP exam. You can check your degree audit to see if any of those are already fulfilled, or look at https://catalog.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/degree-requirements/index.html to see if you did fulfill a requirement but they haven't included it yet. 

Lastly, here is an excel sheet the person I was helping made for themselves, you can edit it to input your own classes and all that jazz: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1arL9Ji0E38xSjCOl92cktUSMmmuhOVcPPa3VpKGNBjI/edit?usp=drivesdk",1615974606,1,0

"Hey! I was a transfer too and an anthropology major who got stuck in Revelle. 

The first thing I did was fail the math placement test intentionally - because it meant I would need to take more math courses which would extend my time until I can graduate. 

I tried switching the second or maybe third quarter, but they denied my request since it still seemed doable (to them) that I could graduate on time if I took some CC classes. 

Stressful AF but what I did was made sure not to go over the units that make you eligible for the ICT, and I tried the transfer request again in Winter quarter my second year as a transfer (with hopes of graduating in spring). I also avoided all Revelle GEs, and took GEs only within my major and the university's requirements (so anthro courses and DEI classes).  That way by the time I applied during winter quarter, I would have only the two GEs from Marshall college to take (and a class or two for university units), as opposed to the 6+ Revelle courses. 

Also, the right counsellor makes all the difference. See Ashley Grove - she was super supportive of my attempt to transfer both times I met with her, and the technicality a different counsellor denied me on the first try, was one Ashley didn't care about too much so she cleared it to have Marshall college look at the request. 

Also, I recommend transferring into Marshall. Theres actually a lot of freedom with their GE classes, and it's only two writing courses. I ended up doing two creative writing classes and I was good to go. Meanwhile Muir it's one very specific writing class that, as a former writing tutor at UCSD, many students struggle with and often complain about. But at the end of the day, really any college is gonna be better for transfers than Revelle.

"I think there are a few different things you need to consider here: 

1. The professor. I had a class last quarter where the professor was super anal about rounding grades/curving exams/offering EC .. etc. They even went as far as including it as a strict policy on their syllabus lol but I think at this point in the quarter you should have a relatively good understanding about whether your professor is compassionate and cares about student health during the pandemic, or if they straight up don‚Äôt give a fuck. If they have it explicitly written on their syllabus that they don‚Äôt round, you‚Äôre better off saving yourself the time and just studying for the final in hopes of pulling off the C instead of drafting up an email. 

2.  How well you write the email. You gotta go heavy on the pathos. Spend some time revising the email and try to run it by someone before sending it out. You need to have a good balance between convincing your professor and not being too pushy/annoying. Talk about your goals and ambitions, and how important passing this class is for you. 

3. The reason why your failing. You can‚Äôt just ask them to bump your grade up without showing them that you‚Äôve tried your absolute best, but for whatever reason (family problems, financial instability, mental health, etc.) you came up short. It‚Äôs got to be a valid reason for it to be effective so you can use your imagination here, just don‚Äôt go over the top with it.

"I'm in a similar situation. If you see your little brother upset, have a talk with him. Some things that helped my 11yo sister: 

* parents are capable adults. They will be fine on their own
* They will still love you and care for brother
* YOU still love and care for brother
* This has nothing to do with your little brother, it's the parents' relationship and they are trying to fix problems between them. 

For kids, their parents' relationships is joined at the hip to the kid's feeling of safety and security. If the relationship looks shaky, the kid starts getting nervous and insecure. Reaffirming that they are still loved and cared for no matter what happens between the parents goes a long way.",1613873370,1,0

"So, when my partner was getting his PhD in CSE. His stipend was $39, 000 (before taxes) for ten months - funding during summer (2 months) is complicated. This was a relatively high stipend. My stipend is less than that because I am in a different field. Your stipend fully depends on the type of program (ranking, private/public) you go to. Additionally, it depends on the funding a department have. People get accepted to PhD programs but don‚Äôt receive funding offers. You are expected to TA or serve as a GSR for the stipend. My partner went to a top 10 program at a private university so that is why his stipend was very high.",1613871117,1,0

"My parents split during my sophomore year at UCSD. I was torn apart as they were my motivation to do well in school. I felt like I lost my rock and my reason to do well at UCSD. I had a close friend who went through a similar experience as me and he had me lean on him. He made sure I kept going to class, kept me going and helped me realized that I had to do well for my own future. I didn‚Äôt go home for a bit (I understand that can be difficult if you are doing classes at home over zoom) and just surrounded myself with friends. I had 2 brothers at home dealing with it and I felt guilty that they had to deal with immediate consequences while I was away at school. My biggest advice would be to keep pushing forward, be the big sister your sibling/s need (check on them, offer them a space away from home if that is available) and stay strong. I‚Äôm sure your parents are hurt themselves over the ordeal and the last thing they want to see is you struggling with it. It‚Äôs important to recognize that each of our parents are their own persons and you may have to be there for each of them. It wasn‚Äôt easy at all but you can be the rock your family needs at the moment. Stay strong and take care of yourself, wishing you the best of luck.",1613869353,1,0
"Not to sure about what you‚Äôre studying or what you plan on for a career after graduation, but maybe create your own work portfolio. Look at job posting you‚Äôre interested in and email them for volunteering opportunities. Provide independent services. Do projects and display them on GitHub or another online forum. Work in other fields just to get that work experience. If none of these apply, find anything that does.

I understand how hard and maybe ‚Äúnot as prestigious‚Äù that may be, but getting your foot out there and networking will help you out in the long run. Most jobs now a days are through word of mouth and recommendations. As a low-income first generation student, you learn to get creative. 

I understand the imposter syndrome, the culture shock, the stress with taking care of undocumented parents, the resentment towards other students and even on rare occasions our own family. And I can only empathize with your citizen status. It‚Äôs also hard because we feel this expectation to go back and help our communities and our families, and feel shame when we dream of leaving to chase our own interests or when we don‚Äôt find the success we hoped we‚Äôd have.

You have 1-2 years left of college. It‚Äôs never too late to start networking or talking to other students in the same situations. Maybe this wasn‚Äôt the advice you were looking for, or this was a something you already knew. Just know that you got this, focus on your mental health and yourself, and start getting creative.",1613868543,1,0

"Hello! I apologize if I ever implied Webreg was third party, I was simply trying to share the info that I had on the specific issue. Webreg is homegrown, but ITS only manages certain elements of it. We were having people contacting us angry when there was literally nothing we could do, as the mistake wasn‚Äôt on our end. Additionally, I was trying to share that the department responsible for the error, the Registrar, was hard at work fixing it. 

A good way to think about the issue would be Microsoft developing Excel, and then a company using Excel to create an equation but accidentally selecting the wrong cell and causing the equation to be wrong. Microsoft is unable to fix that issue, as Excel did exactly what it was told to do and worked correctly.

My boyfriend got covid during finals week last quarter, which while stressful isn't anything near the magnitude of losing a parent. I contacted my dean &amp; she helped me contact professors to help make a plan to complete the classes and very much had my back through the whole process. They can also help refer you to counseling if that's something you think would be helpful. 
Logistics aside, I'm so sorry that you're going through this and that your professors aren't being supportive of you. They're asshole if they expect you to carry on with academics as usual when you're dealing with such a traumatic event. It's NORMAL for grief to get in the way of life! You are not weak for struggling to function- you are human, and you deserve to have the time and space to mourn.",1613865099,1,0

"I am not a PhD in MAE. But I do want to say this, only go for a PhD if it is absolutely necessary for the job you have in mind. I also have a MS and a PhD was necessary for my career goals but this process is rough. PhD programs in the US are minimum five years (even with a MA/MS unless it is from the same institution) unless you are a superstar. PhD programs can range from 5-7 years. It is mentally exhausting and really weeds those out that are the best of the best. Being smart isn‚Äôt sufficient enough to succeed as a PhD student, everyone is smart. 

Main point: don‚Äôt do it unless it is absolutely necessary for the job you want. If you have academia in mind, just know that the job market is complete shit for that.",1613863664,1,0

"My parents divorced when I was young (5-6) and its definitely had a lasting impact on my life. Especially with things you don't necessarily think about like holiday BS and having to think about appeasing everyone. As I've gotten older, I have tried my best to not give into any of that crap (I've taken up the Clint Eastwood grumble approach over the years haha). Right now your studies are the most important thing. You have to be responsible for yourself first! Your parents will always be there and they want you to be successful. Do NOT give into taking sides or playing into the divorce game (its not a game worth playing). My advice, focus on your studies and if you can take a weekend a month and get your brother out of the house or facetime him. That gives you both a breather and you have the perfect person to share with and push a positive atmosphere. Its better to be there for your parents after the fact than in the moment.

I had seen my parents fight, but when they got divorced it felt like they became something different, more human. I was lucky in that my parents divorce was as amicable as it could be, and I hope the same for you. 

My best advice for coping is to think about your life and future. It might seem selfish but this is a transition point, your parents relationship is changing and you‚Äôre changing too. I stopped thinking of family as me being a child to my parents and more about every close relationship I had, my friends and roommates. I also thought about the life I was creating for myself here in San Diego (I stopped referring to ‚Äúhome‚Äù as my home town, and instead SD). Family as you hold it in your memories is changing, but it also changes for the better as you enter new relationships in your life.

"Commenting from a PhD student in chem perspective (so take my opinion as just an opinion) I don't think you could really go wrong either way. Anyone saying that you are crazy is ignorant, these are both top schools both nationally and globally. They are both roughly around the same prestige (maybe Penn is a little bit higher but I don't know offhand) but honestly the only major differences will be weather and research topics, which I'm sure there will probably be lots of overlap in research and you should be able to find a suitable advisor in either school.

 I will say this, if you're looking for reasons to commit to San Diego the graduate education is top tier (undergrad suffers a bit since the university is research focused, I won't speak for UPENN but I'd imagine it might suffer the same issues) and there are plenty of university resources to help build your ""soft skills"" (teaching, public speaking, writing, networking, etc). I'm sure Penn is pretty comparable in all of these (except the year round warm weather), so if you decide to change your mind you'll probably be just fine. That being said, San Diego as a city also offers a wide diversity of great food, amazing breweries, lots of outdoor activities, etc which will make grad school in general more bearable. You will be driving distance to plenty of tourist attractions (LA, amusement parks, National parks, etc) and not to mention you are walking distance to some beautiful beaches (there's a reason why La Jolla translates to the jewel). I'll drop the same advice that my Master's PI told me when I was choosing PhD programs, if schools are roughly the same in prestige and education, choose the school that will be in the area more aligned in your interests outside of your college since you are committing a few years of your life to a place.",1620235155,6,0
"The Econ major is relatively light in terms of total coursework, so yes you would be able to fit in a DS or CS minor (I believe the CS minor requires less courses).

"I suspect that the source you are using to get the (median) earnings of Econ graduates is flawed (sampling issues, other methodological issues,etc). UCSD's economics department is considerably better than UCSB's (both are good however), and the Econ degree at UCSD forces you to take 3 courses in Econometrics as opposed to 1 at other schools. This quantitative focus should actual make your skills more desirable. As for jobs with an Economics degree it really depends because the Degree is more of a skill set and you need to decide what you want to pursue. Neither school is a target for the big financial firms/investment banking/etc so if you want to pursue that you will have to network a lot. However, with an Economics degree you can work in insurance, consulting, Data analytics, business analytics, etc. I would recommend potentially minoring in Data Science or CS to get exposure to programming because it will open more doors for you jobs/pay wise. Keep in mind that UCSD's economics department offers multiple degrees: Econ BA, Math-Econ B.S, Management Science B.S, and Business Economics (BA I believe). Econ BA is just the traditional Economics degree, where you get exposure to the 3 main branches of econ (micro, macro, and Econometrics), and then choose what other classes you are interested in. Management Science is basically the Econ BA with more Math (I believe it requires Linear Algebra in addition to Single and Multivariable calculus), and with some finance courses mixed in. The Math-Econ degree is a joint degree that prepares you for graduate school in Economics or Statistics (requires rigorous proof based math courses such as real analysis). Business Econ is new so I'm not entirely sure what it is like. Feel free to pm me if you have any questions",1620234447,8,0

"From reading your post it sounds to me that you really want to do computer science but are willing to settle for cogsci because you're in love with our campus. Trust me when I say that you're going to be miserable if you're settling for a different major just to be at ucsd. There are a ton of people who decide to come here as undeclared thinking they can get into cse with a backup major that they'd be ""okay"" with getting a degree in. While some people can find passion with their other major, I'd argue that a non-insignificant amount of people will get disappointed and frustrated with the university and constantly agonize about having to study something they're not even interested in for the remainder of undergrad. Don't risk this happening to you if you end up not liking cogsci. You have an opportunity to go to UCI with a scholarship and your desired major where you'll be treated like a king or queen.",1617499101,1,0

"&gt; We have to use shitty software that barely works (thanks moneta) and is a pain to use.

Their solution to this problem was to ""increase resources to your docker image"" which made everything even slower and essentially made the lab impossible to finish.  

Moneta and the worksheet-based labs are the biggest pain point for me.

My orchestra (the Intermission Orchestra; google us if you want, we play video game/anime music!!) is a very welcoming environment for freshman (we crave new members lol) so it was really helpful for making friends as someone who's super socially awkward. It required a lot of dedication to the orchestra as well as always attending the weekly social (Convoy street dinner after rehearsals, hell yeah), but I got close to some of the people I met and I'd consider them my friends. One of them is even my roommate now! We're not *super* close but it's absolutely a step up for me compared to how I was last year in terms of friendships lol.

The datamatch thing was kinda funny: the guy I met and had a few dates with ended up not being interested in me (which was fine since I realized I wasn't ready for a relationship at that point anyway oof), but he introduced me to some people at a board game club meeting and I hit it off with a few of them and now we're friends (even if just online atm, sighhh)

"I got diagnosed with ADHD when I was 7 and I‚Äôve been taking concerta (a stimulant similar to Adderall) for the vast majority of my life. Taking any stimulant meant for ADHD treatment is going to have intense effects especially if you don‚Äôt have ADHD yourself. For people with ADHD, my medication gives me enough control over my own mind to pay attention to maybe half an hour of a lecture straight, and that‚Äôs on a good day (this is largely a result of the online learning format we‚Äôve been dealing with and I also take a very low dose of my medication). Our medication is designed to get our brains to the same standard functioning level of people without ADHD. However, when you take this kind of stimulant without ADHD, not only can it create a dangerous level of hyperfocus (like with your roommate), but it can also be addictive. That, along with the very intense side effects of not feeling hungry/being nauseous (and likely some heightened anxiety), is what leads me to recommend people without ADHD to not take Adderall. Yes, you can focus, but you‚Äôre basically just taking Cocaine Lite‚Ñ¢. It‚Äôs dangerous to take this kind of stimulant if your brain doesn‚Äôt need it, not to mention the common recreational use of Adderall is part of what makes it so hard for those of us who actually need it to get a hold of it. 

If you are taking it though (prescription or not), seriously be wary of the effect it has on your appetite. You WILL feel like shit after a while because you‚Äôre hungry, but you won‚Äôt be able to feel that hunger or the thought of eating anything will make you extremely nauseous. I almost never ate lunch at school as a kid precisely because of this. (Some pro tips from someone who‚Äôs been dealing with this side effect for 13 years: keep plain crackers and protein shakes on hand. The idea of eating a normal meal might make you want to puke, but you can usually force yourself to drink a protein shake or eat some ritz crackers. The hardest part is eating the first few bites, once you‚Äôve eaten a tiny bit and taken time to let it settle the nausea will get a lot better and you‚Äôll be able to eat more). 

Also avoid things heavy in caffeine if you‚Äôre taking it. Drinking a large iced coffee with your meds is going to make you feel like a giant ball of high strung anxiety for the rest of the day.",1617052221,1,0

The registrar cant really do anything. In most departments the professors typically dont actually control enrollment in their classes either. What they will want to do is contact the department advisor for each class that they are trying to get back into and see if the department is able to help them enroll. They should also contact their major advisor (if its not the same) to find out if there are any alternative classes that have open seats that they can add.,1617051318,1,0
Email the professor and ask to audit it.,1617051282,1,0

"I absolutely love taking the dance classes here but that was pre-covid haha. I‚Äôm not sure how they‚Äôve been online tho. I enrolled in TDMV 143 (West African Dance) this quarter and even though on webreg its listed as remote, I heard the prof really wants to do it in person (don‚Äôt quote me on that tho haha). Still haven‚Äôt heard anything from the prof even tho the class is today lol, but if you‚Äôre interested check out the dance classes (not just TDMV 143) I think they still have some spots!",1617051122,1,0
"&gt;Data Science: This is NOT a substitute for CS

I really have to say here that the DSC lower division sequence is literally ripped directly from CSE classes, so‚Ä¶

There is a lot more CS than Math. There's only two classes I've taken (183 and 189) that are predominantly statistics. The rest have been programming, algorithm theory, SQL, ML/AI etc.

Having looked over both curricula extensively I'd really say that it's similar to CS in the first two years and focuses more on ML/AI/actual Data Science in the last two.",1617051041,1,0

is it true that incoming freshmen‚Äôs have to dorm for their first year if they‚Äôre 50 miles out? and if so how expensive is it and would it be cheaper than renting an apartment with a couple roommates?,1617048632,1,0
"When did you enroll in the class? Classes can take 24 hours to be added to Canvas after enrollment. If you really want you can try calling ITS, but the technical issues tend to be professors not knowing how to publish their course since people are added to Canvas automatically.",1617048521,1,0
If you‚Äôre aware that this is a possibility you should probably already plan ahead and start trying to get into new courses just in case and drop them if things work out better.,1617048325,1,0
Since classes are online you are not able to really sit in on lectures like you would be if you were waitlisted for an in person class. Because of that I think people on the waitlist are added to the canvas pages temporarily. I believe you‚Äôll be able to access the class until the waitlist ends week 2 unless you are added to the class via confirmation from webreg.,1617048172,2,0
"I just did and they said that i would be dropped from the class if I receive a non-passing grade for the prerequisite course, which I most likely will. But they said that I can stay enrolled if the grade is still empty because of the AI issue. So now I‚Äôm wondering when my blank grade will be updated so that I can plan ahead and not be dropped from two courses and suddenly become part-time",1617047796,1,0
"Usually freshmen will live in the res halls. From personal experience, in a suite there will be 4 singles for 4 people and 2 triples for 6 people (pre-covid). As long as you mark yourself as wanting a single on the housing application, that's the best chance you can give yourself.",1617047726,1,0

"I took PSYC 60 and COGS 18 in two separate quarters but I think I can give you some insight into what COGS 18 was like. The class wasn't too bad for someone like me (a beginner in Python with no prior coding experience). I took COGS 18 last spring with Professor Ellis, she's great btw (currently taking her again this quarter for COGS 108). There are a lot of resources for help whenever you're struggling (OHs, review sessions, piazza, discord, etc). If you go through with taking class, you can dm me if you have any other questions about the class or dm me if you are struggling with a certain assignment and I can see if I can help you :).

"There are a ton of people who love online school and are thriving right now. Many of my friends have had 4.0 GPAs each quarter since going online with much more free time for their personal lives or to apply to tech internships. I love not having to pay San Diego rent, because now my scholarship money actually covers school so I don't have to work two jobs just to survive, and most of my working class friends are in a similar boat.

The thing is, happy people aren't making posts on Reddit every two days about how happy they are, so there's a strong bias in what you see on Reddit and other social media.",1617046727,1,0

"2015 PC with a GPU that was budget even when it was new (GTX 960), so it‚Äôs pretty bad for gaming now. Mostly finished my new one in 2020, but not done completely because of the GPU shortage. 2016 MacBook Pro also starting to show its age and will probably be replaced with the new gen ARM MacBook Pro coming out later this year. So I guess overall it‚Äôs 5 years on average for me. That being said, I can afford to make these upgrades every 5. If I couldn‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt buy them and would recommend anybody to stretch their computer to the limit instead of buying something they really shouldn‚Äôt be spending money on unless there‚Äôs no other choice.",1611060149,2,0
