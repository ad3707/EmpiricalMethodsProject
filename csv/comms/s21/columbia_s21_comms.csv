"I'm not going to lie. As a black student, I find this extremely disconcerting and disappointing. The black community already faces enough stigma as it is without reinforcing this stereotypical narrative that black people use drugs. I don't know a single person in my family who has done drugs. I've never even done weed, and I also don't drink. However, I've seen the catastrophic consequences imposed by drug addiction and abuse within the black community. 

Black faculty members are already highly underrepresented - *especially* at elite institutions. Why does one of the few from that small pool have to advocate for illegal substances that were intentionally planted in black communities decades ago and resulted in disasterous social, political, and economic consequences that still persist today? Why can't he use his platform and influence to talk about the history of drugs in minority communities and *debunk* racists myths instead of promulgating them? 

Honestly, it makes me feel distrusting of the University. Who pushed him out there into the public eye? Who enabled this project in the first place? It's like the executives who push mumble rappers out there, when historically, black music was extremely diverse, intricate, and complex (Jazz, for example). It just seems like there is something inconspicuously more sinister going on behind the scenes, and I hope someone gets to the bottom of this.",1612749420,1,0

"Fair fair, I mean it’s challenging to think through. Everything you said is correct but deals with how responsible/irresponsible what Dr. Hart is sharing. I think he’s trying to make a claim about what drugs are in themselves which is contrary to how most people have been taught to perceive them in the wake of the war on drugs. So his point isn’t that you should go out and do heroin but that the way you have been taught to think about it is largely contingent. This is probably a point of agreement for you and Dr. Hart, since you said his use of heroin is qualitatively different from someone else’s because of his material well being.",1612740581,1,0

"This is exactly an issue of exploitive hiring practices being used to pressure new and inexperienced applicants to accept unfair wages, that's literally the point of exploding offers. They prevent an applicant from being able to gauge what their fair market value is, and they reframe weighing competing job offers into weighing a shitty job offer vs. the possibility of no job at all. They prey on that fear to pressure applicants to say yes. 

The bottom line is that if you force someone to make a choice before they know what all their options are, this is what's going to happen. The company has created a system where applicants maximize their EV by accepting exploding offers as a safety net and then reneg if a better offer comes later. OP is just playing the game they were given. 

Also, the career office policy is to not work with companies who use exploding offers, but they did it anyways and now they're backing that company instead of siding with OP, which perfectly illustrates why OP doesn't owe them anything. The university isn't here to protect you, and your employers definitely aren't here to protect you. The only person who will prioritize you and look out for you is yourself, and you're trying to shame OP for taking a better career opportunity under some vague guise of ""the greater good"".",1612376309,2,0
"I'm not defending that company in particular, I really don't have a stake in this. Put your pitchfork down.

Nobody forced OP to accept that offer--there's no exploitation or ""fair wage"" issue here. OP received an offer and decided to accept it.

"What a ridiculous take. No one should be expected to prioritize what helps large faceless institutions and companies over themselves. Is this company or the university going to cover the difference in salary and benefits? Because if not, then they're not looking out for what's best for OP, and OP doesn't need to look out for them. They're also engaging in exploitive hiring practices (exploding offers) to force OP's hand, and this is the consequence of trying to force people to accept your lowball offer before they can consider other offers and gauge what their fair market value is. This is 100% self inflicted by the company, and it's going to keep happening to them regardless of what different university career offices do unless they up their compensation to a fair level and stop using exploding offers.

Also, comparing not wearing masks during a pandemic to prioritizing yourself over some company that doesn't give a shit about you apart from how much value they can extract from your labor is laughable. Not letting oneself be exploited for lower wages isn't selfishness, and dragging ""American selfishness"" into this as a talking point just shows your own personal biases.

Finally, no one is going to stop recruiting from Columbia, whether they do it officially through the career center or not. If this was some small local community college whose entire existence is predicated on job placement you might have almost made a good point, but in Columbia's case it's totally irrelevant.",1612373670,14,0

"I'm a CS major and I just did a language study abroad over my freshman summer and was heavily contemplating it for a full semester before covid ruined that. 

If you have the room, I would honestly recommend doing a ""non-stem"" study abroad. Trying to match curriculum requirements for your major combined with the language barriers would make taking a lot of CS classes very difficult imo (unless you're already close to or natively fluent in a second language, or going to an English speaking country). Choosing to not focus on CS helped me reset and broaden my horizons a lot, and gave me the opportunity to explore and do lots of cool things instead of being shut in a library or dorm room grinding out coding assignments. I'm not super familiar with the SEAS core requirements, but if you have language requirements and/or global core type stuff that you can knock out abroad I would recommend you consider doing that. 

The other big advantage was that since I wasn't getting burned out by CS related classwork, I was able to do some programming in my free time and really enjoy it. I just focused on learning some new technologies and working on a pet project.

This was a problem for us because we turn down other candidates after someone accepts an offer. Consequently, we don't recruit there anymore. This isn't hypothetical.

"This course is taught by legendary Prof. Massimimo. It‘s quite popular - not Computer Vision popular, but there‘s enough people applying to the class that the professor has to deny quite a few students. That being said, he‘s an incredibly sweet person and just does this because in the past he just did first-come-first-serve which lead to half of the class just taking it bc of his fame, not bc they actually care about the course content. He wants to avoid that and that‘s why you have to explain why you‘re interested in this class before he lets you in.

About the course itself: usually attendance is mandatory (lectures are so entertaining though that it‘s absolutely worth it), and you‘ll have weekly hws most of the semester. Instead of exams there‘s an open-ended group project for which you basically get to design a tool/system/... for ISS. Tons of fun if you‘re a space nerd (usually most of the class is). Workload really depends on you - you can dedicate tons of time to work on the hws &amp; the project, but you don‘t have to.

 (I think most heroin users would agree with him actually), that doesn't mean its a good idea or a healthy habit. Especially since it seems like he's using it to mask or distract from what seem like pretty serious mental health issues. In various parts of the article, he describes it as partly recreational... but also medicinal.... Not a big deal, like a hobby... But also a life-saver, that he's been chemically dependent on... But he only does it sometimes... Well, except to the point of using every day and having to go through withdrawals...

"This is spot on. For someone who seems to be so intelligent when it comes to neuroscience, this is an unbelievably naive view. 

I was a heroin addict for many years. Luckily, thanks to a strong support system, I was able to pull myself out of that hole. However, many of my friends that I grew up with were not and still suffer with addiction to this day. Many have died. I am still on suboxone to this day, almost ten years later. While I no longer live the life of an addict, I do not know if I will ever be free of the chains cast upon me by opiates.

Heroin and other hard drugs are a very slippery slope. At first, you always think that you can have it under control. But, for most people, that is not the case. 

It is quite possible that he is able to do this drug sparingly as a recreational hobby, but that is not the case for many people. He is a highly intelligent, educated, tenured COLUMBIA professor with a sound understanding of how drugs work. Many people do not have those privileges and there are many people out there with addictive tendencies, nonexistent support systems, mental illness, or shitty life situations. What about them? Are hard drugs still a good idea for them? 

And I am not anti-drug in any way. I still use certain drugs recreationally from time to time. I thin that some drugs (particularly psychedelics) can even have great therapeutic value when used in the correct way, in sound mind or under careful guidance.

"addiction is hyper-contextual and negative outcomes are the convergence of literally all of the structural, institutional, interpersonal, socio-economic, political economy etc.  While I commend him for doing his thing - I don’t think non-addiction would be applicable for most in the context of continued heroin use, as generally substance use is not just a thought that occurs one morning.  The pathway to buying heroin is likely one wrought with many other circumstances and it would likely be rare that that individual was just thriving.  Although, truly random engagement is possible - I think promotion of this line of thought could be dangerous as its lacking context of the support systems in place to allow for such use to be non-destructive.  Also, one can never know if it has in fact caused detriment (visible or invisible) to this prof.  I don’t have a psychology background, so I’m speaking more sociologically.

"Nobody (who wasn't already going to procure heroin regardless) is just randomly going to stop by their pharmacy to pick some up on their way home.

It's been shown that steps towards legalization, like what's been done in Portugal, have been effective at diminishing instances of substance abuse and furthering access to treatment for addicts.

Disappointing to see people here argue for the status quo by continuing to sweep the problem under the rug because it's a polarizing, stigmatizing issue. All that does is enable the cartels to further profit off our country's ills.

Legalization would provide for a safe, cheap, and effective means for addicts to obtain their drugs without having to worry about the safety of the drugs they're consuming or furthering crimes against society to fund their habit.

Hey, yeah

Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in
A couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no"" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
Screw it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow, you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growing up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysittin' for Hailie while Hailie's out gettin' smashed

‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

If that's the case, then sure, maybe he's a rare exception who can handle an opioid habit without letting it affect his productivity. 

But that doesn't sound like the case in the rest of the article. I've been around people after a couple beers and also people on heroin. You can have a couple beers and enjoy a movie with your wife, or smoke a little weed and cook dinner and clean up afterwards. Those aren't really things you can do on heroin, at least at the dosages that would get you ""high"". He mentioned that he doesn't do heroin ""every day,"" ""anymore"". That's pretty concerning... I like to de-stress with a beer after work, but I don't do it *every day,* and definitely not to the point that I need to snort sedatives to get through withdrawals. 

He sounds like a heroin user in denial. And yes, I know there are functional alcoholics and functional drug users out there, but ""functional"" doesn't mean you're better with the drug than without it, or that your friends and family prefer to have you on heroin then without it. Just because he can teach his classes without falling apart doesn't mean much.",1613848853,1,0
"I mean, he's a tenured professor, which means he's basically unfireable. He would not be open about this if there was any chance that he'd lose his job.

That being said, it's only been five or so years since he first tried heroin and he built his entire career while sober before that, so there's no way to know whether he would have been able to get to where he is today as a recreational user.

Let’s also not act like heroin is the only option for coping with adversity. This is bad and he needs reason and to think more about the long run and how sustainable this is. 

On a completely different note (not that different I guess) I do think decriminalizing drugs is important and we should move towards that but legalizing hard drugs it’s just dumb and again I think you only reach that conclusion by being addicted to them.",1613832216,1,0

Well... that doesn't sound like a super healthy way to live. I consider myself pretty open-minded; I've done my fair share of substances over the years and believe that rehabilitation is far superior to criminal charges for drug-related offenses (should be the only option, really). But I don't think everyone can be a Carl Hart. I don't even think Carl Hart can be a Carl Hart for very long; he says he first tried heroin six years ago when he was already tenured and has already had to go through withdrawal more than once, so it's not like he's balanced a long career with decades of heroin use. 

I don't know, reading his statement made me think of when I was in Los Angeles with a group of hippie friends that had discovered psychedelics some years back. They all talked about how much better they were feeling, how they could totally function on a low dose of mushrooms forever, how a line or two of cocaine totally removed the grogginess after if taken in the AM. They talked about how their day jobs wouldn't find out because they were ""stealth"" and besides, hallucinogens weren't physically addictive so they weren't like some scummy drug addict. 

Well... 10 years later, not a single one of them is still doing hallucinogens and cocaine regularly *and* balancing their lives. Some went all the way to a functional and relatively drug-free life (realized that being under the influence was making them number and dumber over time), others never crawled out of Venice beach and are fully immersed. Can't get more than a few sentences out of them.

 I'm keeping my mind open to his theory, but unless he has a fix for addiction and dependence, I don't think *promoting* a heroin habit is a great thing.",1613829300,1,0

"As a 2nd BA, you would be applying to the School of General Studies. The most credits that will transfer is 60, which leaves at least 64 credits left to finish a second degree. Included in that, you will also need to complete the Columbia core, though some of your classes will count toward it. [http://bulletin.columbia.edu/general-studies/the-core/](http://bulletin.columbia.edu/general-studies/the-core/)

I'll give myself as an example because I'm a 2nd BA in Math-Stats (though with 30 years, not 3 months, between degrees):

* Language - I took through Intermediate in college, so I didn't need to take this.
* University Writing - despite having many English classes, still had to take (and am still angry over)
* Music and Art Hum - still had to take
* Literature - required that I take 1 lit class at Columbia
* Global Core - I have to take 2, but that is I took upper level electives in American Studies and Western European studies, if I had chosen other classes, they probably would have transferred
* Contemporary Civilization - I had transfer credits that covered it
* Science and quantitative reasoning - my transfer credits covered it

Which is a long-winded way of saying that if you think you will just come in and take Math classes, that probably won't happen. I had 6 Core classes in addition to my major to take (which leaves no electives at all).

Another consideration is the prerequisites for the Math classes. If you haven't had Math through Calc 4 and Linear Algebra, you will be starting there. Here are the major requirements for Math: [http://bulletin.columbia.edu/general-studies/majors-concentrations/mathematics/#requirementstext](http://bulletin.columbia.edu/general-studies/majors-concentrations/mathematics/#requirementstext)

And, finally, how many Math classes do want to/can you take at once? Math is no joke at Columbia. My own limit for quantitative classes per semester is 3 and that's pushing it.

I won't comment on your chances for admission, because it seems to be a little mysterious, but your credentials are impressive. Good luck with whatever you choose. I too chose to strengthen my grad school application by getting the 2nd BA. I only regret that maybe 25% of the time.",1614858449,1,0

"My parents arent going into debt. I just feel bad they're spending all that money.

And also, I used to care what they would feel like when they saw me dead, but I realized it's not worth forcing myself to live the next 30 or 40 years in suffering just so that I don't commit while they're still alive. If I stay alive, and they don't suffer, I still suffer.

Now, it is true that I would feel bad if they suffer. But that's the best part, I won't have to feel bad. I'll be dead. There is no feeling. Its nothing. No suffering, no emotions.",1614809526,2,0
"Hey congratulations!

This is my first semester as a GS transfer. I’m living around West Harlem/Manhattanville.

I haven’t ran into any problems in the neighborhood. It’s nice being close to riverside park also for my pup.

"I think they’d rather have a large debt and a living son doing a job that makes him satisfied, even if it’s just being a teacher and playing video games. Unless you think they would prefer to get a call as they’re going to sleep that their son is dead and they need to come identify the body. Then they have to go look at your lifeless corpse on a gurney in some morgue, screaming and crying and blaming *themselves* for *your* decision. They do everything they can their entire lives to raise a good kid and give him a good opportunity to be successful, and their reward is a 20 year old lifeless corpse, family and friends never being able to look at them the same “The family with the dead son” is all they’ll be. They’ll never be happy ever again, not in any real way. 

So instead of even *considering* ending your life, take stock of what you have, what you don’t, what you want and what you need. Do the work of figuring out what you need to do to get what you want. Do the work of figuring out what you want. It sounds like you want to make sure your parents investment into you doesn’t go to waste. It sounds like you don’t want a life of extravagance, you just want something simple. And since you’re at a school like Columbia, it sounds like your smart enough to figure this stuff out, if you really challenge yourself to. 

It’s not gonna be easy. It’ll probably be pretty miserable. But you should try, because you’ll always be able to kill yourself, and ruin your parents lives forever. That option will always be available. So try some other stuff out first. Hell, try not giving a fuck. Skip class for a week and be irresponsible. That’s less permanent than a hole in the back of your head.

In Prof. Yang's course a year ago, he specifically cited students should SELF-STUDY from the edX materials - [https://www.cs.columbia.edu/\~junfeng/20sp-w4156/](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/20sp-w4156/) .

"My room and board was calculated at around 25k. And that is absolutely correct. I lived in NYC prior to GS and rent w/roommates anywhere decent was 900-1100 rent and another $250-350 in food and utilities+ transportation so $1350/mo but $1500-1700/mo to be safe IMO. 
I really don’t like the word dangerous. I mean the university is in the largest city in the country. Millions live here and are fine, I walk my dog in Harlem at 9pm and feel FINE. I grew up in a city though so it varies on how safe you feel. 
For many people The city is a part of the allure. People live in the Bronx, Brooklyn, right near campus and are fine. Many never step outside the “bubble” and are fine. I suggest researching the city and what “dangerous” means to you. Some people get here and really do not like NYC, research.

Some folks live in riverdale in the Bronx, others scatter across Brooklyn, and some live in jersey. Just depends on what your vibe and budget are plus how you feel about a commute.

&gt;**Drop requests must be completed no later than Tuesday, February 16 at 9:00 p.m**. As you may know, dropping a class at this point in the term is a two-phase process: 1.)

Think about what it means to be African American, Asian American, Latin American, lgbtq etc. You’re part of a community of shared culture and heritage that lets you come together with likeminded people to celebrate in a constructive way. These groups came to this country, sometimes by force, and were oppressed for generations. Of course they’re going to develop a community worth being proud of. White people came here from Europe, and they have every right that these other communities have to celebrate their heritage. Italian American, polish American, German American, all of that cultural history and background is worth being celebrated, but you cant pretend like that’s what you mean when you say “white history” or “white pride.” These European cultures often time hated each other and have very little to share culturally. There’s no common white pride there. but when you celebrate just being white you’re ignoring that history and replacing it with the idea that you’re proud you’re not a minority.

this is because the numbering system was also changed in 2018(?) or so, such that the cutoff numbers you see on bwog/daily spectator aren't really accurate anymore (although they can still give a general idea of what dorms are popular). when the time comes, you can use [theshaft.info](https://theshaft.info)'s  calculator that translates the new numbering system into the old one. luckily, none of this matters for incoming freshmen!",1617051592,1,0

"Personally, I would consider grabbing a beginner's course book for the language you are most interested in, start studying over the summer, and then take the class during the Fall.

Out of curiosity, what languages do you speak other than English? Also, which of the three languages do you interact with most on a day-to-day basis? This is critical, because a language that you interact with a lot will give more speaking/listening practice; feel free to also include media like pop-music, TV shows in this category.

I studied Chinese (Mandarin) for 4 years and I had a lot of fun with it. The problem with Chinese though; you need to figure out which dialect you want to study (Mandarin is the go to but Cantonese and Wu/Shanghainese are equally important.) Generally, people start with Mandarin. With Chinese, there's also a lot of memorization of grammar patterns and you will likely have to learn to different systems of characters (Traditional and Simplified). That being said, Chinese would probably be the easiest to do in terms of logistics, we have very large Chinese population in NYC, but most people speak dialects other than Mandarin.

I'm also tied between Japanese/Korean. First year Japanese isn't too bad, but when you advance to the next level, you're going to have to deal with honorifics and learning new grammar structures for addressing individuals of different ranks/statuses. With Japanese, you will also have to learn 3 different systems of writing, the first two being phonetic - hiragana (used for Japanese words) and katakana (used for English, foreign words). You will also have to memorize kanji, characters that share their origins in Chinese). The NYC-Tristate also has the largest concentration of Japanese expats on the East Coast, so you will have opportunities to practice with native speakers.

Unfortunately, I don't know a whole lot about the Korean language. I believe you may only need to learn one, possible two writing systems for Korean (the first being phonetic, the other similar to kanji or Chinese characters). Like Chinese and Japanese, you have a ton of opportunities to practice with native Korean speakers. Of the three languages, I've heard Korean spoken probably the most on the Morningside campus. Flushing Queens, but also Tenafly, Fort Lee, NJ have a massive Korean expat community. I would be more inclined to take Korean because it's literally just a hop, skip and a jump over the GW Bridge to practice and engage with the culture directly.",1617034544,1,0

idk it's a tough thing, like I have a pretty minority sexuality and it would be cool to date someone who has the same sexuality, but I calculated the probability with the other stuff I want and my dating pool would be like 100 people, and like it's more important to me what kinda person someone is than sexual stuff, so I guess I very likely won't end up with someone with my same sexuality! shrug, I guess we all have to make hard choices about what we want lol",1617000960,1,0

"1) You would be much better served by googling ""how to write an effective and captivating college admissions essay"" than any advice I could give :) I would mostly be repeating tips given better by others.

2) To start, I would definitely google ""accepted Columbia essays"" and read as many of them as you can to start to get an idea of what kinds of essays are interesting and inspiring to the admissions office. Themes that go over really well are generally overcoming adversity, showing how you are different or unique in some way, highlighting interesting experiences you've had in new places, and making a difference in your community.

The other important factor is clear, professional writing with near perfect spelling and grammar. I would have your high school's guidance counselor or English tutor read it over carefully before submitting it. They're judging your English abilities just as much as they're judging how your personality comes off in writing.

3) I don't remember any of the students who called our office, unfortunately. There are simply too many applicants. So it while it wouldn't annoy a staff member to answer a student's questions more than once, it would not help the student in the admissions cycle. If I was on an admission panel and vouched for a specific student just because I talked to them over the phone a few times, the board would generally consider it either irrelevant or a conflict of interest.

4) Absolutely, I believe there is a section for a video or other composition submission and those are always great ways of putting yourself forward. Keep in mind that if you're going to do a video, that a video is *visual*: the school receives a lot of ""videos"" that are just students sitting on their beds reading an essay. At that point, just submit an essay! Another thing to keep in mind that photo projects should have an intent and meaning behind them besides ""look at me with my friends"". Some students throw a bunch of ""About Me"" photos of them on vacation or with their families, but that will not help your chances of admission.

"I was quite similar to you in high school--i went to a public school that did have honors and AP, but there was never a big struggle. Studying wasn't very necessary, there wasn't any kind of competitive academic culture. 

I struggled my first year at Columbia. I thought I was going to major in physics and got a B and C in the two semesters of intro physics and didn't do awesome in my other classes. I found my stride sophomore year and did well for those last three years. 

I was pretty socially shy, but if I could recommend something that would've made freshman year more manageable for me it would be to find a group to study with. That will at least force you put the time in--and with a good work ethic like you have, you won't waste that time. Plus, just socializing a little bit in general is great for your mental health. Also don't procrastinate as much as possible. Take the breaks you need, but if you find yourself with some down time in the middle of the day and your mind feels fresh, don't waste it. 

Further, when you are in a relatively uncompetitive high school, you have a lot of free time. Once you get to college, you need to accept that you can't spend as much time chilling. Don't get me wrong, you do **need** to keep a healthy balance. 

Finally, upperclassmen and your advisor will probably tell you to take four classes your first semester or two. I let my pride get in the way and took five. This was a poor decision and taking four would've benefitted me hugely. That fifth class I took didn't contribute to my planned major nor my eventual major, it just added work that quite frankly I shouldn't have taken on. If you aren't sure which classes you want to take, sign up for five and go to them all in the first couple weeks, then drop the one you are least interested in pursuing. 

I ended up taking four classes the first semester of sophomore year and that was when I discovered how to have healthy study habits, how to balance school and life, and more. It was a godsend that I wish I'd done earlier. 

This isn't meant to be scary or worsen your fear at all. I'm trying to say that I was in a similar position and did struggle that first year, but I think with a few changes to my habits (e.g. finding a study group) and my expectations (e.g. taking four classes) I could've had a much more 'successful' first year.

So is the BA a thing for all American universities? Or is it just a Columbia thing? Or perhaps an Ivy League? Does yale, harvard etc. offer BA primarily as well? Im not worried it'll look bad I've just never seen math/science degrees with the word ""Arts"" lol

Also what do you mean by rigorous? As in its stupidly rigorous for a BA and should be a BS?

And another question (I can't find answers for this online): How does the undergraduate years in America work? I'm pretty sure in American colleges you don't declare your major until 3/4th year?

"For perspective, I'm a first year mech e major, and I've experienced Columbia only online.

I did things the wrong way--tried to take 16.5 credits first sem, 18.5 second sem. For me, it was way too much and I've just accepted that I'm my best. Having a social life has absolutely been tough. I think if I could go back I would have taken a lighter load to get used to how college is and to take time to enjoy myself.

One thing I've learned is that you have to make your well-being and social life just as large a part of your life as school. Most of my friends and I have fridays off and I've started taking that day to do absolutely nothing but fun stuff.

I have to go to my German 101 class and write about a transgender German figure for a homework assignment... 

or have the same German professor apologize for the use of the 3 grammatical genders (m, f, n) and preach her acknowledgement of gender fluidity...

or have a CC teacher push gender theory and the Communist manifesto down my throat while skipping MAJOR western civilization philosophy books...

Or have students in my CC class try to cancel CC for having strictly Western philosophy books rather than include Eastern philosophy books for the sake of diversity (while the focus of the fucking course is Western Philosophy)...

or hear that “black people (or any other racial minority) can’t be racist” (language is a human invention... If you wanna make this argument, you can...but if we can all agree that hating other people based on race is unethical and can be exhibited by ANY individual of ANY color... expect this kind of argument to burn more bridges than it builds)

or see student BLM protestors HOUNDING at white kids for using the term “people of color” instead of “black people”... 

or have a JJ’s worker harassed by a student for letting a song that says ‘nigga’ play on the loud speaker... 

or have a microecon teacher go on a rant about the gender wage gap and provide no room for counterargument...

or have a mattress girl #MeToo a kid who had PROOF of her making the move on him, yet still ruining his name...

or have an insecure gay kid try to record you and call you “homophobic” for doing an impression of a white girl... 

Or if someone whose not black happens to be walking in the historically black building and gets told “what the fuck are YOU doing here?”...

Or have a kid pull the race card on a CS professor, saying “ARE YOU CALLING ME OUT CAUSE IM HISPANIC?” after clearly caught cheating on the final exam and getting away with it...

People like you are the issue if you hear a buzz word that immediately triggers your “YOU’RE A RACIST!” card. This student body is insane. These kids will do ANYTHING to obtain a higher position of power, pull any card out of their asses and you won’t ever acknowledge that.

"I  have a free app on my phone (called Time Recording) that lets me log  how much time I spend on different activities. I used it to track the  amount of time I spent on different core components of the MBA  experience (classwork, careers, and community) during my first two  semesters at CBS (Fall 2020 and Spring 2021).

Notes:

1. ""MBA  classwork"" includes not only classwork, but also learning team  meetings, academic modules, course registration, studying for + taking  exams, reviewing notes, and readings (essentially anything related to  academics/class). However, it does **not** include time I spent in class, which was normally \~15 hours/week when classes were in session.
2. Networking/careers included coffee chats, career-related research, LinkedIn, emails, and career-related club events.
3. Social/community  data was not tracked before 11/5/2020. The data includes both online  and in-person social events, not just with classmates but also with  family members, friends, and housemates. It also included dating.
4. I took the same number of credits (16.5 each) during my first and 2nd semesters.
5. The X axis labels should read ""Week of semester"" instead of ""Week started"".
6. Our spring semester started/ended much earlier than normal this year due to COVID. The fall semester was longer in part because I had a core class that started before regular classes.

There are tons of caveats to this data, including:

1. Time  recording was not precise. Classwork hours are probably inflated  because I wasn't always 100% focused on schoolwork. Other categories may  be underreported due to forgetting to log time in my Time Recording  app.
2. Your  mileage may vary! I took academics pretty seriously (despite trying to  remind myself that ""grades don't matter."" Because I'm most interested in  nonprofit work, my 1st semester recruiting experience was pretty light  compared to students who were fully immersed in on-campus recruiting for  investment banking and consulting (although I did do some on-campus  recruiting for consulting as well). I accepted an internship offer in  late February, so my careers/networking hours dropped off pretty  significantly after that.

"I'd also add to stay far back away from the edge of the subway platform. Maybe I'm paranoid, but every once in a while, someone gets pushed. Also, sit in the same subway car as the conductor when it's late. It's in the middle of the platform. You can identify it by a sign that looks like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=subway+conductor+point&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiOrKmhtLHwAhXKK6wKHUdtCdQQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=subway+conductor+point&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIECAAQGDoECAAQHjoGCAAQBRAeOgYIABAIEB5Q2T5Y9UZg60doAHAAeACAAWOIAYsEkgEBNpgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nwAEB&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=U_eRYM62MMrXsAXH2qWgDQ&amp;bih=725&amp;biw=709&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS864US864#imgrc=GwZ-lNeXXzfsMM). 

What's expensive is relative, but don't overspend on rent unless you really can afford it. 

Don't grocery shop at Westside or Morton Williams. It's highway robbery if you ask me. I don't know where you'll be living, but find a good neighborhood grocery store or go to Trader Joe's. Avoid Gristedes as well. 

Get the monthly metrocard, but Uber if it's late and you're a woman. 

Avoid empty subway cars. Pay attention to when other people suddenly leave a subway car (if you're a woman) because you don't want to be alone in one. Be aware of your surroundings and don't look lost. 

Avoid side streets/poorly lit areas at night. Avoid parks after the sun sets. 

Dress properly for the weather. I used to try to be cute during the winter. I've wised up since then. Get a good, warm coat, and good quality shoes. 

Take advantage of the city and all it has to offer, especially when it's warm. If you're in Manhattan, make sure you visit the outer boroughs. Try to leave Morningside Heights at least once a week. For the Bronx, you can visit Van Cortland Park, Wave Hill, City Island, the Lit Bar (an independent black-owned book store), and Arthur Avenue (the Bronx's Little Italy). Queens has a ton of great restaurants from pretty much every culture that you can imagine. I don't know Staten Island well, but Enoteca Maria is an Italian restaurant run by nonnas from different regions and sounds pretty cool. I left Brooklyn and Manhattan out because they're more obvious.

Ignore strangers. Don't smile at strangers. If someone looks sketchy, make getting away from them your priority. Don't worry about being polite. Just trust your gut. 

Going out is expensive. Pregame at home if you're not rich! Similarly, you'll probably make a lot of friends who are rich. Make sure you're not overspending to keep up with them.",1620180073,1,0

"A lot of good info here. Just a few add ons:
- look into the student reduced fare rate 
- at a subway platform don’t stand next to the tracks (rare occurrence, but there’s several instances in the last year of unsuspecting people being pushed onto the tracks)
- winter is cold. Invest in good winter shoes or get really good rain boots and line them with insulated boot socks to make them winter ready. Invest in a REALLY good winter coat (you won’t regret a length that covers your bum). Also invest in gloves that are warm, wind resistant, and also preserve mobility (I got a great pair from the brand outdoor research). 
- summer is hot. Central air is uncommon, so be ready to invest in a window ac. 
- others have mentioned sound and I wanted to echo this. Old windows don’t block out a lot. Blackout curtains, bookcases/bulky furniture can help with some of the noise, but it’s not sufficient. If you don’t have noise canceling headphones, consider it.
- groceries! Give in now and get a granny cart (I got [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082F2D8D6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apip_vLiXGWP9g688W) one). It’s compact, doubles as a mini dolly as well as transport for laundry. You’ll appreciate its convenience if, like me, you prefer to only hit the grocery store once every week/two weeks. Also remember your reusable bags! 
- apartment search. Most landlords have this ridiculous requirement that tenants make 40x the rent price - be aware of this and have your financial documents ready to go. CU housing won’t have this requirement, and tends to be a pretty good amount of space at a reasonable cost (reasonable for Manhattan, anyway). 
- good walking shoes. Self explanatory. 

That’s all I can think of for now. Hope it helps!",1620177222,1,0

But when (Ben Philippe) makes a race war plan he doesn't think about protecting his family or anyone else. His plan is to try and trick his white friends (who obviously don't want any part of the race war) into a room where he can murder them in cold blood. In my opinion, because of the woke times we live in, he felt comfortable exposing who he really is and how he thinks. I don't believe in hate speech, because many people say ""if it offends me then its hate speech"".

Most NYC scams are real apartments with addresses and correct information, but the person renting the apartment isn't the actual landlord.

Be very careful, as reliable brokers will not expect money up front if you haven't seen the apartment or verified it through a friend in the area.

The Bronx is not close to campus, but it might be too late to apply for Columbia housing. The school offers rooms, ensuites, studio apartments, 1 bedrooms... They have a lot of options and they are cheaper than you can find in the area unless you are very clever. You should check on the housing portal to see if they are still accepting applications.

"What do you mean by allocated? Do you mean it was assigned to you through Columbia Housing or is this through a private broker? 

A shared bedroom in the Bronx for $1445 sounds very expensive to me, but if it has all those amenities and the square footage is large you're probably in a luxury apartment complex. There are much cheaper options, I personally wouldn't stay in a bedroom in a 3-bedroom apartment for more than $800, but if things like a gym and community room are important to you, you decide whether it's worth the additional cost. 

However, I am very concerned that you can't attend a viewing in person. There are more scams than actual listings in New York City, and no decent broker allows you to sign a lease without an in-person tour for that reason. I would say most people if not everyone I know stayed at an Airbnb or short-term lease first while looking for apartments to rent.

A major personal factor with me is tho that I’m a trans woman, my recent major increase in academic success (and success in life in general), is due to the fact that I’m finally happy with myself and finally have internal peace and self love. Back when I was an unhappy high school boy, I hated myself, which is a reason why I under performed in school, and likely wouldn’t have gotten accepted out of HS. I also used to suffer from really bad anxiety which also hindered my academic potential. So I needed the necessary break in between HS and college to heal and grow as a person, and that’s why GS is the perfect fit. And that’s why it’s dumb to compare me to a CC student who excelled in HS since at the time I had my own internal issues which held me back. We each grow at our own pace 😌.

TLDR: some of us achieve our full potential years after HS which is why GS is the perfect fit for us. It doesn’t make sense to compare the 2 since they’re for 2 different types of students.",1621242010,1,0
"Yes, but I'm not interested in GS, and also I need financial aid, which CC offers much more. Also, when I apply, I will be out of school for only 3 months, so that's not technically a year. Right?",1621238740,1,0

"I think what gets me going is the fact the people bashing GS are actively encouraging people not to go here. I’m satisfied with my station in life, I very much enjoy my college experience and think it’s pretty fucked when kids hop on here and tell new GS admits that they’ll be treated like shit and won’t find a job when that’s just blatantly false",1621226669,1,0

"The anti-GS rhetoric is really disappointing to me. Though I’m on the younger side of graduating GS student body(soon to be 22 years old), many of my peers, whom I am privileged to call friends, are on the older side and feel insecure about their place at Columbia. My friends are some of the most inspiring and accomplished people I’ve ever met. They’ve done and seen incredible things, and learning from them has been an incredible joy. Not to mention, they perform incredibly well academically, and are at the top of their classes. All this anti-GS rhetoric stokes insecurities and creates divides. As OP mentioned, perhaps the most damaging aspect of it is how it may deter potential applicants. 

This is a low point for all of us because no matter what, we’re in this together: we’re all here to make better lives for ourselves. 

What a shame that this divides us.",1621221809,1,0

"You fail to mention that a significant portion of GS students are also working during school and CC students are not. Just based on that fact, GS students will have lower GPAs because they have less time to study or have additional stressors from work.",1621220869,1,0

"I think it can vary week to week though you may be more right for the first semester. I’m specifically thinking of weeks where we did things like The Odyssey, Don Quixote, Crime and Punishment, Pride and Prejudice (probably some others I can’t remember also) where we had to read a few hundred pages for the week so 100-150 per class seems fair to me. That being said, it’s a class where it’s pretty easy to sparknote/skim and I think that’s very common.",1621219924,1,0
The school of General Studies. It’s one of Columbia’s three undergraduate schools (four if you count Barnard). It’s geared towards nontraditional students and its student population has a more diverse age range than the student populations of CC and SEAS. But GS students still take the Core and have access to the same majors.,1621217065,1,0
