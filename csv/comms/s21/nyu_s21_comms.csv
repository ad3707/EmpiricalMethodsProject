"I was isolated in 2nd st dorm towards the beginning of the semester. I had a hard time there - the food wasn't good at all and we weren't allowed to order through grubhub at that time. Other than that, it was fine I guess. Just spent a lot of time doing school work and reading some books.

Food's not the overall best, but I usually order some snacks with my grubhub orders anyways. Also, spend grubhub wisely. $200 seems like a lot for a week, but ordering out is really, really expensive.",1611465163,43,0

I dont think anybody's forcefully befriending each other, just look out for people w similar interests!

Maybe that's just me and I'm sorry you feel that way but it never hurts to try",1611463752,5,0
"BoA at Union Square (University Place, 14th street) is great for international students.  You can book an appointment with them online through BoA's website.  You need a few documents to prove your ID - passport, I-20, and maybe SEVIS (not exactly sure).  I also brought my NYU ID and they recorded that down but idk if that was necessary.  You initially open a checking account with them, and once you get your debit card, you go back in 5-7 days and they'll process an application for your credit card (basically guaranteed).  The Cash Rewards is the standard card which is the one most people get.  Then it takes 14 more days to mail you the credit card.  I know some banks like Chase require the SSN that some international students won't have.",1611463603,2,0

"1. campus is in the city center; pretty new facilities, easy to reach everywhere etc. size is not that big; new campus is being built (planned to be ready in 2 years)
2. faculty --like in every other university, really depends; there are faculty with phd/teaching experience from ivy league schools, leading in top companies etc and there are also young faculty from less famous backgrounds i suppose; dean of engineering (keith ross) is really top; you can search up profs in the faculty page of the school depending on your major/interests. 
3. prestige---imo pretty good; you can use 'nyu' name when applying for jobs if you want or nyu shanghai name; acceptance rate for nyush is super low (about 5-7%); nyush is well regarded in china; nyu name is more famous outside of china, so you can use that; 
4. i think it is pretty easy to get into; more like an interest form
5. yea, learning chinese is required, but its only 4 classes plus you can place out if you learn on your own during breaks/holidays; there is lots of support and classes are quite easy (b-a range is pretty easy) aka memorize a lot, but nothing extraordinary
6. cost of living is waaay cheaper than ny + u can afford rly good stuff (5 star hilton hotels etc) that u prob cant afford back in the us so easily; shanghai is considered expensive, but its still cheaper than us or europe

overall, the school is actually good and you have lots of opportunities to get research/internship/leadership experiences i.e. pretty easy to get research with the best prof at school or found a new student club since school is pretty small and hence easier to be 'noticable'

academically thou, its more challenging than ny or abu dhabi campus since 50% are chinese with top stats, so be ready for grinding",1613869417,1,0

Don't pay to join any clubs. It's not worth it.

Wait until after your first week of class to buy textbooks. Some professors will say during the first class whether or not a textbook is required. Also, you can usually find a PDF of that textbook online.

Not directly NYU related, but keep an eye out for scams during welcome week. Here's a quick rundown:

* **Official NYU Welcome Week Events**: These events are free and run by the school. It's a great way to meet other students, especially as a commuter student. You can find these events in the NYU app.

"I am a Muslim and a NYU student. ( From Bangladesh, resident in Iran so I might be your geographic neighbor).

However, I attend NYU Shanghai, which is NYU's full fledged degree granting campus in Shanghai, China. So I cannot go by direct experience but much of what I say supports that at an institutional level NYU is very welcoming.

I had no problem whatsoever with my identity on campus, and I have not heard of any problem with Muslim folks who did their study away in NYC. 

And the school at Shanghai seems to do what it can to make the Muslim community, a minority, welcome on campus. There is Halal dining station on campus, you can schedule to have accomodations based on NYU policy, and I recall last Ramadan the administration emailed the school about the significance of the month of Ramadan and urged students and faculties alike to show consideration to the Muslim community.

I recall, during my orientation as freshman we were assigned a readings that focused on different traditions &amp; worldviews. One of those was about a Muslim doctor and their experience.

And, while mostly irrelevant because of where I live and not being an exemplary Muslim anyway, the Islamic Center at NYC routinely sends emails over this or that event based on the Islamic events.

I woud also add my cousin, a Muslim too, did her Masters in NYC  and she did not report on any racial incidence based in the two years she was in the city.

Like everyone else has commented, this spirit of inclusion is something NYU inherits from NYC, which rightly has a reputation for diversity and representation. 

It does not mean there's zero racism &amp; discrimination, but your experience there is likely to be better than a lot of other places in the world as a minority.

Also, in case you did not know NYU has a campus in Abu Dhabi. The scholarship package there is much better, and admission proportionally tougher, but you might want to consider getting your NYU experience there if your parents are admant over safety concerns.

NYU has mandatory study-away policy and you can study up two-three semesters abroad, so you can take clases in New York after a certain point ( rising sophomore or first semester of junior year).

"Hi! I‚Äôm a current CAS freshman but I applied to internally transfer for next fall. Here‚Äôs what I learned:
-I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs more competitive to get into Tisch as an internal transfer. Yes, they accept less transfers than freshman but schools tend to favor internal transfers over external transfers so I think it balances it out. But Tisch primarily admits by evaluating your artistic review so if you have the passion and talent that‚Äôll get you in. 
-if you don‚Äôt get in you just stay where you are. So you‚Äôd be able to continue as a Gallatin student.  
-I‚Äôm honestly not sure if you‚Äôre Gallatin scholarship will go with you but if it‚Äôs a scholarship specific for Gallatin I can‚Äôt imagine it would. But if it‚Äôs regular financial aid that would go with you. 

Something to be aware of is if you‚Äôre internally transferring for drama you‚Äôd be entering Tisch with the incoming freshman class. This is because you need 2 years of studio training and so you won‚Äôt be put with members of your own class who have completed their first year. I personally don‚Äôt mind but it‚Äôs something to think about. 

Hope this helped :)",1615968121,1,0

"it's really easy to get a research position, even with professors you don't know yet. it rarely has to do with gpa (i've never been asked) or the school you attend. 

the process is usually 
1. find a lab that works on subjects you like. you can do this by just searching for professors' lab websites. 
2. send a cold email with your name, year, interest in THEIR work, and a request to meet up for an interview if they have available positions
3. their reply will either be an interview or an interview with an application process. one of the soft matter labs for example asks you to solve a complex physics question. 
4. start training if you get the position.

i had a wet lab research position beginning in freshman year with nothing but chem 1 lab under my belt. most labs aren't looking for prior experience in other research positions. the most important thing across the board has been a clear interest in the subject and an ability to have a conversation with the PI/peers.

"Location- not many other colleges that give you the experience of truly living in NYC (no campus). I knew I wanted to go to NYU as soon I visited bc the campus is in such an amazing area 

Global network- so many study abroad options and international students

Academic program- I'm in Stern, so knowing the school had a strong program (esp in my majors) was important to me 

Job opportunities- So many professional opportunities in NYC (esp. as a business student)

NYU was a gut decision for me. Of course there's always stuff that I wished NYU did better, but I don't regret my decision at all. 

I'd take into consideration what school you're applying to specifically into NYU bc personally I justified the tuition bc I knew I would get what I paid for being at Stern. Also, there will be additional costs (e.g., housing, personal expenses, etc.) that come with living in NYC.

"For this academic semester there are rules against going into any dorm room or dorm building that is not your own. We haven't gotten any update on a change to that rule, so I can't tell you if in-dorm socialization will even be possible next year. 

That being said, if you want built-in friends, go for a dorm that has many suites in one apartment. I imagine that way you can come in contact with more people in your apartment on a day-to-day basis. 

Google search NYU 2020-2021 housing rates and you will find a pdf of this academic year's buildings and the types of dorms they have. Look for the ones that have labels like ""suite"" and ""double/triple"" to increase the amount of roommates. If you're not looking for more suite-mates or roommates, I can't really say that there is any dorm on campus known for being more social than others. 

Also, check out exploration floors, they are themed communities where the entire floor tends to hang out together because of a shared interest. Pick the one that interests you, then you'll have to submit a further application to be considered for that floor. It can all be done in your academic year housing app.",1615946844,3,0

If you get denied an internal transfer nothing happens as far as I‚Äôm aware, you just remain in gallatin, and scholarships should definitely not be affected by a change of school (only a change of actual university).

If you know you're in a foreign country where you don't speak the language, even if it's not ""just,"" it's best to tread carefully. If they were being asked to remain in place while the police was conducting the drug raid, the downsides of staying in place (on the off-chance it's some random non-police officer doing it for shits and giggles) is way lower than the downsides of fleeing if they are police officers. 

Also legitimately, I don't think I'd know of any way to make sure that someone talking to me was a real police officer unless they were showing up in a PD car. Like I've gotten ticketed while driving by someone who was in an unmarked car and I never checked the badge or anything.

"&gt; Is it hard/ worth it to transfer to CAS as a CS major considering you're losing the head start of freshman year? 

 There are people in the past who have transferred from Tandon to CAS for CS their sophomore year purely because they think CAS degree looks more prestigious or because Courant is ranked highly for its CS research despite the fact that it doesn't tell anything about how strong the undergraduate cs program is. They are shortsighted, underestimating how much rapid development Tandon is undergoing that I guarantee most of them are going to regret transferring to CAS when they see their original classmates  in Tandon 2-3 years from now graduating and getting software engineering jobs at top tech companies.  Much more tech companies already recruit from Tandon given that it's an engineering school. A majority of Tandon majors are CS majors so you will find plenty of people who are interested in participating in activities relating to CS. Even most of the summer undergraduate research and activities that take place at Tandon revolve a lot around programming.   Now you hear on this subreddit how there are people from CAS who want to transfer to Tandon for CS given how CAS isn't investing much into its undergraduate CS program. Also, it is forbidden from doing an internal transfer and majoring in the same subject again. 

&gt; Is it possible to be involved in both campuses? 

This is mostly subjective. Tandon is indeed separated from the CAS campus by 15-20 minutes from the train. Some people may not want to make the extra effort commuting between two campuses and some people may not have a problem and enjoy being at the Tandon and CAS campus.

It seems to me that most of the information you gathered about Tandon has been posted on the internet especially this subreddit a few years ago. You should take those with a grain of salt considering that Tandon has changed a lot since then.",1617994948,1,0

"I think you should go to UMich or Hopkins. 

When I talk about NYU, I'm referring to CAS. With that out of the way, if you go to NYU, there are research opportunities, particularly in applied mathematics, simulation, and modeling. There is very little undergraduate research in pure math taking place. That's not too unusual, because the bar to do research in pure math tends to be high. We have a summer research program, called SURE, which plenty of students do and is a very good experience. You could look at the projects [here](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/undergrad/ba-cas/activities-research/summer-undergraduate-research-experience/) to get an idea of this. We additionally have an honors program, which gives several honors versions of existing courses. I think the biggest strength of NYU is the faculty, who are brilliant, and learning from them can be great. You could look at [this](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/undergrad/ba-cas/alumni/profiles/) to get an idea of what graduates do. There are some truly impressive outcomes there. It is definitely possible to go to a top tier graduate school or get competitive employment out of NYU. So coming here for math is not a bad thing whatsoever. However, there is not much of a focus on undergraduates in the department, which in my opinion is a real problem. Advising is not as serious as it should be, which I think is a big issue.

Superficially, having looked at the course offerings, UMich appears to have a much better honors mathematics program in terms of starting students early on serious mathematics. They also have a laboratory of geometry, in which undergraduates can be involved in research, and an REU of their own (like we have) which appears to produce more pure math projects than ours. You can look at those at this [link](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/research-and-career-opportunities/research/research-experience-for-undergraduates--reu-/recent-reu-projects.html). They have a weekly newsletter sent to undergraduates, and it looks like the advising of honors students is taken seriously from the [honors math major page](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/major-and-minor-programs/honors-mathematics.html). Like NYU, they also have very, very elite faculty, and a very, very elite graduate program. I have no idea what it's actually like there, though. 

The CS thing mentioned by another commenter here is a good point. I took some CS classes here and they were very poor. If you're interested in math, I think doing some measure of CS is a good idea, especially in case you don't make it in academia or are not interested in that.

I didn't look at Hopkins' undergrad math program, not sure how good it is. But I think UMich seems better for undergrad than NYU.",1617990084,1,0

For me it‚Äôs always been a dream to live in the city and I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm finally doing it (even though I didn‚Äôt imagine doing it during college). I also really love the programs NYU has to offer specifically I‚Äôm planning on double majoring and NYU is the only school that‚Äôs widely respected in both fields. So if I had gone to my other choice (a small school in the south) I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to have the same majors and the same quality education. 

As cheesy as it is, it almost feels like I didn‚Äôt choose NYU but NYU chose me. Even though it‚Äôs definitely not a perfect school and im still working through some struggles, I think this is where I need to be. 

All that being said, that‚Äôs just me. Ask yourself why NYU was your dream school. If it‚Äôs just for the prestige then maybe this school isn‚Äôt for you. But if it‚Äôs for specific opportunities here/program of study then it was probably your dream school for a reason. But no one can tell you that, you have to answer it for yourself.

"Np! I know politics majors at NYU are actually more on the quantifiable side so there‚Äôs definitely some rigor! 
So far I‚Äôve only taken three of the required classes because last semester I was somewhat undecided so I‚Äôve only taken Intro to Macroeconomics, intro to microeconomics and intro to international politics so far but I‚Äôve loved all of them. 

For professors I love Andrew Paizis for Econ, I‚Äôve had him for both micro and macro and his exams are straightforward and his lectures are recorded. 

For international politics I have Schwarz and he‚Äôs new and it‚Äôs a lot ngl. He really likes game theory  so there‚Äôs a large focus on that but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs like that for the rest of the major but idk. I did well on the midterm solely because he offered a curve and extra credit but before all that the raw average for the midterm was a 68 soooo
If there is another professor offered I‚Äôd go for them as of rn but I feel like I can‚Äôt accurately judge the class just yet not knowing how the final and paper will pan out. 

All three of them have been pretty large because they are intro classes and count for a few different majors/minors so they‚Äôve been about 100-200 students or so (hard to tell with zoom and asynchronous students). And I‚Äôve found my professors to still be accessible despite the size. Paizis in particular will always respond quickly to an email so that‚Äôs awesome.

"Hey! I got in off the waitlist to CAS last year and I remember that Tisch had a lot of waitlist movement last year. I don‚Äôt know about this year obviously but a lot of people get waitlisted every year so don‚Äôt let that one factor sway you. 

Honestly, I verbatim wrote ‚Äúif accepted I will absolutely attend‚Äù on the waitlist form and that worked for me. Don‚Äôt be afraid to communicate that NYU is your top school if that‚Äôs the truth! 

I waited until the last day to fill out the waitlist form because I wasn‚Äôt totally sure at first about NYU but now I‚Äôm glad I did because the more time went by the more things I was able to do and then I actually had a decent amount of stuff to update them on. 

Also, I‚Äôd recommend looking for any weaknesses in your original application and addressing them on the form. For me, I knew my Why NYU essay wasn‚Äôt good because I decided to switch programs really late in the admissions cycle so my Why NYU essay didn‚Äôt reflect the major I was applying to. So I basically wrote ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to address why I decided to switch programs...‚Äù and then launched into an updated Why NYU. I think this worked because it addressed a specific problem in my application and reiterated my interest in NYU and how I would make the most of the resources this school provides. On the off chance you have something similar you feel they should know about don‚Äôt be afraid to tell them! I know you mentioned wanting to study abroad and make the most out of the academics and the arts so I would find a way to communicate that to them! 

Anyways I hope it works out! If it doesn‚Äôt just know it wasn‚Äôt anything you did or didn‚Äôt do on the waitlist form, some years there just isn‚Äôt any movement from the waitlist.

"I think you can only go for a semester - you also have to remember that people really put their major on hold to do it, since class selection is fairly limited there. By that I mean the classes are really good, but you're not going to be able to fill the usual 3-4 major requirements during that semester. I think when you're a junior you'll probably understand that major urgency a bit better. Look towards doing a semester - your thoughts might change by then anyways.",1617981814,1,0
"UT Austin has prestige and will get u a good job too if that's what ur worried about (considering u aren't worried about college experience).

"I went to UT Austin for undergrad and absolutely loved it! I went for architecture and was in a similar boat as you when I started -- I REALLY wanted to be in New York but didn't want the debt associated with it. I am moving to New York to start grad school at NYU in the fall, and I have several friends who are already living in NY for work.

McCombs is a great school and Austin is a great city. UT has a very strong alumni network and this network extends across the world -- there are definitely connections in New York. As long as you keep up your grades and network while you are in school, the transition to New York should be easy.

I have a lot of student debt from UT. It sucks but it isn't the end of the world. NYU is a private institution, so your loans will be different. You should research how private school loans will differ from public school loans. Ultimately go to the school that feels right and makes you the happiest. You can definitely get a job in NY with a degree from UT though.

Feel free to DM me if you want more info about UT / living in Austin!",1617980589,2,0

Is IMA a competitive major at NYU?,1619153646,1,0
"it's just as competitive. i'd say competitiveness can be generally decided based on a few factors: class material, class stats, and class attitude.

for class material, introductory science courses are generally standardized across the board. so the class material isn't going to be super distinguishable between nyu and ucla. and if you switch exams, students at each school would be able to complete them. 

in terms of class stats, professors of all schools generally have goals for grading percentiles. they're not aiming for everyone to get an A otherwise the class is deemed too easy but they can't aim for Fs or the class is deemed too hard. So most exams are written with the expectation that the average will be a B. When i compare class averages with my friends at other top schools, they're very close to ours. so not much differentiation there. 

as for class attitude, this factor has nothing to do with intelligence. moreso a willingness to work hard. and nyu students work hard. dude i have met some real idiots at the school but i'll be damned if they don't work their ass off. it's very respectable in my view to acknowledge any gaps of knowledge and work to lessen it rather than leave it be. professors also tend to take a liking to these types, which makes even the letters of recommendation competitive to get. premed programs at any top schools are going to be full of these types of people. 

so yeah the competitive atmosphere of nyu is comparable to like ucla i'd say. 

i also have friends finishing up premed at other major schools. we compare notes frequently. their learning experience is not much different.",1619153559,2,0

"I don't think NYU will care. The only way in which they would is if you used OCR/Wasserman, in which you would probably get banned from using it.

But be careful with reneging. Are you going from a bank to another bank? This is when you are in dangerous territory because from what I hear, IB is a pretty small world. Some companies have a policy were they will take away someone's offer if you renege. And you might face backlash from the IB that you're reneging on and might struggle getting a job with them in the future.
