"I'm sorry to hear that you've been feeling down. I know what it's like to feel completely tapped of energy like that; having to find a doctor can just kind of add to that more. But I know that it helped me *a lot* because, in addition to being able to speak with someone about what I was going through (which got the ball rolling), I was able to start on a new medication regimen (which kept the ball rolling). Sending a message through Cornell Health and asking for a referral could be a start. Plus lots of clinicians are providing telehealth appointments, even if they're further away.

Though I'm not a professional, I want to validate what you're going through. It's okay to have off-days. Setting small goals helped me get to the next day, even if the next day was another off-day. I'm talking about goals like taking a hot shower, having a full meal, and brushing my teeth. Your health and wellbeing come first, even if that means dropping a class or asking a professor for accommodations. It's neither an easy, nor comfortable thing to do for yourself. But it gets the ball rolling. 

And on the days where you feel like your energy is zapped, it's okay to spend more time in bed and eat chocolates. This isn't to say that you should do it every day (or even every off-day), but I find that checking in with myself and really gauging how I'm doing compared with other days is helpful. Even if I'm still zapped, but less zapped than the day before (and maybe even more motivated), I try to do one extra thing. Maybe it's getting up a little earlier or washing the dishes a little sooner after eating. But the little things add up for me, and I think it's fair to say that we all deserve some credit where credit is due, especially when we don't feel like ourselves.

"That is probably at least somewhat influenced by selection bias. Cornell is a fairly STEM-heavy school compared to our peer institutions. The members of this sub are disproportionately STEM majors. So most of the humanities classes that most of the people on this sub are taking are lower level ones to fulfill a requirement. I certainly know plenty of engineers that disliked these courses, but the intro level humanities stuff just doesn't have nearly the same workload that many of the weeder courses for STEM majors do. When you combine that with the fact that most of the people here are complaining about courses that feature difficult content with fairly high expected workloads, it stands to reason that humanities aren't as strongly represented. There certainly are very difficult courses in the humanities that require huge workloads and attention, but they are typically only going to be taken by the people who have a legitimate interest in the material, helping them manage it better than someone who is just taking a class to fulfill a requirement.",1615993464,1,0

Personally, it's not an official goal of mine to ""have a positive impact on the world,"" but I do have the rather selfish goal to have a positive impact on those I specifically care deeply about. In pursuing making the world better for that specific subgroup, I'll inadvertently also make the world better for others too.  For example, I want to be a veterinarian so I can help out my friends, family, and community when their pets have health issues and make sure that veterinary care is accessible to them regardless of financial barriers. That's the true motivation behind my career goals, but I'll still end up helping plenty of other animals too because I'll have to take other patients as well.",1620243628,8,0

That being said, if you'd rather explore the immense variety of interests you have, I might suggest just picking one major and taking a bunch of other courses!

I got in the class with basically no substantial game dev experience, and nobody on my team had any either, but it's fine because they teach you everything anyways. There are definitely some people in the course with substantial experience, though, so it's all pretty varied.

"You stated my problem beautifully.

My biggest life crisis I've been struggling with is deciding whether I want to channel my energy into things that I deeply care about, such as mental health and research, or using my energy to level up in the corporate world. 

I crave stability and a ""normal life"" where I don't have to worry about my mental health crashing because I have to constantly work 24/7, 7 days a week. I don't want to live that lifestyle, especially after what happened these past 5 years. I took a year-long health leave, and while it has served its purpose, I wasn't completely satisfied with myself mentally and emotionally. 

This school has kind of built me up and tore me down at the same time. I'm not going to write eons and eons about my school experience. 

My family wants me to have a high-paying job so that they'll ""mooch"" off of my money. I feel uncomfortable talking to them because they never consider what I want in life; it's always about them. I have a tough time dealing with the fact that they'll use me even if I'll start working full-time this summer. I do want to experience working in the corporate world and decide whether I want it (or not), I always wonder if I'm meant to pursue my ""dream career"", which is within research (industry, academia, policy, wherever else). 

Both paths are risky, but I'm going to have to eventually settle on something. Don't rush the process and enjoy yourself while you can.",1620236237,7,0

"Per [https://covid.cornell.edu/prevention/quarantine-isolation/](https://covid.cornell.edu/prevention/quarantine-isolation/) , if you test positive or are symptomatic, or are a close contact of someone who tests positive:

&gt;**Students living off campus** will be assessed by the Tompkins County Health Department (TCHD) to determine whether they can self-isolate in their off-campus residence. If a student can‚Äôt self-isolate where they are, the TCHD will work with Cornell Health staff to arrange appropriate isolation housing. 

And TCHD, in turn, will determine that your off-campus residence isn't suitable because you're probably sharing a bathroom, which remains against the state guidelines for [precautionary quarantine shelter](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory). You will be almost certainly be sent to the Statler, unless the Statler is at capacity.

IF you have in-person classes, you'll need to contact the professor and explain the situation. There will probably be some variation in how you are supposed to make up the work, depending on the professor and department, but it's not as if students haven't had to miss class in the past because they got mono or had a car accident or had to fly to their grandfather's funeral or whatever.",1611468485,4,0

"I can't think of a single house at any time in history where any brother would ask about your GPA at any point during rush, and then hold it against you in preferencing (provided you're not literally failing out). But that does not mean it's totally irrelevant.

First, understand that to join any chapter (IFC/PHC/MGLC), you must agree to release your  grades to the Office of Sorority and Fraternity Life for the rest of your undergraduate career. These are used, for example, to generate aggregated GPAs for the chapters that you find on the [Organization Scorecard](https://scl.cornell.edu/get-involved/sorority-fraternity-life/our-community/organization-scorecard). It is what it is, and there's no escaping it.

Second, if your GPA is a 2.48, you should consider whether joining a house this semester the best idea. Rush and the pledge/neophyte/associate/candidate period are time-consuming. Even as a full brother, your house is an essentially bottomless source of distraction; there's always something funny/cool/crazy/interesting going on. That's part of what makes it awesome, but it's absolutely disastrous if you struggle with your study discipline, time management, procrastination, priorities, etc.

The GPA requirement isn't there because the fraternities are pretending to be some kind of honor society. It's there because you can't be a good member if you're precarious in terms of your education. If you're barely keeping up in classes, you may be missing events and meetings. If you get put on academic leave, you aren't participating in the life the house, nor helping pay the bills.

All that said, I do not believe the GPA limit is a hard limit. The principle, at least, is that being below the GPA requirement means you'd need to have a conversation with someone in OSFL first (where they will probably go over similar points as I've made here).",1611467215,31,0

But I did join a gym a few years ago and found that most people were awesome.

There are classes like CS4700 which have online instruction only but explicitly state that despite this fact, you must be in Ithaca to take the course as the exams will be in person. Hence it is possible that a course mandates in person exams even if the modality of instruction is online, although I'd expect them to indicate so on the roster but there are no guarantees.",1612802331,1,0

"took it last semester also and while it was definitely work, the course is extremely organized and offers a lot of structure/help if you need, which was my primary concern with an autotutorial class. in terms of exams, which was probably the most drastic change imo, what was difficult was that certain ""memorization based"" questions that would normally be stressed/appear in in-person semester exams (like draw the structure of this amino acid/compound) were not as prevalent on the online semester exams since it was open note. However, you definitely needed to be well-versed in the content despite having access to notes because questions were less ""straight forward"" in a sense. Overall, if you prepare really well and make use of the resources they provide, you can do reasonably well in the class.",1612800458,1,0

"This was worded poorly I think but they changed it in the syllabus. It now says: ""Given the online nature of the exam, we will conduct spot checks via immediate follow-up oral examinations.¬†The immediate follow-ups will be during a pre-determined time period immediately following the end of the exam. You must be free during this time in case you are selected. Not being able to properly explain¬†**any**¬†of your answers (or not being available during the follow-up) can lead to a zero grade on the entire midterm and open the path for an academic misconduct investigation. The follow-up oral examination will be designed to verify that you can properly explain the reasoning (and concepts) behind the solution you provided (regardless of whether that solution is correct or incorrect).""

So students are randomly chosen to have to explain some of their answers after the online exam is over.",1612799464,1,0

about rec letter from high school/dual enrollment professors.... the upperclassmen i spoke to about this strongly discouraged doing so.
