"&gt;	 1. ‚Å†It‚Äôs not just about the vaccinations although that‚Äôs the main thing. If the federal mask mandate can be enforced and having a figurehead listening to science tell people, that could work. Also trump withheld 50M doses for people to also get second dose. Biden sent all 100M out, knowing that people would make more vaccine fast.

Have you been in Westwood this past year? Not asking as a jerk, but I‚Äôve been here the whole time and everyone already used mask. That didn‚Äôt prevent Los Angeles being a COVID hotspot. Also, neither Trump nor Biden do anything, vaccines are distributed by states (and California is lagging)

&gt;	2. ‚Å†Both in response to your first and second point, one aspect of thr COVID relief bill is opening more vaccination centers and increasing production.

I don‚Äôt disagree, but I still want to see this happening

&gt;	3. ‚Å†True, but if the previous points work out (and I really hope they do), then maybe we can get everyone vaccinated. My feeling is that ucla might equate the COVID vaccine to a requirement to attend classes like TB test/flu vaccine, but we shall see.

We are almost in February and not all the health staff (around 30k people) are vaccinated. And these are people who are in campus right now. I don‚Äôt think that this will take forever, but what I see is that the vaccine distribution is not as easy as you may think

"Poli Sci major here, I think I have some insights about this. (Sorry for the essay, feel free to just skip to the rankings) I took 4 of the 6 offered classes, so I'll give you my rankings of the ones I took plus whatever I know about the other two. Also, I was a Peer Learning Facilitator for this subject, so I've actually experienced some of these classes under more than one professor.

1. PS 20 - International Relations. One of my favorite classes ever, but I might be biased because my specialization was IR. I took it with Johns but tutored it under other professors, and the curriculum is very consistent between profs. You learn a lot about global governance and international law but also world history, international economy, etc. None of these classes are hard, but I will say only downside is this is less BS-able than others.

2. PS 50 - Comparative Politics. Completely different classes depending on who you take it with, but I recommend it either way. Lofchie basically does a deep dive of British and French systems of government, but he also offers a lot of insights into the US system too. I took it with him, and it's a very easy A while also being informative. I tutored it for two other profs who basically taught it the same and they actually teach broader principles about different systems of government from all across the globe. Things like dictatorships, political revolution, etc. More work than Lofchie but also probably more useful material.

3. PS 30 - Game Theory. I don't think this is what you're looking for. I liked it with O'Neil well enough, but it's practically a math class.

4. PS 60 - Ethics. One of my least favorite classes ever, but some people might like it. I am pretty sure it is only taught by Lohmann, and the structure is 100% of the reason I hate it so there's no choice here. It's a class that's *supposed* to teach you concepts about ethics but the structure is actually that the students of the class do exercises online (even before Rona) and *act out* those concepts. I don't feel like I learned from this. The grading is also based solely on weekly reports on the data that the class generates, and I feel like the grading was so inconsistent. The only upside might be that it was always an online class, so you're not missing out by taking it during quarantine and it wasn't difficult mentally.

The other two are PS 10 - Political Theory, which I didn't take because I knew it would be a lot of reading about old philosophers and writing essays, and PS 40 - US Government, which I heard is just basic civics. Can't offer more info other than I know Prof. Peris teaches PS 40 sometimes and he's a really cool prof.

I graduated from a high school in a rather disadvantaged area, so I likely got high off of the idea of advancing to a place that reeks of privilege as my senior year drew to an end.

At any rate, that kind of mentality is nothing but a festering disease and delusion, and it took me over for a year. In all honesty, I often daydreamed about the possibility of transferring until about a year ago. That‚Äôs when I began to open up some career-related doors that I thought only the Ivy League would let me open. If anything, my rejection lit a fire under my ass that I wouldn‚Äôt have felt if I had actually gone to a university like Columbia; I would have likely gotten complacent and expected the world to be handed to me, as the popular myth goes.

I can imagine that there are a few people here who still have the same inferiority complex that I once did, so let me give you a incentivizing kick to knock you out of it. They aren‚Äôt wrong when they say that long-term outcomes are almost identical among those who try to get into ‚Äúreach‚Äù schools and fail and those who succeed (read ‚ÄúWhere You Go Is Not Who You‚Äôll Be‚Äù). It‚Äôs not the school that gets you anywhere‚Äîit‚Äôs your drive.",1613868806,1,0
"Yes, I majored in EE and math.  I learned to code when I was a kid so I can't really help there, but I really suggest just doing it on your own.

"I would not recommend double majoring AND double minoring unless you want to take 4-5 classes a quarter which will probably hurt your GPA or mental health or both lol.

If you want to do entrepreneurship, I can‚Äôt speak to the entrepreneurship minor, but there are definitely opportunities through different orgs on campus!

My personal advice is to relax. I get it, you‚Äôre super excited to take all of these classes and do everything. I was in your shoes not too long ago and I honestly think it‚Äôs great to be excited! But UCLA is challenging no matter how smart you are, and your plans can definitely change once you start taking classes and gaining some experiences/perspectives through clubs and meeting the people here :)) so take a deep breath, go in with an open mind, and know if you have time before you decide what you really want to do!

Not only is this a university that does not care about it's students, it also happens to be in the most mismanaged city in the country. LA is vaccinating slower than any other place in the country (correct me if I'm wrong) and there's no way they'll let anyone unvaccinated back on campus.

That's 175, and you probably have another 40 that have natural immunity from already having Covid.

But put some thought into it. Is there actually something wrong with being referred to as the color of your skin if the person doing it has no malicious intent? Why we call black people black but we don't call Asian people yellow? We don't because that just isn't the way people currently talk.

&gt;  if the student has not been able to develop themselves on the more foundational materials and experience needed for these programs (through involving themselves in research or whatnot), how will they suddenly be able survive handling the more advanced materials?

That's exactly the reason. Transfers have one year to find a lab to get involved in, trained in the protocols, and contribute to a project. They have less time to develop research skills and apply them to a project for faculty write an effective LOR compared to someone who started research their sophomore year.",1612743730,1,0

My general rule is to take the no-traffic time for a given distance (get from Waze) and then multiply x3 or so during rush hour. Once traffic returns to normal, you can use Waze to estimate a commute leaving at certain times of day (for a rough idea) or check it during those times of day for a ""live"" sample.

"I worked at Disney (I might know Bading) and I‚Äôm a CS major here. UCLA seemed to be a feeder school for it, but not necessarily for CS. I‚Äôve taken the computer graphics, computer vision, and a grad class on both and I have a few thoughts:

Computer graphics at UCLA is not great, but it will get you through any interview. There‚Äôs only one undergraduate course (174b and c haven‚Äôt been offered in years), but the curriculum is pretty thorough. I‚Äôve done very well in interviews from the material in it. However, if you‚Äôre really set on it and have gotten into UCSD, they honestly offer a way better selection.

Computer vision was an experimental course so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs going to be offered in the future. Professors Soatto and Kadambi are fantastic, some of the best I‚Äôve had at UCLA.

Although you might not get the best computer graphics experience at UCLA, they do teach the other fundamentals you need for work in graphics very well. CS 111: Operating Systems and CS 32 (2nd intro course) are very, very useful and taught well here.

For graphics, a lot of what employers have looked for have been passion and personal projects, not necessarily the classes I‚Äôve taken. If you‚Äôre passionate, the graphics curriculum here is perfectly fine.

I found the math at my community college was more difficult because it was on the semester system so the professors that were passionate about the subjects had lots of time to drill us to the fine details. My experience on the quarter system is that (depending on professor) courses are more standardized and shorter which can sometimes lead to a more surface level feel. I don't think that idea extends to upper division courses as well because you will need to really hit the textbooks for those, but lower level math courses should be more straightforward - I think",1617053347,1,0

HOWEVER!!! 10 weeks do go by extremely fast, and although it might be painful, it'll be over before you know it, then it's summer break! Yay! 

I'm not sure what year you're in but if you have time to take a quarter off, I suggest talking to a counselor first, enjoy your break, and then take summer classes if you can. If not, then hang in there! You can do it! You've made it this far and school is almost over. Good luck!",1617050303,4,0

"Hi! :) 

If the Tesla option is feasible, do it. I have a Model 3. You get used to it fast. Traffic is easyyy. I love my car so much. Turn auto pilot on and just sit and watch. I promise you the scary part goes away quickly and it feels scary when I don‚Äôt have auto pilot on. Pay attention to when you need to merge/exit and that‚Äôs it. 

I can‚Äôt tell you how many times auto pilot has saved my life from sensing a collision from other vehicles and automatically braking, moving me into a different lane or moving me off the road. You‚Äôre driving a long way in one of the most complex driving areas in the world. The extra safety is so nice to have. 

I live in the Arts District in DTLA and will start to commute to UCLA when campus opens back up in the fall for my last year. 

I chose to move here because my building is brand new, has every luxury amenity I could want: security, in unit washer and dryer, secure package/mail receiving so nothing gets stolen, gym, pool, secure parking garage with my own ev charging spot and on and on. 

I pay a lot for my loft (though I moved from the Bay where my rent was more expensive) but I couldn‚Äôt even find a half decent studio near UCLA for a similar price with amenities. They were all so expensive, tiny, no parking spots, no pets allowed, no washer and dryer, no breathing, no fun, no... on and on 

My point to this very long story is I wouldn‚Äôt have chosen to live this ‚Äúfar‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have a Tesla with auto pilot.

UCLA parking garages offer free charging too so you won‚Äôt have to stop at a supercharger on the way home which would add an additional 30-45 minutes to your commute depending on the battery size. 

No joke, Irvine is beautiful. Every time I‚Äôm out in that area I‚Äôm like damn, should I have gone to UC Irvine so I can live closer to Newport? 

I vote the Tesla option. Then you‚Äôll have a car and you can stop somewhere on the way home if you want, hang with friends, go get food... I mean anything. You won‚Äôt be obligated to be somewhere at a certain time. 

Then again, if you do take the train route, you can sit and study and that might be nice too. 

I have tried commuting with people before when I lived in the Bay Area and it was difficult. If someone didn‚Äôt want to go to go that day or was running late or they ran late which made traffic worse or you woke up late... Yikes. Depending on others is hard. 

Idk. I‚Äôm torn. If I were you, I‚Äôd either get a Tesla or take the train. Having that built in time on the train to sit and studying or chill is nice. 

I lolled at the helicopter option.

"u/bobacrepecakes. . . let me give a forewarning; I was a history major at UCLA, so I don't typically write short blurbs.  A lot of the great historians typically wrote long, prosaic narratives, with ungodly, paragraph-long sentences, but yet incredibly detailed accounts beneficial to all who desire to study the past. So I hope to give whatever insight I can with respect to your choice of colleges for your probable chosen field(s), based on whatever historical training I have. But additionally, I also took some economics classes, so I do have a tiny bit of quant/numbers-based education.  

I would agree with Slam about the merits of the local colleges, UCLA and USC.  Trojans are good at propping their school, but Bruins aren't really into that as much, so someone who has grown up near the two, especially the former, often take them for granted.  But both universities produce top-tier graduates in all fields. 

I kinda disagree with him though (presumably wrt gender) because it sounds like he is writing about someone who might want to get a job with a hedge fund with his reference to connections. 

USC is better than UCLA in business training because Marshall extends degrees to Trojan undergraduates and Anderson does not to Bruin undergrads.  But the latter is putting together a curriculum that is reaching deep into quant, and it's emphasizing its top-tier math department with students studying Business Economics, Economics, or Mathematics and Economics, and their doubling or tripling in things like Applied Math, Financial Math, and/or Statistics. UCLA's closing the gap considerably with USC in this regard, though if one wants, e.g., more of the qualitative marketing side, one might want to go with Comm or an unrelated major at UCLA and do a lot of internships, or take that concentration at USC Marshall, with internships. (Also, join a lot of the bus clubs on both campuses.) 

But since you mentioned premed most readily, though, UCLA is probably the tops in the nation in its numbers of graduates who become MDs.  I worded it as I did, because becoming an MD is an individual accomplishment not a at all a university one. Typically every year, UCLA grads apply to med school at &gt; 1,000 in number, as seen in the [AAMC-Matriculants](https://www.aamc.org/media/9636/download) spreadsheet, with UCLA having 1,152; USC, 318, and Brown, 277 for the 2020 cycle.  Brown would have the most adjusted to undergrad enrollment, with UCLA second.

For UCLA, the rate of acceptance (that an applicant would have ‚â• 1 offer) has gone up for the last five years, with the latest being \~ 52%, and with the national average being \~ 40-42%. Since 52% of the 1,152 who applied in 2020 would be closer to 600, the numbers may be still be ascending for UCLA premeds who are enrolling at med school yearly.   

I wouldn't expect USC's rate to be significantly higher if it is, because they too have a lot of students who start out as being premed, in addition to there not being some magic power to grant one special dispensation to admittance. (Slight dig.)  According to the [class of 2024 profile](https://admission.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/Freshman-Profile.pdf), 15% of the freshman class (3,500 + spring admits) is at least 525 premeds, and if one considers transfers, it might be &gt; 700 students initially starting out on the premed track. That number is culled down to a little less than half per cycle, and undoubtedly the same happens at UCLA with 1.5 times the undergrad enrollment.  Both UCLA and USC produce a lot of other health professionals like dentists and pharmacists for those who aren't competitive for med school if not their first choice. 

Even if one considers the above paragraph a draw, the fact that UCLA produces at least a good three times as many MDs -- perhaps \~ 3.5 times more -- means they have more of a fraternal and sorority order than USC among the doctor set. Additionally, UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center is just a stone's throw from the life sciences classes, and there are numerous research groups on campus to boost UCLA undergrads' med-school applications. 

I would think that Brown would have a higher rate of acceptance than UCLA's 52%. But it's not going to be 90% as some colleges like to claim, maybe \~ 65% or so, because those colleges which present that high a percentage in premed advising would be gaming the statistics. I'm sure that Brown's advising is better than UCLA's, but UCLA has mentors and other people who give really good advice. 

The grade inflation at Brown is significantly higher; according to this [one site](https://ripplematch.com/journal/article/the-top-20-universities-with-the-highest-average-gpas-84ef5edf/), in which it reports the average gpa at Brown as being 3.71, the highest in the country.  At UCLA, I did some estimations (some guesswork), and for Letters and Science this is what I came up with -- I wanted to link but the post I took it from might fall off the map -- and the Life Sciences would run in accordance to this as I'm sure LS professors are enabling wrt grades:

Here are the [Latin Honors designations at UCLA](https://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Registration-Classes/Graduation/Final-Degree-Audit/Honors). Looking at the three classifications of gpas, you have for the school year 2020-21:

* Summa Cum Laude, 3.956, top 5%
* Magna Cum Laude, 3.908, next 5%
* Cum Laude, 3.816, next 10%

(This shows a little less than a hundredth grade point decrease for each percentile rank decrease.)

So the graduating class in 2021 will have 20% who graduate with a 3.816 gpa or higher -- and the admin has it down to a fairly exact science based on their calculating gpa to the thousandth, as well as their accumulating gpa data for each class and each student. And of course, the college of L&amp;S includes \[Life Sciences, etc.\].

So let's look at my estimate of gpa by percentile of graduates for L&amp;S:

99th Percentile, 4.000 (I would imagine there would be a decent number of these.)

\*95th Percentile, 3.956 (Summa floor)

\*90th Percentile, 3.908 (Magna floor)

\*80th Percentile 3.816 (Cum Laude floor)

75th Percentile, \~ 3.77

70th Percentile, \~ 3.72

65th Percentile, \~ 3.67

60th Percentile, \~ 3.63

55th Percentile, \~ 3.59

50th Percentile, \~ 3.55

The 3.51-3.75 gpas would be more plentiful than those from 3.76-4.00, because grades would be normally distributed. Of course, too, this wouldn't compare to the 3.7+ median at a place like Harvard, and the average at UCLA would be lower than its 3.55 median -- it'd be perhaps \~ 3.45, because the upper half of the class would be tighter in grade distribution than the lower, which would bottom out at 2.20; i.e., meaning it is negatively skewed, and would resemble a wave rolling right to left.

Additionally, the bottom 10% (decile) would probably need to have an average or midpoint that is decently above a 2.00 because one can't effectively graduate with a two-point-0 because the candidate would have been on probation effectively perpetually and \[would have been dismissed long before coming close to graduation\]. So the 5th percentile would probably have to be \~ 2.40. 

Sorry for the long-winded writeup.  A tl;dr: Med school admittance is very much an individual accomplishment not a university one; UCLA is the top premed factory in the country in shear numbers who attend med school; but Brown has the highest grade inflation.  All the best.",1617993269,1,0

"It's LA, so rent goes through the roof compared to the rest of the country. Normal price for apartment double (i.e. 4 people in a 2bd/2ba) is around $750-$1000 per person. Living in dorms is about the same for rent, but you are forced to get an on campus meal plan which costs around $9/meal for 19 meals/week on the cheapest per-meal plan, fewer meals saves you a relatively negligible amount of money since the price of meals goes up. If you cook for yourself in an apartment, you can eat great on around $2-3/meal. That comes out to ~$200/month by yourself or ~$750/month on a meal plan. I personally don't have too many expenses other than that, but definitely expect to pay at least a hundred bucks a month or so on eating out, ubers to places with friends, etc. And apartments have lots of upfront costs too, like furniture and cookware. 

Grade deflation is honestly not terrible, and grades get even better in upper division classes. There are even some classes where the whole class always gets an A. Most humanities classes are actually not curved at all as well, so there is no deflation by definition. Science lower division classes might curve to make sure ~30% get A, ~30% get B, and the rest lower, but I've never had a professor curve down before (i.e. a B for &gt;90%). You can check bruinwalk.com for grade distributions for most classes, it's where we post reviews of classes/profs and look at grade distributions when planning our classes.",1617992355,1,0

"There are of course some jobs but I think math is really either something you do out of interest or as really good stepping stone to something else. It's true that what a mathematics degree technically trains you for (i.e. understanding the fields of analysis, abstract algebra, and geometry) are not generally skills needed in any job other than research in mathematics, but the general skills you develop along the way (logical reasoning, being able to explain/prove things precisely, quickly grasping new definitions and concepts) are invaluable things that math majors are #1 at. These things are attractive to basically any employer, you just have to spend a little bit of time extending your practical knowledge to the employer's sector, which will be very fast given your background. For example, you seem to be a little worried about programming, but I assure that if halfway through your math major, you realize programming is the direction you want to take your career, you'll be able to pick it up in no time since the core of programming (logic) uses the same part of the brain as you've been practicing in math, especially in your proof-based courses. If you're really worried about career prospects, it's also trivial to switch majors to Math of Computation or Financial/Actuarial Math to give yourself a little more time to practice the field-specific knowledge, but it's really not necessary - after a math degree, you basically only need knowledge, not skills, which comes easily.

"My first research experience was through a club, I'm not sure if they're still together but I quickly transitioned into a lab.

I actually quite enjoyed most of my GE classes, it was a nice break from chemistry and math. I know a lot of people take a math class over summer and thought it was helpful. If you do take a GE class, try and take a writing II class (or if you don't need the writing requirement, take the English class that fulfills it, I don't remember the name). You need to take 3 Writing II classes to apply to med school, sometimes people forget to do them since they're thinking about science prereqs and it can get dicey down the line to cram writing classes that can be high intensity with upper div sciences.",1617989448,2,0

"Hi! Yes, my gap year happened after I finished up classes and matriculated.

I don't think there are many, if any, cons to taking a gap year. It's becoming very common, the majority of students in my class took one (not to mention that the average age of matriculants is rising, currently 25).

Pros are numerous. You have time to work and buff up your resume into a way that you can't do while in school. For example, for a lot of med school applicants they scribe, but some companies want you to be full time so it's impossible to do. Some work as EMTs that require training and working long shifts. Moreover you can make money, which is always nice before falling into debt lol.

I think gap years are also good for preventing burnout early on in med school, I really valued the time I got to do jobs that I enjoyed and could learn from and still have time for myself. Being in school is really different from working, it was refreshing to be able to work and then come home and not need to study and continue working.

"If you signed up for the Experian thing they'll tell you to call their number for advice.

I had my number compromised back when Equifax had that huge data leak back in my 2017 that exposed like half of the population's SSN. After that I was advised to put a credit freeze on my account. To do that, you'd call up one of the three credit bureaus: Experian, Transunion, or Equifax and ask them to place a freeze on your account.

A credit freeze basically means creditors can't do hard checks on your credit report until you lift the freeze, which you can do temporarily, or forever. It prevents anyone, including yourself, from making new credit accounts in your name. It's free to do and is a bit of a hassle but it's worth considering if your data has been compromised.",1619184922,1,0

"[Before someone reads the first sentence of this post and decides I'm an antivaxxer, let me be clear: I became eligible for vaccination on the 15th of this month, have already gotten my first dose, and have already scheduled my second dose.]

It's one thing for a private business to require employees and customers to be vaccinated, but I don't love the idea of public institutions requiring proof of vaccination. I would prefer to see a strategy of educating students about vaccines and encouraging voluntary vaccination, not mandating it.

At the state level, this is already California's strategy; there are no plans to roll out ""vaccine passports"" here, but the government has created incentives for businesses in high-risk sectors to require proof of vaccination or a negative test result. (For example, more people can attend an indoor event if they're all vaccinated or recently tested.) A number of states have already preemptively banned vaccine passports for reasons of privacy and personal freedom. The federal government has refused to ""[support] a system that requires Americans to carry a credential"" and indicated that there will not be a federal vaccination database.

Since a large number of Californians only recently became eligible to be vaccinated, it remains to be seen how many of them will decide to get a COVID-19 vaccine, but the figures so far are encouraging. [More than 33% of the state](https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccination-progress-data/) is already fully vaccinated.",1619168540,-1,0

"When writing about philosophy it isn't necessarily about writing good words and making it sound as flowery as possible. Philosophy is a whole nother animal. If you really want to write a good paper I'd recommend *School of Life*. Watch videos and really delve into the mind of the author. To do well in philosophy you need to answer two questions. What ideology is the author pointing to and why did the author write what he/she did. If you can answer those two questions then you should be good. Like for example. If I'm writing a paper about John Muir I'm going to pick out two specific points.

Why: Muir wrote his paper as a way to delineate the artificial world from the natural world. We should focus on preservation as a way to separate ourselves from the artificiality of the world and all its poison. He's talking about industry and society in general.

What: Muir is writing and stressing the incredibly intricate details of nature. He speaks of God as the one who created the natural landscape. We should respect nature because it is our true home. It was created from the essence of that which is holy. We lose ourselves in nature. In nature, we cultivate ourselves. In nature, we find that we are not that different from the trees and the animals and the ground where we stand.

Fundamentally understand your authors and get inside their heads. You'll have a much easier time if you google synonyms and have that tab open. As you're writing, find synonyms for basic words as a way to better connect with the author. Many philosophers were alive in the 18th and 19th century so choosing advanced words will help you learn how to write like those same scholars.",1619161991,2,0

"Hii! I relate to what you wrote! Though I became fascinated with the human body after attending UCLA, my parents have always pushed me to be a doctor. They wanted me to do one of the 7-year medical programs, lmao. 

I volunteered in two different hospitals in high school, one at a gift shop and another handing out magazines to patients who were recovering from surgery. I honestly didn't love the environment of the second hospital and decided that I didn't want to be premed and do medicine. Long story short, I came back to being premed because I became super interested in the body and health and wellness in general. I ended up taking all of the premed pre-reqs and not doing so badly in them. 

The last two quarters, I've been taking extra classes to raise my science gpa, but I realized after taking the courses that I have that I don't want to do premed precisely because of the long hours of studying, long work hours, and training and all that. It's a big sacrifice, and those around me who are physicians (like my own sister, lol) literally tell me not to do it because it's very taxing, and you should only pursue a career in medicine if you're truly interested. The classes I took at ucla were basically about health disparities, and just learning about the healthcare system from my classes and the stories I've heard from my sister being a doctor herself has really turned me off from the field further. (I've realized that the entire healthcare system is flawed, and it's not really the patient's fault for eating ""unhealthy"" when, for example, they live in areas where they don't even have access to grocery stores.)

During spring break, after consistently taking 5-6 classes per quarter in an attempt to raise my science gpa, I decided to quit being premed. And honestly, it wasn't even because I was burnt out; it was because I realized that in order to continue down this career path, I would be sacrificing a lot of my own values. I would have to sit all day to study when I literally learned in my class this last quarter that we shouldn't be sitting for more than two hours A DAY!! Not only that, I just don't feel like I'd have much time or energy to exercise and do things I want to. I know it's all about balancing your time, and people can and do have fun in medical school, but, at the same time, you still have to study hard, and you're always going to be studying to pass a test. It also has helped me decide to quit premed from watching several different peoples' tiktoks on a day in the life of a medical student. 

In the end, I realized that I was interested in health and wellness and the human body for myself, LOL. Idk if any of what I wrote was helpful, but I've been where you have and found my way out; I hope you do, too! Don't feel like you have to do medicine just because you feel pressured. At the end of the day, it's your life; you are going to be the one taking the tests, studying all day, doing the work, etc., so if you want to do medicine, make sure that it's because YOU want to do it and not because you want to make your parents or anyone else happy/proud.",1619161364,1,0
