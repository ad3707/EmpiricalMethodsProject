"Did excel in 2019-2020. I highly suggest you skip it. The only priority you get for registration is for math classes since they have certain math classes exclusive for excel students. That might sound like a great thing right? Well a quick search on ratemyprofessor and you find out that the calc 1 excel teacher has a 25% would take again rating. So you’re basically getting priority for a below average teacher, not so great now right? Theirs also the mandatory lab hours of 2 hrs per week where you have to study in their small excel room that has 2 TA’s to answer 30 students questions.  Again, not so good.

"I took ECO 3410 three years ago but I doubt that the class has changed much outside of being virtual. I found that the best strategy is to spend lots of time working through his notes yourself and making every effort to not mechanically complete homeworks, i.e. to understand why you perform each step in, say, a profit maximization problem. He teaches and assigns work to incentivize you to internalize the material and the economic ""why"" or intuition behind the math, which I suspect is the reason why his lectures appear to deviate from homework; the homeworks are just exercises while his lectures are meant to elucidate the economic underpinnings and mathematical tools at work (part of the reason he doesn't want you writing notes in lecture is so that you can fully take in his explanations and actively ask questions on the fly).

From what I recall, his exams are more like his quizzes and lecture notes. However, you will not be able to do well on quiz- or lecture-style exam questions if you don't have a solid understanding of the mathematical tools and economic examples that the homeworks provide. If you're still using Silberberg's text for some homework problems, then by all means try and do extra problems. The most important skill you should work on acquiring is seeing an economic problem and recognizing the mathematical tool(s) you will need to solve it. That's the thrust of his exams and of modern economics really, so make every effort to learn how to make that connection between an economic question and the math necessary to address it.

If any of the aforementioned is too general then by all means ask specific questions!",1611442920,1,0

Campus Crossings down the street, while the management was MUCH better, was ghetto AF. The units were a bit small, and they tended to attract a much less reputable clientelle. The unit two doors down from mine had a large drug-bust that I witnessed coming back from classes.",1612748736,1,0

"Dude I’m so sorry I had that class last semester with a different prof and it was beyond rough. The prof was decent at explaining stuff but it was really useless because she barely scratched the surface of all the stuff we were supposed to know. Worse, my textbook sucked SO much, one time I had an example problem for homework that was the duplicate of an example question in the textbook, so I put them side by side and looking between the two I literally could  not answer the homework question, despite the textbook trying to explain the EXACT same question to me. Is your textbook any good?? If it is, definitely really lean into using that. If it’s not, what I did was buy 2 self-teaching books online. I also had a far more talented family member of mine basically become my full-time tutor, which obviously isn’t a realistic option for most people, but try getting the tutors/TAs to walk you through questions as much as possible. I managed to pull an A- in the end mainly thanks to my homework grades, I literally poured hundreds of hours into homework throughout the semester, it was horrible and it still angers me to think about it because physics is completely irrelevant to my major yet for some reason I have to do 2 full semesters and this cursed class was the only open one. but anyway my homework average really buoyed my overall average, so that’s the only strategy I can recommend, in addition to getting actually helpful books. The orgo chem tutor channel on YouTube has some physics stuff, which I didn’t really discover until it was too late, but I recommend checking that out to see if it’s helpful. The time commitment of this class was unreal, so don’t be frustrated with yourself if it’s taking a super long time to get through your assignments and stuff, and try not to be too hard on yourself in general either, the class average for the last test I had last semester was 35% so it’s not on you it’s that they’re literally going to make you do astrophysics and the like",1612740140,1,0

1.) Location: Blows everyone else out of the water. Easy walk to stadium for football games and it’s between 7-11 and Publix.

3.) Rent: The rent here is better than most of what is around town. Honestly, are you really going to use the ammenities that much to care about how they are? You also have options on campus if it’smsomething serious to you.

Events, Cyber Cafe, and Clubhouse: Social opportunities and study lounge. easy enough

"I suggest applying as a freshman before getting your aa to see what kind of money ucf throws at you. Since you're here asking ahead as a junior and in dual enrollment you're a smart one, so there's a decent chance you'll get something, especially if you're eligible for Bright Futures (florida high schools). Side note, from what I remember the top 10 knights program only applies to florida high schools but I could be wrong.

If the AA is in Florida then all those credits transfer pretty neatly to UCF, even if you don't complete it. I also did dual enrollment (from a Florida high school at a Florida community college) and I got a bunch of the history gen eds and stuff done and only had to take a speech class and chemistry class at UCF before being able to fully focus on my major's classes.

Assuming you're in state, here's my suggestions for routes you could take:
1a. Apply to ucf as a fic freshman. If they give you enough money for it to make sense financially, go in without finishing the aa.

1b. Same as 1a, including the money part, except if it ends up being that you could finish up your aa before your first semester at ucf (say you apply for spring semester and you can finish up your aa in the summer and fall beforehand, or applying for fall and finishing up in summer) then go for it. Entering UCF with an AA, even if you applied as an FIC freshman, exempts you from the Gen eds of your major, even if you didn't take those classes to get your aa. (Note I don't know if this applies to every aa or just specific ones, I suggest asking the admissions office or looking around on the website)

Before taking this route, I suggest evaluating the financial cost of pursuing your AA versus how much money you save (think housing and food, since this route assumes ucf gave you enough money to cover tuition) by taking less semesters at ucf

2. Apply to ucf as a fic freshman. If they don't give you money/ don't give you enough money to make it viable to not complete the aa before enrolling, finish up the aa and then apply as a transfer. If you get your AA from a UCF direct connect college I think you're guaranteed admission. If you get your AA from another Florida college, it's not guaranteed but if you have good grades and stuff you have a really good chance

**If you're out of state**, all of these routes still apply, just you might have to fight a bit for your credits if you don't finish the aa",1613805610,1,0

"I'd say its not super linear for most positions, but I can speak somewhat for my classmates and I. While I know a few students who went straight to more AAA/AA level game dev jobs I don't think it was the majority. A lot of people got jobs nearby doing related work in military sims, a few like myself started small indie dev studios, quite a few went onto FIEA, some got jobs outside gaming but semi-related using programming or art skills. 


One piece of advice I'd give is try to get in contact with UCF grads (can start by asking teachers or game dev knights) who are in companies at a similar level to what you'd like to shoot for. Ask if they are willing to share information on what they test for in applicants. 

Extra advice, don't limit your learning to just the coursework, you are competing for positions against people who are putting in much more time that the basic assignments. Game dev is a field where you need to separate yourself to beat out the big pool of applicants at AAA levels.",1617953452,1,0

The class itself was lectures, weekly homework assignments and weekly quizzes on what you learned last week. Then the last month or so was a group project (we no longer had the weekly homework and quizzes but still lectures). He gave a list of project topics you could choose from and he'd create the groups based off of what people signed up for. The projects apply what you learned throughout the class but most of them also require a lot of external research to complete.

"Depending on what year you're in and what classes you have taken, you may or may not know this already, but recently UCF created a new pre-req for intro to C. I believe you have the choice of either taking CS placement exam and pass it , or take the pre-req class that they added very recently. 

If you are an IT/other major, you don't need to take that exam, so you're better off taking the pre-req class- especially if you are not proficient in coding.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're a CS major, you will eventually have to take that exam, but not until after you take CS 1, normally in your 2nd/3rd semester. However, again, if you are not proficient in coding, then just take the pre-req class.

"First of all, check the [UCF abroad website](https://studyabroad.ucf.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.Home) if you haven't already, and you can browse their available programs there. Also, keep an eye out for the study abroad fair that's held each semester (you should be able to see it coming up in those ""this week @ UCF"" emails, if you have trouble finding the date elsewhere). A lot of students who previously went on exchanges help advertise programs and are there to answer any questions about them, so that's probably the best place you can get information.

I'd recommend watching through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIwC0MHEPbo&amp;ab_channel=UCFAbroad), at least for the ""Program Types"" section. It's important to understand the differences between these because a lot of things like financial aid, credits transfer, and the sign up process will vary depending on which category of program you're looking at.

I did a semester exchange program through UCF. The benefit to that was that tuition and credits were handled by UCF and worked the same way they do for any other semester, so there was little hassle on that front. On the flipside though, nobody else went on the exchange at the same time I did, so I ended up having to travel and handle a lot of things solo. I didn't think I'd mind that, but it did present some difficulties, particularly since I had to deal with a language barrier (I even studied the language two years before going --there's just a big difference between practicing in a classroom and speaking in a native environment). If you go with a partner program, there might be a better chance you'll be grouping up with others, so that's something to consider.

I'd definitely recommend trying to get in contact with a student who participated in a program you're interesting in before signing up. The information I got before going didn't paint as clear of a picture of the experience as I thought it did, and I likely would have opted for a different program had I taken more time to investigate beforehand lol. The UCF abroad advisors should be able to put you in contact with a student who previously participated in one of their direct exchanges, and I'd imagine partner programs could as well (and again, the study abroad fair is helpful for this). Some of the things that I didn't think to ask about before going that I wish I did: what's the schedule for the school like? (mine ended up feeling far more like a high school than a college, which was not what I was anticipating) What's the location of the school like? What classes did you take? What was the housing like? What was the hardest/best part of the experience? Etc.

As for coursework, I ended up going between my junior and senior years, and by that point in my degree, I couldn't really get anything abroad that would work towards my major(Digital Media). I just signed up for extra language learning courses and there was no issue. It did push my graduation back by a year, but I decided it was worth it.

Hope that all helped. Good luck!",1619157353,1,0

"I’m a rising senior and based on my experience with ME classes, having a Windows system to work with would be much better than MacOS since not all important program you’ll typically use, like LabView and SolidWorks, won’t be compatible unless if you install Windows on your MacBook. I also heard good things about M1 chip in terms of performance but what I am unsure about would be its compatibility with existing software since its an ARM processor and might not function well with existing software. 

To be safe, I’d stick to a Windows laptop such as the Thinkpads since they typically have good specs and are built like a brick so it’ll last. Above all things though, try to get a laptop that has good specs since software can be demanding. So if possible, having a desktop would be preferable (since you already have a Surface Pro 7) but parts are ridiculously expensive at the moment due to shortages.
