"I didn't really see anything specific about what they would do for any groups, and I think their phrasing of ""age-friendly"" is intentionally vague so that it can be further developed. But comparing this draft to the 2010 vision? That strategic plan didn't have a section for well-being of the students or staff, though it did specifically mention ""support"" of stakeholders and other financial resources (different times, different priorities).

I'm glad supporting GT well-being is one of the 6 top priorities in the current vision, and I can't speak for past processes, but having the chance as students, not just stakeholders, to provide feedback and join the groups defining these priorities seems like a good opportunity, as long as they listen to our voice like they say they will. If we need better accessibility in terms of bathrooms, then it might take some sharing that in the feedback survey and (for those with more time they can dedicate) joining the work groups to dedicate those institute resources to the necessary communities and causes.

Ultimately, this whole thing isn't going to go perfectly, and we will probably not each see exactly what we hoped from the process. But if we assume nothing is going to happen, then we'll probably be right. However, if we hold them to their claim, to whatever extent we can, that they want to ""Strengthen our culture of ethical and professional conduct, transparency and accountability"", we might see some progress come out of it.",1582268490,1,0

"Hey folks, it‚Äôs Jason Wright at the Library. I‚Äôm the communications manager, and I‚Äôm the one that answers your questions about the Library. 

Regarding the doors: The major issue is that the Library, while open 24 hours, generally only has the two or three people at the desk working 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. During the day staffing isn‚Äôt a problem, because everyone is in the building. But ‚Äúwork‚Äù for faculty and staff generally ends at 6 p.m. or so despite being a 24-hour campus because that‚Äôs how the rest of campus operates. 

Having two entrances means that someone can walk into the top entrance and no one at the desk would be able to see them. Yes we have security, and yes they have stations at entrances, but it‚Äôs not perfect. 

Unfortunately we‚Äôve had a couple of situations where someone who was not part of the Georgia Tech community made it extremely uncomfortable for our overnight folks, even with security. So, to try and help with their safety, we keep the bottom entrance open all night. This way our people can at least see everyone walking into the building and can anticipate a situation before it happens. The top entrance on 1 remains an exit because we don‚Äôt have our people stationed there. 

We understand this can be frustrating, but please understand it only has to do with making sure everyone is as safe and protected as possible on campus. 

Also: Keep in mind this will change slightly when Price Gilbert opens because the entire ‚Äúfocus‚Äù of the complex will shift to the Grove or ground level, which connects with Clough 3. We‚Äôll have to see how the entrances are used and how sight lines develop with people in the spaces. 

Lastly, regarding someone being rude, that‚Äôs never ok. If you can DM me when this was and a general description I can work with our logistics people (they hire security) and make sure the issue is handled. 

And if you want to DM me to talk about issues you‚Äôve had, or how you feel we can improve security and access, please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me. I can always set up meetings with our leadership and facilities teams to build a better service for everyone.",1582253380,1,0

Library security and the building manager should really reconsider this stupid policy, which helps nobody and hinders almost everybody trying to get into the library after 5pm.

"I lived with exchange students for three years here.

\-Nightlife is as active as you want it to be. Go to Buckhead/Edgewood/wherever you like the vibe. Most exchanges are underwhelmed by fraternity parties but they all attend at least a few. The exchange students tend to form groups that party/hangout together so get in contact with others early on. The biggest obstacle here is that our drinking age is 21, but everyone knows that ID checks at bars/clubs aren't exactly strenuous.

\-Difficulty is a misleading way to compare your school to Tech.  We are a very well respected school (ie the classes are no joke), but the way material is taught here is very different from most of Europe.  Finals/Tests are easier but you have a much more consistent workload. Expect a problem set a week per class or project every 2-3 weeks. Many upper-level classes have term projects that take the place of the final. 2-4 ""midterms"" each semester. Basically you will not have any huge terrifying finals but in return, you will always have something to work on.  In my experience, most people tend to prefer the added structure and dispersed assignments.

\-As I mentioned earlier, most exchanges stay together with those of their own culture. You can definitely meet Americans though. I had many experiences of hanging out with Swedes/Germans/Koreans etc as the ""odd nationality out"".

\-Transportation is pretty bad. MARTA is quite limited. Uber/Lyft/Friends-with-cars will be the best way to get around. Biking/Walking if you are mainly on campus. If you travel this will be the same in most American cities like Los Angeles or Dallas. Exceptions include older coastal cities like New Orleans, the core of Boston, New York.

"It depends what you want to do with it.  I am targeting the cybersecurity/malware research indsutry and the CmpE program is fantastic for that.  CmpE will give you quite a bit of exposure to the hardware side of computing, which is useful in learning about lower level system operations.  That's where the interesting malware stuff happens.  Its also great if you want to get into chip design, VLSI, or devices in general.

I think the main complaint about the CmpE program is the lack of access to software development courses.  Our main ones are 2035 which teaches you C and Assembly, and 2036 which teaches you C++.  There is also an advanced C++ course, 4112 I believe?

It‚Äôs not a middle ground between CS and EE. It‚Äôs far more closer to ‚ÄúEE stuff for computers specifically‚Äù and there are complaints about lack of classes like OS and other software components of computing (hence why many CmpE‚Äôs get a CS minor like in SysArch). 

If you‚Äôre into low-level stuff, the maths, lots more hardware and more on circuitry end, then I‚Äôd do CmpE. If you‚Äôre more software oriented and just want to understand the hardware rather than design chips it from the ground up with all the maths and physics involved, personally imo think CS with sysarch thread is more than enough. Again, take with grain of salt, just my opinion. 

Bottom line is that CmpE != Half CS, Half EE. More like concentration of EE. Prospects for jobs are great for both.",1581185731,3,0

"No degree is worth it if you can‚Äôt get through it without being miserable all the time for 4 years. That said, there are less drastic measures you can take than quitting your degree program that will improve your experience.

I don‚Äôt know what your mental state is actually like, but feeling stressed occasionally is normal, and it‚Äôs probably not a worthwhile degree if you never have to do anything that really challenges you. On the other hand, if you feel consistently overwhelmed and unhappy then certainly you should make a change in your life.

First of all, take a realistic look at how you are doing in your classes. If you have a high 3 something GPA then you are probably holding yourself to too high a standard. Leave a homework question blank every now or study one less hour for a test and you‚Äôll be fine. Your sanity is more important than getting an A in every class. 

If this is not the case and you are really struggling to pass your classes then it gets more complicated, and you may really need to consider taking a lighter load. Yes, I know you say you can only afford the 4 semesters, but student loans are an option. I know no one likes having extra debt, but if your options are quitting, putting yourself in a situation that is detrimental to your mental health, or having one extra semester worth of student loans then I‚Äôd say the student loan wins hands down.

Also, take a (fall or spring) semester off and work. Ideally this would be an internship or something related to your major, but even if you just have to take whatever job you can get it will still be good for your stress levels and your finances.  Just because you only want to take 8 semesters does not mean they all have to be in a row. I did a co-op and found it worked nicely because I‚Äôd do a semester of classes then get a break from it all and felt refreshed and ready to go back by the time the co-op semester was over.

Finally, if this is something that really affects your mental health, talk to someone about this IRL and on a regular basis. Preferably talk to a professional, but if that is not financially feasible then a friend or family member is an option. IMO we often tend to treat mental health as not real health when it absolutely is. If you were sick and didn‚Äôt get better after several days, you would actively take steps to get better. Just staying sick would not be an option. The same should apply to your mental health.

When you graduate, you will have a significant leg up on people from the sorts of degree programs you can coast thorough. But make sure you can enjoy the here and now too.",1581140308,1,0

That's...that's what pneumonia does to your lungs, this is just phrased to incite panic.

They told you a true statement at the time of their post which was that as of today there are 5 confirmed cases in the US and none in the state of Georgia or Georgia Tech. There was no dishonesty or misinformation in the post, and the reason they sent the ""flu safety email"" is because coronaviruses spread in a similar fashion to the flu and common cold.

&gt; The University System of Georgia announced Monday afternoon that all of its 26 colleges and universities will conduct online instruction for the rest of the semester, with &amp;quot;Extremely limited exceptions&amp;quot; to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

&gt; The University System said Thursday it would close temporarily suspend instruction for at least two weeks to prepare for possible online instruction.

&gt; Emory University, the state&amp;#039;s largest private institution, announced last week it was moving to online instruction for the rest of the semester.

"The AE industry is more robust than people think it is, though it really depends on which sphere you‚Äôre working in and whether it is private or public. As for telecommuting, it‚Äôs very possible.

"Hey, 2016 alum and current employee of a major defense contractor here. Obviously we're just getting in to this whole debacle so I don't yet have a feel for exactly how we'll react, but I can say that at least on the defense side we're presently chugging right along as much as possible. Given what we've seen in the news about the airlines making massive cuts to their flight schedules I'm sure it is clear that there is a more immediate impact on that side of the industry.


Not going to get in to predictions of where this situation is headed over the next few months but suffice it to say that in some fashion we are going to be continuing to complete our work to the greatest extent possible no matter what happens because unless this lasts for years demand from our customers will not drop. As such I would guess that it is unlikely that we will be seeing mass layoffs unless this goes on very long term. Obviously that is just one person's opinion and beyond that the opinion of someone who hasn't ridden out hard times like 2008 since joining the workforce, but hopefully it gives you some perspective.

Telecommuting is possible in our industry, though there are certainly still leaders who hesitate to implement it even in the current situation. Many employees are currently telecommuting but it is dependent on your exact function and leadership. On the software side of things I would expect it would be an option, unless of course you are on a classified program. 

Hope that helps, good luck.",1584402136,2,0

"How close will you be to keeping it? If it is only one class making the difference, you might want to consider dropping that class with the extended deadline. I would probably think the same if it was 2 classes. It will be lost HOPE hours, but I would say it's much better than losing the scholarship. 

If that is not an option for whatever reason, you might want to talk to the professor of the class that is worrying you to see where you stand. You don't have to frame it as ""I need a better grade for HOPE"", but it can be discussed in the context of moving to online learning and being concerned about the new class style, etc. In my experience with Tech (which might or might not be yours), curves are generous and rarely let a student get below a C - so it might just be pushing to go up a single letter grade.

Also, moving forward, you might want to take as many electives as early as possible to give yourself a cushion on your GPA. When I was doing my undergrad at Tech, I tried to be heavy handed with loading electives in the first few years to take away some of the worry from the occasional ""C"". I know that comes at the cost of easier closing years, but it's a trade-off (not to mention I found myself enjoying the work of later classes relative to the earlier, general courses). Alternatively, look at cross enrolement for summer classes at a local community college if you need 1 or 2 more core classes (like a lab science). It will be much easier to get an A or B there, and while it won't help your Tech GPA, it will help your HOPE gpa.

Either way, I wish you the best of luck.",1586560971,5,0

Professor Stan: Not really. Well, there's actually two ways of viewing the plot of Dr. Strangelove, and that's there are either 15 or 20 ways of viewing the plot of Dr. Strangelove. None of them are a metaphor for Vietnam, but I appreciate the contribution.

Professor Stan in interview: Some students I would prefer cared less about inta.

Student:... And that is why Germany was actually right in WW2 if you think about it. (Pans to entire room visible confused or angry)

(Cut to interview with Professor Stan): And then we have some students who care way too much about the role playing.

I want to communicate to you some words of encouragement and hope. Although it is very very hard for you now, there is light at the end.

In the absence of parents who gave me that love, and although it was very difficult to reach at times, I was ultimately able to find that love within myself. I have been surprised to find that caring for and loving myself is something that I can develop and grow - and that seeking help from others, admitting when I need help, and reaching out to others at that time - is a big part of that.

I agree with a lot of these other comments; don't change your career aspirations because of this!

It's been really good for my mental health and I'm doing a bio minor instead now because I really like specific bio classes (and didn't want to be forced into taking Orgo 2 and stuff!).

I have been there as well, and I know how upsetting it can be to get a hard  and immediate ""no"" from BoA when you have poured so much time and effort into advocating a change.

The associate chairs can not directly get any change made in regards to Pass/Fail. But, generally, the second step in the chain (students/faculty &lt; assoc. chairs &lt; chairs &lt; colleges/institute &lt; USG), is not as supportive of Pass/Fail as one might expect, given all the student outrage on here. And as long as that is the case, I think it is unlikely that the message that makes it to the top of GT - the message which students hope gets argued to USG - will be strongly in support of Pass/Fail.",1586538812,1,0

"I should clarify.  The associate chairs do not have a direct impact on whether or not Pass/Fail happens. USG has the direct impact. But USG does not seem to be terribly concerned about individual students, so perhaps it would be advantageous for students to use other avenues to reach USG.

What I am saying is that now, while many students are individually pushing for Pass/Fail, the closest leadership to them, the associate chairs, may not be. And some of them are arguing against Pass/Fail to their school chairs. The school chairs report to the institute. So, if USG at least considers the opinions of the institute, the associate chairs have an indirect impact on the message USG receives.

For what it is worth - I had assumed for the past few weeks that the leadership within the institute, colleges, and schools were advocating for Pass/Fail to USG. I was surprised to learn recently that this is not the case and that some leadership within GT is adamantly opposed to Pass/Fail.",1586538091,2,0

I transferred from Auburn as a BME student, and while certain aspects have been shit-shows (the way they've handled this pandemic, for example), the entire experience has been pretty good for me. 

yes, I'm stressed a lot. Yes, I'm exhausted and haven't slept more than 5 hours in about 2 years. But that's just college. 

The communication (or lack thereof) is probably the worst part. You'll get hundreds of emails a day on the same topic, and you'll end up knowing less about the topic than you did at the start of the day. 

but overall, professors care about you. They may not show it, and it may seem like they don't, but if you talk to them and really get to know them, they care. They're people too, and they understand that we're stressed and broken and tired.

"It's mostly a question of the distance vs. staff dilemma. With more distance, elevator buttons/door handles/etc. still need to be cleaned, so more staff are required to come in. With less distance, those public items are limited, so fewer staff are required to come in. Yes, those public items are touched less frequently, but they are still being touched, and require cleaning. There's a lot of complexities involved (being landlords, being employers, having to give refunds to services that pay paychecks, adding hazard pay for the employees that are required to stay, etc.) that we don't know the details of.

I still think moving everyone is stupid. Not even so much consolidating, just forcing everyone still on campus to move during one given time. But since everyone would have their own apartments, since fewer employees would be required to come in, and since they still claim that they're working to keep public areas clean...

"Maybe I can give an unbiased outside perspective. I‚Äôm a few years removed from undergrad and I have never attended Georgia tech (tbh I‚Äôm not sure why I still follow this subreddit! But tech has the most entertaining memes and drama), but I promise you that your parents are anomalous. First, I want to preface that school reputation does not matter as much as you think it does before and while you‚Äôre in college. That being said, among engineering schools, Georgia tech is extremely highly regarded amongst academics and practitioners alike. Tech is in the same conversation as CMU, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley...etc. it is shocking your parents are engineers and don‚Äôt feel this way. 

I would also like to add from an outsiders perspective that Tech has a very strong reputation of being an INCREDIBLY difficult school, more so than other elite engineering schools. A 3.7 from Georgia Tech says a lot more than a 4.0 at other engineering schools. You have a lot to be proud of by being at Tech and succeeding.",1587630895,1,0
"OP: I think a lot of the ""advice"" you're getting in this thread is about defending GT's reputation, trying to prove your parents wrong with a ""Gotcha!"" moment, etc. It sounds good on a Reddit thread, but it's not a productive nor substantive discussion, and I wouldn't listen to it.

A friend of mine from high school had his parents and family talk shit talk his choice of college for months, and it drove him absolutely insane, they said he could do better, it wasn't that great of a school, blah blah. The school in question? Columbia.

Proving that GT is actually this ""world renowned academic institute"" would have likely the same effect that my friend had convincing his parents of the academic merits of Columbia relative to where they wanted him to go - very little if any. 

The real elephant in the room is that your parents are not being supportive of your decisions and lifestyle. It might seem like there's an ""easy out"" in convincing your parents that GT is better than they think it is, or in doing everything your parents say, but based on the fact that you think ""they are deeply disappointed with and ashamed with everything I've done after high school"", it goes deeper than just ""They think Tech isn't a good school when it is"".

I was in a similar boat when I swapped from Aerospace Engineering to LMC. My parents weren't happy - aerospace jobs paid a lot more than writing, an AE degree from GT is fairly prestigious compared to an LMC degree, and so on - and it made for some contentious behavior between my parents and I, despite the fact that I wanted to do this for myself and because it made happy. Ultimately, I made it clear that I was going to change my major no matter what and they could either get on board with it or not. I changed the subject when they tried to talk me out of it, and I made it clear that as an adult, I don't need their support and I can make my own decisions, but would love to have their support if possible. Things worked out incredibly well, they came around on it and I'm much happier with my current job than if I had doing aerospace.

It's a difficult situation to be in because if you cause a fuss with the folks you're quarantined with, there's not a good spot to run away to. That having been said, it's clearly something that's causing you grief and you're confronted with it every day, so it's difficult to sweep it under the rug for now.

If you feel like you want to try to resolve things, you will inevitably need to talk to your parents about this. When talking, make it clear that they way they act and talk about your school and your choices make you feel inadequate and it's hurtful. Remind them that you're an adult, and since they were the ones who raised you to make good decisions, they can have faith that you'll do what's best for you. Make it clear that you're not asking for them to stop giving you advice, guidance, etc. altogether, rather you're simply asking that your parents be more supportive of your decisions like going to Tech (which, the other folks in this thread do have right - GT is a tough school, especially under the circumstances, but there are considerable benefits to a Tech education). That was the messaging I used with my parents when I was asking them to be more supportive, and it helped them come around. Have confidence in yourself and be assertive.


If you don't feel like talking, try writing them a letter - you can be a lot more thoughtful and planned out with it, and if you're worried about emotions, it keeps things fairly low key.

Of course, I don't know what your parents are like - certain tactics might be better than others, so feel free to ignore all this advice or pick-and-choose the parts you like. But it sounds like at a bare minimum, it's a deeper issue than your parents not simply understanding Tech, and no problem goes away without talking through it first. Just some food for thought.",1587630593,1,0

"Georgia Tech is [tied for 4th for undergraduate engineering programs](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/engineering-doctorate).

Georgia Tech is within ~$1k for cheapest out of state tuition for any Engineering Schools in the top 30 (Except for Purdue, where GT is ~$5k away), making it by far the best education per dollar.

Georgia Tech has many major engineering companies that actively recruit from it. Look up the companies that consistently attend the all majors career fair, and your major specific career fair. Tell your parents some of the companies that recruit directly from GT that you'll be handing your resume to, I'm sure they'll be impressed by some of the names. Because EVERY impressive company recruits from Tech, or they hardly recruit from universities at all.

At the end of the day... your parents want to push you to be the best. They wouldn't even disapprove unless they wanted to see you grow into a *successful* adult, and ideally more successful than they *ever* were. Give them facts that show them that GT has what it takes to make you the top engineer. They're MEs, they appreciate facts. And dammit, it's a FACT that Georgia Tech will make you a successful engineer wherever the hell you end up. Telling an engineer you're from GT raises some serious eyebrows because of how impressive the education is. I've had multiple recruiters--both in person and general info sessions--say that they take Tech engineers over ALL the top engineering schools; we work the hardest and don't take no for an answer.

Use the facts to tell yourself and your parents that you _can't_ look down on GT. Look up all the statics you can, drop facts here and there at the dinner table. Encourage them to look up their own facts. Tell them to ask other people about the education from GT, form an opinion the _engineering_ way and get facts from credible and unbiased sources. There's over a *thousand* engineering schools in the US, being #4 is nothing to look down on.",1587624252,1,0

Don't worry, you absolutely can. You can ""fuck this class up"" among quite a few others and come out the other end just fine. I'm a graduating senior with a slightly above 3.0 GPA, and it's not the grades that matter in the grand scheme of things. And trust me, I'd know. I've gotten my fair share of C's and B's in critical classes.

You know what does matter? A passion for CS. A passion that will drive you to create things for the hell of it, a passion that will drive you to reach for internships and co-ops to gain real-world experience, a passion that will tell you that you can reach whatever heights you damn please.

And you know what this passion has given me? 2.5 years of cybersecurity research during my undergrad and an admission letter to a master's in cybersecurity here at GT, where I was applying alongside seasoned industry veterans for a spot in the program.

Keep your chin up. You have plenty of time to redeem yourself, and there's more than one way to do so. Learn from this experience and look forward.

Also, FWIW, you'll probably get a high B at worst based on what Stasko mentioned in the thread with the guy absolutely bitching him out. If you truly got A's on the first two exams, the worst you got was a 77.5%, which is most likely far from the worst grade you'll get at Tech (my personal worst was a 38% in 2550, still got a C). You've still got time to bring that grade up.

If it helps shape your perspective, a lot more people are more likely to post negative things about their professors on here than positive things. In my case, my CS professors are super accommodating and actually made the classes way less stressful. Also, we were thrown into an online environment without much warning (maybe 2-3 days max), so professors planning and adjusting to online was probably tough for them especially since they also have research gigs with employees they are in charge of running. Research, whether classes were normal or online, are way more important to them than class and reconfiguring their research probably took up a lot of their time. My hypothesis is that in the fall, there will be more time for professors to plan out their online courses.

"I went into detail in this comment: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/f3bxlq/companies_prefer_to_hire_students_from_ksu_than/fhi2s1q

But the tl;dr without doxxing myself is I‚Äôve helped with recruiting after my internship (info sessions and some resume reviews) at a large SV company, and their recruiting methods aren‚Äôt different at all from other tech companies I‚Äôve applied/interviewed/worked at.

You don‚Äôt have to believe me (despite the fact that target schools, dedicated recruiting teams, etc. aren‚Äôt exactly a well kept secret), but think about it logically: How can a company parse through tens of thousands of applications for a handful of open entry-level roles? Especially when GPA isn‚Äôt an effective indicator of someone‚Äôs professional performance (and can‚Äôt be compared between schools anyway), and quality is absolutely better than quantity when it comes to personal projects and internships. There‚Äôs no way to automate the application process, you have to consider candidates qualitatively before their interviews, and you only have a limited number of interview slots.

Recruiting season for the big players is only a month or two long, and interviews are given out a few weeks after resumes and applications are submitted. How are you supposed to compare Student 1 from X university to Student 2 from Y university if their quantitative stats and qualitative experiences are roughly equivalent? How are you supposed to do this comparison across hundreds of others with similar stats and experiences? And how do you do it in a few weeks time to get to the ones you actually want to interview? 

If you were in the recruiting team‚Äôs shoes with one interview slot left and two exact same candidates, one from GT and the other from Clemson, why wouldn‚Äôt you pick the one from the school with the higher ranked program and a more competitive admissions process?  Now look at the macro-level where GT students are more likely to get better internships than students from Clemson or other lower ranked programs due to the above reason and it becomes a vicious circle; why waste time looking at Clemson applications in the first place if you know students from higher ranked programs are more likely to get better internships?

Recruiting is a numbers game for the companies as much as it is a numbers game for the applicants. The top companies are all competing with each other to get the best and brightest students to be a cog in their machines, and they only have a limited amount of time and resources to invest. The quickest and easiest way to get the best and the brightest is to focus on the ones that have already been filtered through the increasingly competitive college admissions process. Because fact of the matter is, if you only have 100 internship slots that every CS student across the country wants to get, you can afford to be picky.

"Stony Brook is good bang for the buck, especially if you *just* want a job in the NYC area, BUT I feel like you would be better off with a GT education.  The GT experience, I feel, would have the slight edge, in addition to the fact that Stony's CS department has less classes in areas such as ML/distributed systems as well as research opportunities in general in case you may be interested in going to grad school in the future; plus student life will be at least a little better than Stony.  For cybersecurity specifically, there's only CSE 331 (Security Fundamentals) and then future security electives as well as research opportunities may vary depending on timing (they're offered on and off, apparently they're not offering security electives at Stony at all next year).  I didn't do my undergrad at GT so idk how it differs but your luck may be better for getting a better cybersecurity understanding here or perhaps a different field of interest that might not be so well covered at Stony.

Also, I'm assuming you haven't applied yet.  Keep in mind that Stony CS is having a lot of capacity issues and that it has been getting harder and harder to transfer in from a different college or from a non-engineering major if you're already a student there (remember, EVERYONE knows SBU CS is bang for buck and has the same idea as you).  I befriended a few transfers and from what I've heard you basically need a \~3.9-4.0 GPA, and that Stony has rejected people for retaking a class.  Additionally, once you get in, you WON'T be directly in the major, you will most likely be in AOI (area of interest) and will need to do well in certain pre-req classes to get in.  Even once you are in the major, it can be hard to get the classes you want, especially if they're well-reputed classes; class sizes and availability have been decreasing as of late.  I've yet to read such stories on this sub (at least for transferring into a major itself), but do keep this in mind.

TLDR: If you can afford it, I'd go with GT, due to the better CS department and for the other reasons I mentioned above

But seriously yeah that‚Äôs a ton.
