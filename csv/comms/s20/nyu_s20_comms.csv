"Hi there. I'm late to the party, but I can share some insight. I am a mental health counselor in training (not at the Wellness Exchange) and I can tell you that to some extent, all counselors do this. It is an attempt at reflecting, paraphrasing, or summarizing, all of which are common techniques. In of itself it is not bad. That being said, in the process of performing these techniques, good ones do it in such a way that makes the client feel heard. Even if a client still feels the need to direct the conversation or probe for advice, the counselor typically shows that they are on the same page and is able to follow the conversation so that the conversation progresses and does not keep dancing around the same point (albeit it can stay on the same theme if it goes there). They may also ask follow up questions. There may be some times that the conversation does not flow as naturally as it should, but the counselor typically has ways of addressing that. After all, while many people have different ideas of how much control a counselor should have over the therapy session (e.g. some say they should act passive, some think they should be more collaborative, and others say they should take complete control), one thing is for sure: it is on a counselor to make clients feel comfortable and it was not comfortable for you to have to lead your own therapy session when all you wanted was direct instruction on what to do. Ideally, a counselor would pick up on this and adapt the session accordingly.

I have had really, really, really bad experiences with the Wellness Exchange. I have also had really pleasant experiences. I know that even if I only had pleasant experiences, that wouldn't invalidate the many less-than-savory (and in some cases, that's putting it mildly) experiences that others have. I will not defend them for some of those worse things, and even when there is a good explanation behind some of the other situations, I cannot deny that students are not getting the quality of help they would like and that is not okay. I am really sorry that you had to go through that.",1581205721,1,0

3N has better parties and it's easier to block the doors and hotbox the rooms.  Get a higher floor and your views are kick-ass. Live it up my guy.,1581194415,1,0
"3N is only a 3 minute walk from the palladium gym I feel like distance from the gym shouldn‚Äôt matter if you really want to go to the gym. As for AC, both have it but during the winter months all buildings‚Äô AC is turned off and if you try to use it it‚Äôll just be heat coming out and you can‚Äôt change that it‚Äôs just how it is either get a fan or a higher floor room so the wind coming in from an open window can act as AC. Third north is a bigger social environment and has the dining hall in it as well as a dining dollar store. Uhalls commons is a bigger store if you‚Äôre looking for a few more groceries using your dining dollars but for the most part 3N would be the better choice for relevant arguments about the buildings themselves. The rooms at Uhall are nicer I think the kitchens are around the size I had a double vanity bathroom at third north with a separate door for the toilet and shower so people could use the sink in the morning even if someone else has to shower. Thought that was a plus but if you aren‚Äôt a stickler for the nicest possible rooms then I think 3N is just the better dorm.",1581186476,1,0

There‚Äôs also a breakfast/lunch/dinner spot called Breakfast &amp; Co in the basement, and a Dunkin Donuts that you can use your meal plan at. It‚Äôs only a 10-15 minute walk to campus, and its literally 2 doors down from Palladium. The E bus also stops right outside so if you don‚Äôt feel like walking you can take that. There‚Äôs also a subway station right outside the front door for the 4, 5, 6, N, Q, R, W, and L trains so if you plan on moving around the city a lot, it‚Äôs definitely nice to have that.",1581179315,3,0

"The Game Center in fact is only for a very narrow group of people. It‚Äôs not for those who want to land jobs in the AAA game industry because they simply don‚Äôt hire fresh grads designers, those who want to do programming or art because the Game Center actually has very few courses in them, those who want to pursue academic game studies or take a more humanistic approach to game studies because it doesn‚Äôt have the academic rigor and resources that a more established humanities department would have, and lastly those who are not passionate about games.

The Game Center is most suitable for those who want to become indie game designers, focused on innovative design and small scale production. But the risk of being an indie is huge. So think about your choice. Many peers of mine have regretted coming to the Game Center because they didn‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs really like before coming.",1581148146,1,0
"My advice from a CS student is to be vary of overspecializing yourself in well anything, but software engineering especially. Compared to orher devs video game jobs are quite hard to land, have high hours and generally low pay. If you want to play it safe I would suggest going for a CS degree from either CAS or Tandon, working on as many projects and games that time allows you to, and trying to land a good internship. This way if game dev doesn't work out you still have a great degree with many high paying prospects.",1581147032,1,0
"Thank you for the answer! 
Can you tell more about the game library? What games are there? The one‚Äôs students create, or is it AAA-games that are free for students? How about VR? Do you study it there? I am interested in that, and there‚Äôre plenty of games for VR on a market now, including educational ones.

What is the Game Maker? Oo",1581143321,1,0
"I‚Äôm a Game Center student currently and I think it‚Äôs very good if you‚Äôre interested in the field! The required first semester class (Games 101) is the only class where you have to memorize a bunch of dates, games, developer names, etc. And it might seem hard but if you just study for a little bit you will definitely do well on the final. Plus, it‚Äôs only one semester class. And you do learn a lot about the history of games in the class.

After that you can take a lot more interesting classes dealing more directly with developing and studying games, and within the games center are classes specifically focused on programming games with GameMaker (which are required classes).

If you‚Äôre really interesting in games and you love to play them, I think applying would be a good choice. Plus you get access to the games center library which has like every game ever in there, so that‚Äôs another big plus imo. And the profs are really cool and approachable! Very interesting people who have made cool games. The classes are not SUPER challenging in my opinion but you do have to manage your time well.

There are some required classes dealing with art, so if you‚Äôre not into that then that might be a con. Um, that‚Äôs all I can think of currently, but if you have any questions about the Game Center specifically feel free to message me and I‚Äôll do my best to help answer :)",1581142523,1,0

"Could you clarify what you're trying to ask here? CAS DS is a very new program and assuming you're talking about Stern's CDS concentration, those are two very different things which should be immediately apparent if you even look at the course plan for both tbh. One thing of immediate note is that Stern's is a concentration, not a separate major. Stern itself only offers 2 majors: BS in Business (with a mandatory concentration) and a BS in Business and Political Economy: case in point, those two have significantly different and lengthy requirements. The BPE major core consists of 48 credits and even accounting for classes which overlap with the regular BS in Business, there are still 32 credits that are BPE unique. In comparison, all concentrations with the exception of a few (only econometrics from what I can remember) are 12 credits long; that's 4 3 credit classes and most students can double concentrate. 

So if you're comparing it on the basis of dedication or depth of the subject covered, CAS is going to win but that's also bc Stern isn't trying to put together a data science major so it's an odd metric to judge it on.",1581068141,1,0

"I took this class last year. If you like literature and history, you might enjoy this class, but I found it incredibly boring. The workload isn‚Äôt that bad. The readings can be a lot, but you can get away with just skimming and finding the main takeaways of each section. The weekly papers are 2 pages which is doable. The worst part, for me, were the lectures. The prof just goes on and on about French history and writes entire novels on his powerpoints, and no laptops are allowed. I found it hard to stay awake. But, many of my classmates enjoyed the readings and the lectures. If you‚Äôre interested in the topic, you might like it.

"I‚Äôm from Texas so if you‚Äôre from anywhere that gets above 90 in the summer it is not that bad. The humidity doesn‚Äôt compare to 100+ heat at all and fans are an easy solution. I didn‚Äôt buy a fan and i never felt more than a slight flush in the heat. This year they gave out high quality fans for free as it got colder but I never ended up needing one. Plus I found I was not in my room at the beginning of the semester that much to feel it. 

Another plus is the affordability. I‚Äôve been in rooms in Brittany, Lipton, Founders, and Third North this year and if finance is really a concern, Rubin is the most bang for your buck. Kitchens/apartment style dorms are not worth it especially because you still have to pay for a meal plan which is mandatory.

This doesn‚Äôt apply to every room but the views can be really good. From my (corner) room I can see Bobst and all the way to FiDi and the Jenga building which is really pretty at night. Also the rooftop events and views are literally to die for. 

The live in faculty are super nice, I have only a met Heidi but she does her best to carry on events and make connections with students. My biggest regret is not participating in more building programs and meeting other people. 

Being so close to campus is nice because it only takes me about 7 minutes to walk to Bobst and a lot of the Writing the Essay classes which you will have to take are held in the Rubin classrooms. There is a good amount of diverse restaurants in the area which you don‚Äôt find as much in Goddard and Lipton and Grubhub has plenty of options. 

One of the downsides is the elevators get really busy during popular times so 9:15-9:30 and 10:30-11:00 because everyone is trying to leave for class. However if you leave like 5 minutes before those times the elevators are empty.

Rubin is also a 10ish minute walk from any subway station which can be kind of deterring when it gets cold or dark, however, it is truly not that bad unless it‚Äôs freezing outside because the views are nice. 

I tried to break this up into paragraphs for visibility but as a current resident in Rubin I would definitely recommend atleast giving it a thought and watching some room tours on youtube.",1582142758,1,0

First question yes and yes,1583295981,1,0
"I absolutely don't want classes to stop, but in two weeks... they'll have no choice. This pandemic is like nothing seen by anyone living at the moment, and it will rock America off it's shoes with how unprepared it is (mostly for those needing hospitalization/intubation... who might not get it once it gets to a high-tide and treatment capacity is maxed).

Edit: I've been following this for a while you could say... in any event, at a bare minimum just keeping sanitary and hoping for the best is a good idea. But... these last few months have been absolutely negligent and downright criminal by authorities here. It might turn very, very bad. This isn't ""like the normal flu"", in that 20~% (instead of .2~%) need intubation/ventilator breathing support. Once treatment capabilities are maxed out, instead of a (still) relatively low mortality rate, it could shoot up to that percentage.

Addendum: Yes those needing hospitalization skew to mostly the elderly and weak, but still. Could you imagine if it spreads to large swathes of the nation (due to zero measures taken), and a good 10, 20 million people die.
If only the US would do at least what China's been doing.",1583295903,2,0
"I don't think the vast majority of leadership is so dumb as to not realize what is happening. So I can only take their relative silence (or useless assuaging messages) as pure spineless inaction in fear of speaking up first before others about the truth (so many students here could use it as well. Saying everything is fine and to just go on as normal, and to definitely not ""don any special gear"" is as criminal as what Trump is doing).

Still, 2 weeks max NYU starts talking about some serious issues/movements, and 3 weeks max closed/online I say. Of course, NY better start testing people. Or it'd be funny if we lasted till commencement with only a portion of the students still standing, and large swaths suffering from ""some cold/illness"".",1583295726,1,0

"I wouldn't go outside in Shanghai for sure. But everyone there wears masks, and everyone takes it seriously (and well, of course there are the quarantine etc. measures).

In NY? Nothing yet, they had their time. But this is the US lol. And NYers from who I've talked to, won't stop their life and quarantine easily.

The only really bad thing, is how unprepared they are here. As in the health infrastructure, as well as how they are basically doing all they can to make it spread to everyone lol (""Don't wear masks, those are bad!"").
The kicker comes here: The 20% rate of coronavirus cases that need hospitalization are of course slanted towards the elderly and weak, but once the hospitals reach maximum treatment capacity with intubation/ventilators etc., then that becomes the mortality rate (instead of point some or 1~2%). That's why we saw an early 10% mortality rate in wuhan/hubei. I'm afraid it'll be quite bad over here, as they're not ready, at all. ([It's a lot worse than ""the normal flu""](https://i.redd.it/i1461d6hzkk41.png))

Also I guess, it's taken a bit to get people to be serious about it here, so there's a highly increased chance to get it from people living in close quarters/etc. Then again as a young person, hopefully you can just recover easily with some rest, and not have too great long lasting effects (though it's possible).

Being at home in Shanghai (for me) would be much safer than being at the new epicenter of a pandemic modern America has never seen or prepared for. But of course, if I had a good place to stay, somewhere nearby NYC, bunkering out could work just fine too. Then again, the harsh truth is there are some pluses to a strong regime like China's, especially if you live in comfort in Shanghai.",1583295429,2,0

"So the big picture is that if university closes students get sent back, and kicked off of campus, due to the severity of the situation. (This is happening in NYU campuses abroad) This means that the population that has a home where the infection is worse has to either 1) pay for housing in NYC 2) go to where the conditions is worse. I agree NYU should take action but closing the university is not the best thing to do.

For evidence supporting this. Yes NYU would send students back, it happens in Florence. Campus shut down and everyone had to go to wherever home was for them. Some students are staying in London for a month (and paying out of their own pocket) and figuring out what to do since home for them is a heavily affected area. 

There‚Äôs too many moving parts to consider. If you‚Äôre willing to hold off on graduating that‚Äôs on you, but it shouldn‚Äôt be the collective decision: Im sure there‚Äôs a middle ground I‚Äôm missing as well and I‚Äôm open to acknowledge if I‚Äôm incorrect too. There just a lot of students who financially cannot afford the set back in graduation. Meaning, having to take summer courses that may be paid for by NYU but also not being able to work and pay off any debt or miscellaneous fees.

"That I completely agree with, and thanks for putting it so nicely. I was expecting really intense comments haha.

"Self-quarantine is probably a step they will skip. They did this already and it proved to not be super cost-effective.

"I honestly understand the concern for the virus, but if what is fueling this is just a desire to have classes canceled,  I don't agree. I know I'll get downvoted for this but let me explain.   
The obvious one is Seniors. I am a Junior, but I still understand that pushing back classes and possibly canceling them will have a rippling effect on Seniors. Graduations can be pushed back, and this affects people who had the intention of having full-time jobs, preparations for grad/med school, things like that. Not to mention that this will affect all years, but will have the most immediate affect on Seniors.   


If NYU cancels classes, it will be extremely hard to make up the time lost. I am from the NYU Florence campus and the online courses we are receiving are screwing us over hard. Some material can't be taught online and needs to be taught in person. Furthermore, professors absolutely hate this, with technical difficulties, and lack of coordination I am set back 2 weeks and midterms are still coming regardless of whether we complete them online or not. Material is poorly taught and will mess you up harder in the long run for the second set of midterms and finals. Example:  Cancelled classes does not mean that professors will stop assigning you readings that you are responsible for over the course of time. Meaning, if you don't understand something you have limited access and opportunity to clarify it before midterms.   


Pushing NYU to do this could possibly have students exit housing. We sometimes forget that while NYU has its headquarters in NYC it can still push students out of housing and tell them to go to a safer location if home is a safer locations. This is happening abroad. Example, if the coronavirus had hit NYC first and cases escalated, they would have sent students home earlier, and pushed the semester back one month. This is money that will not be refunded to students. This is happening in Florence right now. Students were sent forced to be sent back, it didn't matter where they went , they just couldn't be on campus.  Parents are pissed right now because money was spent to send students to NYU sites and NYU is staying firm that it will not refund any sort of housing payments to students. 

I don't mean to sound hard, I just want everyone to know what the courses of actions will lead to. Feel free to disagree or comment below, I don't mind chatting further about this :) I promise I don't mean to be rude, I probably am missing a bigger picture too and public concern is well enough of a reason to take action.

Wash your hands. Keep hand sanitizer with you. Be cognizant if when you touch your face. Stay home if you‚Äôre feeling sick and speak to a healthcare provider if your symptoms match the disease profile. I‚Äôm not saying this isn‚Äôt a serious problem, but panicking is not helpful.",1583278525,5,0

"Ummmm, it's a bit complicated. Basically, the Intro to Programming course which is the prereq for Intro to CS at NYU counts as an elective for CDS, but isn't a part of the major track for DS or CS.

Also, the DS class ""Intro to Machine Learning"" has Math-UA 235 (Probability and Statistics), Lin Alg, and DS as required courses in order to take it so you really have to structure out your studying. 

The CS track automatically saves you one course as well (12 courses vs 13 courses) and is comparatively less structured (you need to go Into to CS -&gt; DS -&gt; CSO but that's about it) so it would definitely be easier to do a CS major on its own vs. a DS major on its own; whether it's better to do CDS+CS &gt; solely DS is a harder question though.

NYU's overall handling of the COVID-19 outbreak has been incompetent and inexcusable. Firstly, it is dismissive and irresponsible of NYU to evacuate all undergraduate students from housing. Students will spend collectively millions of dollars flying out of New York, running a very high risk of spreading coronavirus out from this hotspot for the disease. The university is not carefully considering students who a) come from immunocompromised families and were depending on the dorms to isolate themselves or who b) live abroad and may be unable to travel back home to places where the outbreak is currently worse. 

Additionally, there is no good justification to evacuate the dorms, which do not risk facilitating the virus any more than other NYC apartment buildings. It is therefore apparent that health and concern for students is not the primary motivator for NYU's decision-making at this time ‚Äî rather, the university is only interested in shifting the burden of responsibility away from itself and onto students, whom NYU has abandoned. 

Lastly, NYU's choice to operate remotely for the rest of the semester is a huge compromise to the quality of education which the student body is receiving. Students expect their classes to include not only the curriculum and the professors, but also the university's facilities and advantageous location. It is particularly damaging to students in arts fields, whose classes will not yield portfolio pieces, who will be unable to perform junior/senior recitals, who will not receive the education which they have paid for by merely dancing/acting/singing over Zoom. Although the decision to move to remote classes was arguably inevitable, this is objectively not the quality of education we rightfully expect from the university.

With all this in mind, I believe that the only fair course of action would be the following: 1) To extend the deadline by which students are expected to be evacuated from housing. NYU's decision to evacuate was made hastily and after the start of spring break, so it is staunchly unreasonable to expect students to make arrangements to leave on such short notice. Most importantly, 2) to offer partial refunds for this semester's tuition. We have simply paid for a service from the university that we will not receive in its entirety, and we should be rightfully reimbursed. It is insulting if the university thinks that it can delude students and parents of students into believing that the quality of education is the same/sufficiently similar over Zoom compared to physical classes. It is insulting that the university thinks that the student body will silently accept this blatant injustice. 

In order to preserve the least bit of integrity in the eyes of the student body, I urge the university to seriously consider these proposals.",1584417869,1,0

This decision doesn't just endanger ourselves, but it endangers those around us (both in the city and when we return home), as because of this hasty return to New York we could become asymptomatic carriers and spread the virus even further. Did NYU not get the memo about social distancing?

"Ok, this is fucking absurd. A dorm is not any worse of an outbreak hazard than any normal apartment building. Shutting down facilities is one thing, evacuating *12,000 students* is fucked over-reacting, and doing that in ***6 days?*** 

Ok, let's assume that everyone has a safe place to go home to. You're going to send *how many students* home through airports in New York, where the outbreak is the worst? Ignoring the possibility that anyone is already a carrier, there's an *awesome* chance of becoming a carrier in the act of traveling home, and then congratulations you've helped spread the disease! 

[Ten days ago](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-10/us-coronavirus-cases-far-above-official-tally-scientists) the realistic estimate for Coronavirus carriers was 10,000. [Today we're reporting 1,500 confirmed cases](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200316-sitrep-56-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=9fda7db2_2) within the United States. A third of those *confirmed* cases are in New York City. Telling the few thousand out of state and international students to just leave would be like China telling a few thousand people from Wuhan to just fly around the country. This is not a responsible decision. Telling students not to come back is as good a decision as telling students to leave is a bad one - this is facilitating mass travel.

And what good is telling students to leave the dorms going to do for the bulk of students who *come from New York?* You're not putting them any farther out of reach of the virus! 

Yes, an outbreak in the dorms was always going to be a matter of when, but a dorm can be quarantined. I stayed in the dorms *knowing* I would get sick sooner rather than later, and have been preparing for a few weeks of isolation. This decision removes agency from full adults in weighing the risks of staying vs. leaving. 

*We are already at a time where the idea of closing off Manhattan Island is being discussed. Restriction of movement between countries is already being applied, restriction of movement between states is already under heavy consideration, and restriction of public gatherings has already been applied.* For this decision to have impact it would have needed to be made weeks ago.

**Edit** Oh yeah, and ***Pro-rated** rates for a month and a half of ***Downtown Manhattan rooms?*** The only acceptable amount of money to withhold is what's needed to pay the wages of people who would be working here at those times. [28%](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/budget/operating-budget/major-categories-of-expense.html) of NYU's expenses are building maintenance and operating cost related, soooo a month and a half of slashed costs for a fourth of the budget should represent some significant savings on the part of the University.

The basis ofc is, even if one student who would have received credits ends up not getting them due to the coronavirus, and with it blows away all the effort and resources invested, that is an injustice that doesn't require much to fix, and doesn't really give an obvious loss to anyone (the university or other students)",1586550912,1,0

"Ok so I had the exact same issues as you last year. Courant has a great reputation but is traditionally a school withing CAS.
Th√© merger made everything more confusing but this is my take on it as a math major in Tandon.

I'd say the only difference as of now is the core requirements. As you probably already know, you have to take physics/chemistry and CS at Tandon as well as one engineering concentration (if you want to go into quant finance take CS). In CAS you have to do a bunch of humanities requirements, which imo are useless and not worth the tuition. I'd rather die doing physics than having to do a cultures and context class, but that's just me.

 You can take math classes at Courant at the Washington Square campus, because they're cross listed as Tandon courses (apart from calc 1, calc 2 and applied ODE, applied Statistics and the other 2 applied classes). I was doing it this semester until the covid 19 situation, and planning on doing it next semester with another honors class.

 Basically when it comes to math education we have the same as CAS students. Although some may argue that the classes at CAS are better/more theoretical etc. it doesn't even matter because once you finish calc 1 and 2 you only need to do your applied math classes at Tandon during your junior year and all the rest of your math classes can be in Manhattan.

Moreover, a lot of Courant professors are now in Brooklyn and they also move from campus to campus. So don't worry about the quality of education, the math department is amazing regardless of where you are (my observation so far).

You might also be worrying about Tandon's reputation for math. I honestly can't help you with that because I've been stressing about the same thing. However, I've talked to the head of the math department at Tandon (who used to work in Manhattan btw) and she assured me that since the departments have merged with Courant, that it doesn't matter. A math degree from NYU is still a math degree from NYU. 
I'm not sure whether to trust that, but so far I loved every single math class I've had, specifically Linear Algebra honors which I highly highly recommend if you're up for a challenge.

Good luck",1586537120,1,0

"There is an issue involving the meaning of the grade itself. What does an A or a B or even an F mean during a global pandemic? In my opinion it is meaningless because it‚Äôs not the same as the A or B you got last semester in a comparable class due to the situation. My professors at least are doing online test that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt allow open notes‚Äù but obviously most will cheat which could inflate grades and the professors have no ways of monitoring. Likewise they are trying to maintain ‚Äúacademic rigor‚Äù and ‚Äúthe integrity of the course‚Äù which in my case involves giving more and harder work to the point of being overwhelming. Regardless grades in many classes especially with a curve mean that grades could be inflated slightly in favor of those who are able to attend. 

Likewise, some grad schools have already stated they will accept pass/fail but prefer the letter grade when it is optional. This means that if the school uses an opt in system grad schools might look down upon it when it is optional while if it‚Äôs mandatory they can‚Äôt punish us for it.",1586533947,1,0

"NYU is definitely on the rise as of late, especially in its graduate departments, so the reputation of the schools seems to be getting closer and closer each year. I would make the decision based off of the experience you‚Äôd like to have in college and your future goals.

Cornell offers a much more traditional campus experience with sports, outdoors activities, more active Greek life, and a closer knit, smaller community. However, it is isolated in upstate New York and you‚Äôd be limited to the campus and surrounding area.

At NYU you‚Äôd have tons of opportunities to pursue your interests and establish connections in the city and globally, as NYU has probably the best study abroad network available. I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs a great experience living in NYC for 4 years with little-to-no long term commitment. You really grow as an individual and become very independent. With that said, you need to be 21 to go to bars and such in NYC, which is a lot of the city‚Äôs appeal.

If I were to pick, I‚Äôd probably go to Cornell undergrad and NYU for grad school if you want the best of both worlds, which is actually similar to what I did myself haha. But if you‚Äôre looking for a job or internship in the city, NYU would be the best option",1586529499,1,0

This is all on top of the argument for fairness. Why should some peoples grade stay the same while others improve because they had the resources. I don‚Äôt even have a desk to work on at all at home.

"I'm a grad student at Tandon. 

I live near Myrtle/Broadway, its less than 30 min from campus via subway. A lot of shows/venues are in and around Brooklyn, especially near Williamsburg. I'd recommend NOT living in a multi-unit walk up despite the lower rent. (A house/condo would be a lot better for your sanity lol).

In general yes, Clinton Hill is pretty family oriented. But it is quiet which is a big plus. The further you go out into Brooklyn, especially near low-income housing and hospitals, generally there is a lot more noise pollution.

A lot of young (18-25) year-olds live in Bushwick because its cheap and you can find a house.

Not that I know of, not many grad students have cars, it's not worth it in my opinion unless you want to escape the city (may as well rent a car). It's more of a hassle to have a car (insurance, parking, etc.) and driving in New York (even Brooklyn) is not easy. It's much easier to bike or take the subway. 

Depends. As it looks for now, I'm doubtful that the school will resume in person in the fall. The subways are still open, yet eerily empty and rightly so.

"I‚Äôve totally been there don‚Äôt worry lol. I approached my Why NYU essay completely different than my previous essay. In my option my precious essay really didn‚Äôt show who I was or anything about my character rather than just a bunch of programs I wanted to be involved with, so I started off with an anecdote about what really makes me stand out compared to other people/makes me, in my opinion, unique. My goal was to make them remember me and I think I did because told a story how I made a phone out of a banana. Essentially that was my into how I made a phone and it was unique and cool. Also I should mention I am an engineer so I talked about programs, research labs, projects, etc that I can work on, but I all related it to the banana phone which was my essential theme. So a paragraph would be like ‚Äúhere at the NYU (lab name here) I could improve upon my skills to bring new projects into fruition‚Äù (something like that). So essentially try your best to showcase your personality. In my opinion, the really good essays are the ones that are truthful. You‚Äôve got a lot of time so you should just start doing some light research and see what you‚Äôre into. Also I throughout my first semester, I visited the campus a few times and spoke with students and friends who go there. After each trip I would write down my feelings because I definitely think it‚Äôs important to include how you feel about the school.  Wish you the best of luck and please ask me more or to elaborate on more stuff. 

Here is a video I was talking about that really helped me: https://youtu.be/aXXq8dsOL5Y

Regarding transfer process my best advice is doing all of your stuff early. Email or call NYU with any questions you have because that‚Äôs where you will get the best answers. Also try to establish connections with teachers who would be willing to write a rec for you and stuff. That‚Äôs pretty much it from what I remember.",1588647305,1,0

"in CAS you'll have 3 required freshman classes. 

One is Writing the Essay which is pretty easy if you can write an essay (lol). Thats twice a week, no recitation, 4 credits.

You'll have your cohort which meets for like every day the first week (:/) and then once every two weeks for the whole first year. It's a pass/fail class where attendance is your pass or fail. You basically just learn about college and nyc life. It's not worth any credits but required.

Last is your freshman seminar which is a class that includes half your cohort. You get to pick the topic the seminar is on from a ton of different options, make sure to pick something you really enjoy as it's a 2 1/2 hour class that meets once a week. Mine was pretty cool bc we mostly watched movies lol. 4 credits

So technically you only have 8 credits required for freshman year classes, but you have to meet all of NYU's core curriculum standard by graduation which is like .. a dumb amount of credits. If you google 'NYU CAS core curriculum' it should come up, it's like 2 sciences, a math, a social science, 2 cultures classes, a texts class, and passing through a 4th semester of a language (You can test out of that if you already know another language).",1588645851,2,0

In CAS you'll generally take a 4-credit class, meaning a lecture that meets twice a week for 1.25 hours and a recitation once a week for 1.25 hours. If you're lucky, no recitation. Some 4 credit classes meet once a week for 3-4 hours. Hope this helps!",1588645191,2,0

My friend negotiated and her school asked her to pay a certain amount of tuition up front she got 10% off per year for all of the years.

"It‚Äôs simple, though, to respond to misinformation and misrepresentation with what you know to be the correct information. When Trump said the stupid thing about uv light and disinfectant, there was an instantaneous wave of backlash and reporting that demonstrated what he was saying was bogus.

Commenting an opinion and prefacing it by saying ""I'm just a freshman so I may be not 100% accurate but this is what I've heard..."" is also acceptable but from what I've seen it's more along the lines of ""this is what you should do"" even when they don't know shit.

This is just plain wrong. There's still other people who aren't necessarily underclassmen on this subreddit. I could argue that you're essentially arguing against the whole purpose of Reddit too in this case.

Simple example: people want ways to get rid of coronavirus. ""oh how do I get rid of coronavirus... how do I reduce my exposure, what do I do, etc."" are all valid questions. People are allowed and should be allowed to ask such questions regardless of how stupid they are. However, what I'm saying is that someone who isn't qualified to answer such a question shouldn't even attempt to answer it. ""I've heard from some third party source this might work...."" or ""inject disinfectants and get more uv exposure"" or whatever shit trump said is far worse than just letting the doctors respond and waiting until they respond.

"Good point noting to use professors and alum as resources. That‚Äôs what I meant when I said informational interviews.

Sure, there are unconventional ways, but there are also tried and tested structured ways. I‚Äôm surprised your friend didn‚Äôt end up getting arrested/thrown out by Citadel. Cold calling without having some appointment/schedule will also annoy more people often than actually help you. Please don‚Äôt just walk in. I‚Äôm also worried about security at Citadel‚Äôs office if that actually happened, seems complete BS.

Again, stick to advice from people who ended up in roles you want. Find them on linkedin, see if you have a mutual friend who can introduce you or figure out their email and shoot them an email. Most alums are often willing to talk to you if you don‚Äôt seem like a complete idiot. Set up a call with them and then talk. Eg. Want to intern at BX? Find a NYU alum at BX. Figure out their email.

"good post, check out /r/financialcareers for career advice from ppl actually 6 ft deep in the financial industry. But then again, a lot of these resources can seem circlejerky, and I don't think you need to look further than WSO to confirm that.

But to be fair, ofc there are a lot of jaded people on any college subreddit. I'm sure there are people in Stanford or Wharton saying the same thing, it's just what happens if there's a dedicated college subreddit filled with 21 yos. For every Stanford kid who wants to knock on Sequoia's door for his new janky startup, there's a Stanford freshmen who watched some Paul Graham video about the perils of entrepreneurship talking him out of it. A kid from Harvard could flunk a Jane Street interview and rant about it on /r/harvard and stay jaded for a very long time. And then there are jaded people who DID do those IBD or HF internships, then talk about it on /r/nyu or what not. 

The freshmen/sophomore giving career advice is very valid though, but there's nothing wrong with sharing perspectives from different people, even if they have no right to talk about it. A lot of NYU kids have successful parents, and even if they are regurgitating what their parents told them about finance or tech, I would be happy to listen since a lot of these parents paying NYU tuition are very accomplished people. You just gotta know to navigate through the bullshit. But great post.

p.s. to add on, use your professors and alumni as a leverage. A lot of talented people I know who have the craziest jobs (Moore Capital, SIG, BX) got their internships / FT offers through unconventional sources like cold-calling, asking professors they're close with, etc... Hell, I know a mutual friend who got a trading internship at Citadel's Chicago office by literally pretending like he had a meeting with a senior personnel and walked in with his P/L statement.

"Transferring to Stern is not as hard as people make it is. 

First, make sure you understand what prerequisites you need to get into Stern. You need to take Writing the Essay, Calculus 1/Mathematics for Economics I, and Principles of Financial Accounting. There might be more I'm not aware of but those are the major ones. 

Second, write a solid essay. I can't stress this enough. Be as detailed as possible on why you want to pursue business as a major. Talk about the strengths that Stern offers that you can't find at CAS. It's good to be as specific as possible, so talk to a lot of upperclassmen or professors at Stern who can give you details. Don't just write about stuff you can find on the website. 

Third, for obvious reasons, try to get a good GPA. As a freshman student, they only consider your Fall grades, so get at least a 3.7 and you should be fine. I know students who also transferred in with 3.4, 3.5's so its not the end of the world, but try to get classes with easy professors that can boost your GPA up. 

If you follow all these steps you should be pretty set for transferring into Stern. Again, for some reason people say its impossible to internally transfer to Stern, but I for one know many of my friends who transferred internally from CAS, LS, and Tandon. Also, if you don't get in as a freshman, you can apply your sophomore year as well. Good luck!",1585438634,1,0

"Okay, hi, it may sound like a stupid question but is it possible to change the NYU school before the enrollment but after the admission results? I know it is possible to apply for an internal transfer after the freshman year, but is there a way to avoid waiting (and risking a LOT of money if the transfer would be unsuccessful)? I just recently changed my mind concerning my major and future path and I am stressed out that I would have to resign from the NYU because of the wrong school I applied to.....",1585438528,1,0

"For freshmen course selection shouldn't happen until June. Unless it's different for Tandon (I'm in Tisch), generally what you want to do is login to Albert and stay on the ""Home"" tab. Under Home there will be a section titled ""Shopping Cart,"" go there and click on ""Course Search."" Here you can look through all the courses available, and when you find one you want you click ""select class,"" which will let you add it to your shopping cart. After you've added all the courses you want and are back on the homepage there will now be a button under Shopping Cart that says ""Validate/Enroll/Edit."" When your registration time rolls around, you click on this and first go through the steps to ""validate"" each of the courses you want to enroll in, and then go back and go through the steps to ""enroll"" in each course.

The other things I would note are:

1. There's a very good chance your process may unfortunately look different from previous years, just since everything about the fall is sort of up in the air right now, so just keep that in mind when looking at the answers you get here
2. There's a pretty good chance you aren't going to get anywhere close to your ""ideal"" schedule freshman year. All current students already registered in April, and then for freshmen your registration time is also based on what school you're in, so by the time you go to register, a lot of the classes you want (or specific sections of those classes) may already be taken. My personal advice would be to focus on building a schedule (in terms of timing) that works well for you rather than focusing on the courses you're taking. Obviously take courses that interest you when possible but if, for example, you know that an 8 AM class is not going to work for you, don't just enroll in an 8 AM class bc it's the only section of a class you really want to take. Most likely that class will be offered again, and first semester of freshman year is just a big adjustment, so having a schedule where you make sure you can actually eat lunch, where you don't have to worry about getting up at a terrible hour, etc, is important in my opinion. 
3. There are a lot of classes at NYU that actually happen at night. I know in Tisch there are some that are like 6-10 PM, and then in most of the schools one common section time is 6:20-7:00 PM. Honestly you won't be able to avoid these section times forever, but I'd try to avoid them 1st semester freshman year if you can. Most clubs meet around 6-8 PM, so if you want to participate in those (which I strongly recommend) those class times are obviously a bit of a problem.",1589750522,2,0

**EDIT:** But even if I had only one concentration and a second major, I still would have chosen to take 18-credit course loads to sort of get the most out of my tuition. So in that sense, the second concentration didn't necessarily make my workload heavier.",1589738669,1,0

"I disagree with this for the same reason this sub disagreed with universal pass/fail -- it takes the choice of what to do away from all students based on a vocal fraction of the student body. Except this argument seems even worse to me because it doesn't even have the backing of trying to help all students' grades. As for how deferring helps NYU, I don't really care because NYU wouldn't care if I went bankrupt attending it. As a student in mostly lecture based classes and works just as fine, if not better, at home, I am perfectly fine with the quality of my classes, and because I intend on attending grad school, I absolutely do not want to spend another semester waiting to finish out all of my degrees. I know what I paid for and it isn't to learn so much as it is to get my fancy degree, and online classes does not change the value of my diploma (despite all the jokes about Zoom University). In fact, as someone with social anxiety and depression, I benefit from online classes because I don't have to face the strain of needing to constantly be surrounded by others and to always have to look presentable, and can fully focus on studying and working. I feel like because of the vocal outrage everyone expresses about online classes, this post got caught up in focusing on the people who don't like it and arts students specifically, overlooking the people who don't care about necessarily the quality of how they learn or benefit from an online environment. It's fine to say you prefer in person and would rather defer, but to say you'd rather cancel classes entirely than let people have the option of going online at all just because you don't like it strikes me as somewhat selfish.",1587619715,0,0
"Hey!

The student population is very small so you'll be able to make a lot of close friends. Everyone lives on-campus, so there are a lot of parties. They did say that it is very removed from Abu Dhabi (because they're on an island or something?) so it's hard to get to the city and do stuff off-campus. A lot of international students and since NYU pays for 100% of tuition, differences in class aren't really a big thing. However, they did point out how everyone is *so* competitive and the studying culture is pretty hardcore. When they study abroad in New York they're always so happy (and shocked) at how chill and, dare I say, dumber everyone is.

2.	Probably obvious, but if you‚Äôre not super focused on a specific set of skills or goals coming in, it‚Äôs gonna be hard to get your money‚Äôs worth or have a good time. NYU‚Äôs too expensive to come and just explore or whatever, it‚Äôs grad school.

However, as someone who is paying very close to full tuition, I don't feel that it's ""fair"" to be paying so much for online classes. That being said, if the fall semester is remote, I would continue with classes as planned.

I do worry about the volume of students who would defer/take a semester off.

"While I can appreciate your intentions/motives, nearly every one of your points is severely flawed. 

First point: NYU must pay faculty/staff regardless of whether they are online, on campus, or deferred for the semester (under your plan). Some staff are unionized, faculty members likely under contracts (especially tenured research related), etc. If the school deferred, they would not collect tuition at all. If they stay online, they can still charge tuition. Yes, some students may defer if they are in the Arts or Physical Sciences that may benefit from equipment/in person classes, but compared to the majority...NYU would probably be ok with those deferral if it means getting the rest to stay online. Moreover, many students can complete electives or core requirements online unrelated to their major. Especially Freshman and Sophomore undergrad students. 

Second point: Yes, NYU is not ASU...and staying online doesn't change that. Yes, the tuition may be much more than ASU to stay online, but the degree will still show NYU. It will not say NYU online or anything to resemble a difference. Yes, some students may complain...but what else are they going to do? Realistically they could transfer out, but they probably would not because they want the NYU name already. Second, NYU is not alone in this pandemic situation. Thus, transferring out to another college may be cheaper...but they may be online too or they will go online if a second wave hits in the Fall/Winter. NYU also knows that for any number of students that want to leave the school, they have many others lined up waiting to take their place (regardless if it stays online). The reason is simple, NYU will reopen and life will get back to normal in 2021/2022. So for most students a semester online is not going to be a deal breaker for those just starting out at NYU. For those on their way out...they probably will stay since they already paid 2-3 years at NYU, credit may be wasted if they exceed the transfer limit, and they will lose the name recognition. So again, maybe a very small will complain...but the majority will stay put. 

Third point: Yes, art majors may feel cheated/lacking the experience or equipment...but where else will they go? NYU should grant these majors an option to defer if they want, but most will not leave NYU if they stay online for the Fall. Honestly...where do you think an art major will go? ASU, Rutgers, Florida State? I doubt it. 

Fourth point: Two semesters with short vacations would not be very viable. First, people plan their academic careers in advance. Second, J-Terms and Summer Terms allow NYU (and other universities) the ability to make more money during said terms. They rent out student housing, credit courses for those needing to catch up, or for those seeking to get ahead. Third, students will not take too kindly to ""short"" vacations. What you are essentially proposing is 3 consecutive semesters with about a month break. Fall starting in J-term, Spring starting somewhere in about April and ending in July/early August, and the subsequent Fall semester starting right back in September. Very few students can take that emotional/academic demand. It may be fine for seniors graduating over that summer, but not for all others that have the next year ahead of them. Fourth, that raises all contractual issues with Faculty/Staff since they have their own breaks and research commitments during breaks. In sum, that is an economic disaster, an academic/student relation disaster, and an administrative disaster. 

As mentioned, I can sympathize with students that feel cheated/missing out on the experience, equipment, etc. That said, the school must look at things from a practical, economical, and academic standpoint that benefits the majority (even if it irritates a percent/minority of the students). It is not that similar to the students complaining/demanding tuition refunds. 

Again, completely understandable...but not realistic. Every college/university has faced the same crisis. They are all losing millions of dollars as it is, and it sets a dangerous precedent to try an appease some students. If NYU were the only school in this situation, I would be more inclined to say they can attempt to appease some students...but they are not alone in this issue. If NYU attempts to change the standard now, smaller colleges/universities across the country may collapse. The reason, their students will use NYU as the standard and the ones without NYU's economic strength will go bankrupt/close. Again, students can not think of things from a personal or emotional perspective in this regard. The big picture has many moving parts and can damage an entire system.",1587594310,9,0

My roommate called Housing yesterday and they said that Phase 2 has been delayed for everyone. They haven‚Äôt sent out announcements for room selection times because they don‚Äôt know when it will be ready.,1587589261,3,0
"I‚Äôm not a veteran but I use my dad‚Äôs GI bill benefits to pay for NYU. 

The housing allowance has changed every semester I‚Äôve been here but you should assume you‚Äôll get between $3300 and $4000 a month for each month of instruction. So you do NOT get housing for January or summer since you aren‚Äôt actually enrolled in classes then (unless you take a J-term or Summer class) which is something to consider. The city is expensive so I would expect roommates but as for areas you can check out Stuytown, it‚Äôs pretty popular for NYU students and is pretty close to campus and a NYU shuttle goes over there. 

I used the GI Bill plus yellow ribbon which NYU doesn‚Äôt have a limit on the number they give which is nice. However, if you use the yellow ribbon you only get ~$43,000 for tuition when tuition is $50,000+ so some of tuition will come from your housing allowance. If you don‚Äôt use the yellow ribbon, you only get $23,000 from the GI Bill so remember to use the yellow ribbon program. 

I know a little about the DLI but not in terms of transfer admissions unfortunately so I can‚Äôt help there, but if you can explain the grades then it might be fine. As for the SAT I‚Äôm not sure if you need it but it could help you if your score is good enough. 

If you have any other questions I can try to help.",1587589153,1,0

"Uhh no, it really doesn't. NYU has expenses that aren't going away. If they were to defer fall, at 51,123 students paying about 20k per student, they'd lose about a billion dollars. That's a little under a quarter of their endowment. Even if they decided to burn 1/4 of their endowment, endowments aren't meant to be spent in such a manner. They're investments/holdings that if sold, would result in massive losses. 

While NYU would save money on some teaching staff, they'd need to pay their professors still. Professors do teach, but they're mostly employed for research. While NYU could furlough their faculty, they'd lose a lot of legitimacy if they stopped paying their Nobel Prize/Abel Prize/Turing Award winning faculty.",1587588916,6,0
"depending on the focus of those classes - sure.  If your class is Politics of Russia 1900-1917, then no.  Any business or econ class that isn't historical and isn't focusing to some degree on COVID-19 is doing a disservice to their students.",1587588326,2,0
"I just had office hour with a professor who‚Äôs teaching 2 classes next semester and said he‚Äôd quit if classes were online in the fall. I like the classes I chose for next semester so it would suck if I had to take them online. With that being said, to defer the semester, the entire student body that graduates after May 2020 would have to be ok with delaying their graduation and that‚Äôs not gonna go well with administration.",1587587211,7,0
"I made the switch last year and it's really great because I just need to take my laptop, iPad and chargers to my classes. I get PDFs/eBooks for all my textbooks and just download any documents my profs give out off of NYU classes. Hence, I'm way more organized and my bag is way lighter.

I did a lot of research when buying mine and found that the iPad Air was the best bang for buck; I'm really happy with it and definitely recommend it! I never really get distracted when using it as some people have suggested because tbh I usually just keep the wifi off on it unless I need to download/send something.",1587585845,2,0
"&gt;If you're a professor in that area and COVID-19 even tangentially touches on the subject, as a professor I would feel obligated to shift focus.

Well then, given COVID-19's far-reaching impacts (which I am not denying ofc), I suppose it would be reasonable for every politics, public policy, metropolitan studies, business, economics, East Asian studies, religious studies, global public health, biology, etc. class to let  the virus take the centerstage of the latter half of the semester's meetings /s.",1587585818,-1,0

"While a nice idea I think that a semester which continues into the summer would just be even more of a shit show &amp; cause more hassle. 
People have internships/jobs lined up and who‚Äôs saying they wouldn‚Äôt just defer another year so they could do those internships? It would severely mess with people‚Äôs graduation timeline as a lot of people have jobs lined up right after graduation (I.e. beginning of June) and delaying that for almost 2 months could put that at jeopardy.
Also summer classes are a thing people take.",1587583279,6,0
Yea I can't think of a better way. Hopefully they'll be very clear with professors so that both are equal options and there's not a situation where students get penalized for not coming in physically,1587583266,3,0
