**“**I was in a conference yesterday watching people, and in just about two minutes I counted a dozen times that I saw someone touching mucous membranes,” Dr. McLaws said. “It is a very common practice. We rub our eyes, scratch our nose, touch our mouth — the general community needs to be aware of how often they are touching their face.”

Dr. McLaws was the senior author of a [2015 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637115) on face touching that documented the alarming number of times we do it. While medical students attended a lecture, the researchers filmed them and counted the number of times they touched any part of their faces. Over the course of an hour, students touched their faces, on average, 23 times. Nearly half of the touches were to the eyes, nose or mouth — what infectious disease researchers call “the T-zone.”

Other studies of [primary care doctors](https://www.jabfm.org/content/27/3/339/tab-article-info), people doing [office work](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15459620802003896), and students riding [a simulated rail car](https://search.proquest.com/openview/e2c136dc5c05115cdf9e55cb5133bc46/1?cbl=2040555&amp;amp;pq-origsite=gscholar) have all found similar rates of touching the T-zone.

“I was really surprised,” Dr. McLaws said. “By touching your mucous membranes, you’re giving a virus 11 opportunities every hour if you’ve touched something infectious.”

The risk of picking up a virus by hand-to-face contact depends on a number of factors, including the type of virus, whether the surface was nonporous, how long ago the virus was left behind, how much time the infected person spent in the area and the temperature and humidity levels.

The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses) notes that while we don’t know how long the new coronavirus survives on surfaces, it seems to behave like other coronaviruses — which is unsettling news. A recent study from the [Journal of Hospital Infection](https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/fulltext) found that similar coronaviruses have been shown to survive on surfaces for as long as nine days under ideal conditions. That’s far longer than the flu virus, which typically can survive under ideal conditions only up to [24 hours on hard surfaces](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/infections/how-long-do-bacteria-and-viruses-live-outside-the-body/). [Public Health England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings) says that, based on studies of other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS, “the risk of picking up a live virus from a contaminated surface” under real-life conditions “is likely to be reduced significantly after 72 hours.”

In general, a virus will survive the longest on nonporous surfaces made of metal and plastics — including door knobs, counters and railings. A virus will die sooner on fabrics or tissues. Once on your hand, a virus begins to lose potency, but it will probably live long enough for you to touch your face. Although more study is needed of coronavirus, [in one study of rhinovirus,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1658033) which causes the common cold, a small dose of virus was placed on a participant’s finger. An hour later, about 40 percent of the virus was still viable. After three hours, 16 percent could still be detected.

We also know from the 2003 epidemic of SARS, a more deadly coronavirus than the one currently spreading, that the virus was often transmitted from surface contact. In one Hong Kong hotel, an [infected doctor](https://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_04/en/) who checked into his room on the ninth floor before going to the hospital for treatment left a trail of virus that infected at least seven people who also had rooms on the ninth floor, who then went on to spread the disease elsewhere. The doctor, who died from the infection, was later identified as a “super spreader” [linked to about 4,000 ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/hong-kong-hotel-hosted-super-spreader-in-the-2003-sars-outbreak.html)cases of SARS that occurred during the epidemic.

The good news is that frequent hand washing can make a meaningful difference in lowering your risk. During the SARS epidemic, hand-washing reduced the risk of transmission by 30 to 50 percent. But after washing your hands, you must still be mindful about face touching, Dr. Sawyer said.

“Your hands are only clean until the next surface you touch,” he said. “When you reach for the door knob or hand railing, you’ve recontaminated your hand with something. If you touch your mucous membranes, then you could inoculate yourself inadvertently with that organism. If there is one behavior change that could prevent infection, it’s do not touch your T-zone.”

But it’s not easy to stop face touching. In fact, many people say that the more they think about it, the more their eyes twitch and their nose itches. [A number of memes](https://mashable.com/article/coronavirus-prevention-dont-touch-your-face/) have emerged on social media from people who say that ever since the warnings about coronavirus, they can’t stop touching their own faces.  


Only [humans and a few primates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6427652) (gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzees) are known to touch their faces with little or no awareness of the habit. (Most animals touch their faces only to groom or swat away a pest.) [German researchers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530432) analyzed the brain’s electrical activity before and after spontaneous face touching, and their findings suggested that we touch our faces as a way to relieve stress and manage our emotions.

To break the face-touching habit, try using a tissue if you need to scratch your nose or rub your eyes. Wearing makeup may reduce face touching, since it may make you more mindful of not smudging it. [One study](https://search.proquest.com/openview/e2c136dc5c05115cdf9e55cb5133bc46/1?cbl=2040555&amp;amp;pq-origsite=gscholar) found that women touched their faces far less when they wore makeup. Another solution: Try to identify triggers for face touching, like dry skin or itchy eyes, and use moisturizers or eye drops to treat those conditions so you are less likely to rub or scratch your face.

It also may help to wear glasses to create a barrier to touching your eyes. Gloves or mittens can also make you more mindful of not touching your face (and can make it more difficult to put your finger in your nose or your eye). Although gloves, too, can become contaminated, viruses don’t live as long on fabric or leather.

Given that face touching is a long-ingrained habit, it makes sense to remain vigilant about frequent hand washing and wipe down your desk, phones and community surfaces. Carry hand sanitizer and use it often. The more mindful you are about regular hand washing, the more mindful you will be about your hands and what they are touching. &lt;/article&gt;",1583280525,1,0
"Want to improve your chance of staying healthy? Stop touching your face!

One of the more difficult challenges in public health has been to teach people to wash their hands frequently and to stop touching the facial mucous membranes — the eyes, nose and mouth, all entry portals for the new coronavirus and many other germs.

“Scratching the nose, rubbing your eyes, leaning on your chin and your fingers go next to your mouth — there’s multiple ways we do it,” said Dr. Nancy C. Elder, a professor of family medicine at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland [who has studied face touching](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24808112) among doctors and clinic staff members. “Everybody touches their face, and it’s a difficult habit to break.”

As communities prepare for the spread of coronavirus around the globe, the primary advice from health officials is for people to wash their hands. But a number of health researchers say the public health message also should include a more forceful warning about face touching.

“The C.D.C. and W.H.O. still say something like ‘avoid' touching your eyes, nose and mouth,” said Dr. William P. Sawyer, a family physician in Sharonville, Ohio, and creator of [HenrytheHand.com](https://www.henrythehand.com/), which promotes hand and face hygiene. “The advice should be ‘absolutely do not touch them!’ If you never touch your facial mucous membranes, you’re less likely to be sick again from any viral respiratory infection.”

To understand why hand hygiene and face touching can make a meaningful difference during a pandemic, consider how a virus can spread. An infected person rides in an elevator, touching buttons both outside and inside the elevator or maybe sneezing during the ride. When that person leaves, microscopic droplets containing the virus stay behind. The next people who press the same buttons or touch a surface pick up the virus on their hands, then scratch their noses or rub their eyes.  


“Eyes, nose, mouth — all those mucous membranes are the portal into the body for a virus like Covid-19 or SARS,” said Mary-Louise McLaws, professor of epidemiology, health care infection and infectious diseases control at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.",1583280520,1,0

And don't worry, you will do *plenty* of programming at UNC as well. Based on my heavily anecdotal knowledge, I would guess the UNC program is more rigorous as well, but I wouldn't die on that hill.

Even more important than which school you go to is the importance of working on your skills outside the classroom. You will learn lots of great stuff in class, but real work experience is what's going to help you get you a good job and boost your career trajectory. This is highly important to realize *during college*, because there will never be another time in your life where people will give you a job despite having zero experience and very limited knowledge. Get an undergrad research position (when I was at UNC, these were paid jobs so I assume they still are). Apply for internships, and don't wait until after your junior year. Do personal side projects and/or contribute to open source projects if you have trouble getting paid positions.",1580134244,1,0

I felt like I was very unprepared for web development as someone who took up to 410 IIRC. It definitely felt like UNC was more theory based. I wish I had learned more practical stuff like promises and git and so on. But I do think I had a better core understanding of OOP and MVC which are more abstract CS principals.

"Yes, cybersecurity is definitely a thing here. Here is the [CS Course Catalog](https://catalog.unc.edu/courses/comp/). Look at 435, 535. I took both, learned a lot and would definitely recommend them! Beyond that, almost any class you take higher than the 500 level will teach you about security concepts that apply to that classes curriculum.

Outside of the classroom, the CS department here does quite a lot of research in security - both hardware and software. Here are all of the major [CS research areas](https://cs.unc.edu/research/areas/). The Security description listed there is not up to date but the people working in that area are. You can look at their publications to get a better idea of what they are studying.

Most research areas have undergraduate research assistants (URAs) working in them. I am actually a URA (not in cybersecurity) but I know that to be considered to be a cybersecurity URA you need to at least have taken 535.

I feel the need to add that some of the info on CS research is not publicly available. Some research areas and/or projects in the department are sponsored by the Department of Defense among other entities and are classified. I wouldn't be surprised if there are a few cybersecurity projects in there.

"Federal positions recruit HEAVILY from PWAD.  I'm talking foreign service, intelligence community, agency work, state-level work, etc... as I said before, they really love the prospective of a military academy-like education from a top tier public research university. Allows them to reel in new employees at an earlier point in their career than wait for the required commission to end from military academy graduates.  For some reason or another they really seem to like *this* humanities path compared to some other similarly broad ones like POLI or HIST.  Defense contractors hire PWAD students quite a bit as well for similar reasons, though never in an engineer or software position like many would hope for obvious reasons (hint: it's not an engineering or CS major).

The only other comparable school I know of with regards to federal hiring (disregarding DC schools like Georgetown) is Texas A&amp;M, which has it's own pseudo-military academy vibe to it and somewhat similar availability of classes.

The required language skills helps as well, though that's the same for Global Studies which imo puts GLBL a step ahead of something like POLI which you can skirt by without languages and barely touch on maths depending how you take it.

Like seriously though, PWAD + a critical language + a good summer federal internship and you're set.  If you market GLBL similarly (good region + language, take security/war classes) it should be about the same.  

But dam do they love that PWAD name.",1580097510,1,0
"I’m a sophomore and I’m just finishing up the intro sequence before I start my electives.

I saw in another post that you’re interested in how computers work, which is what the computer organization focuses on. It has some coding, some theoretical stuff. Algorithms and analysis is actually not too centered on coding and more about math/efficiency of different algorithms. The electives might have more or less coding depending on what you choose. I took a web development class, and all the assignments dealt with programming. Some other classes might be for focused on statistics or some other field. It all depends on what you want to do.

"I feel probably the main reason why there is no minor is the amount of double majors PWAD already has.

Most minors require 5 courses, right?  Doing POLI, HIST, PLCY, or maybe even GLBL could cover 4 out of the 9 classes required, leaving only 5 left for that double major.

Now I'm not saying it would be a bad idea, in fact I think it'd be a great idea, but that's my explanation as to possibly why.  I think a minor composed of a set of general classes (one overarching class like 250, a good history class, a good intel class, a good policy class, and maybe a good poli sci regional class) would be nice, but some of the current PWAD classes are already hard enough to get into, ESPECIALLY the required ones like 250/272.

Now, what I would think would be outstanding is if an Intelligence Studies minor was created within PWAD, but I doubt that would happen as the leave of professors like Dr. Castro has created a sort of gap in the intelligence aspect of PWAD resulting in MAX 1-2 classes a year on the subject, although there are some 10+ courses in the syllabus applicable.  

Additionally, UNC is no longer an active IC-CAE school but an IC-CAE associated school or something like that, so that might have a little to do with that as well.  I forget if that was made on UNC's end, IC-CAE's end, or because the IC-CAE program is coming to an end altogether.  Nevertheless, that's another slight-yet-not-super-impactful hit on the intel side of things at UNC.

***____________________________________________________________***

Nice to see some PWAD love on this sub though, not typically the kind of major I see discussed here (COMP/BIOL/CHEM).  ***Big recommendation for incoming students to look into it.***  The career fields exposed to PWAD students are the types that were completely overlooked in my earlier education, yet exactly what I wanted.  There's a TON of internship and post-graduation opportunities that get pitched to us within the major, and many of those employers (you can assume the types) specifically love the concept of a security/war/intelligence studies program that's *not* at one of the military academies, which iirc UNC is one of few schools (if not the only) in the country with that.  Guest lectures are a plenty, hiring/""meet an _____"" events are at the least semesterly if not quarterly, and there are also numerous weekend/week long trips that you can apply for.  If anyone wants some more info on it feel free to ask, or if the mods ever decide to do any sort of major exploration megathreads or group threads I'd be happy to do a decent PWAD writeup.",1580089961,0,0

"I mean, we are all going to be biased on the school we go to. Putting bias aside, both schools are quite good in computer science. NCSU has a great engineering school, so if you’re thinking about wanting to pursue comp sci engineering, I would go there. Rather, if you would like to go to the comp sci route, I would recommend looking at both schools closely. 

From my understanding by talking to NCSU students and recruiters, NCSU’s comp sci department is much more focused on programming. UNC is more abstract and teaches you about why things are, and invite you to explore beyond that. I really don’t think you can go wrong with either school, but (bias shows here) if you want to go to graduate school, I highly recommend UNC. UNC’s diploma Just carries more weight and prestige than an NCSU one does, plain and simple. Also, UNC’s CS curriculum better sets you up for graduate work by speaking about higher level conceptual theories.

it fascinates me but at the same time scares me cause I could realistically see almost every guy I knew going into UNC (including myself) just never finishing school.  we come from a fairly undereducated region of NC and I know it would do us and our families a huge benefit of finishing, but for some reason we all have this deep-seated feeling of regret, remorse, or loathe.

one aspect of UNC which I know has caused a few of my problems is that it feels huge without any real ""substance.""  like, if you *aren't* into Greek life, partying, or going to games/tailgating, it feels like there's next to nothing to do on/around campus.  even simple stuff like going to a bowling alley requires a drive, yet I know maybe one person out of all the friends I've made at UNC and from before UNC who has a parking pass.  outdoorsy stuff requires a drive too, stuff like hiking, paintball, lakes, etc.  this leads to isolation as there's nothing to go out and do if you aren't into drinking and partying.  even the frattier ones of us aren't the type to spend every weekend at a formal or spend their entire friday and saturday nights blacked out.",1584300905,1,0

"I’m an uprising senior and I plan on getting a B.S in any major (biochemistry, biomedicine, biology, or neuroscience) on the pre-med track.

My gpa isn’t really pretty (talking about lower than a 3.0) but it’s bc I was taking dual enrollment classes during my freshman year at an early college, although I passed every class (exam wise) they failed me due to absences which is ridiculous, bc now it no longer matters at my school.

"For grad school, it's fair game for anyone. The M.A. in digital comms is designed to be done online as a part-time program and is designed for people who are already working. 

It's also uncommon, although not impossible either, for people to get into the master's programs within the Hussman school immediately after graduating. If you are trying to get in immediately after graduation, they want to see a lot of working experience, despite what the minimum requirements say for the residential programs. You're required to have 3 years of working experience to even get in the digital comms program. Furthermore, you have to *really* know why you want to pursue the master's without providing generic answers. 

If you're set on going to UNC for grad school right after graduation, I would highly suggest you look at the residential programs instead. The strategic comms program is a combination of PR, advertising and some general marketing, and the business school at UNC offers an M.B.A. in marketing.

If you were to ask for my personal opinion, and also the Hussman career advisor at UNC, you should consider working first before pursuing an M.A. For our field, working is much more relevant and valuable than pursuing an M.A. right after college. PR is all about application. The M.A. is typically reserved for a bit later in your career rather than early on. Your GRE score is valid for 5 years. 

I hope this doesn't come across as being harsh. I was pretty dead set on pursuing an M.A. after college my junior year, but ended up deciding against it since many people within the Hussman school advised against it due to the nature of the application process and the  practicality of it. 

[Here's the FAQ](http://hussman.unc.edu/ma/faq) for the M.A. programs and you can join in for the [online info session for the M.A. programs on April 1st.](http://hussman.unc.edu/madc-is-200401)",1582207705,1,0
"It can vary from program to program, but most grad programs don't favor their own undergraduate students. In fact, it *can* be the opposite because they are looking for a diversity of viewpoints to come into the program.

Standing out on a grad application is basically the same as standing out on any application. You need experience related to the field (internships, summer programs, project work, etc.), references, and good stats (GPA, GRE scores if your program requires them, etc.). It is good to know that you are on that path now so that you can build up good programs and projects and jobs to work on.

It helps, they will excuse some absences to an extent with accommodations if that’s something you would be interested in. I’m not sure if it’s applicable since the semester already started, but I got accommodations near the end of last semester and started using them this semester.

"If your financial aid offers work study, definitely do it. There are some work study positions on campus that pay super well. I was able to do one relevant to my major as well, and there are numerous positions like this. Even if you're not given work study, check out positions at the university since they're relatively easy to get, pay well, can be relevant to your interests and also are flexible with your classes. 

I did the APPLES internship as well since it gave a stipend of I believe $1200 for the semester. It pays you, gives you class credit and also gives you experience for what you're interested in too. It was an awesome opportunity to get involved with the Chapel Hill community as well. 

What hard skills do you have? You could advertise your skills to other students. For example, I dabble in some photography and had numerous friends/acquaintances ask me to take their graduation photos. I typically do this for free, but they paid me for it with whatever rate they thought was fair. I'm also good with Photoshop and Illustrator and had a frat pay me to do some of their graphic work. Join your class's official FB page and advertise some of your services on there. If you end up doing really well in a difficult class, you could also offer tutoring services. My friend was a math major and did a lot of tutoring, which also looks good on a resume. 

I would advise you be strategic with how you decide to spend your time making extra money. Try to work smart, not hard, and find opportunities related to your interests or major. 
 
Consider ways you could save money as well. For example, your meal plan. As a first year, I originally got the 120 meal plan but downgraded to 100 since I never even used up all the swipes. Also, living on campus is more expensive than you think. I did the math my first year and found out that I would be saving more money living off campus than on campus, and that includes utilities. I ended up living off campus my sophomore year. I'm not sure how much it costs now, but I know that on campus housing wasn't advantageous for me at the time. Also, while I'm on the topic of housing, imo, places like Lark, Shortbread, Warehouse, etc. are low key scams with how much they charge you for rent. Since this will be relevant to you later on, definitely look for alternative locations than apartments directly marketed toward students.

I'm not saying one is harder or easier than the other, what I'm trying to say is that they handle differently.  collegiate level labs and papers can feel drastically different than their high school counterparts.  you might come in trying to juggle 2-3 labs at once cause you did great at them in highschool only to end up struggling with labs at UNC due to the sheer amount of time they take once you account for pre/post lab (like seriously, for a 1 credit hour course labs take up SO much time).  adjust your scheduling accordingly.

use this time to explore programs to see what truly sticks with you.  you might be surprised to find out that one elective you take first or second semester that doesn't fall under your intended major becomes the best class you ever took and you drop your first major altogether.

take advantage of the numerous hiring events, talks with current employees, and general extracurricular events held on campus.  I know the departments I commonly associate with (primarily PWAD, but extends to POLI/HIST/PLCY) have talks with extremely important figures and employees of desirable positions (intelligence, foreign service, NGOs, special operations, etc) multiple times a semester.  no clue what resources like this are open to STEM majors, but I've been very pleased with what resources are open to PWAD/similar.

take fun classes while you're here.  take that skiing class cause you always wanted to learn how.  take that 101 language class just because you liked a certain show that was originally in that language.  take a photography class just cause you want to end up taking better pictures of your friends (be warned the workload of some photography 101 classes is HIGH).  most majors tend to only need 1-2 classes in major per semester, that leaves you with multiple credit hours that can be filled with these ""for the fun of it"" classes.

start looking into internships during your freshman year, you'd be surprised how many are out there and the variety of them.  a good internship in your field could be the difference between getting the job you want straight out of college or having to work towards it for years.

go study abroad, there's a high chance it will cost the same if not cheaper than a normal semester.  you'll love every minute of it and wish you could spend the rest of your time at UNC abroad (in fact, you might actually end up doing that).

consider doing some supplemental activities like ROTC, Greek life, student organizations, or simply starting a project with some friends.  one that I know has popped off big time locally is @OfficeHours.TV, a dance event production series created by some people from the UNC radio station and a few others.",1581985438,1,0

I also have a kind of nerdy personality and found that I clicked a lot better with kids in honors classes vs regular ones. There are also some fun events you can sign up for that usually have free, good food at the very least. And even if none of that appeals to you, they usually dispense higher grades a lot more freely in honors classes.

You can knock out plenty of gen eds that you would have to take anyway with honors classes, so my advice would be to find one that fills a requirement and see how you like it. If you decide you don't like it, just quit taking them and you'll get dropped.",1585447492,1,0

"class size is simply class dependent, classes which are *specifically required* by the major or are taken by a TON of students due to the class/professor being very popular can have somewhere between 150-400 students.  other classes, such as first-year seminars and language courses, can be as small as 13 students or so.  it really just depends and any number of variables can change it.

this also plays into professors.  one example I have is Dr. Joe Caddell, he's a hilarious professor with some of the best stories you'll ever hear, but max you get to talk with him in office hours is 10 minutes in a group session cause he'll have another 30 students waiting in the hall to speak with him.  his classes, if you couldn't guess, often have 200+ students in them.",1585353761,2,0

Its not incredibly difficult to get into the B-school, just keep a relatively high GPA through the prereqs.

In the minor, you have to take an intro to info sci class, a class where you learn about MS Office, a database management/SQL class, a project management class and any electives. The department courses focus on how information is stored and managed. This ranges from library systems to projects in companies. I think it really goes well with the CS major because classes aren’t as technically intensive and it really focuses on how users can interact with information and technology. I took a class where we discussed the ways apps and websites are specifically designed to be user friendly. Some CS and IS electives are cross listed (COMP 487/INLS 512, COMP 486/INLS 509) so you can count it for both majors.

Dining Halls - even takeout, considering it'd probably be restricted in hours, would mean large lines of people.  what are they gonna do, force people to stand 6 feet behind each other?  that line would probably end up wrapping around Davis lmao, blocking foot traffic from all around.

Dorms - dorms I could *potentially* see working if the public spaces (ie: study rooms) are blocked off, but there's no point to being on campus if classes end up online so...

Clubs - ehh I could see clubs working, coordinating a small group of people with shared interests/communication networks to meet in a way that is safe is a WHOLE lot easier than saying ""hey class of 300 try not to sit close to each other ;))))""

Libraries/Study Spaces - expecting fully closed off, or like restrictions on shared tables and stuff like that.

My biggest concern though is foot traffic.  For as big as UNC's campus is, it's walkways aren't the largest and are easily congested.  *That* is where sickness will spread and there's no way of getting around it except just not having people there to walk the paths in the first place.",1589770806,4,0
"I was in a few stores today and was surprised to see the decline in folks wearing masks. A couple weeks ago, *everyone* wore masks. When I went in the Target on Franklin Street today, I’d say maybe 20% of shoppers had masks on.",1589770089,3,0
I agree but I don’t think the UNC system is in that boat. Most universities that are truly at risk of going under are small private colleges,1589770063,4,0
"I’ve been thinking about that, too. If they don’t offer on campus classes, I can’t imagine many students being willing to pay the same cost for distance learning. I think most people would take a gap semester. And yeah, that doesn’t leave the university in a particularly good position economically.

But at the same time...our country hasn’t really started to “make things work” for the sake of the economy, so I can’t imagine universities being the first to make that decision.",1589770013,1,0

"Wow lmao are you me? I took comp110 as a first year (rising junior rn) and LOVED it and HIGHKEY thought of switching into a comp major. I’m also a bio major rn and I’ve done a lot of health-science related things. I was so, sooooo close to declaring comp sci (like literally sitting in Steele building waiting to double). I realized I just wasn’t that ~ talented ~ so I couldn’t really do it. 

BUT if you’re legit interested, I recommend looking into making one of your majors a BA. Bio and Comp BS degrees have HELLA credit hours and some crazy tough classes (physics 117/118, linear algebra and pre req math classes leading up to that, plus an entire chem minor for bio BS). With a BA or a BS in comp you’re pretty set, computer science majors actually have the highest earnings right out of college, plus there’s lots of hackathons at UNC (HackNC, PearlHacks, tech careers fair) where you can go and find career / internship / job opportunities as a comp sci major. The CS department has a rough teacher to student ratio, so that might be something to consider :) 

Best of luck!",1589769531,1,0

"I met a number of gay people in frats that I rushed at last year. They seemed to pretty much just be ""one of the bros"" in their frats, with some having leadership positions too. Of course, I can't speak for all of them, and some frats had zero while others had 2 or 3 or more. If you're rushing, asking about that is harmless. 

Also, UNC gets a rap for being uber-liberal sometimes. While it's irked me at times (I've felt uncomfortable to voice views at times that were more mainstream), I'm proud of how accepting it is of everyone. We have whole academic clubs of people who are nonbinary, trans, gay, bisexual, lesbian, etc.  As other comments have said, it's often standard to say your pronouns in professional occasions (even if you're a straight white, cisgendered male :) ), so people really do try to be accommodating I'd say. Though, this is from a straight guy, so I can't really speak for it the best I'm afraid. 

Ultimately, you should be able to find people at UNC that are accepting of you and share similar interests. Whether it's frats, academic clubs, or even just random people in the dorm or at classes.

They were sooooo *woke* (/s) that they would give you a warning for saying things like “hey guys!” or “yeah dude!” or “do you girls have any hair stylist recommendations?” because they had determined that “babes” and “y’all” and “folx” were the only gender-inclusive terms allowed to be uttered within the group.

I'm a gay trans man and I've really only been met with acceptance for the most part, even from communities that I assumed would give me shit (i'm really into e-sports for example which for some communities has its issues, from my experience). I've gotten the occasional look when i wear explicitly gay/trans pride things, but I have met SO many other queer people, and the resources on campus are great for me.  


I'm always surprised to see a lot of the professionals at UNC include their pronouns in their introduction/signature, and (as someone who takes a lot of humanities courses) have had both classmates and professors talk about pronouns in an accepting way.  


I've not really heard of any hate from my peers, either, at least nothing huge - I've been met with some annoying jokes and intolerant remarks, as I said, but nothing that I would classify as a horrible experience (I've dealt with WAY worse, is basically what I mean).  


I don't have any Greek life experience because that's not my thing, but I know LGBTQ+ people who participate and they have not expressed anything big to me about hate there.

how harshly depends on the school, but plenty of people are worried that if they p/f they may not get into the school they want, especially if it's a major requirement. and let's face it. there's a plague on, almost no one has the grade they wanted in alll of their classes and making it mandatory would remove a lot of stress from students looking to apply for some type of grad school later on

"1. In Ehaus they are in the basement. Honestly they kinda suck. The washer is too small, and at least a third of them are broken at any given moment, so there's often a line. I guess the best time to use it is during the day when most people are in classes or real late at night. Once a red moon the washer will make your clothes soaking wet and then they have to be dried for like a few hours. Usually you need two sessions of drying, which is also kinda annoying, since one 30 min session is enough to mostly dry it but it's somewhat damp, whereas an hour is overkill. I've heard Ehaus is due for major renovations soon so maybe it'll be improved idk... I liked Ehaus otherwise though!
2. I like the dining hall tbh but I'm in the minority there. With restaurants I'm not a stickler so idk. There's a Dominos I ordered from a few times. I like Benny's... for $2 you get a giant piece of pizza that's like a meal and a half. I couldn't finish it a couple times. But again [I'm in the minority here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/eublu2/why_do_people_dislike_bennys/).
3. It's like 20 min. I don't think frats/sororities care if you live on south campus.
4. I'm too lazy to get involved with anything tbh.
5. Make a list of the classes you want to sign up. Make a list of backups. Do this in coordination with ConnectCarolina and having those classes in your shopping cart. Put like every section if there's multiple sections (unless it's Spanish or something and there's a hundred). Note you can only be on one waitlist at a time, and to do so, you have to press the Waitlist button on the class page. They'll (hopefully) teach you this stuff at orientation though so I won't get into too much detail. I will say after your first registration session, you may be deeply disappointed that you got like two of the classes you want. Don't worry though, since a lot of classes that appear closed may end up being open later, and a lot of classes will be dropped by students. In some cases (especially the CS department) you can just go to the first day of class and the professor will try to help you get in.
6. Might be different for the ladies but I did fine. Couldn't always shower right when I wanted to but I was always able to shower.

"1. room in the bottom level with multiple washers/dryers, though it's like 2x more dryers than washers if I remember correctly so you might have to wait around for a while, curious as to why the high rises are your top 3 choices

2. uhh, Lenoir and Rams are fine but anything else is just preference.  my favorite restaurant (Midici) closed down, Time Out is great for the price (bbq, bbq chicken, biscuits, pancakes, mac and cheese, etc), Lucha Tigre has bomb tacos and skirt steak, Cosmic Cantina is overrated as hell, Top of the Hill is the classic date/parents come to campus spot (their pulled pork is surprisingly good), Sup Dogs is overrated, Blue Spoon Micro-creamery is amazing (dark chocolate + almonds + olive oil + salt 🤤🤤🤤), Heavenly Buffaloes is fantastic (13 bone in lemon pepper burnie zass-hoff mix with full order of lemon pepper waffle fries 🤤🤤🤤🤤), IP3 is decent but overrated (good size for deliveries tho), Lime &amp; Basil is really good, Spicy 9 is decent, etc

3. depends on how fast you are, it can be 20 minutes or it can be 45 so I wouldn't try making it a daily thing imo, just take the bus

4. Carolina Adventures and the radio are the two I'd recommend, FashionMash is pretty cool but you have to be in the class to actually do anything with it, but it all just depends on what you like or have the time willing to commit to

5. predetermine your ideal schedule, use a wired internet connection and start enrolling in the shopping cart 15 minutes before your time (basically just click enroll, let the page refresh as it denies you, scroll down and click again over and over and over), have multiple course backups ready in your cart with written out hotswaps so you know what to swap a class out for when it becomes full, don't try 18 credit hours your first semester

6. yes it's awful, anticipate a tug-of-war where everyone starts waking up 10 minutes earlier and earlier and earlier so they get their spot in the shower, it's especially bad as many first-year oriented classes (ie: CHEM 101) are all at like 8AM, so you can potentially have half or more of your suite fighting at 7AM to get in the shower.  it also sucks having to run down multiple flights of stairs to access the lobby bathroom if yours is occupied and you gotta go.  that's why I don't recommend the highrise towers but instead Olde Campus Lower Quad for freshman, hall style is 100% better with regards to the bathroom situation.  also don't get your hopes up too much, chances are we won't be on campus this fall

7. tough but probably doable, but on your first semester take max 1-2 STEM courses and 1 Spanish course just to see what you think about it, thousands try pre-med a year and thousands quit pre-med a year cause it's HARD here, fill up the rest of your credit hours with any First Year Seminars or otherwise regular courses you think sound cool

8. no, you can change any time, orientation isn't major specific nor does the ""registration help"" at orientation help out at all.  the only majors you cannot immediately swap into are [outlined here](https://admissions.unc.edu/explore/enrich-your-education/excelcarolina/) under ""Assured Admission""",1587596573,2,0

"1. Course registration can be really hard, but it varies a lot - your first choices won't be the same as everyone else's. If you really want to take a class that's full, get on the waitlist at registration and stay there til classes start, and start attending the class and talk to the professor. Lots of people will drop classes and switch around in the first few weeks, and professors can sometimes make exceptions and add you if you talk to them. You don't want to get added late and have missed two weeks of material.
2. If you're sure about your majors/minor, hold out for gen eds that overlap with your major requirements. If you aren't sure, take a couple early to see what you're interested in and consider adding a second major or minor based on that. 
3. It doesn't really matter when you take your LFIT. I think most people take it early, I guess it's better to not leave it til your final semester in case something crazy happens since it is a grad requirement. There are multiple sections to make sure everyone who needs the credit can take the course, it doesn't matter what section you're in unless you coordinate with your friends. Take one that sounds fun, and don't skip it - you're graded on attendance and it's an easy A. 
4. I don't know much about the computer science major. I would definitely suggest combining it with a second major and/or minor to help you stand out from other graduates with just a comp sci degree. 
5. Besides the normal places, check out the Hanes Art Center and the library there, Graham Memorial, and the arboretum when the weather's nice.
6. Sign up for enough hours so you'll be able to drop something and have at least 12 hours. Sometimes classes are harder than you think, or you run into an unexpected life crisis, and you'll need to drop something. 12 hours is the minimum you need to stay enrolled. Dropping below 12 hours, partially withdrawing and re-enrolling, or doing worse than you're capable of in a course are all scenarios you really want to avoid. Depends on how much you need to stay on track to graduate, but generally, 12-15 a semester is normal, 18 is pretty hectic, and anything more you need to get permission for because it's going to be very difficult.
7. This split of days on and off very much depends on you and your ability to manage your free time and workload independently. One of the biggest challenges transitioning from high school to college is that you're leaving what's typically a very structured environment with external pressure for one that's almost entirely self-directed. Nobody will make you get out of bed, do your homework, or go to class - you'll just fail if you don't. That's true of any schedule, but especially true for having all your classes on two days, and five days of the week completely unstructured. I would not recommend doing this your first semester if you're at all unsure about whether or not you can handle it - go for more balance, and try it a later semester if it still sounds nice.
8.  It's pretty doable to work out your courses to graduate early, but I would say it's probably not worth it. If you're accumulating more debt than you can afford, needing to work a lot to afford tuition, or maybe if you're going straight into a graduate program, it would be worth considering.  Definitely don't do it just because you can. Instead, if you find yourself with extra hours available, pick up a double major or minor, study abroad, take some classes just for fun, take a senior underload and have a really chill semester. Instead of rushing through it, doing any of those things will help you get the most out of your time in college and will set you up much better for what comes next.",1587586301,1,0

You can rope off the Pit... but then you just direct traffic onto the footpaths surrounding it, which aren't wide enough to maintain 6 feet of distance. It's great if we do the ""big classes are now just Zoom classes"" but it doesn't matter if you get infected when you're walking to your next class. Lenoir's the same way. Nearly every sophomore/freshman has a meal plan. Why would anyone pay for 3 swipes a day when they can only eat in the cafeteria 3 times a week? Alright, so they transition to take-out containers. Still have to wait in line. Still have to hand your card to a cashier. Still have to take your food from a worker. You'll go eat outside (or in a classroom) with your friends.

Either way 3 stem classes is a big commitment and if you have time to spread those out then that’s probably what an advisor and anyone on here will tell you to do. 

Keep in mind Fall 2020 might be online and if you have problems slacking online it might be best to drop one of those if that announcement is made. Of course if you’re ok with a pass/fail for one of those classes, online might be the time to do it. 

If we’re back on campus and you want to stick with that schedule then try to gauge the work commitment within the drop/add period. If you have any doubts drop one before it ends (assuming, once again, you have the time to spread out those classes). 

A lot of scenarios, I know, but 3 stem classes is a daunting task, even for those with good stem backgrounds. I don’t mean to scare you and if you go through that schedule in blazing colors then props to you. Just basing this off of what I would probably do.

"Hey! Sorry it took so long to reply, I didn't see the notification for you message until just now.

First off, don't worry if you're unsure of what you want to do; college is a place for exploration. You're not expected to go in knowing exactly what you want to do.  Most of my friends have changed from their intended major, anyway, so don't think you're going to be locked into anything.

If you're more STEM oriented, looking for a bit more of a challenge, and pretty self-sufficient, GT is a solid choice. If you are a little more exploratory, looking for a good education as well as a healthy balance between school and social life, and wanting a community of people to guide you, UNC may be the choice. 

The truth of the matter is that you got into both schools, and you'll be fine at either. If you can get the perspective of a GT business student and a UNC business student, that would probably be a little bit more accurate for your case, but here's my understanding.


I'm not too well-versed on the Business School aspects; obviously both are very good, but I'm unfamiliar with them as a CS major. I know my friends who went into the business school here at UNC enjoy it, but not getting in is a very real possibility, and I can't weigh the risks for you. Same goes for GT, I would contact advisors and other students for advice on your choices.

Regarding international students, you're right; UNC doesn't have a particularly large international population. However, my experience at UNC is that if you look for friends, you'll find friends. And the people I met here are probably some of the friendliest I've met. They're just generally very welcoming and have a strong sense of community. 

That said, that may hold wherever you go. I think GT doesn't have quite so many social events and it may take a little bit more effort, but I believe there may be more international students there, so that may be a bit of an advantage if you want to find people with a shared experience.

May I ask where you're coming from? My friends from China and Korea have both been able to find groups of people from their respective home-countries when they felt a bit homesick. 

No matter where you end up, though, don't just stick with one group the entire time! Make new friends, reach out to people, and find shared interests.

Feel free to DM me if you want to talk more about this, but be warned that I'm not super knowledgable about the subject - also, it's the start of finals, so I may have a delayed response. But I would also recommend making a new post about the international experience as well as the business school vs. Applied math so you can get more experienced responses. And post in Georgia Tech's subreddit too!",1587541041,1,0
"Can't speak for Econ, but if you're Honors, you get priority for Honors courses (they're good for gen eds).

I've had a bit of an... unusual... run when it comes to class sizes. Of the eleven classes I've taken so far, I'd say that seven were under thirty people. That is not the norm, but depending on the gen eds, major, and specific course, the class size will vary. Some of my friends, meanwhile, have had almost exclusively huge lectures. It all depends on what you take.

As a side note, afaik all Honors courses have sizes of &lt;24, and, as I said before, you get priority for the honors courses. I've had three so far and they're not hard to get into.  Got all my first choices, so if you get on the waitlist you should be okay. It may take a few weeks, but people usually swap around enough to let you kn.

Lastly, even in big lectures, you can get to know professors. I've had professors teaching 200 students just start chatting with me when I ran into him about his family, and another who I'd talk to about his course and book recommendations since I was interested in the ones he suggested in class. It really just depends on who's teaching. But if you go to office hours, or talk to them when you have questions after class, that's a good way to get to know them.

"Well! There is a clear progression from the intro classes through the major, which is nice. I haven't ever had to go to advising to understand my course requirements, although I think you could say that about most majors assuming you are willing to take a little time and, uh, read the requirements. The STOR department is expanding extremely fast right now as more people are becoming interested in data science - they're just added several new courses (probability for datasci and intro to stats for datasci) which I can't really speak on as I took the old versions. If you major in stats and you haven't already taken discrete math, take either STOR 215 or MATH 381 ASAP. Understanding proofs will be very helpful, as this is kind of like a math degree with a strong focus on applications. Take 320 or 520 with Giacomazzo, he's hilarious and grades leniently. Avoid taking at least 415, but I'd say probably any course with Shu Lu if possible; she's just not good at teaching (and I say that looking at an A or a B in her course this semester, so I'm not just salty). The way Carlstein teaches 155 is stressful but I hear he's incredible in 555. Taking a COMP course or two early will be helpful if you don't already know how to code (I say as someone who hasn't even taken COMP 116 yet).

"There's good and bad and whether or not it's right for you depends on your needs and approaches.

For reference, I'm a CS student, and have responded to many of these threads with reasons why the CS department is struggling. However, I have never at any point regretted going with CS at Carolina.

The classes are crowded, sometimes to the point that the class ceases to function. Unless you go out of your way, you will be anonymous, there are too many people for the professor to take the initiative to give people direct attention. Your assignments will, 90% of the time, consist of you writing a program that makes a computer happy somewhere, you will likely be carrying bad coding habits and practices that no one will ever see or comment on. The curriculum is heavily weighted toward the theoretical aspects of CS (algorithm analysis, for example), with you doing *far* less coding and actual practical problem solving than you would probably like. 

Now, taking all the complaints I just listed, there are mitigations and/or personality types that will overcome any of these. Be self-motivated, take early initiative on assignments, get in touch with TAs and LAs, pay attention to good coding practices and force yourself to adhere to them instead of being content with just what pleases the auto-grader, join clubs or launch your own projects to get more actual no-shit coding under your belt, learn to appreciate the difference between Computer Science and programming and why it is valuable to understand the theoretical aspects.

And at the end, you get a degree from a highly ranked university through their highly ranked CS department. And you'll probably end up pretty good at using Google-fu to solve your practical coding problems, which is really the skill you need to have to be effective.",1587497535,1,0

"I took 471, 555, and 475 (was 390) before graduating and am currently working as an actuarial analyst (SOA side, annuities). 

471: It covers some FM content that may be helpful, but focuses mainly on LTAM. If you haven’t had a class with Dunn yet, expect his lectures to mostly consist of examples off the chalkboard. Expect ~5 free response HW problems every class. I took the class about ~2 years ago and am currently studying for LTAM. Although I had to relearn the material, it’s usually easier to relearn something than to learn it the first time. 

555: good class if you want to learn the “why” behind certain things, like why confidence intervals are usually calculated as PointEstimate +/- Z*StdError. Hard, but interesting class. Expect homework due every class. 

390/475: Rick Kelly leads the employee benefits division of Marsh and McLennan, a health consulting company whose main office is in Raleigh. Good if you’re interested in health and/or consulting, but not super useful otherwise. Your grade is mostly determined by 3 group presentations (no tests) and homework (mostly completion/effort).

I didn't live on campus at NCSU, but my brother and sister did, and from us talking about our lives, those experiences were largely similar. Transfer could impact that because you would be a little starting from scratch with social networks as a sophomore, but I had lots of friends who were transfers, so it's not isolating if you're willing to put in effort to meet people and join extra curricular groups.

"Different professors are asking for different things.   Larger classes won’t want camera or mics on now should mics be on at all unless you’re actually having a conversation. Leaving cameras on can also bork your connection speed so don’t leave it on unless you have to.  

All my profs have been understanding about some people being in different time zones and can’t make the class or not having a laptop with a camera, or other limitations (and the school has more or less told them to cut the students some slack, considering). No idea if they’ll extend the same courtesy into a semester where we (sorta) know what we’re getting into.  

I’m curious as to if Summer classes will be on Zoom or only on Sakai (forum, etc).  Zoom is being used as a last minute conversion to a virtual classroom mid-semester solution but they might not use it if there’s notice.

I didn't do badly my first semester, but it would have been really nice to have that option to tone down the overwhelming nature of trying to make new friends, find your way around campus, and adjust to the new teaching style. Maybe take a few of your larger classes where interaction with professors is minimal anyway. My wife does research at UNC and I know they are definitely not hiring since everything is up in the air right now.

You need to be careful though because the electives aren’t on the normal core curve, which is why the grades can be higher on average but it also means the teachers can give out as many bad grades as they want to.
