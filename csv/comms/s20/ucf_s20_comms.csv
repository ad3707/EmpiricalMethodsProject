"You have been made into an issue because its beneficial for government to continue dividing people.

To the left, they're nothing but Nazis, bigots, racists, homophobes, transphobes, etc etc. There is literally zero room for discussion at this point.

And nobody questions the power of government. I don't recall a single Democrat saying ""we need to reduce the power of government and the presidency"" it's more of a message that they want the power. My guess is that when the next Democrat is in power, the Republicans message will be the same.

"Drugs.Just kidding, I would say find a project within your field of interest that brings you motivation. Its going to be hard to be motivated about a class or teacher that isn't engaging but if you can work on a project that is close to the subject of the class you are having trouble with, it may bring you more interest in it. But even if the project isn't related to the course, having something that gives you focus, a means for your own accomplishment, and a project that builds your skills is going to benefit you regardless. And that focus can help take away the negativity from grinding out a course. You can learn just about anything online these days so outside of material cost the bar to start a project is very low. Plus if its programming/computer software related, outside of any software fees those projects are generally free. So do you have an idea on the sort of work you enjoy? Do you like working with computer hardware, building pcs, pushing physical performance, and building computer networks or are do you enjoy the software side more? Building applications/websites, setting up computer systems, etc. You can get a Raspberry Pi for around $35 and the possibilities with it are pretty much endless from both a hardware and software standpoint. Any project you take on is something you will keep forever and will be able to show off in the future. Employers like seeing those sorts of things more than anything as well. The better employers want someone who can think for themselves and create a solution over someone who is good at regurgitating book text. Unfortunately most schools focus on the latter which is why we have this problem to begin with.

Social activities are important as well, having a set of friends to wind down with is important but can definitely be hard, especially if you are from a different area. I live in Sanford (\~20 min north of UCF) so I had the benefit of having a group of friends around that I grew up with but that isn't the case for most people. The tailgates are a lot of fun and I still try to come out to those every once in a while but I remember there being constant activities going on from lan parties, to movie nights and other shenanigans. Clubs are another possible avenue as well, I think they have a club there for just about everything.

Its going to be hard to be interested in something that's not interesting but working on a passion you have in your life that is interesting and engaging, can help mitigate the negative aspects of school so you can get through the coursework, graduate, and hopefully get to where you want to go.",1583343242,1,0

"I think a national emergency, pandemic is an exception imo, especially considering the partnership and involvement of the school. UCF has these affiliated housing complex's for students to live in to go to school right? Okay, but UCF also tells such students they should not come and to campus during this time, for the rest of the summer, +summer. Some students have leases during all the way to summer, with that being said. Such students most likely, have a home elsewhere ( which I think the ones who are having the issue are about) and want to be at home with their families during this time, what if they need to take care of people? Help their parents/grandparents, etc? They are being forced to stay there or waste the money on something they are not even using. People with leases elsewhere, not students, etc, that have leases SPECIFICALLY to attend a school, are not the ones having issues or begging for exemptions. These kids just wanna get home man'. The point is that UCF has these affiliated housings, told students to gtfo, refunded the UCF dorm students allowing them to have peace of mind, (tho..also kicking them out), but the students stuck in their leases dont have that option. They either leave and still pay or stay and pay. I'm not in any type of housing and live at home, but i really feel for these students and feel it's not okay at all that they are stuck in this situation. Im sure some dont care and just wanna stay there, but since this is a big deal, and lots of people are wanting out, it would be *nice* to give them an option to go home since they are just there to attend UCF which is now online. 

Leases are commitments, yeah,  but schools and what they affiliate with them should be committed to their students and their well being. National emergencies are a time to unite and come together and for fucks sake have some compassion for one another going through shit, not be greedy money mongers.",1585486461,1,0

I’m definitely going into it ready to work hard and learn as much as I possibly can; this is a tremendous opportunity that I’m being given and I will not let my ego get in the way of my growth.

"1. I took regular biochem with Dr. Gerasimova and I would recommend her if you aren't dead set on medical biochem or if it doesn't fit in your schedule. It's obv work but she gives exam reviews, HW that reflects the exam and is very involved with her students so there isn't a reason to fail. She's the kindest professor I've had.
2. I'm taking molec 1 with Dr. Sui right now and it's her first semester teaching the course. She's basically using all of borgon's material, but altering where she sees fit. I would suggest her over borgon because of that. She's making the course more relevant to students and removing material he teaches that she finds unnecessary. She literally cut down a 100 question HW to 50 questions. Borgon is just an extra man. I would suggest taking the course after taking biochem because it's pretty heavy in that aspect. There is a genetics portion for the first exam but tbh taking genetics beforehand won't really help you. The course goes more in-depth into genetics than the actual genetics course.
3. I took Borgon for QBM and unlike the other comment on your post, I don't agree that it's THAT easy. It was the first and only class I had to rely on coffee to keep me going. It's very time consuming and ridiculous how much time he wants you to put in for your grade (the lab is a huge pain) especially if you have to take other major courses that are also time-consuming or require practice problems. I'd say if you like info about research techniques, bench work, and all that jazz it's great but if you really don't like biological research the class is hell.
4. I took physio over the summer 2 years ago so it was blurr. I just remember it was doable even though it hurt to do it in 6 weeks. Pay attention to what Dr. Ahangari says in lecture and be ready to type fast.",1584413820,1,0
"Intermediate 2- Johnson and Wallace are both fantastic professors and it’s just choosing between the two best you can’t go wrong. I had Johnson and he was a homie very caring and wanted to see his students succeed

Cost- anyone but goldwater he is a nightmare but you may have no choice but to take him. I also heard he lightened up this semester so it might not be /too/ bad

Audit- Sean Dennis or Lisa baudot it’s like intermediate 2 and choosing between the best of the best. I have Dennis and he’s super kind and very forgiving. Also has a pretty heavy curve. His exams are hard but the curve makes up for it

Advanced- I have Verner (Scott) Smith. I had him for intermediate 1 and I loved him and still do hes a great professor and gives two bonus questions on every exam (so it’s out of 105 but you take the grade out of 100) also really wants to see students succeed 

Tax- Rosenthal is your best bet you have to 100% show up to class everyday to really understand the material as the exams are only on what he covers in class and he doesn’t cover portions of chapters but he is the most caring professor and truly goes out of his way for his students.

"GEP (General Education Program) are classes that are nothing to do with your major, but are required.

Try to figure out if you've met GEP requirements found [here](https://catalog.ucf.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=14&amp;poid=6360). Use your link to see which GEP courses you got credit with.

Here's a short overview of what GEP courses you've got credit with:

|GEP Area|Met?|State Core?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|COM 1|Yes (English Lang and Comp, 4)|Yes|
|COM 2|Yes (English Lang and Comp, 4)|No|
|COM 3|||
|CUL/HIS 1|Yes (World History, 5)|No|
|CUL/HIS 2|||
|CUL/HIS 3|Yes (US History, 4)|No|
|MAT 1|No (can be taken with Calc AB)|Yes|
|MAT 2|Yes (Comp Sci A, 3)|No|
|SOC 1|Yes (US History, 4)|Yes|
|SOC 2|Yes (Psychology, 5)|Yes|
|SCI 1|Yes (Physics C, 3)|Yes|
|SCI 2|No (can be taken with Env Sci)|No|

Each foundation area should be state core, e.g. you should have at least one 'yes' in each of the COM group, CUL/HIS group, MAT group, SOC group, and SCI group.

"this is most likely an EXTREMELY heartless and not a popular opinion, but I kinda think that on a business standpoint, airlines shouldn't be giving refunds or feel they have to.

Most people do not purchase travel insurance because they feel ""nothing would ever happen and is a waste of money"". Then when a pandemic happens, all hell breaks loose and people EXPECT it.   


On a moral standpoint, I think it is awesome that they are extending use of the tickets so the people using them is more spread out over the course of 2 years and not losing them money, but also not making them give out loads of refunds and basically killing the airline. With that being said, I also feel they shouldn't think they have to. They are doing an extremely kind thing by doing just this.   


Like yeah ""who would think a pandemic would even happen?? no one would predict that, airlines should still refund"" well, yeah no shit.

"There's nothing there to dismiss my claims or substantiate your implications. My claim: the general public (in the US) is not at risk of becoming a human trafficking victim because the general public does not fit the demographics involved in human trafficking (third world citizens and homeless children). You're implying students at UCF (and the greater public) should be wary of being victimized. Nothing in your source supports that.

I would even call the source deeply misleading, as that stats are based on city population and the vast majority of human trafficking cases involve transient actors. Of course Orlando ranks highly--it's one of the most visited cities in the world, and a ton of third world people are trafficked though here because of that. I think that's terrible, but it doesn't put UCF students at risk of being kidnapped and sold. You're conflating two distinct issues (crime against US citizens and crime on non-US citizens imported to the US), which is why crime statistics don't match your trafficking stats. It's not that you're wrong about human trafficking, but you're entirely wrong about who's at risk.

The crime statistics regarding kidnapping and missing-persons are clear: people living in the US are safer now than they were 20 or even 10 years ago.",1582245906,1,0

If you have been funded full-time (12+ credit hours a semester) by bright futures, you are expected to earn 12 credit hours that semester. Anything above a D- is an earned credit, an F or a U is not.

However, credits earned are not evaluated until the end of Spring. In my case: I may fail one class this semester, leaving me at 11 credits earned (below the 12 required). BUT because I was funded full time for Fall, I was also required to earn 12 credits for the fall. In my fall semester I ended up earning 13 credits. Since credits are not evaluated until the end of Spring, I ended up earning 13 + 11 credits, which is 24. Since I ended up earning 24, it fulfills the renewal of bright futures as it only requires me to have 12 + 12 credits earned.",1587631516,1,0

"@aph_econ couldn't have described it more perfectly. I just finished my junior year with this degree, and it's definitely been rewarding thus far. I've taken nearly all of my required electives, and I believe that Econometrics I with Dr. Scrogin was by far the most useful and best economics class that I had ever taken. It is really stats and math heavy, but it was such a great class with him. Make sure to take it once you accomplish all of your core requirements and prerequisites. You learn so much about linear regression models in the univariate and multivariate settings, and you get to code programs in STATA. Again, amazing class. Just put the work in and there's no reason for you not to get an A. 

Apart from that, welcome to UCF! Economics B.S. is truly a great major, and most of my classes have been very interesting, encompassing a broad array of economical topics across so many different fields (health economics, labor economics, environmental economics...)

"B.S. grad here. In my opinion, the biggest pro is the accessibility and helpfulness of the professors in the economics department. Those two factors may not hold as well in the introductory level classes, but even then if you make an effort then it will be reciprocated warmly. Moreover, just about everyone in the department is more than willing to assist you with any goals you may have for your time as an undergraduate or post-grad, be it getting involved in research, entering the job market, or applying to graduate school. Whatever your interests are, I assure you that the faculty will be interested in guiding/assisting you outside of lectures. I have to be nitpicky about the biggest con because cons are sparse, so I'd have to say that it's the lack of overall quantitative/mathematical content in the curriculum, particularly for the B.S. However, that is changing and the department is adding more quantitatively oriented classes and augmenting current classes so that they are more mathematically rigorous. 

As for advice, I would strongly encourage you to get involved with the department outside of classes in some way. This could mean being a TA, research assistant, or undertaking your own research project (be it via the Honors in the Major program during your junior or senior year or Independent Study); the Institute for Economic Forecasting is also a good option for getting some experience with research and quantitative skills. Since you'll be doing the B.S., I'd also suggest minoring in math, statistics, or even computer science (or any combination of the three). Even if you don't go through with a minor, having some upper-level courses from those fields under your belt will provide you with invaluable skills that will be helpful regardless of whether you end up pursuing academic research or working in industry right out of undergrad.

This whole situation is so unprecedented that no advice I can give you is worth jack shit right now. All the places that would hire someone with a pulse right now are closed, or their outlook is so bleak no one knows what will happen. We are living in a world where a McDonald's employee (no disrespect to fast food workers) are getting OT while physical therapists, dentists and financial analysts in certain sectors are seeing pay cuts or just flat out being furloughed.

If you can stay here and find any job then go for it but dont feel shame having to move back with your parents.  This situation will pass but likely not without fucking everything in its path.

IT is focused on network stuff and dips into programming and theory a lot less than CS does. CS would be what you want for software engineering although like the other guy said I would dip my toes in first and see how you like everything. CS has significantly harder pre-reqs.,1588683681,1,0

She even puts down the practice problems for them in it too. Definitely take her a lot of my friends had seemed to find her to be harder, but if you just study the material it’s really easy I wound up with an A.",1588678221,1,0

"Yeah do it while the other classes are fresh in your head. Just make sure you **force** yourself to make plenty of friends to help with study groups and get you through the hard classes. Depending on the professor, Calc 3 and Physics 2 can take up a *lot* of time and effort. Be nice to yourself if you're stuffing a bunch of hard classes into one semester.

When I was in school I found a way to send out mass emails to all the students in the class where I'd create group chats for anyone to join who wanted. It was a life saver for especially the calculus/difficult math courses I had to take. I think you'll be alright as long as you've got that type of support system.

Good luck!

"A lot of early cs classes are similar to IT classes. So I’d suggest doing cs and getting through the weed out classes fast (discreet cot3100, cs1 (with foundation exam), calc 2 Mac2312). if you get through these I think you should be able to do the rest of the major and  you’ll also avoid switching majors late from failing one of those 3 times, isn’t uncommon in this major. As for software development I’ve never heard of it but there is a software engineering track on the CS catalog. I’d suggest to look at both majors catalogs and class descriptions and see which is closer to what you wanna do in the future.",1588668451,1,0

"tldr: ucf doesn't have a lot of things that other major universities do :/  
i transferred to ucf after 2 years at UC san diego and 2 semesters at seminole state, and i've lived in 3 countries and 5 states prior to college as well so I've talked to a lot of friends who've attended colleges across the world. i've kinda come to realize that for whatever reason, ucf doesn't have a loooot of features/things/amenities that other major universities tend to have. things like:

1. a better class registration system (myUCF is absolutely terrible to use compared to UCSD's and even seminole state's systems)
2. a ""grade distribution archive"" of all past classes offered at ucf organized by term, professor, and how many students got A's/B's/C's in that specific class in that term. had this at UCSD, it was SO useful when trying to plan future semesters. not just for which professors or electives to take, but to easily see if a class was historically offered every fall or every spring. made long term planning so much easier. so many UCF students get close to graduating but then realize they actually have to stay for an extra semester or two because courses they thought would be offered in a certain semester just aren't.
3. a reliable, up-to-date staff and faculty directory with emails and phone numbers for every entry. we do have a main directory, and then a bunch of other directories spread across different departmental websites. and the smaller directories almost never match up exactly with the main directory due to one or the other not being updated. i've personally struggled multiple times to find contact info of faculty or campus officials.
4. A student directory like the one you're talking about
5. Better shuttle tracking! In my 3 years here I've lived in 3 different off campus apartments and therefore regularly taken 3 different shuttle routes. and legit 75% of the time the timings aren't accurate on the UCF mobile app. I've talked to so many different friends from other major universities and it isn't as much of a problem for them, and I've experienced a better system myself while at UCSD.
6. it takes so damn long for ucf grads to get their actual diplomas mailed out to them!!! this is FOR SURE not normal

These are just some main examples I've noticed. It's honestly kinda sad, like yes our tuition is cheap, but we have literally 70,000 students to offset that, and our campus isn't even as big in terms of size and # of buildings/offices/classrooms as some other universities. 

PS: apologies for the length of this comment, i've been thinking of all of these things for awhile now but never actually expressed them to anyone so the thoughts just kept flowing :') now that i've typed it up i think ill actually try to email the appropriate campus officials about this!",1588658494,2,0
