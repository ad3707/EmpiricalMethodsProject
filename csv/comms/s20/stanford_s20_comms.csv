Figure out what it is about each one that you like and see how much of it you can get out of the other. For example, I realized what I really liked about political science was the statistical aspect of it, understanding human political behavior at a mass scale and seeing broad trends, and I became frustrated with how case-study-based a lot of my polisci and public policy classes seemed to be. While taking the ML/AI classes, I ended up doing some really cool projects using NLP to study language trends in successful and unsuccessful candidates or for politicians in different time periods and now I work in a part of the industry that still, for the most part, satisfies my politics itch.

Another thing is you have to report scholarships ahead of time, since the office says they will adjust aid accordingly, so aid would likely be reduced before the cardplan even happens, unless you're not reporting the scholarship (?) and the organization is sending it anyway",1580795600,1,0

Stanford AI classes are more akin to math classes than programming project classes. i would spend more time reviewing probability, linear algebra, and optimization. most programming is proof of concept type work and they will generally provide the structural code and give you stubs to fill out. very little OOP, computer systems/IO work. 

with that being said, you will need to be fluent in Python. you'll need to know reference/copy semantics, plot data and save figures, and know how to step through and debug Python code. you may learn basics on Numpy, PyTorch, Keras on the way, but learning anything else you'll start to fall behind.

Just take your time in undergrad to explore what you find cool and interesting.

GPA is not as important if you are at a competitive big name school that the Stanford faculty see a lot of applications from.

But more important than both of these things is your research experience, if you're interested in a PhD.

The courses are rigorous (lots of reading, writing, and discussion), and the people there are also very bright. On the downside, it's lacking in diversity because of its meritocratic system (a LOT of Asians). All in all, I think it'll be a great experience. Congrats on getting in!

"As a student, you can register to vote either at home or at your residence on campus.

If you’re registered to vote at home and home is outside Santa Clara County, you would have to go home to vote. It is too late to request a mail-in ballot, as it wouldn’t arrive in time. 

If you want to update your voter registration to your residence on campus, simply go to the vote center on campus and tell them you want to update the address on your voter registration.

"If it’s still taught by Freese, then the class is fairly easy IMHO. Mostly athletes take the class. Freese used a grading system where there was like ~400 available points in the class, and you need to get around ~360 points to earn an A. 


You earn points basically by showing up to lecture and signing in (I think via iClicker). There’s also weekly reading assignments on canvas with short quizzes attached to them that you also do for points. You also collect points by showing up to section. I believe section is usually just a debate surrounding a sports topic. You can earn extra points for leading a debate, and I think you could lead multiple times a quarter if you choose to. There’s also a midterm and final, but they’re fairly easy as long as you paid attention to lectures and did the readings. The readings are basically just sports stories. Here are some examples I remember: the Harding/Kerrigan story, Gladwell’s Outliers, and the 1968 Black Power Salute. Lastly, I believe there was also an ethics paper due at some point towards the end of the quarter. I believe attendance and readings/participation made up for most of the points.

"Disclosure: I'm a current Continuing Studies Instructor at Stanford teaching product management and user experience (BUS 57 W). I've been teaching for Stanford CSP since 2018 (5+ sessions) and I've loved every moment of it. I'll try my best to be as objective as possible, but understand that I'm colored by my own personal experience/bias. 

**Pros/Cons**

**Pro:** The quality of instruction (in most cases) is top-tier. Stanford CSP faculty are either a) Stanford educators (lecturers/ associate professors / full professors) b) industry professionals (with decades+ of experience) or c) academics with teaching appointments at other universities. In my case, I have 9+ years of experience in consulting/tech along with a published textbook and a teaching appointment at Brandeis University (master's courses). 

**Pro:** The workload is tailored to fit a working professional's schedule. Stanford CSP courses are unlike master's level coursework -- they don't expect 15-20 hours of commitment. A CSP course generally expects anywhere between 5-10 hours of commitment per week, and this adjusts up / down based on your incoming experience level with the subject matter. This reduction in effort is reflected in the course pricing -- CSP courses are typically 1/5 the price of a graduate-level course. 

**Pro:** A dedication to offering a true Stanford experience. For the majority of learners who will never be able to receive an on-campus Stanford experience (let alone live anywhere near Palo Alto), Continuing Studies is their only outlet to a quality education. The instructors use mixed-methods (e.g. Zoom live lectures, Canvas discussions, cases, assignments, capstones) to cater to a learner's strengths and provide an accessible experience irrespective of location, baseline understanding, etc. 

**Pro:** A generous refund policy. You can enroll in a Continuing Studies course and receive a full refund if you withdraw before the third class session (for 5-10 week courses). This creates a risk-free atmosphere for students to enter into a course and decide if its right for them. 

**Con:** Not all instructors are created equal. Although Stanford CSP has a rigorous interview &amp; course evaluation process, there will always be so-so classes with instructors that fly just above the required threshold for a repeat class appointment. I'd urge you to investigate their background, their prior teaching experience (important!), and alignment to the subject matter.

**Con:** Stanford CSP courses don't count as academic credit for Stanford University. If your goal is to take a CSP course, then apply to a Stanford graduate program and transfer the credit over, this will not be possible. 

If you have any other questions, DM me. I'm happy to chat and provide context.",1582835009,1,0

Thanks for the answer! Could you elaborate a bit on why replacing B grades is suspicious? I don't fully understand what you mean by that.,1582140147,1,0
"First -- you can apply up to three times, so you might as well apply early to see if you get in. 

Second -- the 106B/107/103 grades are something that they will look at, and are concerning, but if you go and try to replace the 106B/107 grades that will be an obvious indicator that you're doing it just to apply for coterm. Replacing a C is generally acceptable, but replacing B grades is always suspicious. Your later grades are important, too, and should counterbalance the early grades somewhat.

Third -- get good letter-writers. Make sure they are all from the CS department, if possible. Letters from internships are basically worthless as far as getting into Coterm is concerned. It is 100% better to have a letter from a professor in CS than an internship, and probably 75% better to have a letter from a professor in CS/EE than from another discipline. If you think you don't know a professor well enough, set up a meeting and pitch your case, and then give them everything they need to write a great letter. Tell them how you did in their course, how you have improved overall in your coursework, etc. You want them on your side, and that can mean the difference between getting in or not with a relatively weak GPA.",1582137927,1,0

"Sorry, calling BS here - and I’m willing to admit I’m getting defensive here as an alum who was MS&amp;E. 

Your statement is just an oversweeping generalization looking down on MS&amp;E as a major that isn’t accurate or helpful with no real facts or even first hand experience to support it. What does weak even mean and in what context? How many professors have been openly telling you that they hate teaching MS&amp;E students? Are you going around asking your professors this question? 

I’ll say this based on my experience in MS&amp;E:
MS&amp;E is arguably the “least” engineering major. 
MS&amp;E is certainly a very broad major that requires core basic engineering fundamentals, then learning how they can be applied in a range of business and societal settings and their implications. So yes, I don’t think MS&amp;E students on average are going to be stronger than other engineering students in technical knowledge - and that’s by design of the program. What they do get is a broad, practical education to work in a wide variety of careers or further depth in an area with more schooling. 

But MS&amp;E’s major requirements mean pretty diverse experiences in terms of difficulty and knowledge. You have a lot of classes to choose from to fulfill the reqs and they vary a lot in difficulty and technical depth. A bunch of those classes are in the 200’s (classes designed for the master’s program) - and I think at least 1/3 of the classes I took for the major, and I think a lot of my peers had similar class loads. But I would also agree there are MS&amp;E students who can avoid taking the tough classes and cruise by - but certainly not most students. 

Sure, MS&amp;E has a lot of students who are interested in business - not sure why that means they don’t take their studies seriously? Completely disagree that the major is full of athletes - in my year probably &lt;10% of MS&amp;E students were athletes - and I have no reason to believe they tried less or performed more poorly than other students. 

To actually answer OP’s question - I don’t think many of my peers did coterms because a lot of students have a very pre professional mindset. But the ones that did usually did CS or MS&amp;E again - mostly to build more technical knowledge in whatever they were interested in.",1582090701,1,0

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;was planning to take a few CS courses (have taken CS106A so far) to become a proficient programmer.

I definitely taking some CS courses to beef up your skills is a great start, especially with the resources of Stanford at your fingertips.  As you mentioned in the block above, CS 106B is a great next course to take, and I would recommend taking it as soon as possible after 106A-nothing like continuing a sequence without having to catch up at the beginning of the class! (If you have time constraints/other issues which prevent this, no worries!! In the end, there is no rush lol :)) After 106B, I would definitely prioritize taking CS 107 and CS 110 rather than CS 129, though you could take that concurrently or as a break in between the two, etc. The reason why I emphasize CS 107 and 110 is because these are: A) CORE CS classes for the CS major so even if you don't want to major/minor/whatever in CS, you KNOW these classes are important for your growth in the field and B) Taking those two introduction to systems type classes is a great way to beef up your skills as a coder because it'll make you be more in tune with different types of system design, working with/adding to a large code base, and how to properly debug (though let's be honest, no one ever really ends up knowing how to properly debug lol). I know that for me, those classes really helped open my eyes to how to properly style, develop, and design code, and it was definitely a great building block in my education. Also, not as required (but still highly recommended in my opinion), is taking CS 103, CS 109, and/or CS 161. Depending on your proof background, you can choose whether or not to take CS 103/109, but I would definitely say that 161 is a great class which teaches the basic of algorithm design, analysis, and creation. Once again, it teaches you a way of thinking and reasoning about CS type problems which will make you a better programmer overall (and again, 109 and 103 are the prereqs for that class, so make sure you have that content before you take it!). And when you do take 161, take it with Mary Wooters! Beyond this core, branching out depends on your interest. Since you listed 129 above, I assume you are interested in taking a look at AI. From what I can see, CS 129 looks like a good starting place! I also recommend taking CS 221 because from what I've heard, that is the basic first building block in an AI education, and if you want to branch out from there, CS 229 gives a good math foundation and CS 230 gives a good introduction to deep neural nets. As a non-AI track, I don't want to say much more, since I don't this as well as others will! However, I will say that even if you enjoy AI, taking some systems classes will not only beef up your programming chops, some of them will probably help you with your AI work! (CS 149 for example)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;(would internships help?)

Yes, internships would help give you a sense of what building a production codebase feels like. If you are going to be a sophomore next year (I assume you are currently a stanford student), then apply to either Facebook University, Google STEP, or Microsoft's equivalent program. You can also apply to various startups, other companies, and SWE internships. However, generally to break into these internships, it helps to have the classes above to back up your resume! Internships are a whole beast on their own, and they are not for everybody, so I'll just leave my commentary on that there :) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also what do CS majors think of the Reid's comments that he didn't  consider himself to be a programmer despite taking 7 CS courses?

I think many people think this even after they take 8 classes or heck, even after they get a degree in it! CS is not a static field and there is always so much to learn that you should never really feel like you've ""arrived"", and you have nothing left to be taught. While you will build your skills and reach heights you've never thought even existed, once you get there, you realize just how much more of the infinite mountain is left, and you keep climbing!

"Coming from a different angle--I absolutely did, and though I felt sad at first, it helped me find my perfect balance.

Starting my sophomore year I spent about 75% of my days alone. After a frosh year around tons of friends, I thought I was an extrovert, but turns out I love my alone time, and realized my perfect balance is perhaps seeing a small number of close friends approx a few times a week.

Most of the time I'd spend with people would be during meeting for a meal or talking 1-on-1 with interesting people I'd met. Depends on if you're the type to befriend many people in groups, or thrive off of fewer close relationships

Overall, I'd say that at least a bit of alone time is good because it really makes you look inwards, become comfortable with who you are, and figure out what you truly want (especially at a place with tons of shiny things like Stanford). Paired with some podcasts, interesting things to read online, and the desire to spend some free time learning something outside of classes, alone time at Stanford is great IMO.",1579776842,1,0

One idea is you can try to get involved in your dorm events, especially if your dorm isn't known for having community because then it will be the same few people showing up everytime.

But yeah you definitely need to make an effort to proactively maintain friendships, especially if you lived with these people freshman year and don't live with them anymore.

There are exceptions if you have good reasons.

I often get asked what I want to do with my potential degree (humbio or psych) and it does feel a little awkward sometimes to admit that I don’t really know what I want to do yet. But, I feel like thats pretty normal when you go to school with students who are used to always striving for something. 

But many students really do have true passions! These very same friends enjoy dancing, are interested in medicine because they come from a low-income background and want to increase access to equitable health care, and want to become lawyers with a focus on racial discrimination.

Didn’t read 90% of these comments but saw you said you’re going to engineering school and immediately wanted to suggest you check out CS Graphics.

"Great questions! The main mental health resource is CAPS. They provide counselling to students, which is free and doesn’t require you to have the Stanford insurance policy. CAPS is slightly controversial—the main issue being that it is somewhat understaffed, so there’s often a delay to get in. However, having worked with the people at CAPS a fair amount in my frosh year, I know they very seriously prioritise mental health and if you have a serious issue they’ll try to get you in immediately, or near immediately. The staff are generally very kind, good at what they do, and genuinely care about their jobs. Some of them help teach classes on mental health too. The other main problem with CAPS is they’ll try to move you to other resources after about 7-10 weeks of counselling—e.g. set you up with an outside counsellor. They’ll never insist you stop coming, but they’ll get gradually more focused on you using other resources, and it does feel a bit like you’re being kicked out... Given their staffing issues and the cost of them running counselling without insurance, this is a reasonable policy in my opinion—and they do help you with insurance and calling if you’re worried about that. 

The other main resource is the Bridge: a peer counselling Center run by students. They’re not professionals, but I really like the Bridge. Again it’s run by kind people with good intentions and decent training, and they know how to help with most things. But they’re not intended for serious issues or recurrent counselling. 

Another thing to mention is 5150s: this is when you’re considered suicidal, you can be arrested and hospitalised. This has happened to several of my friends and it sucks hard. Stanford used to handle these particularly badly, but they recently lost a lawsuit relating to them, so I’m hopeful they will improve.

I go up to SF 2 or 3 times a quarter, generally for concerts and events. This varies with how busy I am usually. I know some people go a lot more though, so you don’t have to follow consensus at all! You do you. :) If I can, I try to leave campus at least once a week if I can (though was busy this Winter so definitely did less than that), and I think a lot of people do around that or a bit less. People usually go off campus more after their frosh year, and that’s also when some people get cars. I went off campus so much in my Sophomore Fall! But I don’t think there are too many cars on campus—maybe something like 1 in 5 people after Frosh year? I’m not sure if my sample is representative though, that could be too high an estimate.

I have a good friend who’s a linguistics major and very, very passionate about it. He likes the department and knows them very well. If you have any specific questions on that, I can definitely ask!

Good question. I think I’d want you to know that the advice people give you about college (and particularly Stanford) is usually only their personal experience, and you should ignore others and make whatever you personally want out of your time in college. There’s so much you can do at Stanford—everyone has a vastly different experience—and Stanford really has the breadth of resources for you to do anything you’re interested in. But it won’t always feel that way—for example, there are a lot of CS people here and it will sometimes feel like you have to do CS (or at least STEM) here. That’s a definite misconception, and don’t believe anyone who harks on about how great CS is. If anything, it’s a great time to be in other departments—(I’ve slowly moved to Math, despite being much better at CS)—which usually have smaller classes and care more. 

And I think the same thing applies with picking colleges to some extent. Ignore people’s advice unless it seems really relevant to you, and what you’re interested in doing! Stanford does have a lot of great opportunities and a lot of people I love, so I personally think you should come here. :) But any of those options would be fantastic, really well done!

"Either 1) take the SAT/ACT during a gap year and apply as a freshman or 2) attend a year of college and apply as a transfer student. Whatever you do, refrain from attending a year of college and concealing your transcript.

"I'm an engineering and art major, with an interest in cinematography and film. There are more than enough resources on campus for screenwriting, short films, and networking. And Stanford's art program has a lot of money per a student and a beautiful new building. Plus our proximity to LA lends to a strong alum group there. 

That said Stanford does not have a strong filmmaking program. Compared to NYU and USC, you won't gain the same skills or be challenged by the same level of filmmaking (but not necessarily creative) talent in your peers. 

Compared to Columbia, on the other hand, I think the differences are negligible, especially if you're majoring in engineering. If you're serious about film do a masters at USC, NYU, or AFI post-Stanford. Personally, I focused by electrical engineering degree on novel camera  systems and VR and was able to do projects for short film club, attend movies with the film society, take multiple excellent screenwriting and script analysis classes + meet lots of amazing actors, comedians, and writers on campus.",1585455417,1,0

"am not familiar with film on campus, i’m studying SymSys/CogSci, after 20 years in the theater &amp; entertainment industry in SF &amp; NY starting in my early teens

industry in the Bay is nothing like NY, except for post-production houses, documentaries, educational/science/history, voice-over, and the best nonprofit theater outside OB/OOB

NY is intense, sometimes brutal, careerist, and no-nonsense. it’s phenomenal, and takes a full two years to become fluent in the city. obviously, there are a lot of shoots on location there, the revived Kaufman-Astoria, a few post-houses, and a lot of casting &amp; scouting given the number of film schools &amp; acting conservatories, plus the industry capitols for theater, casting, fashion, dance, classical music, advertising, and news

but, for a long while, principle feature and independent film production beyond necessary exteriors has been moving elsewhere because of salary costs (+20-30%) in greater NYC. so if you’re not doing a film program, will mainly be on campus, and can only do industry internships during summers anyway, it may not be worth it if you’d otherwise prefer Stanford.

"engineering is probably the only profession, outside of research with PhD or conservatory for performers, where undergrad major is actually important to career options.

both NY &amp; LA are expensive af, so esp if you’re considering an (unfunded) MFA later, being qualified for a high paying job that can potentially be done remotely will make it a *lot* easier to prioritize creative &amp; production opportunities and development in your 20s

a lot of very reputable directors are very anti-film school, some even if it is funded, and *all* are anti-student debt. filmmaking is really an art and a craft/trade that’s learned experientially, so unless it’s one of a handful of industry connected BFA programs like USC, UCLA, NYU Tisch, it’s mainly time to work &amp; access to facilities that you’re paying for

def listen to your inner voice, but the opportunities to experiment extracurricularly, do summer internships/work, and have Stanford’s alumni network before moving to NY or LA after graduation aren’t that huge of a difference.

And schools like stanford and columbia put such a high price tag on earnings and profitable majors that there’s a good chance you get pushed away film if you don’t actively pursue it and instead immerse yourself in engineer world. if you do decide to engineering, columbia’s core curriculum would probably give you a much better outlet for creativity than stanford where taking creative classes outside of your major can be somewhat difficult and time constraining",1585448450,1,0

"Introsems are gr9! I took History 9N: “How to start your own nation”, which was incredible. I’d highly, highly recommend it. I also took Music 17N: “Operas of Mozart” which was really fun, provided you actually put in the work to listen to the operas. I also hear the Math one (on knots) is pretty cool. But generally just look for an introsem/professor that peaks your interest and has good reviews!

Maths-wise: if you can take a hell of a lot of work, I’d highly recommend taking the 60 series in your Frosh year, even if you aren’t a math major. I didn’t, and regretted it a lot in retrospect. It’s not been too easy to catch up with people that did take it. :’) (Don’t believe people who say 50 series is the same, it really isn’t...) 

But also, just try not to compare yourself to others! Maths is super hard, and the people who do it are super smart. It’s totally okay to give up on the 60 series and take things slower, for example. I feel pretty stupid on a regular basis in the Math dept, and that’s totally okay. And if you’re struggling with stuff, just ask your profs for help! Particularly the younger ones will be more than willing to hang out, they have way too much unstructured time anyway.

I’m most happy that I randomly joined an a cappella group in my Frosh year lmao. And happy to have met some really cool people, and changed some of my opinions. I’m also happy whenever I decide to make late night trips to L&amp;L. :)",1585441601,1,0

"I took Math 151, the more obscure and theoretical alternative to 116! CS 109 is definitely the easiest and most fun, STATS 116 is awfully taught, and Math 151 is IMO the best. Math 151 substitutes 116 for most things you care about, so I’d recommend it. (But if you’re CS, you’ll have to have also taken 228 or 229 for it to substitute 109, which is absolutely ridiculous.)

I’d recommend MCS if you want to do a CS co-term. IMO the CS degree here tends to be a bit too focused on software engineering and/or a shallow understanding of AI without sufficient mathematical and statistical foundation. I think you can really get a lot out of taking a few more Maths and Stats classes, and those departments are amazing (even though Stats teaching is bad.) This is particularly true if you’re going to do the CS co-term, and hence cover a lot of CS anyway. 

But maybe more importantly, you can’t apply classes to both your BS and MS, and there’s less overlap between MCS BS and CS MS than between CS BS and CS MS. This makes it easier to graduate faster.

I think the required MS&amp;E courses are a bit easy and boring, but probably only if you’ve done a lot of probability and optimisation already. One thing people don’t talk about is you can take harder alternatives, and the MS&amp;E PhD series is super dope! But that’s also not a particularly easy thing to do, as PhDs are v smart. Beyond just my complaints about MS&amp;E, I got really into theoretical CS this year, and Math has a track devoted to that, so it just makes sense for me to switch!",1585441021,1,0

"If you're interested in doing undergraduate research, I might recommend Stanford a little bit more. Keep in mind that Harvard graduate to undergraduate ratio. As a current frosh, I was able to land a research internship during my first year (and Stanford is very supportive in allowing its undergraduates to find research opportunities). That being said, I could be wrong and Harvard could provide many opportunities for research for undergraduates that I am unaware of.",1586560173,1,0
"Am currently in grad school for (astro)physics and someone who did their undergrad at Harvard is in my cohort. I loved my experience with physics people at Stanford, thought it was extraordinarily collaborative and fun, and their experience was a bit less glowing.  But! We’re both at the same grad school now, so academically, I think you’ll thrive at either place. 

If you have a gut feeling about which people you’d jive with more on which campus, I’d go with that. Years ago, I turned down MIT and Princeton just because I found the Stanford people I interacted with to be closest to the kind of person I wanted to be. I loved the quarter system (I got to take astro and cs-y and stats courses every year, and studied abroad!) and how approachable the faculty were (though maybe they’re that way at Harvard too; I have heard that CfA is a bit inaccessible to undergrads, but I could be wrong). I also had a relatively positive experience with housing and staffing. Palo Alto is a geographical bubble which kinda sucked, but I made friends with cars and we took adventures to Mountain View whenever we wanted to get off campus.  I also did a CS summer internship (software engineering at a big company, because #stanford) and even planned to apply for a CS coterm, before I realized I was sick of tech culture. As of a few years ago, I thought there was a decent amount of astro+ML research going on for undergrads. (I wasn’t one of them.) 

Anyway, that was a whole bunch of word vomit. You can DM me if you have more questions, but my biggest advice would be to, if possible, chat with current students and get a sense of “is that where I’d be happy being a year from now?” ... but also know that you’ll do academically great at both places :)",1586558937,4,0

“A vaccine that you make and start testing in a year is not a vaccine that’s deployable,” he said. The earliest it would be deployable, Fauci added, is “in a year to a year and a half, no matter how fast you go.”

It's a contemporary maker space that isn't necessarily and better or different than you would see at many universities. What you might not see on a tour, though, are the old wood shop, the forge, and the other vestiges of the formed-in-1891 facilities once known as the Student Shops, now also part of the Product Realization Lab.  When you see the lineage from 1891 until now you realize how powerful Stanford's programs in fabrication and student empowerment.

"I'm in a similar (yet slightly different situation), but given that my brother went to Stanford, I feel that I'm at least partially able to answer. 

For me, I got in early to Harvard and was a finalist for USC's half and full scholarships. My parents, as well, are able to afford the tuition and room and board at Harvard (and peer institutions) without any financial issue, so I didn't even think twice about accepting Harvard. There are only a few schools in the nation and the world that leave people visibly in awe when you say you go/went there, and I'd say that Harvard and Stanford are two of those few. 

The opportunities at Stanford are **literally** limitless. They are world-renowned in quite possibly every field, and the friendships that you will make there will not only last a lifetime, but will grow to be invaluable when looking for jobs and pivoting careers. At what other school are you going to go to class with Jennifer Gates (I know she already graduated) or Eve Jobs or countless of other people tied with the literal game changers in the world?

Someone brought up the point that people can fail at Stanford just like they can fail at ND, but I'd say it's a lot harder to fail with the Stanford name attached to you in perpetuity. No one can take that away from you. I've always thought about it this way: no matter what school you go to, you can be successful, but the ""bottom tier"" of graduates at a school is significantly higher at Stanford than it is at other schools such as ND. If that doesn't make sense -- you can always be successful no matter where you go, but I would say that the worst graduates of Stanford and the worst graduates at ND are nowhere near the same position.

"Hi! MCS Sophomore here who dropped out of 61CM after two weeks. I did not take as much multi beforehand, so YMMV, but I found 61CM quite a hard introduction to proof-based maths. It felt like a lot of the students in it (at least my immediate circle) had already taken some proof-based math, and they found the class hard. Personally, I took proof-based math outside of the 60 series and really enjoyed it (108, 113, 115), but I would not have enjoyed it had it been in the 61CM setting – there is just a lot of content and it is hard to stack that on top of (1) it being frosh fall and (2) doing proofs for the first time.  

Overall, try it and see if you want to drop (the 1st two weeks should be enough to know...probably). I will say, Multi is super important, so taking it a second time wouldn't be so bad, esp. if at least 30% is new content.",1586417732,1,0

"Take the scholarship and run. You can be a big fish in a small bowl at ND or a small fish in a big bowl at Stanford. I think ND is well regarded in the midwest and in some sectors in the NorthEast. Their alumni base is loyal so networking once you’re done may be a breeze. 

Have you informed Stanford of your scholarship offer at ND? they will usually try to match or come close. You’re fortunate that your parents can pay tag price for Stanford but thats still a huge amount for arguably a similar education. If they’re willing to spend it on you, have them invest that sum now while the market is low and cash out before grad school. 

College is what you make it, people flop at Stanford and people shine at ND or vice versa. You can make it anything you want to be if you’re aggressive about the right opportunities.

This was several years back (yay PhD)! Nowadays there are good pc options like dell XPS 13s that ship with Ubuntu.

"Just a few notes on above:

- Installing Windows on a Mac computer is super easy (and free, nowadays given Windows doesn’t enforce license keys), and gives you the benefits of a UNIX based system in macOS alongside Windows which will prove useful in CS/EE tracks. 

- Don’t always rule out spending more than $1000.  Depends on how much money you have, obviously, but as CS/AI I’ve benefited enormously from investing significantly more than $1000 in a laptop.  Your mileage will vary, and you can get away with a cheaper one obviously, but it’s your tool of trade and you’ll be spending thousands of hours tapping away on that thing over the next few years.  Don’t skimp out if you can afford not to.

"I was in your shoes last year. Here's what I learned.

Your laptop really depends on your major. Art majors might consider a Macbook for its retina display and brighter colors. But engineers (I'm a Mechanical Engineer major) will need a laptop with 16GB+ of RAM and with Windows because SolidWorks will be much easier to instal. CS majors will build their own computers. Etc.

But in general, I would suggest **comfort** and **longevity**. So factors to consider (In order of personal importance):

1) Your laptop should last you all 4 years IMO, so buying a new 2019 or 2020 laptop is recommended. Look at the specs.

2) Price. You shouldn't spend more than $1,000 on a laptop but also don't buy a $50 used laptop from EBay. A $1,000 laptop is more than enough for college. Some of my friends are surviving with some pretty beat up laptops and they're doing fine. But buy a laptop that you can still use in a few years. Some people recommend going all out on a laptop, but save your money for a good bike or something.

3) A good screen is important, since you'll be staring at it for far too much of your life. I recommend a touch screen since that comes in handy and you can take notes and do homework more easily. Although most people use an iPad for electronic notes. I prefer a larger screen since it makes it easier to see multiple tabs at once.

4) The keyboard should feel comfortable enough for a laptop, since you will be spending several hours at a time typing an essay the day before it's due. Although with the current situation, you might not be able to physically see/feel the laptop before buying.

5) Weight/size. I didn't move my laptop from my dorm very often, but when I did I'm glad I don't have a heavy/bulky laptop.

6) Operating system. OS is mainly personal preference, unless your major will require using certain software that works better on a certain OS. So do some google searches into that.

Same would apply to emails pulled with TLS for instance. So banking websites are totally safe.

I don't know about taking both together but I can tell you 61 is (or feels like) a lot more than 4 units worth of work. it's one of the best classes I've taken so far but it's hard,1588606682,1,0

"If I can piggyback on your comment for a sec: SLE dropout and STEM major here. you're absolutely right about the east flo/SLE community. I also think flomo is heavily underrated as a dorm because it's kind of centrally located - you have access to both east and west campus. I took SLE this year in an attempt to step out of my comfort zone and try an actual hard humanities course. I ended up biting off more than I could chew and I struggled to keep up with lectures, discussion, reading etc. Additionally, the scheduling was awful (most classes run MWF or TR. SLE is TWR so it conflicts with anything in it's very long time block, and it's later in the day than I like to go to classes) and I kept falling asleep in lecture and even discussion section. I was in way over my head and was not having fun so I dropped after a lot of back and forth with my friends.

Ultimately, I was way happier having dropped it. Having more units free meant I got to explore my actual interests more and I'd even say PWR 1 was a pretty cool class because I got to write papers on subjects that were more personal to me. That being said, I don't regret having taken it. SLE plugged me in to a community unlike any other on campus. The kids in SLE are super smart, they consider problems deeply and with perspective that I never had, and I learned a ton from them. 

Even still I can't recommend taking SLE for everyone, and I'm sure I would have gotten a lot of other benefits out of going to a normal all frosh dorm. Whatever you do, I'm sure you'll get something invaluable out of it.",1588604691,1,0

"SNRT doesn't have any form of monitoring - it is a registration program that ensures that you download Stanford BigFix (pushes Windows/MacOS updates only after they've been tested to work correctly and are secure), that you have some form of anti-virus, checks that your device is encrypted if you have noted that the device you are registering is using data that is required to be encrypted, and other things like making sure that you are an enrolled student, etc.

In terms of what information is kept about you: when you register your device, your MAC address is entered into a database that connects your SUNET id / name to that device.

What information can Stanford see when on an HTTPS connection? They can see all metadata of requests you make - so they can see stuff like how large the request is, your IP address, the website you are requesting, etc. But they cannot see contents of any packets sent or received. This is just how HTTPS works. This also means that University IT has the ability to see what sites a specific MAC address visits most, but they cannot tell more than that (more explicitly, they cannot see reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/..., but they can see reddit.com)

Using a VPN would, I believe, prevent them from even seeing a majority of that metadata (potentially all of it).

Another quarter of S/NC (and of more LOA) would also be pretty undesirable for everyone, not to mention that semester schools would also be moving to a 15-week online semester.

I think the most likely scenario is that students will be brought back to campus, but numerous regulations will be in place (no parties, online events, classes over a certain size being online, regulations to exam seatings, etc.)",1587622548,1,0

"I spend the vast majority of my time (truly hours and hours a day) working on homework. I get to have much less of a life than I ever thought I would, and many of the students here are able to coast through because of their prior educational background, which is something I definitely can't compete with. Most of your classes will have the curves set by people who already know the material. It can sometimes be demoralizing. There definitely are other people who also are going through it like me, but I would say, at least within my experience in STEM, current grades are correlated with past educational experiences. A decent number of profs aren't super great lecturers because they were chosen for their research. Some of the most brilliant people in the world can't explain the intro level topics :(

"Yeah. I'll split it into STEM and non-STEM (and I'm going to try to be vague for privacy reasons)

STEM: Microbiology lab research, produced published results (but wasn't necessarily published myself if that makes sense); hospital volunteering; did separate lab research as a prestigious summer program; tutored kids in Math, CS, and Science (both inside and outside of my school); did the typical Math competitions; did some stuff regarding public-health and health-education for some public schools in my state

Non-STEM: I really enjoy a fairly niche type of literature, so I read a lot of it on my own and then eventually did some research into it with a professor and lead some other students through reading some novels; editor of a publication in my school; run a non-STEM tutoring center; teach sailing and compete in the summer

Other: good at my sport, which took a lot of time (good enough to been recruited by some Ivy Leagues but not good enough for PAC12, for reference), and was captain for 2 years

So I don't know where my ""spike"" would have been. If your ECs are already kind of all over the place like mine, I wouldn't try to present yourself as having a spike in your application. I considered trying to make myself seem like a biology kid through my supplements, but now that I've met some of the kids who actually put all of their time into pre-med and bio ECs, I realize I would've paled in comparison.

"I was in the same position last year, also interested in CS, and ended up going to Stanford. For me what swayed the decision was going to a technical high school and wanting to meet people who weren't necessarily all STEM-y. I think I think Stanford's culture is definitely more decentralized than MIT culture. It's very dorm-centric, and--at least to me--seems more laid back and chill. People are intense but most don't project this intensity onto others. I have friends who joke about sleeping till 4 PM every day and also work their asses off. At Stanford I heard the word ""self care"" a lot, and my dorm had this thing called ""Candid Conversations"" where we talked about intense subjects like anxiety and depression, which I really liked. Duck Syndrome is a thing, but I think it exists more among casual acquaintances rather than close friends. There are so many fun places to explore on campus too, and my favorite memories are wandering campus at like 2 AM and finding cool spots :)",1587587539,1,0

That being said, I did feel like certain cliquey friend groups on campus wouldn't want me to be a part of them because of my race--the disinterest was mutual.

With that said, I don't think South Asian social life has to suck. I know a ton of South Asian undergrad dudes in relationships with extremely strong networks. My advice: Find an extracurricular activity that you enjoy and has a large active campus presence (SSI, any of the acapella/music groups, one of the campus newspapers, dance teams, Section-Leading, Axe Committee etc.) and truly immerse yourself into it. You'll make so many close friends and it's a great way to keep meeting new people after freshman year. Most of these organizations also tend to be far more diverse than Greek Life.",1587525339,1,0

"I feel very strongly about this topic, so here are my thoughts. Social life for South Asian undergrad guys at Stanford sucks, I hope other weigh in on this if you agree/disagree. Specifically, I am talking about second generation (or higher) undergraduate students who were raised in America but are ethnically Indian, not international students from India although much of it still applies. I am also specifically talking about social life.

* There is no centralized community. The main clubs/groups are: South Asian Society (formely Sanskriti), Bhangra (dance), and Raggapella (Indian acappella). As far as I know, the actives in SAS (the ones who actually show up to meetings, are not just on the email list) are small and made up of mostly international students. If you're not into song/dance, then you're kind of out of luck (and those two performing groups are relatively small as well). No Ethnic themed dorm like Latino/Native American/Black/(East) Asian
* Everyone is friendly, but few non-Asian people will actually be (close) friends with you after freshman year. Just the way it is, I don't think this is Stanford-specific.
* Most Greek Life (Frats moreso than sororities) just straight up don't want you and won't invite you to their private rush events. Pretty sure the total number of brown guys in Greek Life is low single digits. It's better with sororities from what I hear.
* Dating as a brown guy here is... incredibly difficult. A lot of the South Asian (undergrad) girls actually end up going for white guys since they have the choice. Dating apps in the Bay Area as a college-aged brown guy? Expect 0 matches, not kidding.
* The Indian grad student community is apparently very strong, as Stanford admits way more South Asian people with regards to masters degrees.
* With regards to racism, haven't seen or witnessed it myself, and would not say it is prevalent on campus. I do think Stanford is very multicultural and accepting as the other comments say, yet there a ton of race-based aspects to social life that here that can get overlooked if you are not part of that race/ethnicity.",1587513512,2,0

"Your social life will be great, but I think it's disingenuous to pretend there's no racism. As another commentor said, Stanford is very multicultural so people aren't going to be blatantly racist, but there are going to be some instances were it's more subtle and stereotyping/microagressions occur (this is true of any race, not just Indian). 

There was a bit of this in my freshman dorm, my advice is to speak up when it happens and let people know that it bothers you / is not okay. Most people at Stanford do want to be welcoming to others and they might be saying something without realizing it's offensive. 

One thing that might be hard is that the South Asian community at Stanford is pretty decentralized. There isn't really a community center/ ethnic-themed dorm like there are for some other groups. This means that if you're looking for a tight-knit ethnic community, it might be a little harder. Personally, this wasn't too important to me but it's really important to some people. 

Just to reiterate, most Indians at Stanford have thriving social lives, but Stanford's not a utopic paradise. It's a great place, but it's not perfect &amp; there will be some racism. With that said, it's much better than most other places in the country and people really do try to be open-minded.",1587501401,2,0

I know many other poc whose roommates have been implicitly or explicitly racist, and of course, have had some professors who have more conservative beliefs to say it nicely. Stanford might be “multicultural” but that doesn’t necessarily mean it doesn’t have its issues.

That being said, unfortunately, you won’t find any school that doesn’t have its issues. The difference with Stanford is that most ethnic communities are very passionate about their culture and about supporting their members.

5. Don't do it if you want to have a social life! College to me is more about the people than anything else and I think finding your communities on campus and being an active participant takes a lot of time. Plus, you have four years to complete your major its no rush
6. I highly recommend taking Designing Your Stanford considering you are a freshman, the class will help you answer 1-5 pretty thoroughly.

"Seems like you want a lucrative career path; that’s fine. Not going to turn you off from that, but I do think Stanford will challenge you to reassess why you want that. 

I’d personally recommend the MS&amp;E major / financial and decision area track for what you’re optimizing for. You can take some essential Econ, take some CS courses, and take helpful upper division classes in investment science, risk analytics, etc. If you’re interested in the quant side there’s exposure to do that too; there’s an algo trading class, the Kudla fund, etc. within the dept. (although anyone can access those opportunities). There’s also a few GSB classes geared towards finance/investment that’ll be available to you if you email the right professors. 

Bottom line though, get out in 4 years max. You’re going to need an expensive top-tier MBA from probably H/S/W to advance your career, so don’t spend more now paying for extra quarters if you can help it.",1589671588,1,0
"You don’t need many textbooks at all for CS FYI. Lectures generally are more than enough to do well in those classes, especially for the core. Also many people here seem to use libgen for digital copies of textbooks.

"(1) ESF is the best way to go. Don’t think of it as a thing for “liberal artsy” people—think of it as a thing for people who want to fulfill their PWR and THINK requirements in one class. You save a lot of time and energy by doing ESF instead of the two frosh requirements.

(2) Just look on Carta to see what people think of the courses.

(3) It looks like the catalog comes out on Aug 1.

(4) You can check out the course requirements for the major online, see if that’s too broad for your liking.

(5) Physics and Chem and Math all at the same time would be rough, but you can always try out the course load and drop classes later. In general I try to limit myself to 15 units of “real” classes, and then tack on some 1-units and 2-units for fun. For premed, just make sure you take Chem in the Fall, and you should be good. Premeds usually wait to do Physics till junior year.

"The max transfer creds you can bring in is 45, I believe (unless you're a transfer student, then you can bring in 90). I used to recommend taking physics/math outside of Stanford, but I just finished the 20 series and I actually quite liked it (would still recommend taking math elsewhere if it's not your major, but still a requirement). But it sorta depends on what your educational goals are. As a premedical humbio student, I wanna get premed requirements out of the way, but math at Stanford is kinda ridiculous so I would definitely do that elsewhere if you need to/can. As for physics, it's sorta up to you.

I've hated it at times (and tbh I still wonder whether I should have taken a full ride to a less prestigious school because I'm dumb) but in reality it's a decent place.

To make sure you don't hate it, I have a few tips for avoiding bad parts of the experience:

1. DO NOT live in an all-freshman dorm: your dorm-mates will behave horribly and almost invariably will ruin your experience with their immaturity. FroSoCo and four-class dorms are all better options.
2. Choose a major because you genuinely like it, not because you're trying to make a statement (that's a mistake I made): obviously many of us need to pick majors that will pay the bills, but among those options, pick the major you like best, and also feel free to minor in something less remunerative if it would please you.
3. Don't let Stanford's toxic activist environment get to you. There are real issues on this campus for certain, but the activist groups only exacerbate them, and they can make your life hell if you interact with them and dare to question their beliefs.",1589656259,1,0
