"Of course, the majority of people that come here love their time here. Reddit will take the tip of the tip of the iceberg and blow it up onto the front page, which is what gives the illusion of negativity surrounding Cornell. Saying anything is bad is clickbait. It’s not just an internet thing, it’s a Reddit thing in particular. 

However, it is important to understand that there will always be some ratio of students out of the body that legitimately don’t enjoy their time here. I think if you come here, and make an effort to make friends, be reasonably social, and pick up the opportunities that come your way that almost anyone could be happy here, but this may not be natural for everyone. 

At the time of this writing, 11 people have responded saying that they do not regret their time here, with plentiful upvotes and not a single person disagreeing. While this may be reassuring for prospective students, it doesn’t make for a very profound conversation. And I do think that this discussion has value, clashing here with someone else’s reply, because I think it can make you more prepared in general for your time here or could indeed drive you from this school. 

In general, there are 3 reasons I can think of to avoid this school. The first is the money issue. This school is really, really expensive. If you’re not receiving aid, help from the fam, or in a very lucrative major, then there’s legitimate reason not to come here. 

Another issue is that it’s super competitive here, much more so than other colleges. One of my peer advisors “””studied abroad””” at Georgia tech and, if you’re willing to forgive the anecdotal evidence, said that it wasn’t  as competitive as Cornell and that people didn’t care so much in general. Which, if true, is actually pretty surprising. 

The last issue, perhaps the one that is most interesting, is that Cornell is a general dreary place. The weather is often bad, it’s cold for a long period of time, the campus is inconveniently placed on the side of a mountain, and I do feel that morale is generally pretty low as a result. You may occasionally see someone crying in the phone due to test grades or even break down mid test. You may see people taking naps in hallways. You might experience a gloom that seems to permeate much of campus. But in the end, while it’s always there, I think this can be fought through without too much trouble. 

Now, let me talk about myself for a moment. I am a junior in ECE and I regret choosing Cornell. For me, it’s really a collective thing. I originally came to Cornell because it was Ivy League, and the prestige was too much to pass up. I came here as an excited and motivated engineering major and I thought of Cornell as the vehicle that was going to transform me into the person I wanted to be. However, following my sophomore year I quickly realized that ECE isn’t what I thought it was, and I wanted to choose a different engineering major, but my parents wouldn’t let me. They told me that my only options were the most traditional engineering fields, e.g. meche, ece, cheme. Even CS was closed off. Disobeying would mean a $280k slap to the face, so I had no choice but to go through. 

So I guess the primary reason I regret cornell, the unintended consequence of the financial aid system being that those with aid get autonomy from their parents and those without are chained to a leash, is not really an issue with Cornell directly so much as an unfortunate interaction of circumstances. But still, the predicament I find myself in can’t be a unique one and I still think yields some insightful results. 

I think what’s most important to understand about college, that I definitely didn’t understand when first coming here, is what makes it hard. Is it that the work you do on a daily basis is incomprehensibly difficult? Well, not usually. Is it that everyone else is now so smart it’s hard to stand out? While this effect exists, it shouldn’t prevent anyone from being successful. While many could breeze their way through high school, some modifications with studying correct this and allow people to stand out. 

No, what makes a place like Cornell hard is that it’s a psychological battle, not a mental one. It’s very easy to wake up in the morning, and tell yourself that you will work hard today, that you will do your work when you are supposed to and that you will start essays and study for tests ahead of time. It is a very different thing to actually be able to carry this out. It’s difficult, at least for me, to stay disciplined, especially after the first few weeks pass. It’s difficult for me to stay motivated. Sometimes I can get very frustrated with myself, because I will procrastinate work and then get upset, and then have this cycle repeat over and over again every day. I guess the exact manifestation of this issue could very from person to person, but I think some people can get what I mean. This past semester, amidst my own insanity I burned out on an easy schedule after the first few weeks, and I probably would have imploded into a black hole if I didn’t have this cancellation to return home and set things normal again. Literally just from leaving campus I feel a huge weight off my chest, not because I don’t have assignments to do but because I feel myself freed from the same bad habits, endless YouTube drip feed and mental ruts and noisy neighbors, like a curse being lifted from my body. 

So, I hope this balances out the responses you get and helps you understand how someone here could be feeling. I’ll be fine in the meantime. Just know that, I don’t think everybody is joking we complain about Cornell. It’s some ratio, and personal experience will vary wildly.",1584412418,1,0

"ok so here's my best explanation:

Since we have to maximize consumption per worker, we first have to start with the equation C = Y-I because consumption is everything that isn't being invested (or, as we see on the prelim, Y(1-s), for the same reason that everything that isn't being saved is being consumed). Then we have to divide everything by L to get to the actual ""per worker"" part, and we'll wind up with a function that has C\~ = a bunch of little ks or whatever (because k=K/L). Then we take the derivative of C\~ with respect to k and solve for k to get kGR. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helped a little, if you want to PM me I can draft up an example problem that might make it clearer! also, if you're dividing Y by L you often have an L 1-a already in the function, which won't divide out cleanly. divide that portion by L\^a \*L\^1-a instead (because it equals L), so that the K\^a becomes k\^a and the L is divided out.",1583333461,1,0

"I'm in Engineering and for many majors, it's not too difficult to graduate in 3.5 years if you have AP credit coming in and manage your time well. I also know a fair amount of people in CAS who do double majors, so presumably with proper planning you could cut it shorter with one major.

"I read your other post. it sounds like you're leaning towards GT. to address some of your points

- the laundry/gym stuff is like $500/year so idk if that should be a big deciding factor
- applying to clubs is not unique to Cornell. My friends at [big state school] also had to apply to join certain clubs.
- both will give you good job prospects. If you're thinking about ""return on investment"" solely in terms of amount you pay + amount you earn after graduation, then go to GT
- Ithaca has Chipotle, Panera, Five Guys, Walmart, McDonalds, etc. I'm from the suburbs of a major city, and the only thing I really miss is good Chinese food. People keep asking about what there is to do in Ithaca. There's a lot to do, but when you're busy with school, it's hard to make time to leave campus, and you don't really need to because dining halls and convenience stores are a short walk away.
- you can still graduate early if you plan it correctly. If you mention what AP credits you have then I could be more specific about this
- winter sucks, but it's the same where I'm from. If you live 5 hours away from Cornell then I imagine you're used to shitty winters already. It's also understandable that you would want to experience different weather though
- on difficulty - I think Cornell can be difficult but also rewarding

I think some people on the sub are tired of answering the what is there to do in ithaca/is cornell depressing questions. Cornell is not in a major city, but there are still things to do. My personal experience with social life here has been very good (and I'm not involved in greek life), but not everyone can say the same.

"To be honest, I'd call the student experience really diverse. You can get everything from project teams to sororities to intense business clubs to a sword fighting clubs. I know people who are pretty much always in the library and I know people who go out every single day. So, basically, Cornell is a place where you can do pretty much anything and you have to choose what you want to do. The problem is that oftentimes many people do way too much and get overwhelmed or spread themselves too thin and don't foster deep connections or get ""deep"" experiences. You just need to make sure you find the right balance.",1586545234,2,0
"So Cornell is sort of in a unique position. Because campus is more rural we have a lot of natural places to explore the outdoors, hike, swim in lakes, etc. Cornell itself has a lot to do on campus (botanic gardens, swimming pools, bowling alley, rock climbing center (it’s HUGE), basketball courts).

Then of course we have Ithaca itself. It’s a nice town with a lots of restaurants and bars. Right next to Cornell is Collegetown which is a bunch of bars and fraternity houses. Greek life is fun if you enjoy partying and that scene.

There’s also TONS of clubs, from service and business clubs to cultural clubs and sports clubs. Our sports teams are pretty good depending on what you’re looking at. Our hockey team is #1 in the nation for both men’s and women’s, those are a lot of fun to go to.

I should also add that just walking around campus and exploring it is an amazing thing to do. It’s so large, it’s hard to fully see everything without trying. Hope this helps.",1586545048,2,0

"Doing this won’t help you and it might hinder you. An excerpt from Professor Sirer’s page on grad school admissions:



Q: I was about to get a C+ in a computer science course. I am too proud to have a C+ on my transcript, so I asked my professor to fail me outright with an F, so the registrar would allow me to re-take the course. I spent another semester re-taking the course and ultimately got an A-. How would the admissions committee view my case?


A: Negatively, as that was a dumb thing to do. You only have four precious years as an undergrad. You should have been trying to take advanced courses and expand your knowledge at every opportunity instead of going through convoluted hoops for the sake of a grade. Professors in my area want to spend their time with people who are eager to discover new algorithms, design novel protocols and build amazing systems no one has yet dreamed of. Re-treading old material is not something the strong students do, as it is at odds with dedication to true discovery and learning.

I advise you not to do this. I advise whoever gave you this idea in the first place to rethink their advice. And I advise your school's administrators to put in policies to avoid this behavior.",1580092108,1,0

"I was only at Cornell for a year so take this with a grain of salt...
 
Academically, I didn’t really notice a difference in the quality of instruction or anything between the two schools. Note I studied humanities, though.* I do think Brown professors/faculty in general are much more receptive to students and helpful. You could run up to a professor at brown about a whacky independent study project you’ve vaguely considered, and they’ll be willing to jump on board with you and help you out. Independent learning is a big thing there. + Brown has always struck me as way more student-friendly. The staff are responsive to students and will really listen + are there to help you.  +++ The culture is also much chiller. I could get stressed just talking to friends at Cornell. 

Socially, Brown is much more open-minded than Cornell. While this wasn’t a reason for my transferring, it was much easier to be openly gay at brown than it was at Cornell. It’s a non-issue here and very common. 

Where I am now: I am doing a Fulbright in Spain and will be at Harvard law the year following the award. To be honest, I got great opportunities at both schools but made sure to make the most out of them and think that’s why I am where I am. I think to have such an outcome at Cornell, you have to be much more self-sufficient and fend for yourself sort of thing, whereas at Brown I felt supported by both my peers and professors and well plugged into things+opportunities.",1582247491,1,0

"I’ll assume that you aren’t into partying or going to big social events with lots of people. So if you have difficulty meeting people through clubs, parties, etc., then I suggest starting off with the following:

-Go to TA office hours for bigger classes. Generally, courses like linear alg, stats, and organic chemistry will have TONS of office hours held by TAs. You can get to know people by collaborating on problems, asking questions, or even studying together at office hours. You can ask for their name and get their phone number or Facebook so you have a way to contact them! People have asked me for my name and contact info before, and I’ve done the same to other people. I go to office hours consistently and I’ve met the same people before so we can always talk about the work but sometimes talk about other classes and activities. Then outside of office hours, it makes it easy to continue the conversation or form a study buddy. During prelim season, you can ask them to grab a quick meal and then head to library together, or after exams are over you can get a meal and relax and get to know each other :) It does take some confidence but we are at Cornell so making friends and building relationships is super valuable for your well being! 

-Meet people near your dorm or apartment! So if you notice someone sitting in the lounge at night every day then strike up a conversation! Yes, it’s easier said than done but you can really talk about anything. I have had people come up to me in my dorm lounge and ask about a particular t-shirt I was wearing with a city on it, or other times when people wonder if they’ve seen me in lecture before. I’ve introduced myself to my neighbors and in the dorm situation, I’ve bumped into new faces in the kitchen and asked what their name/major/etc. is. When people are washing dishes or prepping their dinner, it’s super easy to ask and get to know people, and they don’t mind since otherwise there would be awkward silence in the kitchen!",1585478493,1,0

"This is a good problem to have. Even though there are lots of factors at play here, I think you have a fairly straightforward (but admittedly emotional) choice to make. If you are more introverted, I would stick to a liberal arts college. On the other hand, Cornell has more people to meet, more activities to do, and larger breadth of classes—great for the extroverted adventurous type. I’m wrapping up my studies as a government major. I found it difficult at times to speak up in front of large classes and meet with busy professors. But this doesn’t mean that faculty members are unapproachable, it just menas that you have to step out of your comfort zone. The introversion versus extroversion is the overarching theme here, and I’ll tackle the rest of your questions point-by-point. 
1.	Could you get an experience similar to CMC at Cornell. It is possible to have a small-college experience but it’s not the norm.  I’ve taken massive classes held in large lecture halls as well as classes with fewer than 10 people—all taught by senior faculty members. A better question may be whether you can get the “Cornell experience” at CMC and the answer is no. Then again, it doesn’t seem like you’re too smitten with the big-college experience anyway. 
2.	How has the cold affected your health? It sucks but I’m from Southern California originally. In the end, getting angry at the weather doesn’t take you very far in life. 
3.	Are people at Cornell upset? It is difficult to generalize. There are many upset people and there are many happy people—I am almost certain that this goes for any school with high-achieving students. But here’s an article that suggests weather is not the decisive factor.  
4.	How competitive are the students? No doubt that people try their best here. But I would not worry about sabotage or an adversarial sort of competition. Nobody treats their education here as a zero-sum game (maybe the engineers have a different opinion). 
5.	Does brand name matter? Maybe it you’re going straight into the workforce at a prestigious (read: morally questionable) consulting firm/investment bank. But if you’re set continuing into graduate studies or professional school, it will not matter. 
A note on location: Claremont/Pomona is less of a town and more of a continued sprawl in Los Angeles county. You’d be living in suburbia and it’s quite a hassle to get to Los Angeles’ entertainment. I used to live at the half-way point between Clarmeont and Los Angeles and I did not like traveling to the former. For me, Ithaca was a nice change of pace and I got to see things I had never experienced before (snowfall, changing fall colors). Maybe the inverse is true for you and CMC—you’d get a taste of what life looks like for the majority of Southern Californians. 
A note on grad school: I’m spoiled for choices between some great grad programs now, and upon reflection, I realize that I had only one faculty member who I could really count on for a great rec letter (you’ll need 3 if you’re applying to PhDs programs). I scrambled to find two more writers in the first semester of my senior year and I was fortunate enough to have two additional faculty members pen letters for me (one writer was a current instructor teaching me in class that hadn’t even wrapped up yet). The point of the story is that faculty members (especially in the Government department) are always willing to help, but the connections may not form naturally unless you dedicate some personal effort. 
Both choices are great, and I hope you learn a lot about yourself in the coming weeks as you come to a decision.",1585462963,1,0

You can estimate the average increase at roughly 2%. Bear in mind that if you're receiving finaid you will not pay more in any future year than you're paying now because your need will remain the same and Cornell meets full need.,1585459924,1,0
"I'm assuming you're in CAS? Imo CAS majors such as IR are going to be pretty closely knit, econ maybe less so because a LOT of people major in econ since it's one of the most employable majors in CAS. It is very easy to build good relationships with both professors and TAs in small programs at Cornell, although there's nothing like a consortium of close by schools that build up resources for you. I strongly disagree with the statement about research. Well I don't disagree, I would say it's incomplete. While in some cases you may have a harder time doing research due to the presence of grad students - notably, not always the case or even I would say a majority of the time in my experience - there's also the trade-off that research areas you are interested in may not be represented at all at a college like CMK. Personally I prefer warm weather to cold weather but I still didn't find the Ithaca weather too bad except on a few days where it got really extreme. I did learn that cold weather is mostly a mental phenomenon though. Students at Cornell are for the most part much more collaborative than competitive in my experience, but I was an engineer and in a very collaborative major. I haven't heard of widespread competition outside of maybe like premed though. As far as whether you should be concerned about the brand name it depends strongly on what you want to do out of college. If you want to go into like finance then yes Cornell would be a significantly better school than CMK and you are probably significantly underrating this aspect. If you want to be a lawyer it doesn't matter at all, and if you want to do politics Cornell is probably a fair bit better still.",1585459853,1,0

However, I can say that my experience here is absolutely positive. I can't say to the difficulty of ILR, but I do know that my friends who are ILR enjoy it. 

Cornell is definitely hard, no shit, but professor office hours exist (and normal OHs). The doors are there, you just need to open them. 

As for the weather and cold. Yes, it does get cold and snowy beginning as early as November and it ends in March for the most part. The SADs really do hit you sometimes, but finding a solid group of friends (whether from clubs or other) really does make the experience better. Nothing better than a friend group to do work and complain together.",1585458362,1,0

Also, once you have a handful of friends, consider putting the effort to make friends with your friends' friends. They might be cool, and since you have at least one friend in common with them, you have a convenient excuse to hang out with them.",1585457524,1,0

"As an ECE major, I can say that Cornell ECE is a really fulfilling program. Since you are interested in Electrical Engineering, I'd predict your potential sophomore/junior year classes to include ECE 3150 (Microelectronics) and ECE 4530 (Analog). I've taken 3150, and it's quite the class. It's hard, but if you put in the work you can do fairly well. There are many roads you can take through ECE ranging from Computer Architecture on the digital side, to Signals, to Semiconductors, to quantum and power electronics.

Feel free to dm if you have any specific questions. (Though, I am more of a ""fake"" CS major)",1585457214,1,0
Applied to all internationals including myself. Rip,1585456690,1,0
"I agree, engineering is inflated not deflated in a strict sense. I do want to point out that USC has a remarkably strong EE program relative to the rest of USC's STEM - they have a lot of stuff that frankly shouldn't be in EE like quantum computing - so imo it is fairly comparable to Cornell's.",1585456576,1,0
"I believe that universal S/U for this semester will be fairer to premeds. At the AAMC virtual med school fair yesterday, a lot of schools had bulletins saying that they strongly recommended/preferred that students who were given the option to take their classes graded did so and did not opt for S/U. So right now, “big red choice” actually does not provide premeds with a choice — if they’d like to be admitted to med school, they must “choose” graded. However, med schools simply cannot penalize students if their undergrad forces them into the S/U grading scheme. Students would not be given a choice then, either, but the s/u grading scheme does an immense amount to level the playing field for pre-meds experiencing infections or difficult home lives with those who did not have these difficulties or tragedies. Similarly, grades will be super arbitrary, as cheating using the internet and FaceTime will be made easy, and different professors will deal differently with grading during a national crisis (grade boosting vs. hard balling). So students who have “earned their grades” may not even have really done that by the end of the semester, though I do recognize that an A is still different than a C.

I could of course be wrong, but I believe that Cornell will recognize all of this and adopt a universal S/U grading scheme once classes resume. Can’t believe I’m saying this, but Martha has done the right thing for students lately with Humec/CPP and COVID.",1585456209,1,0

"I was at the AAMC virtual medical school fair yesterday (an online opportunity to chat with admissions counselors) and many med schools had bulletins that said that if your undergrad gave you an option between graded and S/U this semester, they would strongly prefer that you take all your classes graded, and implied that they would look down upon you opting to take classes S/U.",1585455387,1,0
"In high school nothing is curved (at least in most cases) but tests are pretty easy. At Cornell, especially for STEM, everything is curved, but tests are harder. We definitely do not have grade deflation, I personally would say we have grade inflation, but most would say we are somewhere in the middle. 

It’s hard to pass up the prestige of the Ivy League over other institutions imo, but I think regardless of where you choose, you’ll have more fun and less stress than in HS. USC has great weather, which is a major plus; if Cornell was on the West Coast, I’d argue we would be indisputably the best Ivy, as more people would come. Cornell has a great engineering college and lots of cool clubs too and ECE isn’t as competitive as CS which is nice, so it’s (somewhat) easier to get in to those clubs.",1585455124,1,0
"Definitely but you also do have to work hard. If you are an ECE and you go hard on academics and you also go hard on extracurriculars you will not have that much free time aside from that, depending on HOW hard you go on extracurriculars and research.",1585455097,1,0

"I'll be double majoring in both! The chem major is especially flexible with double majoring since after gen chem/orgo/physics (which all satisfy both bio and chem requirements), you're left with only inorganic (4 credits), one semester of pchem (3 credits but if you decide on the biochemistry concentration, you need 2 semesters instead), and only 8 credits of labs (including the mandated orgo lab). The rest of the chem major are electives, which has a fair amount of options to choose from, many of which are biochem cross-listed.

So TLDR, majoring in both is not uncommon and isn't tham much of a time crunch imo as the chem major offers a lot of overlap with the bio major.",1585454819,1,0

"I'm currently triple majoring, and on track to graduate normally. For me, however, it's been easier than most since two of my majors overlap quite a bit (bio and chem), and my third (French) is only 9 courses. I'm doing the same thing that a friend of mine did, who did successfully graduate last year (bio/chem and a similar 9-course humanities major). That being said, I've effectively never taken an elective course- every course I've taken at this school so far has been either a major requirement/contribution or a graduation requirement (for example, my FWS). I'll be able to take some electives as a senior since I'm almost done with all three majors, but that's also because I've been taking 18+ credits every single semester. So maybe bear that in mind - if you really love what you're doing, it probably won't be a problem, but if it's more for ambition's sake, you might feel burnt out by not having the chance at variety and/or by the workload and rigor that it takes, especially if your disciplines aren't particularly overlapping.

I refuse to believe that in a class where office hour rooms are like Indian busses the highest category for a harder than usual test lies in the A range. The high grades imo come from cheating and extra time. Though I suspect more from cheating than extra time. If all it took was extra time then everyone should get 100s in Hw lmao. But this clearly is not the case as averages for hw in this class are, from what I've heard through this subreddit, are far from 100s.",1588700386,1,0

"Respectfully, this is a rough time for a lot of people and given that the median for this prelim last year was a 56, I’m more upset about the fact that she blamed people for “inadequate preparation” without thinking more deeply about why there might be a huge difference in the distribution (possible collaboration, using sources beyond the textbook and notes like the internet, people having issues with internet connectivity to download and turn in the exam, ppl undergoing family stress, people losing family members.)

If you look at the last 2080 prelim and even 2070 prelims, the curves are much smoother. This semester is in no way an adequate assessment of anyone’s performance. It doesn’t matter if Melissa said it was because of blank answers if she doesn’t consider why that might be and how this distribution just may not be accurate.",1588699480,4,0

"Hi. In STEM classes at Cornell, the tests are pretty hard, so the average grade might be say a 60%. The professors curve the grades so the average is about a B and 1 deviation above the average is an A- or A. 

However, difficult tests usually result in bell curves, not distributions with crazy tails like this or bimodal ones like a post a few days ago showed. Between different test taking environments, different amount of notes, and probably cheating the online testing has been a really different experience. I didn’t take this test so I don’t know if it was open book, timed, etc and can’t really comment on that

"&gt;I sincerely hope the situation is better than that. I think that everyone is seriously discounting the value of an effective treatment.

"Based on the scientific projections outlined in the recent Harvard study, intermittent social distancing may be necessary until 2022! The only way that it will be safe to really have a functioning campus, would be for testing to reach appropriate levels in the US (which...is such a disaster right now), and then for the population to reach the appropriate level of vaccination/immunity—which again is going to take some serious testing, and we haven't even started to reach levels near that, either the immunity or the testing needed to confirm any immunity, as you probably all know. The only way that people might be able to come back to Ithaca would be with some sort of proof-of-immunity clearance from a doctor. But those people are a minority—those who have had exposure and immunity, and the antibody tests aren't even really figured out yet, nor are they very available. (Federal non-coordination is really affecting all of this, obviously). Since the vaccine is not going to be ready and widely available for a while—until 2022, most likely—that means, as far as I can tell, that unless one of the outcomes in the Harvard study proves true (that people after exposure have lifelong immunity), then we are going to have to wait until the ""herd immunity"" moment: whether that's people getting immunity through exposure (ie. having covid19, whether one has symptoms or not) or through the vaccine. And then one has to have the proof of immunity/vaccine to come back to campus.  

There is no other safe way to reopen campus without risking a very dumb situation like what is potentially going down in Georgia and other states that are reopening against the scientific evidence and advice. I read Martha's pointing out the ""risk"" factor as pointing out the obvious; and it doesn't really communicate anything else about plans. Maybe some more people who are essential or doing essential lab studies (these researchers are already on campus, I believe), and can get tested and can appropriately and safely come to campus. But all the undergraduate students? How? This is a historic moment and we are still only coming to terms with just how long this period of time is going to be. It's really sad for the undergrads who are going to miss out on these years and this experience for at least the next year and a half. 

I can only foresee, if the vaccine is really widely available by Spring 2022, that Fall 2022 will be the grand reopening of campus. Though not back to normal, since some coronavirus will be with us every winter forever—but in much smaller numbers, and with better treatments, and more chances with annual vaccines. I'm trying to be as scientific as possible‚ if any science people see flaws I'd love to know. Sorry to really Debby Downer but I'm just trying to figure it all out, too.

But a lot of why 2800 is bad stems from the structure of the class itself. There's just so many topics to cover that you really only gain a surface-level understanding of each topic.

"Warmth is about layers. Get a shell to protect you from the wind and rain and have space underneath for layers.

"1. I don't know if this is true beyond the introductory courses. After 2110/2800, CS classes get a lot smaller. Making 1110/2110 easier would make some sense since those classes attract people who don't want to be CS majors but would benefit from some instruction in programming and very basic CS.

2. Having passion for CS and wanting a good job aren't mutually exclusive. I can't imagine going through the entire CS curriculum and getting a software engineering job without enjoying the material at *some* level. But you'll find that a lot of people are career oriented because not everyone has the luxury of going to college to chase their passions.

3. I'm assuming you mean undergraduate CS. The answer depends on how you define being ""good"" at CS. If all you care about is starting salary, the average is [$105,751](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad/cscareers/placementreport), which is well above the national starting average for CS majors. That figure comes from a survey in which only 34% of grads filled out, so that figure is probably close to what a top 10% student at Cornell can expect to earn. This is comparable to another top CS school like MIT, which is around [$110,247](https://capd.mit.edu/sites/default/files/about/files/GSS2017.pdf). 

4. Beyond intro to programming classes, the focus in upper level CS classes isn't to improve your programming skills. You'll naturally get better at programming through your CS projects of course, but I personally think that you won't be able to get good programming skills through classes alone. Everyone has their own definition of what it means to be a good programmer, but basically everyone agrees that it involves more than just writing code that works. Some skills I think are important are
    1. Writing code that other developers can understand and use
    2. Being able to efficiently write code for a project with goals that aren't fixed and may be constantly changing.
    3. Understanding and handling criticisms of your code by various members of your team, who may or may not be more experienced than you
   4. Being able to constructively critique other people's code without being a dick

   Notice that the skills I listed have less to do with raw technical ability, and are more related to how you interact with other people. Some of these skills you'll learn in the classroom, and some of these skills you probably won't completely develop until after college when you become a software engineer. The CS classes here do a great job of teaching you technical skill, but the people side of software development can't really be learned in the classroom.  There's no best way of picking up these people skills, but you should find some outside projects to work on with other people (either through an internship, club, project team, open source software, etc.)

I sincerely doubt that there's much of a different between top students at Cornell and top students at peer institutions. But if you're interested about how well students at other schools are taught CS, you're better off asking at their respective subreddits.",1589771545,2,0

"I used to be a big believer in ""oh man they made the CS curriculum easier and now it's bs"" but now that I am at the tail end of my CS degree I think it's more subtle than this. 

Of the core classes: CS 2800 is a class that has definitely decreased in difficulty a lot and I personally think some of that was not necessary. CS 3110/3410 have been made somewhat easier, but I think more importantly they've just removed a lot of the annoying/painful parts that don't add to learning but discourage students from continuing with CS. OS and Algo haven't really changed in difficulty over the past few years. Most of the electives have not really changed in difficulty, excluding a few cases where they're trying to make them more rigorous (like AI I think)

I think the truth is that some classes have been made easier but it's not out of a desire to make class sizes larger, but to make CS a less painful experience, while still preserving educational value. Having TAd for a big class before, there are definitely ways classes change to accomodate larger class sizes, but it's more like ways of making it easier to grade and hold office hours for large numbers of students. Sometimes this results in easier/more formulaic homework.

Having done an internship at a reasonably large tech company, I think that being top 10% at Cornell CS definitely makes you a top student relative to other CS programs (not calling myself top 10% because I dont think I am hehe). Good CS students at Cornell are very much comparable to ones at places like CMU or Stanford, as well as smart kids from lesser known schools. 

As far as your programming skills, if you want to get better at software engineering, project teams/outside projects will help you get there faster since most CS classes dont explicitly teach software engineering. However, if you take classes with a lot of programming you will get pretty good at programming just by doing that, and you'll also have some cool specialized knowledge like compilers or graphics or ML to show for it.",1589769183,6,0
"Well, both. You will get better at a certain type of proof-based math and analysis itself is a pretty fun topic. However, in 4410/4710 there is no analysis used so it won't directly help much.

"you would take analysis to get more exposure to more proof-based math or just to learn the content itself? Because I'm definitely going to take it at some point: I'd rather do it after 4410/4710 because my fall schedule is already packed, but if it'll help me out w 4410/4710, ill try to squeeze it in",1589768746,1,0

"You're going to be fine jumping up to 4410 and 4710 after 3320. Combinatorics is a little spicy but 4710 is rather trivial. I would take analysis if you could fit it simply to get the exposure, but it's not that important if you're trying to just study math for the CS applications.",1589768068,2,0
