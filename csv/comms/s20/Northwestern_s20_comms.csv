Don’t know why people are saying mudd is alright it’s usually shit and full because there’s literally 4 (2 for you to use) stalls for all the 100+ students studying there.

These are a little tricky to find but there are 3 nice electric upright pianos off in a little corner of the 2nd floor of the wirtz center.

Contact the office of financial aid! The EFC provided by NU was around 10k more than the FAFSA EFC which was near 0. I called the financial aid office and they helped give me an idea of how they came to that number. They told me that I could send in a special circumstances application and do a monthly expenses report to get a better understanding of where your family’s money goes. After a week or so they recalculated my financial aid and I got a much better package for my first year. Good luck!,1580548253,1,0

Just because they have a formula doesn’t mean they can’t tweak the numbers (as seen with poster). If someone’s being put into crippling debt there’s something the FA is missing (or the family is capable of paying but for whatever reason isn’t),1580485639,1,0
"I wasn't in Medill but I have two recommendations. First, don't get something big or heavy. I lugged my laptop around everywhere and I was so happy I had a lightweight computer. Second, get something with good battery life. Sure, you can usually find a plug in this day and age, but it's nice to not be tethered to an outlet.",1580485600,1,0
"I wasn't in the department but knew a few people in it and I took one non-major class. It's definitely interdisciplinary because I think there are very few classes that are actually listed under the Neuro department. But definitely very, very hard science-heavy from what I could tell. I didn't hear any complaints about the faculty at all. People seemed to love 'em.

And for student shadowing or sitting in classes, I'm not sure there's anything official but I think most professors would be perfectly happy to let you sit in. And if one doesn't, the next one will. You could always email them and copy the admissions department or something if you wanted to be extra haha.",1580485400,1,0
"At least in terms of NU, affording a Canada Goose only really puts you in the top half haha.

Also, I will say, some people do spend a bit extra for things they find important. My grandparents (and therefore my mom, somewhat) were immigrants and solidly lower-middle class but they would save and buy the best on certain items.",1580485133,1,0
"People will make jokes about it some and there may be one or two folks who will judge you for it. But most people won't and if they're judging you for that alone, then fuck 'em. Some people with Canada Goose jackets are great folks, some are pretentious fuckwads. That's true if they had the jacket or not.

Just don't be a pretentious fuckwad and you're good haha.",1580484946,1,0
"I can't answer all of this, but I can answer:

2) Junior year is most common and I think it's the best option. You can't freshman year as far as I know (and I think it'd be a bad idea). Sophomore year you're still finding your place in college. Senior year is senior year and you want to enjoy the time with friends plus have time to job search. So yeah, I think Junior year is the best.

4) This totally depends on the program, so you'll have to ask the study abroad people. Some programs are you and NU students or you and other study abroad people and you're not immersed. Some are totally immersive from what I've heard. I would take a guess that in Australia, you'd be pretty engaged with everyone since there's no language barrier at all.

5) I had two reasons to not do it, personally but I doubt they'll apply. I'll say them anyway. The first was cost. The second was I had a great community at NU and didn't want to leave it / I'm also a creature of habit.

6) There are a lot of cool abroad options that aren't whole academic term things. The classics program used to (and may still) go out to a volcano in Italy for the summer and do some archeological stuff (that's the technical term). That's the only one I can think of off the top of my head, but just keep your ears open for stuff like that. But in terms of actual academic term study abroads, I would think they would all be listed.

That didn't answer your main question though. I would guess you've got a pretty good shot at going where you want to go but that's a total guess.",1580484757,1,0

"If your debt is actually crippling, you should really talk to the financial aid office about increasing your aid for future years.

"Hi there! I’m a current Medill freshman so hopefully I can be helpful. First quarter you don’t need anything special as the main focus for 201-1 is writing for print. As long as your computer can run Microsoft Word or Google Docs you’ll be okay. You might need a better computer for 201-2 (Multimedia Storytelling) because we have to edit audio and video. There’s free premiere pro on the library computers at Main so if you don’t mind walking there then that’s not an issue. I’m not really sure what you’d do for audio but there’s probably a way to do it on those same library computers. Personally I used the library computers to edit video for a publication I’m a member of and it was totally fine, the only thing you have to remember is to save your work to google drive because it gets deleted when you log out.

Thank you! That’s very helpful! It is annoying that they assume this familiarity — it definitely makes it harder for any non-engineering students to take a McCormick class. Math 310 seems like the best option for me.,1582257267,1,0
"If you're planning on doing Kellogg FE, I'd strongly recommend taking math 314, 310, 311, or stat 320-1. I've heard that ie 202 is insufficient prep for econometrics. 

If you're planning on Kellogg MA, I'd still probably lean towards taking stat 320-1,2 and stat 350 as a WCAS student. 320 requires zero programming and in 350 all the code you need is given to you, whereas ie 202, 303, and 304 will probably require a bit more time coding. 

Either way, since you're through calc, you'll have time to get all the prereqs done by the end of next year if you start next fall. If you really want to get started on upper level prereqs for Kellogg MA next quarter though, I recommend taking math 368, which should be a relatively straightforward course if you're comfortable with linear algebra and calculus.",1582255899,1,0

Just take math 310-1, 311-1, 314, or stat 320-1 in the fall--that way you won't get sidelined by any random Matlab examples popping up, and you won't have to deal with reading week classes. 

Either way, the math won't be an issue--230-2 and 228-2 teach the same material, and if you can set up a double integral, you've hit the math prereq needed for all of ie 202, math 310-1, 314, or stat 320-1.",1582252682,1,0

I live south tho and all my classes are in tech(building that most stem classes are in and is north campus)  and had one class south last quarter, and the 12-15 min walk is a little tedious, but is super worth it cuz having downtown Evanston right there is really nice.

"Chose the  one you look better as, if that makes sense. Are you better at hard sciences (ie grades in stem classes, stem subject tests, AP tests, etc)? have you taken psych in hs, grade in that? relevant extra curriculurs, etc. If your application looks better through the lens of being a psych major, do that, if it looks better through the lens of neuro, do that. 

Remember though that it legit has no meaning besides being one question on the app. You are admitted undeclared, and until you declare (as late as end of sophomore year), you can tell people/clubs etc you are majoring in psych one day, decide at 2 am that night you dont care about psych, and say you are gonna major in econ or whatever the next day. 

Honestly though, in terms of admission it will make minimal to zero impact. They look for a diverse student body (in terms of strengths, experiences, activities etc, not just race by any means), and the major you select will not change the story you present to them. Your essays, activities, etc will still be the same.

"International grad student here, trying to answer your bullet points in order:

- I live in an apartment off-campus at a 10-15-minute-walk distance. Rent is $1,400 per month and can house 2 people. This seems to be the average price (on the lower end, though) in the area right next to the campus, from what I gathered when searching.

- Around $75 of utilities (electricity + gas) per month in winter, $45 in summer. Water is included in the rent. Internet is $80 per month for good speed (not excellent, not bad, just good). Easily sharable with other apartments (what I do). I end up paying $20 myself. Mobile is $40 for unlimited texts/calls and 10 Go of data (T-Mobile). I honestly haven't delved into all the plans available and compared other providers so you probably can do better than this.

- I walk to the campus. To go to Chicago, it's a $2.50 train fare, and the same to come back. There are passes available but I don't know the exact way of obtaining them.

- Good, healthy food is expensive. I feel like I can't really help on that one but I also cook myself, all sorts of things. Generally involving steaks and fish and veggies. So I end up paying for over $80 per week. You can go by with much cheaper than this with pasta and rice. I know I'm an oddball for this so I won't expand too much.

- NU insurance is $4,000 and mandatory unless you already have one that covers everything they need. You won't.

I actually was given the option to test out of those classes—even if you don’t know the language, if you know the programming concepts it seems like you can get out of it. Racket is a really weird programming language, but it involves functional programming, imperative programming, and recursion, so if you’ve dealt with all that you’re good to go.

Thank you for your interest!

A few things first:

• Northwestern has a few different schools — McCormick (engineering), Weinberg (arts and sciences), SESP (education and social policy), Communications, Radio/TV/Film, and Bienen (music). There are many roads to finance, but the most notable are Industrial Engineering (McCormick) and MMSS (Weinberg). 

• Northwestern also has pre-business programs open to many majors, such as the Kellogg Certificate in Financial Economics and the Business Institutions minor.  

• Because Northwestern is on the quarter system, double majoring is very common — Econ/Cs is a very doable combination, and some can even tack on a data science minor/Kellogg Certificate. Students can use this flexibility to differentiate themselves. 


1. How good is IB recruiting (Pref for NYC offices) at Northwestern University? Do most people land good IB internship in NYCs?

Any response  to this is going to be anecdotal and controversial, as there is no perfect way to objectively answer. Do major banks recruit here? Yes.  I recommend that you check out [a poets and quants survey ](https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/2018/05/21/top-feeder-schools-to-wall-street/) on this — its from 2018. You’ll see that, while we get people on Wall Street, it’s in lower numbers than Cornell. Many people believe that this is related to interest (We are much more of a consulting school) and location (Being in Chicago is a notable disadvantage for NYC IB), but if you work hard and take advantage of student organizations/career resources, you should have no problem landing the same NYC IB job yoo would have at Cornell.



2. What are the best majors to major in for IB at NU? Is the econ major grade deflated/inflated?

Majors: MMSS, Industrial engineering, applied math, economics, computer science

Minors: Business institutions, data science 

Certificates: Kellogg Financial Economics 


3. Lastly, given that NU is near Chicago, do NU students do part-time finance internships in Chicago throughout the school year? If so, what types of firms/positions recruit for these part-time roles?

We have something called the [Chicago field studies ](https://www.internships.northwestern.edu/cfs-concentrations/internships/banking-private-equity-financial-services.html) program that allows you to have an internship during the school year — some destinations include UBS, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs. 

I apologize in advance for the barrage of questions. just very interested in NU!

It’s good that you are seeking out information. However, I advise that you pay attention to the campus culture as well. While Northwestern is a great school with fantastic career prospects upon graduation, many people are unhappy here. There isn’t much hand-holding, and it’s easy to feel alone. Make sure NU works for you.

"Hi there, I am a 23 y/o sophomore/junior and very honestly I want to tell you to reconsider coming here if finding people your age and maturity level is important to you. It is important to me, and if I had any idea how monolithic, young, and highly traditional the NU student body is, I would never have come here. 

It sounds like you haven't been in a college setting before, although I shouldn't assume. My experience in college as a slightly older student is that there is a *very* significant developmental difference between 18-20 and 23 (and especially 18 and 24 -- most of your classes will be with only freshmen). People will tell you it's fine and not a big deal and it doesn't make a difference if you're older, but that's 100% false for me -- in my experience, the relationships you can have with 18 year olds at 23 are fairly unidirectional; you may be very interesting to them, but you will have trouble finding relationships with reciprocity. 

For me, the experience is also complicated as someone who has taken time off, gone to school part-time, and had a number of different battles with life that most 18 year olds here who just finished high school can frankly not identify with. If you have had a non-traditional path in ways beyond being older, and if you feel that has defined you, then like me you may feel particularly isolated at a school like Northwestern where most students' greatest challenge was keeping a 3.99 GPA and a great number of students will scratch their heads and look at you wide-eyed as they realize for the first time that not everybody on the planet starts college at 18 and graduates in 4 years. 

N=1, but I have not met a single undergraduate student my age since starting college here (this fall). 

I also thought that I could befriend graduate students, thereby meeting people more in my age range. Well, that hasn't happened -- I don't know where all the grad students are, but they obviously aren't in undergraduate classes, or attending undergraduate clubs and events, so it's not clear to me where exactly you could meet them. Most graduate students, from my impression, are exactly eager to get out and meet undergraduates (even the older ones). 

Culturally, I also find Northwestern a very frustrating place to be an older student because the people, systems, and rules here can be infantilizing in a way they were not at my previous school (big and urban). Definitely life off-campus if you can, because on-campus has strange rules (like forcing you to vacate your room for a month over winter break) that may make sense for your average 18-year-old freshman but make zero sense (actually, a negative amount of sense -- like negative infinity sense) for a more independent older student. 

In my honest opinion, if you haven't already committed, take a look at some other great options that have big non-trad student bodies (trying not to identify myself completely here, but DM me if you'd like suggestions). Northwestern can be a socially mind-numbing place if you don't fit into one very specific profile.",1579663422,1,0

I assume because you are in this subreddit that you value education and do agree with me that reliable sources are really important - you even state that we should educate ourselves. I'll strive to provide sources to help everyone reading this do so. Please, don't just listen to what people say and do your own research! {TLDR AT THE BOTTOM}

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing we need to clear up. This Coronavirus? Is not the flu.  [https://www.sciencealert.com/the-new-coronavirus-isn-t-like-the-flu-but-they-have-one-big-thing-in-common](https://www.sciencealert.com/the-new-coronavirus-isn-t-like-the-flu-but-they-have-one-big-thing-in-common) Coronavirus is a new type of virus - AKA, nobody is immune before they catch it. They are, however, quite similar except that as far as I can tell, there is an additional route of transmission for COVID-19 compared to the flu, and it tends to be much more dangerous.  It's not a flu virus. [https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-disease-2019-vs-the-flu](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-disease-2019-vs-the-flu) 

&amp;#x200B;

You are right - there's tons of flu virus strains, but the thing is? We know that. We have vaccines that at least somewhat work, and its been around a while so a lot of the time, we have some immunity to it. We dont with this new virus. And I believe the WHO said it's not the same thing as the flu, so I mean. You can google cause I'm writing this in pieces and don't wanna go find a source. 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as it being more dangerous - According to UChicago, \~20% of people who get this may need to be hospitalized. [https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/prevention-and-screening-articles/wuhan-coronavirus](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/prevention-and-screening-articles/wuhan-coronavirus) 

&amp;#x200B;

As I'm sure we are aware, numbers are still changing, research being done, to get more precise numbers, so I do understand if that number is a little iffy to some. However, it is \*not\* just limited to older people. According to the Norwegian Institude of Public Health ( [https://www.fhi.no/en/id/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/dags--og-ukerapporter/daily-reports-COVID19/](https://www.fhi.no/en/id/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/dags--og-ukerapporter/daily-reports-COVID19/) ), the average age of cases is 46.2 years. Which means it is dangerous still to those under not elderly (at least, I wouldn't call anyone really under 60 elderly). Granted, this doesn't say only elderly people get it, and again, according to UChicago, lots of people (even if not 20%!) will need to be hospitalized if they get it. Apparently in New York \~17% of coronavirus cases have required hospitalization.

&amp;#x200B;

As a side note, that many hospitalizations? Means our hospitals won't be able to keep up. I suggest you look into the current situation with the hospitals in Italy for this concern. What we \*need\* to be doing is slowing the spread to make sure that doesn't happen here. I don't know about you, but I greatly care about my friends and family, and I, as well as others I know, are in the at risk category. We are your TAs, your professors, your classmates. We need to practice the recommendations from the CDC and WHO asap and make sure we aren't the disease vector that kills other people.

&amp;#x200B;

I read recently that someone said that it'll be impossible to know if we did too much. But if we don't do enough, we'll know. And... I can only speak for myself, but I would much, much rather overreact and fewer people die, than underreact and have millions die (and yes, you can look this up, millions are projected to die with some of the models/calculations being done with lack of action being taken).

&amp;#x200B;

So far, data has shown that it isn't as affected as the flu by warm weather. It's a coronavirus, not a flu virus, and it's a new one, too, which means it'll spread more easily either way. Coronaviruses are a little bit affected by warm weather but you can read this to get a good summary ( [https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/will-covid-19-go-away-on-its-own-in-warmer-weather/](https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/will-covid-19-go-away-on-its-own-in-warmer-weather/) ). \[The tl;dr? Probably not going away in warmer weather\].

&amp;#x200B;

So! Now onto the comparison to the swine flu. I don't mean to get political here, at all, so my point in linking this article is \*not\* politics, but more the fact that they're comparing numbers which may be useful for some readers.  [https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trumps-h1n1-swine-flu-pandemic-spin/](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trumps-h1n1-swine-flu-pandemic-spin/) If you directly compare the numbers, I'm going to say, no duh. This pandemic? Still in the ramping up process. Swine flu? Process already done and handled. And it wasn't more fatal, unfortunately. Swine flu I believe had a fatality rate under a percent for this last round. Though, of course, there are differences in this depending on where you are in the world, how your health care is, and frankly, not everyone knows they had it due to mild cases.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3809029/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3809029/) 

&amp;#x200B;

Side note, and I'm aware I'm rambling, is that this stuff spreads exponentially. (Have you seen the example with the lily pads? I love it. If you have one lily pad and a huge giant lake and they double each day... let's say it takes 48 days to fill. At what point is half the lake full? 47. Pretty sure at day 40 there still aren't too many lily pads compared with lake surface area). So, it'll gradually get worse, early action helps.

&amp;#x200B;

OK so giant TLDR because I ended up rambling because this matters to me.

Coronavirus is not the flu. Different family of viruses.

It's a new virus. One we don't have immunity to, and frankly are still learning about/have no vaccines for.

This virus (not a strain of flu) has let's be conservative and say a 15-20% chance of hospitalizing the person who gets it. Sure, maybe this is affected by age. But do you, dear reader, want to be the reason a friend goes to the hospital? The reason your SOs parent dies? Some italian doctors are warning that more young people are being admitted to the hospital as time goes on, too. So... Do you value yours, your friends lives? (I assume the answer is yes, I'm merely making a point. I know you do!) Remember, even if \*you\* don't get very sick from it, your classmate might. Your TA might. Your grandmother or father might. It's our responsibility as a human race to take care of each other and be compassionate during this time.

We can't compare H1N1 directly, since the numbers we have for that are once it's over. Coronavirus? Just getting started, sadly. And people died during the swine flu, too. Don't we want to prevent that as much as possible?

Lastly, it's unlikely to disappear in warmer weather. It's spreading decently well from what I know in the southern hemisphere, and since its a new virus, it'll spread more easily. Also not a flu.

Recommendations from someone who has spent way too much time researching this? Stay home if you can. Even if you aren't at risk, the people around you, your family, very well could be. Wash your hands, practice social distancing. And don't panic. Quarantines will keep people alive, we'll make it through this. You don't need to hoard toilet paper.

&amp;#x200B;

Some offer a million sections on various day combos, some are all the same and if you need the class you don’t have much of a choice 

For example, next quarter, three of my classes are Tuesday Thursday, and I did have space to fit a fourth in Tuesday Thursday. But 1) I know I would die from going to class 8-3 2) none of the classes offered at the one time slot I had open filled any requirement I needed (ie a distrito) and were still interesting to me.

"Isn’t it biased to ask this question here...? Do have to say NU does not have as many courses for finance careers compared to many other business undergrad programs (Ross BBA, NYU Stern, etc.) but being at a high ranking school says you’re smart and is often a better advantage than having a business degree at other undergrad schools. Also, explore in college. Don’t be dead set on finance this early. It’s really your last few years to truly pursue knowledge. 

If ur into banking/ PE/ asset management. A lot of the learning and networking will have to come from joining clubs like the Investment Management Group (IMG), Investment Banking Club (IBC). These clubs are selective but great resources. People who place well aren’t the ones that take the business classes, but the ones that learn by themselves the most. Also, it is worth noting NU is a much bigger consulting target school than banking. 

If ur into quant, NU is very lacking in having those technical classes, look elsewhere. 

I think overall, if ur smart, which u seem to be, going to higher ranked school will be a better choice because recruiters do care abt that. Also, Cornell seems kinda like a miserable place to be geographically.",1585465854,1,0
"For business and finance, you have a few good major options at NU:

• Econ Major: We have the [7th ranked](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/economics-rankings) economics major in the US. Economics is also among our largest departments, and we offer a BA/MA program and an honors program for top students.

• MMSS: [We offer a highly-selective ](https://www.mmss.northwestern.edu) program that allows undergrads to combine mathematical training with a social science (econ, political science, etc...) — this is very sought after by grad schools, and by financial firms as well.

• LOC: The School of Education and Social Policy offers a Major in [Learning and Organizational Change](https://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/ugrad/learning-and-organizational-change/), which can be very business-related and is often used as a pre-consulting Major.

• IEMS: The McCormick School of Engineering offers a Major in [Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/). This includes coursework in optimization, operations research, and financial engineering. 

Note that it is very easy to switch between schools at NU, or take coursework in other schools. 

In terms of minors and certificates:

• Kellogg Certificates in Financial Economics and Management Analytics: The Kellogg Business School offers pretty advanced undergraduate certificates in Financial Economics and Management Analytics. [These are pretty competitive ](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/certificate.aspx) to get into, but admissions are largely number-driven and therefore predictable. I believe that this offers additional career services as well.

• Business Institutions: Relatively detailed coursework in accounting, marketing, and other business or finance-related fields. This is a minor that anyone can pick up, without much restriction. 

In addition, we have a wide assortment of finance and business related clubs — IMG, Northwestern Capital Management, Investment Banking Club, etc...

In terms of recruiting, I’ve heard that we do *very* well in terms of major consulting firms, and *very* well in terms of Chicago finance in general. For NY finance, Cornell is *probably* more of a target, though I doubt the opportunity difference is significant.

"I was in the same position one year ago and I'm so glad I chose Northwestern CS over USC CS.  Feel free to message me if you want. Now, I want to be clear in saying there's no wrong choice here. I toured both schools before deciding, and I realize that may be hard to do now, but it was really helpful. USC's computer science department outranks Northwestern's on any list right now and USC boasts an amazing entrepreneurship culture that will give it an edge in recruiting for Silicon Valley. Moreover, when I toured USC, it was really cool to hear about the opportunities that students are given access to by virtue of the school's location such as early movie screenings on campus (They got to see End Game a week early and meet the actors), and even going to Conan &amp; Kimmel for a class. 

That being said, I don't regret choosing Northwestern over USC. I would suggest looking up the clubs offered at the schools and see which you'd be interested in joining and consider which culture you'd fit better with. Evanston is more of a suburb that won't give you the same city vibe as USC but will have the charm of the Midwest. Northwestern is also heavily greek dominated and relies on a more established reputation which will have a different feeling than the up and coming nature of USC. I'd consider all of that when deciding where to attend.",1585455766,1,0

"(assuming you're talking University of Southern California and not South Carolina here)  
  
First, USC and NU are two *vastly* different schools, culturally and location wise. What is making you consider the both of them? Where are you from originally? I'm generally of the opinion that people can be happy at multiple schools, but what those multiple schools are depends on what you want to get out of college.  
  
Talking strictly program-wise - the NU CS department is pretty good. Not in the Carnegie Mellon / MIT / Berkeley stratosphere like you said, but pretty good. I work in tech (and did CS at NU), and overall the trend in the college -&gt; industry pipeline is that enrollments in CS departments are exploding. And a lot of these kids are talented kids who 10 years ago would have done finance, pre-med, or pre-law but see that you can make $$$ in tech without grad school or crazy hours. The end result of this is that elite schools, even ones without a history of a great CS department, are pumping out really qualified new grads that are going to great companies. Search LinkedIn for NU CS grads and you'll see that you're not limited in any way...lots of kids at the Googles/Amazons of the world. If you're looking at this strictly as a placing into big tech decision, unless you're deadset on living in LA, I would bet NU is better at placing in SF/NYC/Chicago.  
  
Your case is interesting especially because of Medill. NU has a program called the [Knight Lab](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/) that is pretty unique. It deals with the intersection of journalism and tech, and many people who participate go on to work in places such as New York Times, Washington Post, 538...If that kind of work interests you, NU is a clear cut ahead here.  
  
TL;DR - if you are interested in going into tech, culture, location and financial aid should be the first thing you look at here, as they'll make a bigger difference than the difference between the two programs. However, in a vacuum, I would take NU's CS program and placement over USC. In addition, NU's program for journalism/CS combo is a really unique draw.",1585441980,1,0
"It's true that NU isn't really known for CS, but I won't be surprised if that changes in the next few years. It's growing very quickly in popularity, and they've been hiring new faculty. They also recently split Electrical Engineering and Comp Sci into two separate departments. 

I don't know much about USC's program, but I believe that NU's is pretty good. I've had some really good professors here, and the department heads are very competent and passionate about expanding/improving the program. Like the other poster said, it could depend on what specifically you're interested in - our Systems and AI are pretty good, with HCI not quite as much.",1585441915,1,0
"I like Northwestern’s CS program, but it depends on what subfield you are interested in. As someone who likes Systems/CompE adjacent stuff, I’ve had a large selection of good classes to choose from. Some of my friends who are more into stuff like HCI had trouble finding a lot of classes they care about, and ended up taking a lot of independent study/research credits to fill out their major, which is also cool. 

Speaking of research, the department has a lot to offer there, and are actively encouraging undergrads to participate, which I highly recommend.",1585441492,1,0

Personally I don't really see not being in a frat having a big effect on social life. Almost every single organization on campus has some kind of relationship with alcohol, and most frats are decently liberal with who they let in to parties if big parties are your style. Also by the end of freshman year, you will probably know enough people in different frats and clubs that you can party in many different places. By that point you will likely have made up your mind on what people you enjoy hanging out with the most, and you will probably spend more time with them.

"I’ll try to give you as objective an answer as I possibly can, though naturally, some of my opinions might make their way into this response. 

• Student life

     Student life is varied — I don’t think I can pigeonhole a “Northwestern experience” or a “Northwestern student” into a single stereotype. We have only about 8,000 undergrads, and yet, we have engineers, actors, musicians, journalists, pre-med students, pre-law students, pre-finance students, etc... all on one campus. Not only are we academically diverse, we are socially diverse as well —  we have the North Campus hard-partying, Greek life-loving, sports-following student, and South Campus artistic, quieter, somewhat counter-cultural student. We also have students who fall in between these extremes, and students who do not match either. There is simply no way to generalize. That said, I’ve found that the student body is somewhat fragmented socially, and overall “student unity” is pretty poor. Nevertheless, if you find your people (which most students do), you’ll have make-your-own-adventure fun.  

• Faculty

    We have sophisticated course-evaluations (CTECs) that let students see very detailed, largely uncensored ratings of every single course by former students. You’ll 100% know how hard students found a course, what they liked and didn’t, and how helpful the faculty member teaching the class was. For the most part, you will be able to select faculty that you like, and have a great experience. Anecdotally, all of my professors have been fantastic, and yes, *extremely* supportive. That said, like at literally any school, there are supportive professors and unsupportive professors. But fortunately, Northwestern makes it unusually easy to pick out the good ones. 


• Competitive

      I do not think that NU is known to be especially cutthroat, but it is not known to be especially relaxed either. It is not known to be overly inflated (in terms of grades), and it is not known to be overly deflated. Some classes curve to a B, others hand out plentiful As. The competitiveness of your experience will depend more on your major, courses, and professional goals than on the school you attend. That said,  anecdotally speaking, I do not think NU is supposed to be as culturally competitive as many of its peers.


• Resources 

     NU has *so many* resources for those who need it. Academic, financial, psychological, career-related, recreational, etc... this is where the $11 billion endowment shows. People will complain at every school, but in this area, Northwestern students are very fortunate.


Luckily, you’re deciding between two extremely well-regarded institutions. Know that your experience will not be defined by the name on your degree, but by the classes you take, people you meet, and organizations you join. If your heart is telling you to make one choice, make that choice. Any minimal difference in prestige is not going to matter whatsoever. Best of luck deciding!",1585352917,3,0

I’ve found the engineering faculty (after the general engineering classes) to be super lovely, accessible, and helpful people. I’m an IE major though so I’m not sure about BME. But McCormick was the first school to make all finals optional given the COVID situation, and the rest of the university had to do the same because McCormick did first. I think that’s indicative that the engineering school really does care about student wellbeing.

In terms of the academic resources, I know they exist, but sometimes they’re a bit harder to find that they should be. If you make sure to ask professors/advisors/deans, they will connect you to a free tutor or tell you who to go to. I wouldn’t say it’s the easiest process but there are ways.

"McCormick freshman here.

From my experience, Northwestern can be uniquely rigorous, but seems to be particularly *non-competitive* in comparison with some peer schools.

While the Quarter System has its perks (More classes, easier to double major/take a quarter off/go abroad/graduate early/explore other fields without falling behind, one class won’t make or break your GPA, etc...), 3 quarters can mean 150% as much testing, 1 additional reading week, and 1 additional finals week, which means you’ll spend more time taking tests and less time on break. This, coupled with the increased difficulties that falling behind in a quarter system entails, means that the academic format at NU is more challenging than it would be at a standard semester system school. This doesn’t mean that the material is different, it just means that the way it is administered is different. [The average Greek Life GPA](https://www.northwestern.edu/fsl/resources/grade-reports/assets/academic-report-fall-2019.pdf) seems to be ~3.5, so I would assume engineering is slightly lower. This is probably on par with Princeton, though much lower than most Ivies.

*All that said,* I have found NU to be far less competitive than my high school. Some reasons for that might be:

• Diverse interests. As another commenter said, it’s hard to compare a biomedical engineer to a violinist to a journalist. In a place with abundant double major students, you’ll often be comparing a “math major with a political science minor and a Kellogg Certificate” to an “IEMS major with a CS minor” to a “communications-philosophy dual degree student.” It’s just not apples to apples. 

• Cultural factors. Many students choose NU over UChicago for a reason. In a place with a large Greek Scene, Big Ten Sports, a vibrant theater/arts scene, and many kids gunning for consulting rather than grad school, it feels like more of a social school/work-life balance kind of place than many of its peers. I think that NU attracts a certain type of student — the type that is smart and hardworking, but doesn’t devote their life (or their self-worth) to achievement in a particular niche of academic study.

• Location. I’m a New Yorker. I’ll admit, New York is stressful — life is fast-paced, money is paramount, and people don’t have time for you — ok, maybe that’s a stereotype, but you get the idea. A disproportionate number of NU students come from the Midwest, which (anecdotally) seems slower, more friendly, and less cutthroat. While these are *generalizations* that are not true for everyone, I do believe coastal vs midwestern culture plays a difference.


If I were in your shoes, I’d ask myself what I wanted to study, what culture made me happier, which pre-professional ambitions I had in mind, and how important cost was to me. 

I’m not going to lie: Princeton is more prestigious, and as a massive nerd who has gone to ~3 parties in my life, I’m jealous of my friends who go there. But NU is a phenomenal school too, and you’ll have a plethora of opportunities at either school.

Best of luck!",1586490737,1,0

"I can’t speak to the cost differential — if that is very important for you, definitely go to Princeton and don’t have any regrets about it. 

I love Northwestern. People do love going to sports events, partying, tailgating, the whole shebang, and Greek life is a pretty relevant part of the campus culture. Spring quarter is always the most fun, the campus is beautiful, and school spirit is pretty high. We always put on the football games in my dorm lounge and stuff like that. The community vibe is fantastic. 

The truth is that at either institution, your perception of the “stressiness” will depend entirely on who you’re friends with. I came from a high-pressure, very rigorous high school, and made a point of befriending people who were less crazy about grades. I also make a point of never sharing my grades or test scores explicitly with my friends, and for the most part they mirror that back to me. It has been a big relief. 

Of course, a lot of people still carry that stress culture here— notably, pre-meds or pre-laws who need crazy GPA’s for grad school— but I think you’re much less likely to find that here than at Princeton. Plus, there’s so much diversity between majors and colleges within Northwestern that nobody really cares how they compare to anybody else. What’s the point of comparing an engineer to a music major? I don’t think people really do that. 

You are choosing between two amazing schools, and you‘re conscious of the kinds of things you want from your campus experience; that’s the first step to finding those things, no matter which place you choose. You cannot go wrong here. Good luck to you, and PM me if you have any other questions!

UMass’s intro classes were way harder than NU’s, and this was after doing AP Java. But that’s probably because they were trying to weed people out of the (competitive and good) CS major. I felt like the tests in the intro classes at NU were more fair. There were some crazy questions at UMass. 

I have gotten much better grades in my CS classes at NU. Obviously I did better at the 2 intro classes (111 and 211, which I took bc I didn’t know the languages) bc of prior experience, but I also did very well in the harder classes last quarter.

In freshman year I would get distracted and use my computer during class and then sometimes not catch up on lectures until weeks later (in 220 and 240). I think I would have done better with the good habits I have now. Funny that I managed to transfer with B’s in all my CS classes lmaooooo

Anyway I’d say UMass CS might be a biiiiit harder but maybe due to less support? We have way more office hours here. 

Last thing is that NU is overall much harder. I had much more free time at UMass. The quarter system is brutal and fast-paced, but I like it that way :))",1586403604,1,0

I would consider if you would prefer the core curriculum at Columbia vs being able to chose distros at NU. The core is what turned me away from Columbia tbh

Northwestern has a great econ program with tons of great opportunities and connections. You can also make your experience here whatever you want in terms of fun. So many people like to do so many things, and there is no doubt that while NU students really value their academics above everything, they definitely make time for fun!! Greek life is the center of the social scene imo, but tons of people have amazing college experiences outside of Greek. NU is a “work really hard, play really hard” kind of school, at least in my experience!!",1586398897,2,0

"In terms of reputation, the order goes: Columbia, UChicago, Northwestern, but the differences in prestige are small enough that they won’t really matter (USNEWS, the de facto official college ranking service, ranks Columbia at #3, UChicago at #6, and Northwestern at #9).

In terms of [economics,](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/economics-rankings) Northwestern and UChicago are tied and actually both ranked above Columbia, though common knowledge suggests that UChicago has historically had the strongest economics department of the three, with Northwestern a (debatable) second.

That said, if Wall Street is what you’re going for (and by this you mean literal Wall Street, as opposed to finance in general, which exists in Chicago as well as NY), Columbia is the most heavily-recruited simply on the merit of location alone. Similar opportunities for Northwestern and UChicago are comparable, with the edge for MBB going to NU and the edge for IB going to UChicago. 

For what it’s worth, [Columbia](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/compare/2711-1739/cornell-university-vs-northwestern-university?xwalk_id=147767&amp;xwalk_id=144050&amp;xwalk_id=190150) graduates earn the most, followed by Northwestern and then UChicago. 

Further, there is a cultural difference between all three of these schools. Do you prefer a more traditional college culture with Greek Life and sports? Northwestern might be the right school for you. Do you prefer a culture that is more city-centric and not really based around the campus as much? Columbia might be the best option. Do you consider the “life of the mind” to be paramount and the defining factor of college social life? Stereotypically, that would be UChicago.

You have three great choices. 
Don’t let the negativity on this reddit away you — from my experience, people at NU have a better view of the school than Reddit does.

Best of luck deciding!",1586388286,1,0

"I did mine in EECS, starting back in 2008. Based on my experiences, your happiness is dependent on your relationship to your peers and your advisor, your personal tolerance for long hours, stress, uncertainty, and frustration, and the stability of your personal, school-independent situation. Past year one, there's no unifying structure to grasp on to, apart from meetings with your group/advisor and classes that you may be TA-ing. It's easy to let your research become your entire world, to the detriment of your relationships , your sense of connection to the world, and your health. Once things get busy, it's tempting to let healthy habits fall by the wayside, especially maintaining a sleep schedule, diet, and exercise. They take time, and time is a precious resource. The realization that every second you spend ""off the clock"" is just getting added to the end of your graduation timeline can lead to a sense of guilt when blowing off steam or socializing, or even taking care of your basic mental and physical health, which in turn leads to more stress and anxiety. In truth, achieving healthy work-life balance under these conditions is difficult. I didn't find a healthy balance, if I'm being honest. You will be surrounded by peers who are running themselves ragged. Chances are, your advisor is doing the same, to some extent. There will be a lot of social support and even peer pressure for negative behavior. In that environment, waking up at 2PM, eating half a cold pizza, and then sitting in a dark room at your computer until 6AM can begin to feel like a normal day. Something to be proud of, even. You're on your own to manage this.

Socializing on campus in general is not the same for PhD students as it is for Undergrads. Lots of PhD students have young families or are just trying to put their heads down and finish. Also, there are substantially fewer of you, compared to the Undergraduate class. Furthermore, I found most on-campus/school sanctioned social events, when they did exist, were borderline painful to attend. Your mileage may vary, but I spent almost no time engaging with people outside my lab that weren't direct collaborators or neighbors in my building. This isn't necessarily an issue unique to Northwestern. I was also married at the time and didn't live in Evanston. I was also in a big lab group that was fun and social, so I was therefore less compelled to look outside that group. I spent much of my limited free time exploring Chicago with my labmates who I became friends with. Obviously, the weather in Chicago sucks compared to many other places you could have done your PhD, but it's not that bad. You get used to it.

Independent of your social situation, year 2 can be really rough. We used to refer to that as the ""dark period"" in my lab. It's when you roll off of coursework, if you have any, and purely into research. At this point, everything is up to you, but you don't really know what you're doing yet. If you're bad at managing yourself or need external cues to set your schedule, it's easy to get lost here and spiral. Remember why you're there, enforce healthy habits, and don't be afraid to ask for help.",1586373985,1,0
"I'm very surprised that people are glossing over the location difference, which I think is really the defining difference between the two universities.

Sure, Northwestern has Kellogg and the Garage. But so what? Berkeley has the Haas business school (which is very prestigious) and like someone else mentioned, I would be shocked if Berkeley doesn't have a startup incubator/facility on campus. In fact, I would bet good money that their startup scene is better established than at Northwestern. Take one visit to the Bay Area and how pervasive the tech startup culture is and it's kind of a given.

So what's the deal with location? Simple, really. ""Proximity to Silicon Valley"". I think it's borderline criminal that people don't think this is that significant. Don't get me wrong, like wyetro, I too, was a CS major and know a lot of peers who went on to Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc, etc. I'm not saying that it's impossible to land some dream job in silicon valley if you go to Northwestern. **But you will absolutely have an absurdly easier time getting that gig in silicon valley as a Berkeley student.** Location plays a highly underrated role in job/internship hunting. 

* Companies will have a larger, physical recruiting presence in local universities, meaning you can actually talk face to face with a recruiter and show that you're an actual human being, rather than spamming applications into the online portal black hole. Also, there will just be more companies, period.
* Much higher chance (especially with Berkeley) that you can talk to a professor or two who actively collaborate, work, or run companies in the area. Again, the whole talking face to face thing.
* You are literally in the middle of it all, and you will be better informed and up to date on what's going on in the tech scene. Whether that be the latest unicorn startups, the latest google mad scientist project, etc.
* If you get recruiters contacting you (unlikely but possible. Becomes common once you get your first job.) then they will more likely be from pertinent companies and/or have interesting positions.

Again, this is something that you learn and becomes a bit easier to comprehend with experience. Hunting for a job in a particular city/area is **much** easier if you are actually there. Local candidates are objectively more appealing to companies (assuming roughly similar quals and skills). 

But this location isn't all sunshine and daisies. If you absolutely do not want to work in silicon valley, then Berkeley's location is meaningless to you. In the same vein, Berkeley is also **very** liberal and has a very distinct vibe and culture that is influenced by its history, the local tech culture, and a smattering of other factors. It doesn't mesh well with a lot of people, and might mean that you have a miserable time there. Though Northwestern is also liberal, I would hazard a guess and say that we have a more moderate and diverse culture here. It sounds trite, but it really is a bit of a Midwestern thing, not being overly this way or that. This really extends to California in general. It's quite shocking to live (albeit temporarily) in California after having lived in the Midwest all my life.

All the other stuff, people have touched on pretty well. Regarding the strength of each school's Computer Science, Northwestern still has a lot of catching up to do, regardless of all the sprinting they're doing now. It's no question that Berkeley has a better CS program. *However*, I have heard some pretty atrocious stories regarding how overcrowded it is, since now everybody and their grandmother that go to Berkeley want to do it. One particular shocker that I've heard is that the starter intro CS class (our equivalent would be CS 111) fills two auditoriums and one of them is basically livestreaming the lecture going on in the other auditorium. That's a yikes, obviously. This isn't something to take lightly.

**TL DR;** I would do a bit of research on Berkeley and the Bay Area's overall vibe and tech culture. It really pervades every aspect of life over there, and I cannot stress that enough. It has huge upsides and huge downsides. If you think the culture over there is something that you can handle or will like, (which will most likely mean that you'll eventually want to work there), then I would undoubtedly choose Berkeley. But like I mentioned earlier, it's not for everyone, and it's not like you're forever banned from the Bay Area because you went to Northwestern.",1586373959,1,0

Further, someone who studies CS will not take *exclusively* CS classes, and the truth is, Northwestern has more money and resources, smaller classes, and (on average) higher-ranked programs, even if not for CS specifically. Recruiting cares more about school prestige than “Ooh, who does the QS ratings say is best for this major, or that major...?”

You could always do it the old fashion way with a potato and sewing needle. Which is how my ears got pierced.  Haha. 


I've had a many piercings over the years.  I now only have nose, single hole in each ear, and monroe. All except ears were done at shops.  I reccomend shops vs diy. 

My tips for piercings.

Wear small hoop earrings while healing to allow for maximum airing.  Use stainless steel or titanium.

Gold and silver jewelry is almost always plated. And that plating wears off. 

Using good metal and hoops will reduce chance of infection. Wearing any earrings with posts or balls that come in contact with the skin just harbors bacteria and irritate the opening.  


Dont touch the pierced area unless you just washed your hands super well.  Even then, try to keep that to only when you are cleaning. Dont ever use fingernails to pull at crusty bits or anything. 

Soak in warm salt water every evening until crusting stops. 
A little shot glass will work well for this. 
Then use a qtip dipped in warm water to gently clear off any dried material. Dont scrub. Dont pick with your fingers. If it doesnt easily come off, leave it. 

Dont smother the piercing with antiseptics or creams. It really just needs to be dry and clean. Fine to put a little antibiotic cream on with a QTIP for first few days.

If you have long hair. Keep your hair pulled back away from piercing.",1583298095,1,0

"You apply to residential colleges and need to earn points within the res college to get housing for the next year.

In comparison, you don't need to apply to live in a residential hall and you don't earn housing points to get a better room within that hall (you'll probably want to live in one of the better res halls after your first year). Residential halls are also just a mix of people from all years, with the exception of Elder which is primarily freshmen. 

Your mileage will vary with either type of housing. I have friends who still hang with their Slivka suitemates, I also have friends who want nothing to do with who they lived with in their res college. Same also goes for residential halls.

"I second what Daannii said. I’d say in your budget range, Rogers Park is probably a natural fit, and the inter campus shuttle goes all up and down Sheridan through Rogers Park, so it would be a convenient commute.

In that time I hear crime rate has ticked up slightly, but that’s mostly at night and around hotspots like red line stops. At least that’s the impression I’ve gotten, but definitely do your research first.

When I was a student, I actually found a very nice and spacious studio for around $850/month, heat and AC included, in Evanston. It was pretty far north from campus, but I loved it. And it was easy to take the inter campus shuttle or drive (I had my car, street parking was easy) but was only about a 30min walk if I did want to walk to campus. It was near the Trader Joe’s/Jewel on Chicago Ave. It had enough room for a queen bed and would have had enough room for a couch if I had one, plus a small dining set in the kitchen. It was old but it was great for a student. I also remember finding a 1br around $1100 near Ryan Field. So it’s definitely possible to find a place in Evanston in your price range!

"Anywhere along the purple or red line, South of Evanston, will be optimal for getting to campus.

I moved here last fall for grad school myself. I live in Edgewater.  
I think it's nice enough here. 

I hear to stay away from the area near the Howard CTL stop.  Seems to be a bit of crime there. But Howard is the main stop to transfer from red to the purple line.  The purple line goes near NU campus. 

Some say Roger's Park is a bit ruff. But I know some grad students that live there. 

I dont know if you will find a place in your budget in Evanston  without getting a roommate. 

I couldn't find anything.  

I'm not sure where you are coming from or what the norm was there. But things that are common in Chicago.


There is a ""move-in fee"" instead of a deposit. And you dont get it back.  Basically a shady way for renting agencies to keep your ""deposit"".


Most places do not have AC units. You have to get your own. 


When looking at rentals on FB groups and other sites, most of the time when you contact them. (99.9%) the apartment in the photo is not the one they take you to.  Wont look like the photos, wont have the same address.

So when you contact them, be explicit. Say. That place. The one at that address. 

If they say ""oh no, we just rented it"". Dont proceed further. 

Another tip.  Dont let the agents bully/pressure you into applying if you aren't sure you want that shitty apartment that looks nothing like the photos.   The application fee (non refundable and does not count toward that move-in fee) is usually $50-$100. 


I had one very aggressive dude try to get me to pay the $75 app fee for a place I would def not live in.

Look into sublets. 
It's less committment.  And its likely the actual place listed online is the place up for rent. 

I went that route. But I also got lucky and rented from an honest person.  I think it could be risky. 

Before viewing a place, pull up the CTA bus and train map.  (You get a full pass card from NU if you are a PhD grad student).  Make sure a stop is near where you will live.  

Try to limit how far you have to walk.  The train does not go all the way to campus (Foster or Linden stop is closest) and it's a little less than half a mile walk (I think) to campus. 

There is a bus (or two?) that gets closer.  But there isnt a bus from the train to campus. Most people get off at Foster stop and walk.  Or keep a bicycle there to ride back and forth. I might do this when it gets warmer. I would get a cheap ugly bike for that though. And a good lock.  

You dont want to be walking tons every day though. It will take you forever to get to campus.  Plus it's crazy cold and then crazy hot. Not much mild weather.  So yeah. Try to find a place near a CTL stop (the elevated train, AKA -""L-train""), or bus stop that goes to campus.

I think there is a find-a-roomate site hosted by Northwestern.   Someone recently posted on here about it. 



Anyway. Hope that info helps. 

Also I think there is a crime map somewhere. Maybe try Google.",1583095399,3,0

Honestly, it's just a case of sitting with a spreadsheet and planning what classes you're going to take each quarter. I've managed a double major without having to take any extra classes outside of the required 42 credits in SoC, could have even graduated early if I wanted to.

"I got my MS at Medill, so can't speak to the undergrad world, but my thoughts on culture, life in Evanston, etc.:

**Positives**

* Very easy to get to Chicago, but Evanston is also a good college town, and you get a ""normal"" college environment with access to a great city.
* Compared to many schools, you have a ton of stores, restaurants, etc. within walking distance, presuming you live on campus. Aside from grocery shopping being mildly inconvenient, not having a car with you is a total non-issue IMHO.
* I thought both profs and peers at Medill were by and large very helpful and friendly. I do think NU is more buttoned-up compared to many schools, but I never felt like it was hyper-competitive or cutthroat.

**Negatives**

* Weather. I grew up in the Midwest, so I'm used to cold winters, but the lake effect is brutal. NU has a beautiful campus, but well over 50% of the time you're there, it will be cold and dreary. Just be prepared.
* I'll stop short of saying the social scene is ""bad"" (and again, did not attend for undergrad), but it's a far cry from how you ever see college portrayed on TV/in movies. You can absolutely find your people if you're into partying, but it'll take a little work.
* I was pretty underwhelmed by Medill's ability to help me search for employment, but they certainly were not shy about hitting *me* up my first couple years out of school and was employed via my own efforts/networking (I graduated in 2013). Granted, I'm sure every school is guilty of that to some degree, but just left a bad taste in my mouth.",1588701198,1,0

"I know some pre-med kids in the program who regret taking the program. It can be pretty rigorous on its own, and taking it while being pre-med can be incredibly tough. My best tip is probably to look at the CTECs of the teachers in question and decide from there.",1588692314,1,0
"Yeah so I worked at a small animal vet and volunteered at an equine vet from August-May (around 30 hours a week total). And then I took the summer off and competed all around the country in equestrian show jumping (part of the reason i took a gap year was to take one more year to ride full time before college)! During the school year, I would ride every morning and then work every afternoon-evening except sundays basically. It was busy but super fun and rewarding!!",1588688451,1,0
"My family is super against gapping and probably would’ve never let me do it; I however, think it can be a good idea if done right. Based on experiences I’ve seen, a gap year can be super helpful if:
1. The student doesn’t want to go to college and wants to try out the working world/alternate career paths first
2. The student doesn’t know what they want to do in college so they take the time to really explore their interests and how they think they fit in to the world. Could be peace corps, tutoring full time, working on a project in an academic area you’ve never seen in high school, etc.

I do not think a gap year is helpful if

1. The student just wants to take a year long vacation. Usually this will only be acceptable if the student is rich.
2. The student wants to “travel” the world by visiting every four seasons in all four corners of the world. Again, this is vacationing for a year. If you actually want to immerse yourself, consider learning a new language and getting a work visa and living in the new country by yourself. Only would recommend if you are ahead of your age in terms of maturity/self responsibility tho(I certainly wasn’t), or do it with some other responsible freinds/family. 

The main idea is a gap year shouldn’t just be spent the whole time in a comfort zone. It is ok to take some time off for vacation obviously, but the gap year should be focused on GROWTH. The reason you take a gap year is because you don’t feel ready for college, and want to gain more perspective. This will not be done by vacationing or spending time in your mother’s basement, but by either challenging yourself to discover alternate pathways of life (no not suggesting crime) and developing your interests and goals. If you are not sure how to do that, I’d suggest you start off by finding a job.",1588688415,1,0

However, obviously w/ rona, my freshman experience will not be normal at all, and that experience of meeting new people, getting involved with D1 sports, etc. were like the main reasons why I chose NU, and I just feel that given the current situation it would be a waste of a year +money to (even if things are 'normal' in the spring) not defer my enrollment.",1588670897,1,0

"I was accepted to the class of 2022 and deferred my enrollment to be in the class of 2023 and it was super easy and the best decision I ever made!!!!! 

I emailed the dean of admissions around the end of may of my senior year explaining why I wanted to take a gap year (I wrote about wanting to gain experience in veterinary medicine and wanting to take break after a stressful year of school etc) and then the next day the dean of admission’s assistant called me to confirm, and then sent me an email confirmation of my deferred enrollment that afternoon! 

So I think NU is really generous about enrollment deferrals in general, but I would def have a reason that is not related to covid to justify why you want to take a gap year to admissions. My mom said that other top tier schools are being super stringent this year because so many kids are trying to defer.  

But honestly, it was the best decision I ever made. I came to NU with so much more drive, perspective, stress management, etc than what I would have had I not taken a gap year, and felt very prepared mentally to perform well at NU without getting too stressed. I think this was because I realized how important balance is and that while academic success is super valuable, the world doesn’t end if you fail. I now am able to work my hardest without major stress about doing well!! And that is definitely a useful skill at NU

The trade off with earth science is you don’t get lab credit. Physics and Chemistry give 1.33 credits per quarter, so you can knock out your 4 basic science credits in 3 quarters. I was lucky enough to come in with 2.33 basic science credits, so it made more sense for me to take two 1 credit earth science classes.

Next store this information in a graph.

Next add caching, don't download a page if you've already downloaded it.

Next use threads to make these requests concurrently it should be much faster.

Next display this graph visually with labels and arrows.

Next store this graph in a file.Next create a program to load the stored graph and visualize it.

"Positives:
 
• Opportunity to take more classes than at a semester school, or double major relatively easily

• CTECs that allow you to know exactly how previous students fared in a class before signing up for it yourself

• Diversity of academic interest among students

• Many ways to stand out (Special programs like MENU, ISP, and MMSS, research opportunities, certificates, etc...)

• Lack of a cutthroat, “outdo your peers or else” culture that is rampant at some similar institutions

Negatives:

• The location: It is *cold* and dark for much of the school year, it is a long train ride to Chicago Loop, and Evanston is not a very lively college town

• Dorms and other buildings vary greatly in quality, with most of campus (away from the lakefill or Deering Meadow) not particularly picturesque 

• Noticeable culture divide between North Campus (Greek Life/STEM/Sports) and South Campus (Arts/Humanities)

• Start and end dates incompatible with most other schools, with a shorter summer and shorter breaks

"I’m not a heritage speaker so I can’t really say, but the thing is, they don’t WANT to put people with knowledge of chinese with people with no knowledge. I took 1.5 years of chinese at the beginning of high school and honestly just wanted to start all over again from the beginning, but they gave me the placement test, told me I would join the beginner class in second quarter, and I should self-study anything I didn’t know from the first quarter. 

So if your spoken Chinese is actually good then you’re a perfect fit for a heritage speaker class. From what I know from my friends in heritage speaker classes at other schools, it’s all about reading and writing, and discussing complex topics with the oral chinese you already know. Especially for chinese heritage speakers, the classes are usually meant to bring kids who can’t write up to speed. 

As for Korean, that would depend on how you do on the placement test. The Korean heritage speaker classes are meant for kids who can speak very well but might have some spelling problems, issues with what tone (eg verb endings + slang) to use in what situation, and not knowing how grammar formally works / how to compose writing. It’s possible that you could get into the heritage speaker class and it’s also possible that you could get put in a higher-level “normal” class, like intermediate or something.",1587609546,1,0

There are heritage speaker classes for both, so it sounds like you would fit in the heritage speaker category for Chinese. Also, if you have any prior experience with Chinese, you’ll have to take a placement test. They would definitely put you in the heritage class. 

I’ve only taken the 4th year Korean classes, so I don’t know what the beginner ones focus on. (Do you mean what topics they focus on, or what area of grammar/vocab/listening/reading/writing etc?)

Also keep in mind that once you start a language you’re kinda bound into continuing it, because if you miss one quarter of class, you have to wait a year before you’d be able to take the same class again.",1587608719,1,0

"I agree OP should learn python first, but I don’t think they should try tackling more languages afterwards. It’s only one summer, after all, and getting really comfortable in one language is much more valuable than being decent at many languages. Especially since it’s very easy to jump to new languages often without ever actually *knowing* one. I would also argue HTML/CSS/JS is for front-end development or UI/UX/web development. Software dev is more Java/C#/Python/etc. territory. 

OP, I suggest you learn Python, and after you feel like you’ve learned it, build something with it. What I mean is, take on some projects. Create something. If you can’t think of anything, there are plenty of ideas online for “beginner/intermediate python projects”. But it’s better if you think of something, because then you’ll be more motivated to finish it. 

If you spend a ton of time on this and get really comfortable with Python, you could probably start learning about data structures. That’s the most useful stuff for CS technical interviews, so it never hurts to try at that. Python isn’t the best language for learning data structures, but the concepts are more important than the implementation at this point.",1587608080,3,0
"Hi I'm a Junior in CS. 

Python is really the best first choice. There's a decent range of languages used  heere(I've seen Javascript/C/C++/Java/Python/Rust/Racket), but the most common is python. It's a good first language I'd start there. Don't be scared by the list, the effort needed to learn a language does down like 50% each time. Your 3rd/4th language will be a breeze.

Try and make a few simple python programs, hello world, find the primes under 1000, learn about classes etc. This site seems decent [https://www.learnpython.org/](https://www.learnpython.org/)

After python you should look at C/C++ or HTML/CSS/JS. If you're interested in low level computer systems, compilers, networking etc. go for C/C++ if you're interested in software dev for HTML/CSS/JS.

"ISP student who graduated 2017 here, hopefully I can answer some of your questions.

7. In general I'd say the teaching for ISP courses is much more intimate since the classes are usually all sub 20 people. This is usually good and sometimes not. Some of the classes are better than others but the program does heavily encourage you to study with your classmates which makes most classes manageable even if the professors aren't the best teachers. 

8. Again it depends on you, it's very easy for your friend group freshman year to be very ISP heavy but depending on if you Rush/join clubs/ participate in anything outside of campus you'll definitely be meeting people from anywhere. 

9. For me it was since you're surrounded by people in labs, but again find a lab you're interested in and you shouldn't have much trouble, the undergrad size compared to the grad schools size means that if you want a lab position you can pretty much guarantee you'll have it. 

10. for me the ISP house was a lifesaver, I lived in a fraternity house for 2 years and off campus for senior year and it's a fantastic spot if you need to just pack up a bunch of snacks and pull an all nighter to study. 

11. It's been a while but ISP is much more course heavy than other majors but most people get a second major and since there's so much overlap between other stem majors it's often like 5-6 additional classes for the double major. 

Generally I'd say much of the purpose behind ISP wasn't clear to me until I was in grad school. It gives you the capability to sit in a room with someone from basically any STEM field and be able to super quickly understand what they're doing. Even if you're just interested in one science, the ability to quickly relate and abstract your findings from one field into the broader community is incredibly useful for grant-writing/applications development. ISP is probably the most intense freshman year, and I certainly struggled with it at first, but it's certainly worth it in the long run",1587604272,1,0

You probably won't be taking 5 classes much freshman year unless you're doing a crazy demanding combo of majors or just want to get ahead on credits.

Fall quarter i worked 3 days a week with longer shifts and Winter quarter I worked every weekday but in shorter shifts, most on campus employers are good at being flexible with your work schedule so you can just fit it in around your classes. I work in the library and my position is pretty chill and I get lots of time to do homework and pays well which is nice. Some of the more fun jobs on campus allow for less time to do work so it's really just up to you, I'd honestly encourage going for a ""boring"" job because any amount of study time you change get will help and they're usually pretty flexible with hours or missing days since you're barely essential lmao",1587596900,1,0

I applied regular decision and I received an invitation to apply a few days after I submitted my application in January and the deadline to apply was March 1 (with decisions coming out April 1).

"Section 1:

1. I would definitely say that Northwestern as a whole has a more relaxed atmosphere although there are small pockets of competitiveness, especially those studying more rigorous majors. A lot of McCormick kids for instance, some of them are really laid back while others are grinding 24/7 and given that a lot of our classes are ""curved"" to set cutoff, this elicits a change in everyone's attitudes. This especially applies when you get back an exam and you see the average was 90% when you got 70%. Also, throughout the midterm season (which is basically always once they begin) the grind is definitely notable.

2. This is a very difficult question to answer because happiness itself is very subjective. If you want to be happy, you will be happy. There have been several times throughout the quarter where I no longer wanted to go on and have felt miserable but despite that, I still felt satisfied and overall happy with my life. I would credit that to the number of support systems I have, especially friends. Again happiness is very subjective but overall it just depends on your expectations, which you will most likely inevitably adjust after starting at Northwestern.

3. Winter isn't bad, I do live in the midwest though and have experienced cold temperatures. Everyone always loves to bring up the polar vortex but given that that was basically a once in a century kinda thing, I don't think it's fair to use. The temperature will drop, you will wear a coat but it's 100% bearable. People talk about being inside all the time and winter being depressing and all but my activity changed very little with relation to the climate. Average winter temperatures (from ~December - ~February) were around 20 degrees Fahrenheit with the lowest I saw being somewhere around 0 degrees.

4. Most of the dorms are okay, with some exceptional exceptions. An instance of this would be Lincoln Hall which is commonly referred to as a hotel and it, of course, has its opposite compliments such as Bobb/McCulloch and Sargent that are just known to be extremely dirty (strange smells, mold, etc). There is no ""study"" divided dorms although there are residential communities that are themed to a particular interest. I'll use Slivka (another really nice dorm tbh) as an example, it is themed towards Science &amp; Engineering and typically has a lot of STEM majors but at the same time, you don't have to be in STEM to live there. There is a division I guess you could say though, North campus / South campus because the middle of campus contains libraries/research buildings/buildings for classes.

5. Evanston is like a mini urban city. Downtown Evanston can be as little as a 5-minute walk from campus and there are several food attractions/stores to explore. There isn't really anything that makes it amazing but I honestly love how accessible it is and how tight-knit it feels for a city. I didn't know exactly what you wanted out of this question but I can definitely elaborate if needed. Also, one of the best cities in the country is a 45m train ride away if you ever feel the need to explore further!

6. Parties are everywhere. They do not solely revolve around the Greek system as people are always having little kickbacks in their dorm rooms (some people have gigantic rooms). If you want to party, you will find something (you just need to involve yourself with people). If you don't want to party, you will most likely not be very much affected by it. I feel like it is a pretty nice balance.

"I can't speak to anything regarding your admittance to Northwestern, but I temporarily had stress fractures while living on campus so I know a bit about the disability stuff. For me, my biggest problem was getting to classes on time because my mobility was limited and most of my classes were on the opposite side of campus from where I was living. Accessible NU allowed me to essentially get a ""late pass"" to all my classes because some professors were sticklers for attendance and would have otherwise docked me points for being late. I also got early registration so I could try to create a schedule with the least amount of running around. Most buildings have elevators that are accessible to students, so I didn't have too many problems there. Most of campus is pretty flat, but portions of it, especially on the Southern end, are a bit hilly, which got me a bit fatigued. During winter, they do a decent job keeping pathways clear but sometimes they can't keep up and it can get icy.",1587514618,1,0

"First off, welcome to NU (and McCormick!). 
Like others said - we're in a pandemic. Everyone is working at less than full capacity right now - and that's alright! Everyone at NU is always trying to be productive, so I'm not surprised or blame you for this question, but just remember to have self-compassion. This could be your last summer where you can simply relax, enjoy friends, and family. However, if you're doing those things but still feel like you can do more, pick up something that brings you joy. It doesn't have to be thought of as conventionally ""good"", like say programming - if you don't like coding or programming, don't force yourself to do it. If you like, say, knitting, do that! It'll make you a more interesting person. The point I'm trying to make is you'll have a ton of time in college to focus on becoming more productive, learn more about your field, etc. For example, did you know that a lot of people who started coding before college actually struggle more in our Intro CS course than those who never touched it, since they learned it in a completely different way and kind of have to ""unlearn"" what they thought of programming as. NU will do a great job of shaping you. There's no need to be a stressed potato when you don't need to, or to burn yourself out - save that energy for when school starts :)
So, focus on spending this time for yourself, you worked hard in high school, got into a great school, and you deserve it. All the best!",1589772276,3,0

"I personally agree with every line of what you said. Do students who want an on-campus fall just expect older profs (which the majority of the tenured ones are) to just face the prospect of death every day? In the EE dept tons of profs are in their 70s - that's like a double digit mortality rate I believe. Was speaking to my advisor who is also the chair of the department, and his description of the insane amount of work they had to put in to switch everything to be just as effective online -- I was stressed just hearing it. 
 Furthermore, they spend each week revisiting challenges and how they can fix them. For example, in fall quarter, for engineering classes, many of them will send students kits that will allow for a very similar experience to one they would get in the lab. Luckily, modern technology makes this possible. Another silver lining is time we get to spend with family/loved ones that we might have never gotten after college. Hope you stay well.",1589751348,2,0

"Personally, I think it depends on how quickly you want to be finished with the chem sequence. The difficulty in the material for these two classes seems to be about the same, just the pacing is different. I think it’s wild to finish Gen chem in 20 total weeks since I took chemistry on the semester schedule in undergrad (so 30 weeks), but just depends on what you’re looking to get out of the courses and how much you enjoy chemistry and having that solid chem background.

If you need more time for the material to sink in and make sense and you are okay with spending the full year taking chem, 110 makes sense. Do also note that 110 has a few weeks of algebra and basic math review too, so if you are decent at these topics, start looking ahead as the rest of the quarter can feel jam-packed with material if you aren’t prepared.

If you want to get it over with and maybe not have the fullest understanding of everything since you’ll be whizzing through it along with your other courses, then 151 should be fine.

Either way though, really do reach out to your TAs. Even if the TA for your section may not explain things in ways that make sense, reach out to other sections’ TAs and see who explains things in ways that make sense to you. Go to office hours when you can, especially if you just need a place to do homework. You can easily have a TA around to help if you get stuck and it can be a great learning atmosphere. And totally use your Professor’s office hours if they help too. I know they can sometimes be intimidating, but this can be a good way to get help and stand out to your Professor in these larger classes.",1589739982,1,0

"Ok, let's go point by point:

First, ""the facts"":  https://www.northwestern.edu/financial-operations/annual-financial-reports/2019-financial-report.pdf

Regardless of the 3% CAGR of tuition costs, that does not change the fact that their endowment is made up of thousands of smaller (relative) donations which are contractually tied to certain uses. 

--They have more than $2.3 bln tied to ""teaching, research and program support"" that is unrestricted.  They're good here.  They have nearly $1.1 bln unrestricted  for operations.  They're good there.  

if someone donated $100mm for Chemistry research, the university cannot just take that money and fund whatever they want with it: it has a specific use that is outlined contractually. 

--Correct -- according to their 2019 annual report, they have 62% of total assets unrestricted

The endowment is made up of the aggregation of all of these donations (some are designated for financial aid, some for the football program, some for gender studies etc.), so I'm sorry but you don't make any sense.

--You mean, like it's spelled out $ by $ on Page 17 of the pdf, page 15 of the actual document?  
https://www.northwestern.edu/financial-operations/annual-financial-reports/2019-financial-report.pdf

So, there's actual hard and fast data presented here rather than guessing and rambling about an explanation of ""how an endowment works?""  Yes.  

Throwing in basic economic terms like CPI and PPI which are not in any way tied to college tuition just makes you look dumb to anyone who knows economics.   

--Since you know so much about economics, I presume you took an econometrics class.  Are you telling me that the correlation coefficient between CPI (or PPI) and college tuition is 0?  Interesting.  Care to cite that data?",1589562370,1,0
