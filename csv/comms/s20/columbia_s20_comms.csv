"1. Absolutely do not round. It should say that in the application instructions. This applies to all schools/jobs/etc you apply for, not just Columbia.

2. Your Columbia GPA is separate from whatever other institutions you’ve attended. They are not combined and you should not combine them for applications to schools/jobs/etc either.

3. It’s difficult to get credit for Core classes. Most transfers will be able to get credit for University Writing and 2 science courses. You can petition for other Core credit, but I didn’t because they seemed very strict about it and none of my other classes were similar to the Core. You can get transfer credit for your major fairly easily—just make sure you’re holding onto course syllabi.

Good luck!",1580113779,1,0
"I transferred in as junior to CC. It was awful, but I’m also not a fan of the Core so your experience will vary. I had to take 21 and then 22 units my last two semesters. Advising didn’t care that I couldn’t register for all the classes I needed so I got the pleasure of panicking every semester that I might not get all my courses at the times I could attend—they won’t review over-limit unit petitions until after the semester begins. Finished with &gt; 3.9 GPA, but I was stuck reading and studying all the time, partly because lit hum/CC is so reading intensive. That being said, I’d do it all over again. Columbia was my dream school and although things didn’t quite turn out as I had imagined they would, it took going through the process to figure that out.

The first lecture was good but the attendance issue might make it or break it for you. Its a 200+ people class and he is taking attendance with pictures of your name and uni in sharpie on white paper every class.

"You should talk to Columbia admissions and see what they like to see.  In particular, on the topic of SAT:  I considered transferring to Columbia GS for a while and they said they require an SAT or their equivalent for NY statutory reasons, but give it very little weight.  Their reasoning was that the SAT, when combined with high school grades and other factors, is a predictive indicator for college performance.  If you look up SAT on Wikipedia, the tests are calibrated by previous years’ scores against eventual college freshman performance.  But since transfer applicants already have actual college performance under their belts and are not college freshmen, the utility of the SAT kinda disappears.  NJ schools, for example, have no such statewide law requiring SAT as part of an application and usually don’t require SAT scores if you already have 60 credits.

Anyway, find out from the admissions of the Columbia school in which you’re interested what they’re looking for, especially SAT.  If they’re like GS, you may not have to sweat prepping for SAT again and will be able to focus on your college courses and extra curriculars.",1581178904,1,0

What you could do is go to a cheaper school for 1-2 years and transfer in, thereby splitting your debt. But even then, Id personally still sell-out to IB / consulting with that Econ major for a couple of years to cover my remaining $100k-ish debt. Would you even be happy doing that? It’s not like getting a finance job is some trivial task either— the time you’d normally be spending towards fashion events / clubs would be hampered by the time necessary to land a Wall Street gig.

Agree with a lot of the lack of support... students here are oppressed enough to throw coronavirus parties and disregard everyone else's health (which as a pre-med as well, makes my blood boil)

But from personal experience, I would say that Columbia is more about being independent and having your own go-getter attitude rather than waiting for someone to help you (aka you have to do everything yourself, which imo is kind of like NYC mentality overall tbh); so even though there's a lot of advising services that Columbia offers, you have to *know what you want to accomplish* before going to ask advisors for assistance. 

Even though general administration is kind of meh, I've definitely met a wonderful group of supportive friends here in all the communities I've joined, and through these tough times these are the people that have been keeping me sane. 

Pre-med life: I think Columbia has a pretty clear structure for premed course curriculum, which has helped me a lot in choosing classes (so that's definitely also something worth considering when choosing where to matriculate)

I'll have probability theory before summer ends and get linear algebra in fall. Just trying to see what else I could take in Fall to prep myself better. If you have any other specific course suggestion(s), that'd be great.

Regarding your point about adv cs theory stuff like comp complexity having no direct use in basic ML -- I guess I was thinking more in the longer run, having some exposure to cs theory topics may give a better insight into engineering ML/DL models... but once again, idk.

Putting a bunch of students from all over the world into very close and confined quarters for many hours each day is a recipe for an outbreak no matter how many masks you distribute.

All we know know is that September is a long way away relative to how long we've been dealing with this in earnest (less than two months), and as we've seen since March, a lot can change quickly in either direction in much less time than that.

I'm surprised no one brought this. If you are a Columbia College student, you are bound by a literal Code of HONOR regarding the integrity of your work. ""Cheating"" goes against the concept of academic integrity, the idea that you developed your thoughts of your accord. And you can get expelled for it. It is in the interest of the university to pursue cheaters. When cheating occurs on a mass scale, it slows erodes the academic integrity of the institution, therefore, you ""cheapen"" the degree. When students engage in cheating, they are not only doing a disservice to them selves, but to their classmates, their professors, the administration and the greater Columbia community.

The biggest con is losing guaranteed housing when you come back. But living in the neighborhoods around campus is a lovely experience, and I'd encourage you to look into it. Plus, I'm thinking there's gonna be a lot more students taking a gap year or deferring 2020-21 than other years, and/or a decline in enrollment due to immigration or fears about NYC, so they may amend that policy anyway.

"Wasn't getting holier-than-thou at all. For one to assume that, I must have struck a nerve. Maybe cheating is more about the decline of morality and ethics in scholarship, something academia as whole (humanities, soft sciences, hard sciences) needs to have a discussion about. Honestly, we're moving more in a direction where sole P/F option (with recommendations from your department if your an exceptional student) is becoming more of a tangible reality.

Imho, the ability to commit material to memory, to make connections between adjacent topics in your field, to think about it critically, and to highlight those connections in a closed test setting without supplemental assistance serves as a better predictor for long term success. If you are struggling with this at the Bachelor's level, you might want to rethink your study habits and/or the field that you are in. Generally speaking, students that excel in critical thinking are capable of doing the rigorous intellectual work expected of them in higher degree programs. For example, when you go for orals and/or a written exam at the PhD level, you go in ""naked,"" no books, no notes, no supplemental materials. It's literally just you and your advisors. Rote memorization is nice, but if you can't take apart as to how those tidbits of information are translated as ""fact"", ""truth,"" then what is the value of your work? Especially if you're looking to be on the forefront your field.",1588611095,1,0

"No. My time at GSAPP has been absolutely miserable. 

The admissions standards are absolute shit; the class sizes are massive, and it’s obvious they accept a ton of unqualified students that are just willing to pay whatever an Ivy League degree costs. The small percentage of us that were offered merit-based aid constantly have to deal with fucking morons that can’t understand any concepts beyond pretty pictures. 

Some programs don’t even have a minimum cutoff for the TOEFL. So many courses are full of students who can barely (and that’s being generous) speak English. Stupid amounts of time is spent catching them up at the expense of the others. Grade inflation is appalling. The work is mostly terrible. 

The facilities are an embarrassment and are laughably behind comparable schools; no robots, no zund, no waterjets or plasma cutters. Barely a desk’s worth of space in shitty studios. Outdated computers. So much money taken in and almost nothing to show for it. The library is incredible, but that just isn’t enough. 

So no, I don’t like Columbia. I’m so glad I never have to go back, and that I get to spend my doctorate years at Harvard.",1585473193,1,0
"If you’re a girl, find a good club promoter that you trust. Otherwise, make sure you’re able to get into bars starting on day 1, and join Greeklife!

There isn’t the space or the state school culture if that makes sense, but it’s still fun! Especially the NYC nightlife, which simply can’t be beat. 

In terms of feeling stressed, I picked a really, really hard major and interned a few semesters during the school year, which was a LOT. However, it’s been so beyond worth it for me looking back. My advice is don’t commit to things that either a) don’t make you happy or b) won’t truly benefit you in the long run!",1585468254,1,0

It requires a bit of effort, since everyone tends to be quite busy, but I made a great group of friends, and though I wasn’t too much into ragers, I had a lot of great smaller parties, and saw some reasonably wild frat parties. Especially if one is in a sport, club, or frat, then social life becomes a non-issue.

I think with a reasonable course load, not too many extracurriculars, and time taken to enjoy the city once in a while, it can be a great experience, and it’s one I think back on positively often.

"Hey! While I'm just a freshman at Columbia, and don't have any extensive knowledge about Stanford, I'm an engineering student and also extremely interested in film studies. Here's my insight:

1) Firstly, congrats on getting into these two amazing schools -- you can't go wrong with this decision, but you should definitely factor in what your interests are, your preference for location, as well as intended paths for study (majors, minors, etc.)

2) As an engineering student, I will definitely say that Columbia, just like any other engineering school, will provide you with the resources and the fundamental skills that you may need for any of your engineering disciplines. Depending on what type of engineering you'd like to study, however, Stanford could be a better choice (they have many niche engineering fields ie. Earth Systems, Aerospace, etc.). I personally feel that, no matter where you go, your engineering course work will be very similar in material and delivery.

3) I firmly believe that Columbia will be a strong choice if you would like to simultaneously study STEM, but feel immersed in the humanities. While Stanford, I believe, has more flexibility in which STEM courses you can choose to take towards your major, Columbia will honestly immerse you (at times, force you) into humanities courses that will change your perspective on many fields.

4) There's no way you can double major in Columbia Engineering with a College major. For example, it's not humanly possible for you to do Electrical Engineering and a Film Studies double major. There also isn't a Film Studies minor, but you're welcome to take as many Film Studies or humanities courses you'd love to.

5) Columbia has many many resources for artists and filmmakers. There's literally a whole fraternity dedicated to Filmmakers and Film Enthusiasts, and there's also several film journals, and just generally many movie lovers on campus. I genuinely feel that everyone on campus has an artistic flare, and you'd definitely be able to flex your creativity-- both on campus and throughout the city.

While, once again, I cannot speak to what Stanford can offer, I truly think that you can't go wrong with this decision. But before you make a decision, please, please, please familiarize yourself with the core curriculum for engineers, and note that you have to transfer between the Engineering school and the College. I truly feel that both campuses will provide you with all the opportunities you may dream of, so go with the school you feel most comfortable with. Columbia has changed my perspectives on life and shifted my aspirations in innumerable ways, and I hope that you can feel the same no matter where you go.

Good luck, and great job!",1585463232,1,0

"1. Classes-&gt; search SEAS engineering bulletin. It has the path of study which outlines the classes you will be taking for your major (including first year classes)!
2. Placement tests. You take a placement test for Chem if you want to place into Honors/Orgo. If you’re a CS major, take the easiest chem possible. You only need 1 semester anyway. Physics I don’t know if there’s a test but definitely take 1400 as a CS major. However, take multivariable calc and skip calc I and II if you can. I don’t think there’s a placement test if you got a 5 on AP BC, but maybe I’m wrong it’s been so long. Basically the golden rule is, don’t take advanced classes freshman year unless it will help you skip classes. You will take enough challenging classes later on and those easy As will do wonders for your future GPA!
3. Essentials for college-&gt; Bed bath beyond/pinterest have good dorm room lists. Just pick the stuff you can see yourself using; what’s considered essential is very different based on the person so start from a big list and cross off what you can!

"I’m a current freshman and coming to Columbia was the best decision of my life. I cannot overstate how happy I am I chose Columbia, and how happy I am here. 

Sure, there have been ups and downs, but the overall experience has exceeded all my expectations. 

For me, the biggest part has been the city and the people I have met. The people. Wow. Barring a few pricks, the most amazing humans I have met. 

Before coming, I honestly did not care much about NYC but the city has been much an important and fun part, I cannot imagine going to college anywhere else but in New York. 

Prestige aside, the stuff they teach you in classes is pretty much the same everywhere. However, these is so so much you can do in NYC compared to any where else. 

Additionally, the Core is great if you’re interested in the humanities. A lot of people complain, but it’s honestly great if you select a decent Professor. I barely did any readings or put in much effort, but I got so much out of it if you’re concerned about workload. What I got out of LitHum is probably a hundred times more than what I put in, and to me the core education is priceless. 

There are a number of other things that I love about Columbia and would happily talk about it in detail. If you wish, just shoot me a DM. 

You have the great luxury of choosing between the two best colleges in the world!! Revel in your glory I’m sure you’ll do great where ever you end up. 

Selecting a college is a huge, life defining decision. Despite how much I love Columbia, you should make a decision based on your own circumstance, and not the subjective opinion of other individuals. You will find thousands of people who love and hate both Columbia and Stanford, and your sample size talking to people will not be large enough to decide which school is better. Thus, make a decision based on what you like like city life, weather etc (these things sound irrelevant rn but they matter ALOT).

"As an engineering student at Columbia, you won’t really have the space in your coursework to pursue film. However, NYC offers amazing internship opportunities during the school year. I have a lot of friends interning in various media positions, and personally, I have always found that I have benefited much more from my internships than my classes.

In terms of “liking Columbia”, for me, it wasn’t a great fit culturally and I knew that going in. I wanted to go to a super campus oriented school with a lot of sports spirit, warm weather and big party life. I actually applied EA to Stanford and got rejected, and to be completely honest Columbia was the most prestigious place I got in so I went. There have been times where I’ve been miserable here (mostly because of stress, and feeling like I was missing out on the “fun” of college), but as a junior, I’ve since found amazing friends and have tons of fun! Whereas I’ve died of stress, the stress has made me a better student and professional (I interned a lot during the school year). 

The thing is, if I had gotten into Stanford, I definitely would’ve gone. However, I would be a totally different person, and been studying such different things that I genuinely can’t make the comparison as to whether or not that would’ve been a better decision for me. So all I can say is, I’m really proud of how I’ve grown at Columbia and the opportunities being in NYC have given me changed my life.

8700 for two semesters comes out to around 1000 a month and then you gotta find somewhere else to live between semesters.

"I was an EE undergrad. The EE department is honestly so incredibly supportive. I have nothing but positive things to say, especially given the huge amount of encouragement and support I received through some tough personal times. The professors are friendly and engaging (highly recommend taking as many classes with Vallancourt and Kymissis as you can). The department has its own academic advising and career advising staff just for undergrads. 

There are a lot of opportunities to do research and to find internships/jobs. I emailed a bunch of professors in my first week Freshman year and I quickly found one who was willing to bring me on his team, despite having less experience. In our senior year, we had companies like Boeing who came to directly to Columbia to give interviews and hire Columbia EE and MechE students full-time. Aside from that, the EE department has its own career advisor who has tons of research/job opportunities specifically for EE. Way more helpful than CCE (Center for Career Education) which is more generalized for all majors/the entire school.

In terms of lacking community/school spirit... I would agree. Columbia is definitely not a typical ""RAH RAH RAH Go Columbia!"" kind of school. Compared to graduates I've met from other schools (especially state schools or schools with impressive athletic teams), Columbia students don't have that same school pride. 

That's not to say Columbia doesn't have community. It exists on a smaller scale imo. My EE class was a really tight-knit community. The opposite of cutthroat. We rooted for each other, helped each other, and spent a lot of time together. We helped each with exam prep, shared textbooks, did problem set together. We'd have late night study/dessert baking sessions, play tons of Super Smash Bros, go out in the city, and generally support one another. I never felt like it was cutthroat. But that's just my personal experience, data point of one.",1585446814,1,0

"I don't think anybody is genuinely cutthroat. Yes, everything is going to be graded on a curve, but only a real ass will try to sabotage someone else. 

Columbia doesn't facilitate anything/doesn't baby you. You will need to reach out to find your own friends! I heard at Princeton, there're going to be faculty who check up on you at your dorm to see if you're doing okay. This will not happen. Columbia is a very independent-minded school, I think. It reflects Manhattan and NYC at large, in a way. You will either love this or hate this. 

Regarding school sprit, does anyone really care about football or sporting events? It's something that I don't really care for, and I think not many people do at CU. Like at a big state school where there're like 100k people looking at a football game, not a lot of people go to our homecoming. I went once just to see what it was like. Meh...

Anyhow, I was not EE but another engineer. Had David Vallencourt in a couple of classes and he's such a GREAT professor. Very friendly and approachable. I hear EE as a major is pretty hard the first two years and then you get into the groove of things by your second 2. EE senior design projects are pretty cool, and you can probably find out about them online (Le Google)!",1585446192,1,0

One of the drawbacks I've heard is that the Poli Sci department is heavily understaffed for the number of students that major in it, which means it's hard to get great advising compared to other departments. Also, because so many students major in that field, it may be harder to distinguish yourself from the crowd when applying for jobs/internships. That being said, if I were you, I'd wait until I've had the experience of working with the Poli Sci department/trying out some classes before taking these issues to heart, as they could only be minor inconveniences.

In the same sense, if you want to get the most out of your time here I highly recommend joining student groups as someone else mentioned. And it’s relatively true that there’s a lack of strong school spirit (there are some things here that are classic Columbia like Orgo Night) but I haven’t found it hard to meet people and make friends and connections if you’re worried that’ll influence the social aspect of the school.

"This was the latest one:

Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

At this time of year, my predecessors traditionally have issued a message noting that during spring break many will be traveling abroad for research, teaching, and learning. Unfortunately, this year is different. In the context of the international reach of COVID-19, there is no choice but to outline restrictions on travel imposed by the spread of the virus. Further, as U.S. travel regulations for citizens of certain countries recently have been expanded, I must describe these as well.  

All Columbia affiliates are strongly urged to postpone any non-essential international travel. For students, all upcoming travel outside the United States organized, led, or financed by Columbia is suspended until further notice. 

Further, the Centers for Disease Control [(CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/student-foreign-travel.html) has issued guidance that institutes of higher education should “consider postponing or canceling student foreign exchange programs.” This advice is motivated in part by an awareness that, in the near future, “students may face unpredictable circumstances, travel restrictions, challenges in returning home or accessing health care while abroad.” Sharing that concern, I have asked the Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement to contact our students on study abroad programs and begin the process of determining the options for a safe and orderly return home.

As you know, the University has [restricted](https://provost.columbia.edu/news/update-columbias-response-coronavirus) all [Columbia Travel](https://globaltravel.columbia.edu/content/what-columbia-travel) to China, South Korea, and now Iran and Italy until further notice in light of the CDC’s [Level 3 Travel Warning](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__wwwnc.cdc.gov_travel_notices_warning_coronavirus-2Dsouth-2Dkorea&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=G2MiLlal7SXE3PeSnG8W6_JBU6FcdVjSsBSbw6gcR0U&amp;r=rDjgWI34i3arYhZHO3Ms-PFL0NQ56TxAeW1xVrxokO0&amp;m=pVcKHOE6F6RGwMJTD2lDzyUImgPbwXWczwB9xt2VFDo&amp;s=7sY6SSBJVDsv8BJKKJ8ba6C6f1HjcjJezDlnZncD32c&amp;e=). Please contact [globaltravel@columbia.edu](mailto:globaltravel@columbia.edu) if you believe your trip warrants exemption from these restrictions. The CDC also has issued an [Alert Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.cdc.gov_coronavirus_2019-2Dncov_travelers_index.html&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=G2MiLlal7SXE3PeSnG8W6_JBU6FcdVjSsBSbw6gcR0U&amp;r=rDjgWI34i3arYhZHO3Ms-PFL0NQ56TxAeW1xVrxokO0&amp;m=pVcKHOE6F6RGwMJTD2lDzyUImgPbwXWczwB9xt2VFDo&amp;s=G6BQnuHRuLL-vAIjJtKk1jl0Liy7jq9MxfuH4BfcHMA&amp;e=) for Japan.

Persons who still must travel overseas should make every effort to stay up to date regarding often fast-changing governmental regulations, including Executive Orders and guidance issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of State, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Visa and entry restrictions have been placed on Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Myanmar, Sudan, and Tanzania in addition to Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.

Please be assured that active oversight and planning take place every day by a policy task force that consults closely with members of our University faculty who are leading research virologists and epidemiologists. Based on their expert guidance, as well as that of the CDC and the New York City and New York State health departments, the University’s core campuses continue to operate normally. 

Current circumstances manifestly are uncertain, just the kind of situation that can generate deep anxiety. It is important that all of us modulate our responses to be consistent with the facts and the best information on hand.

I close with appreciation for the professionalism and thoughtful calm that characterize how our community is grappling with difficult current pressures.

Ira Katznelson

In terms of your long term aspirations, I'd encourage you to consider a graduate degree in a STEM field. I'd much rather have someone who has a masters in statistics than someone with a degree in ERM",1583261489,1,0

From what i'm aware of, if you want to attend GS as an international student, you simply must either have the means or be willing to go into debt; there isn't really much help to be had. Hopefully the financial aid office or someone on reddit can point you towards some resources or information on lower interest loan options that international students are eligible for, if those exist. If you already have a Columbia email address, i'd suggest joining the GS student group and asking there, as it will get a lot more visibility than this post on reddit.

"I personally can't live off of the same pasta meal day in, day out. Hence the eating with ""variety"" and eating ""reasonably healthy"".

I still think it's unreasonable to say a ""normal person"" spending $150-200 is a comfortable budget for food though.

Fair point with housing, I didn't really consider dorms. I'm an older GS student so I can't really fathom living in a dorm anymore or living with 3-4 roommates. But if OP can and it's $900-1200 then I'd say go for it",1583183702,1,0

From my friends, it’s not impossible to get a room for 900-1200 if you look hard enough for around 3-4 roommates each in their own room. If you’re still young and you want to share a room or have a significant other, that would be half for a room. 


Okay so one meal: $4 ground pork + $1 canned tomato + $0.50 pasta (half a bag) + $2 spinach + $0.50 spices/garlic = $8... I can eat this for four meals so $2 a meal. Plus breakfast being an egg on toast with some coffee... so call that $2. Throw in some more fruit and snacks so call that $6 a day... multiply by 30 = $180...",1583182907,1,0
"Err, our eating habits aren't that different. I don't buy name brand things, shop at Trader Joe's/Whole Foods/Westside Market and know the items on my grocery list to the point that I know which store has which item the cheapest. I don't eat processed foods, eat out max 1-2x a week (if that), and I'm on a cut at the moment so I eat 2 meals a day (one of which typically includes an omelette, which is ridiculously cheap per serving). I'm also a vegetarian, so I don't spend much on protein because my protein comes from whey shakes and eggs which again, are ridiculously cheap per serving. I still don't understand how your math comes out to $150-200 a month which includes eating out. You must not have any snacks/indulgences whatsoever, which is the only thing I can think of, and I make sure to keep that in my budget for the sake of my sanity alone. Telling OP to budget $150-200 for groceries is ridiculous.

Also where are you finding rooms for $900-1200 around CU? Please pray tell. Unless you want oodles of roommates (3+) or commuting over an hour, you're looking at closer to $1300-1600 for rent to live reasonably. Even if you were to commute, then you'd have to budget in $120 a month for a Metrocard. OP would be better budgeting $1800-2000 per month if they want survival + a little more like they said.

"Don’t give up. The job search is painstakingly difficult nowadays. I applied over 300 jobs before getting offers (I applied for a job outside my direct field because jobs in my field were scarce, so I was fighting a steep uphill battle). 

Handshake is deceptive- some companies do use it, but I think majority don’t. Once I applied to a job I really wanted through handshake. Turns out my application wasn’t even seen because the recruiter called me asking if I’d be interested. I told them I applied long time ago. Maybe that was the recruiter’s mistake, but given that 95% of my applications through handshake never got a response when at least 60% of my LinkedIn applications did, I feel as if handshake apps are rarely even noticed. Again, I’m not sure of it. Just a hunch. 

The thing that changed everything for me was networking. Reaching out to old classmates, even from high school, who could refer me. Reaching out to alumni or even friends of alumni. All my offers were for jobs for which I got referrals or reached out to alumni. 

Putting yourself out there is hard, especially if you’re introverted (like me), but can literally turn the tides of the game to your favor. I have even witnessed people doing crazy things like calling companies, saying that they couldn’t access their application due to some website error, and straight up asking to be connected to hiring managers. Worked sometimes. Not recommending it- but just saying you need to go above and beyond to get noticed sometimes.

"Someone sat in on one of my large lecture classes last fall. It was for people in my program only and I knew he wasn't in my program. Prospective students in my program must register to sit in on a class (there have been several in some of my classes). He wasn't caught and it's possible only I knew since we'd talked before and I knew he was in a different program, but I didn't ""snitch"" on him because I know his situation and interests (plus, he is a Columbia student just not my program). I did think it was weird though. Some people *would* ""snitch"".

While many buildings are technically open, I believe Columbia's policy is that you are supposed to have ID to be in most or all classroom buildings. My work-study job deals with events, and security is required for after-hours events open to the public. If you were quiet and didn't sit in the front, you'd probably not get noticed, but if you did then there might be trouble for you. Probably it would just be asking you to not come back, but why deal with that.

Professors are able to see a print-out of the class roster online that includes our faces. If attendance is required, a TA might be going through the list and identifying who is there. So you might be more likely to be caught than you think. Especially if you randomly show up partway through the semester.

Also, for more advanced classes, there are going to be a lot of readings. You'll probably be confused and lost if you haven't done those readings. Why not register to audit the course you're considering? Plus, if you want to apply for graduate programs, you can talk about that vs. getting kicked out of a classroom for sneaking into a class.",1580680937,1,0

"National Opportunity Program (NOP)
In 1986 Columbia University created the National Opportunity Program (NOP), making a commitment to providing the same kind of academic and financial support to students from all over the United States. In 2006 the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science established a National Opportunity Program.

NOP participants receive the following services:

Academic, personal, career, and financial advisement;

Peer mentoring;

Academic workshops and seminars;

Individualized and/or group tutorial services; and

Financial aid awards will be based on each student’s demonstrated financial need, as determined on a case by case basis.

Parents with calculated incomes below $60,000 a year and typical assets are expected to contribute $0 toward their children’s Columbia education. 

Parents with calculated incomes between $60,000 and $100,000 and typical assets are also eligible for significant financial aid.

Financial aid packages at Columbia contain no loans.
Students can estimate their financial aid eligibility by using the Net Price Calculator.

 In order to be eligible for NOP, students must meet academic criteria set forth by the University

You won't be able to get anything in management consulting that's worthwhile at this point; all the big firms basically closed applications during August-September. 

AM at big shops are pretty out of reach at this point as well, though you could potentially find some smaller firms for AM; CF positions will probably be your best bet at this point as some Corps hire later into the year; take a look on handshake to see what if anything is open. 

If you're hell bent on PE, then you should both try to get as good a position as possible for this year and also already begin networking for IB recruitment (which happens over the course of the summer). Be warned though that it's insanely difficult to get a FT IB role since most banks fill their spots from their SA classes; there might only be 1-3 spots open per bank, so you only really have a good shot at this if you have stellar grades (3.8 min, I'd guess?)/some really interesting previous internships/through nepotism. 

Best of luck, but don't stress out too much; though there aren't that many roles that will get you quite as filthy rich as PE will, there are a lot that will pay more than enough.

"The point of a college degree is the credential you leave with (which gives access to jobs, etc). Essentially none of what you pick up at Columbia is relevant to your working life. So when you're applying for jobs or programs or whatever, you have more access depending on how prestigious your school is. Columbia, being part of the ivy league, remains quite prestigious.

This is not the same thing as saying that Columbia has excellent teaching. ""Prestige"" is tied to grant money, so faculty are hired if they are excellent researchers. So like at most R1 schools, plenty of the professors can't teach for shit.",1579434797,1,0

"Assuming equal/roughly comparable financial aid... go to CLS if you want to do big law. NYU has a stronger public interest network and places better at top fellowships like Skadden, EJW, etc.

&gt;I heard the 1L professors suck

The 1L professors at CLS are hit or miss. I would not say they uniformly ""suck."" I highly doubt they are meaningfully worse than NYU's cadre.
&gt;students self segregate and are cliquey

Welcome to law school. 
&gt;I didn't feel like the school did not care about the students but that's what I keep hearing

I doubt any law school really cares all that much about its students, other than ensuring that they get some job after graduation so their NALP statistics don't decline, but I will say that while the Registrar is a mess, I have found helpful people at the career services office and I think they're improving overall.",1579402096,1,0
"This is not particularly accurate. NYU and CLS are in the same bracket in the legal field w/r/t name recognition, and the big law percentages are [roughly comparable](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/columbia_tops_list_of_go_to_law_schools) (CLS at 68% vs NYU at 57%, which puts CLS at #1 and NYU at #3). Yes, if you're absolutely set on big law and you expect to be a median student, CLS is the safer bet, but you'd hardly be a ""real idiot"" if you chose NYU instead. If NYU is giving you more financial aid, you should pick NYU.",1579401598,1,0

"Current 3L. Like pretty much everyone that goes to CLS, I had the choice between the two. I have loved my time here, and it got me exactly where I want in terms of my career. I have found the majority of the professors to be good at their jobs. There are of course exceptions.   
   
Biggest downsides in my mind are the crap administration. It is really pretty awful, the different offices are bloated and yet seemingly understaffed at the same time? It seems like you can never get a clear answer to anything. Also, the facilities suck. The building is ugly and the size of the school means fighting for study space. Just try walking through JG at noon on a weekday, it is a madhouse.   
   
Biggest positives: if you want to do big law, there is no school better equipped to get you to the top firms besides perhaps Harvard. The V10s doors are wide open, and even the prestigious boutique firms get a lot of CLS students joining. I enjoyed my classmates, have a strong group of friends from here. I think it gets a bit “cliquey” because of how CLS puts students into their legal methods classes with their sections. For the first few weeks it is only 1Ls on campus and everyone is in a single class with their section. It makes people gravitate to the people they know. I didn’t see it as a downside thought, I really enjoyed it. Finally, I actually liked the location a lot. It is a lot easier to get good housing at CLS than NYU (unless you are willing to pay a boatload). It is also nice to not be smack dab in the heart of the city all the time. NYU is in a super busy area, when you are on Columbia’s campus you feel like you can escape from the noise sometimes.   
   
Happy to answer any more questions.",1579355070,1,0
"I’m a current 3L. CLS is an amazing place and I have never regretted choosing it over NYU even as a public interest student. Some professors are duds, but the vast majority of them are wonderful. People form friend groups, of course, but again the vast majority of people are super nice, helpful, and open. It is easy to meet people in your 1L section and through the many student organizations. Also, in terms of placement, you’d have to actively try not to come out with a job in big law.

I do agree that the administration leaves something to be desired, but they are working on making it better, and the occasional annoyance hasn’t really mattered in the face of the rest of the experience.",1579351565,1,0
"Professors were great in my experience. 

Maybe people self segregate, but I can’t imagine it’s any different at any other school. 

The Columbia administration sucks. I have no point of comparison with other schools (I did undergrad there too), but it seems like there is a culture of mediocrity laziness. Just frustrating when you’re trying to figure out how to fill out a form or have a financial aid issue.  Not the end of the world, and maybe I value customer service more than other people. 

Advising was good though. And the recruiting process was super streamlined. 

I can’t think of a reason to prefer nyu of Columbia. Maybe if there is a professor there that you’d like to work with?",1579335225,1,0

"My horror stories about New Sports Club. I've belonged to more than one branch:

* I froze my membership for the summer but was not supposed to be charged an administrative fee. I was charged anyway and no number of calls and emails changed the situation.
* There was a hideous, fat and not fit woman trainer who kept trying to pressure me into taking sessions with her despite my clear lack of interest.
* After Super Storm Sandy, I called and called to see if the gym was open as it was not in an area that was hit badly by the storm. The phone kept ringing and they didn't even put on a message. When I finally walked down there, it was closed.
