I do know someone who does regret it. She had no plan, was just going to college to go to college. Took random classes just to stay full time. Ended up declaring sociology midway through junior year because that's what she had the most credits towards. Realized halfway through senior year that she had no plan for what she was going to do after graduation, and signed up for teach for America just because she couldn't find another job. Didn't work a single day the whole 4 years, and now just constantly posts on Facebook how unfair student loans are.

If you have any degree of a plan it's a great choice. If you're hoping to just get by on the name, you should probably take some time to figure that out first.",1581204480,8,0

I sometimes regret coming here from California. Food isn‚Äôt as good while being more expensive than back home, much less things to do, etc.

"A little. I could have enrolled at an easier in-state uni that I probably would have a way higher GPA at while paying less money closer to home, but at the same time it would not have anywhere near the same draw or recognizability as Michigan as an institution and would not have challenged me as I am being right now. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll pay off in the future, but the workload and competitiveness feels a bit crushing atm. My parents told me about how great a school it is and how well respected it is in the professional world, so that keeps me going a bit lol.

No regrets with anything socially/etc though, it‚Äôs not like there are worse students here than other universities or something haha. In fact, I think the students here, while competitive as I said, are still willing to help and aren‚Äôt petty. 

For example, at UC Berkeley during one of their CS intro classes last year, they had this policy where once the first person asked to use the bathroom during the final exam, no more late attendees to the final would be let in the room. IMMEDIATELY after they were told to start, someone asked to use the bathroom. Presumably it was to prevent people from entering and not that they‚Äôd been busting lol. I don‚Äôt really blame them for using that strat, moreso the course admins, but it‚Äôs still a dick move.

Might be cause there are so many polite/nice midwesterners lol, but I‚Äôd never think that would happen here. Like you hear of people stealing notebooks or whatever to get ahead at other unis, I just don‚Äôt get that vibe here. I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre kinda like USC in that there are tonnes of smart kids that know how to act as human beings and not just 4.0 chasing robots lol. Not that chasing a 4.0 is a bad thing, I just find having a complete lack of empathy for other students in order to get a higher number that is pretty meaningless in the long run to be not desirable.",1581203937,27,0

"True to a degree, but if you want to go into, say, consulting, a high gpa is desired no matter the major. Someone from Ross/IOE would probably have a better shot on average than someone in CS, just due to averages being higher.

Ofc not many fields have these highly interdisciplinary applicants, like obv if you're going into aerospace they'll look at your gpa in comparison to all aerospace GPAs, which are going to be low.

Especially if the place you're going attracts outside investment, those investors will want to see kids being recruited with high GPAs to indicate strong recruitment. This is especially true with hedge funds, compared to prop shops which don't have to appeal to outside people and are more lenient.",1581187225,1,0

If you‚Äôre a commuter your best option is to go for the student yellow/orange. Orange will allow you to park at the stadium and take a commuter blue bus closer to central campus. The yellow will allow you to park at both the stadium and Elbel. Although since Michigan purchased the land next to Elbel there‚Äôs been more parking available, it still fills up fast in the mornings, though there‚Äôs typically parking spots available throughout the day. My guess would be that land won‚Äôt be extra parking for long, so don‚Äôt get to use to the closer parking. If your spot off campus is fairly close and affordable just keep that, parking at U of M is not all that great without a blue pass.",1581183782,1,0
"You can sometimes rent spots in public lots, but those are crazy expensive. The University of Michigan parking structures on central are blue lots and are only available to certain students and staff.  There are commuter lots on North campus and near the crisler center. Those are available to students junior year and above. There is also park and ride lots available from the Ann arbor busses. I use the crisler yellow commuter lot and it's great, I have never had trouble finding a spot and there is a blue bus that picks up right next to the lot. It's also the most affordable way to park at Michigan.

"Draw out a model of a 5 stage pipelined processor, and run some instructions through it like they probably did in class. Understand the data flow, wait states, and squash conditions for branch instructions. 

Specifically, look at the connections needed between Fetch/ALU and Decode/MEM stages for branch speculation/squash and data forwarding. Walk through some code with both of these implemented and keep track of how many clock cycles these features save or lose (if a branch is squashed) for each type of hazard.

This will give you practice with the language, since you'll have to write test code that has each of the data hazard types (RAW, WAR, etc.), and branch or structural hazards. And then using the code in the pipeline as described above will help you better understand that.

Practice writing a state machine will also be good. I'm not sure how far into the material you are, but understanding caches and virtual memory really just come down to doing examples with using them.

Edit: for me, the midterm wasn't to bad honestly, if you run through examples with the pipeline a bunch. The final was hell, because I didn't pay attention to the lectures or study much for the caches, file systems, and virtual memory.

"All my research is computationally-based so thankfully it doesn't really impact me at all. My advisor advised us to work from home and is doing our weekly meetings by skype.

Our department sent out an email saying that anyone who doesn't absolutely need to be in the department building shouldn't be coming in, so as of right now experimentalist can probably still be dong their work but IDK what those folk are doing in reality. Not sure if the advice has changed since then because I haven't really been following it because I'm staying home anyway.

I need to take my qualifying exams in a couple months though and usually studying involves a lot of collaborative quizing and mock sessions from other graduate students - which obviously isn't happening right now. So that's a bit of a bummer.

"Thank you for your reply!

The program seems extremely helpful. Particularly the advisor and priority admission for programs like UROP (which is a huge bonus because I‚Äôm really looking to do some research and will be looking more into that program). I guess the only question I have (and this is clearly more of a personal one) is why I was admitted. I go to a solid public school that sends anywhere between 2 and 10 students to U of M a year, I go to a Math and Science Center half the day at a university about 40 minutes out, take all AP classes, etc... the point I‚Äôm trying to make is I have a lot of (and partake in) the opportunities that normal accelerated students have. And no one else at my school has gotten into this program. I have a relatively low gpa, but I attribute this to rigor and laziness in highschool, not my background or situation. Is my gpa most likely the reason for my admittance? And would I have not gotten into u of m if it weren‚Äôt for this program? I know you probably won‚Äôt be able to answer these questions but it just makes me think. Nevertheless I plan on taking full advantage of the aforementioned resources.",1585488991,1,0
"CSP student here! There‚Äôs a common misconception that CSP is only for ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù/POC students only &amp; such. But it‚Äôs really a lot more than supporting diversity within the U of M community, plus you don‚Äôt get into the program on the basis of race. So far my experience with CSP has been amazing. First semester of my freshmen year I took CSP 101 with Keith Jason, an absolutely amazing advisor through the CSP program. It was a 1 credit course that went over everything from study skills, to how to build your resume, and practicing health and wellness while at college. If you‚Äôre ever looking to fill your schedule with an easy mini course that is worth your time‚Äî I would highly recommend. You‚Äôll get your own advisor through the CSP program which may seem excessive at first but it‚Äôs extremely helpful especially when registration begins and advisors start to get booked for appointments. I also prefer my CSP advisor to my Newnan advisor, she‚Äôs been super down to earth, helpful, and compassionate throughout my first year. CSP also offers a ton of free support through the program. Students are offered free tutoring for a variety of subjects, which I found super useful for when I took Stats 250. Not to mention CSP students get priority for certain programs like UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program) and also for CSP sections of certain classes. Currently I am in the CSP section of Biology 171, my professor Cynthia Giffen is hands down one of the best instructors I have ever had in my life. CSP sections tend to be smaller and may move through material differently than the typical sections do. I find this to be very helpful especially coming from a smaller high school, my lecture is around 80 people. We also meet for an extra day of discussion unlike the normal sections, which has been such a benefit for me in regards to retaining the material, but this isn‚Äôt the case for all CSP classes. You‚Äôll also find that your CSP sections will be more diverse than your typical classes, the classroom environment overall is a positive and accepting place. I‚Äôve made some great friends in my CSP courses and it‚Äôs definitely made my undergraduate experience a heck of a lot better.

"Congrats on your acceptance! Honestly speaking, the premed track at Umich is pretty tough, especially if you're not coming in as a transfer and thus don't have any core credits to bring over. The early biology, statistics, physics, and chemistry classes required for premed students here are widely considered ""weeder"" classes. Essentially, they are classes that shouldn't be as rigorous and demanding as they are, but are intentionally kept difficult to ""weed out"" premed students. I am one of many students here that I know who has fallen off the premed track, largely because I just \*hated\* the experience I was having in most of these classes. That being said, once you get to higher level content (ie. 300, 400 level courses), the nitpicking tends to noticeably decline, even disappearing in many cases. 

There are a lot of research opportunities available here that you can definitely take advantage of and use to your benefit. I'd advise you look into UROP, especially if you are coming in as a freshman. That will also get your foot in the door in applying to research labs over the next few years.

I can't speak with complete confidence, but in my experience, grade inflation in general is quite rare in LSA. They do curve grades in some of the chemistry courses you'll be taking, but that is only because the exams are pretty brutal and something like an 85% is understandably deemed an A (ie. the department isn't really doing anyone any favors). In general, Umich is a difficult school, \*especially\* with regards to STEM courses. Even diligent students frequently have a hard time maintaining a 3.5+ GPA. Don't beat yourself up if you're having a hard time. Honestly, classes tend to get easier (in terms of grading) as you move up from the 100's &amp; 200's to the 300's &amp; 400's, so a positive trend in academic performance is quite reasonable to expect in most students putting in the work.

Professors are pretty hit or miss. I would say the majority are hits, but there are notable exceptions (especially in the statistics department in my experience), who will make your head want to explode. Honestly, your best bet, as always, is to check out 'rate my professor' before registering for a course. If everyone is saying bad things, it's probably not just a one-time disgruntled student... That being said... you will have many GSI's during your time here on a premed track, and this can really be a complete lottery. I've had GSI's who could barely speak English trying to teach microbiology. But then I've also had GSI's who were so on top of everything they were putting the professor to shame. My advice here is to make use of resources like the Science Learning Center and general office hours if you need help and your professor/GSI isn't cutting it. Remember too, that you can often sit in on other professor's lectures in your free time, assuming there's space.

Umich as a school is pretty competitive, and I'd say that the premed track can somewhat highlight that. People come in knowing that less than half of their peers who say they want to attend medical school will actually go on to do so, and no one wants to believe that they'll be one of the ones that ""doesn't make it."" I think this leads people to really go hard in the first few semesters, to prove themselves if you will. But I think that this does die down as you go through the years here and people start to actually take courses because they're genuinely interested in the material being taught. You do also have a somewhat toxic ""I bet I get less sleep than you"" atmosphere here, especially in the weeks surrounding exams. My advice here, and with all of this, is to just try and find a group of friends or even just study partners who genuinely make you relaxed and feel good. Obviously it's important that you work hard, but don't surround yourself with people who just stress you out. You'll be stressed out enough already.",1585468511,1,0

Here's something I found about the career resources for Ross minor:

&gt;Minor in Business students have view-only access to job postings by companies recruiting through the Ross School of Business. Students will be able to independently reach out to recruiters and companies through contact information provided by these postings. Students are also able to attend select workshops and seminars.

Students may enter resume information in order to generate an iMpact resume. Company recruiters may message students or invite them to presentations. If a company recruiter identifies you as a potential candidate, the recruiter may work with Ross Career Services to schedule an interview.

Students are encouraged to continue to work with their career resources in their home school/college, as these offices are best equipped to understand degree programs and career opportunities. The U-M Career Center is a campus-wide resource for all students. Students will have some access to walk-in career advising with peer coaches within Ross Career Services.

Students do not have access to the interview bidding system, nor do they have access to schedule appointments with career consultants.

I will warn you that for CS minor getting into ULCS's is difficult due to enrollment issues plus EECS 280 and 281 could be rough on your GPA. 

I would also **strongly recommend the Multidisciplinary Program Minor.

"I was supposed to study abroad in London. I had applied to and received several scholarships that resulted in the entire thing being covered. It was only three weeks, so not the whole summer, but when am I ever going to have another opportunity to see London for free?

I was accepted (very quickly) for the winter semester of my sophomore year.

UROP is the main way how freshmen get into early research, but you can still get cold call or talk to your professors for research positions.

For those who are current pre meds could you describe how competitive it is at Michigan? I know any institution is competitive but is it overly competitive like a place such as JHU? How many pre meds end up applying to medical school?
-I personally didn‚Äôt experience too much competitiveness. The classes are difficult and exams are made to have a certain grade distribution so in that sense you are sort of competing for a grade. I easily made other premed friends and people are very willing to study together. 

Is it hard to get the classes you want?
-I had a lot of AP/IB credit so I always had an early registration date. 

How hard is it to get research opportunities beginning your freshmen year? Would I be able to start in a research lab at the medical center?
-I did UROP for one semester but ended up in a different lab via a connection with a professor for the last 3 years. I did depression research in psych department so can‚Äôt really speak to how hard it is to get into labs at hospital. 

Would labs accept me if I don‚Äôt do UROP?
-Yes, I was able to use UROP as a jumping off point to get a different research position, but certainly not necessity. 

How hard is it to get other pre-med extra curricular opportunities like shadowing and volunteering?
-I was able to volunteer at Mott Children‚Äôs Hospital and VA. I am from the area so I used personal connections to get shadowing experience off campus. 

Is the pre-med advising helpful since there is so many students?
-I was in the honors program so we had our own advisor who was very accessible. 

How many students from Michigan undergrad tend to be accepted at the Michigan medical school? Is it higher than average?
-UM grads do better than national averages in general https://careercenter.umich.edu/article/um-graduates‚Äô-medical-school-application and more UM med schools admits come from UM undergrad than any other institution https://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/sites/medicine.umich.edu.medschool/files/files/tracker/UMHS11580_5YearAdmissInfographic.pdf

Since I‚Äôm OOS would I still be at a disadvantage when applying to Michigan medical school even if I do my undergrad at Michigan?
-Maybe slightly? UM Med School has a pretty significant OOS population, see that infographic above 

Do you have to apply to be a part of clubs like at Penn or is it more relaxed to join clubs?
-Maybe some but plenty you don‚Äôt have to

How hard is it to get into honors? How do I apply and when?
-I just had to write an additional essay. Last date to apply for this fall is April 7  https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/applytohonors/deadlines-requirements/

Do any of you regret your decision, why?
-Definitely not, classes for tough but I was well prepared for the MCAT and did well. There are so many opportunities, you just have to take the initiative to take advantage of them.

"\- For those who are current pre meds could you describe how competitive it is at Michigan? I know any institution is competitive but is it overly competitive like a place such as JHU? How many pre meds end up applying to medical school?

I agree with the other poster on this one. I honestly have noticed little competition here, people are generally nice and helpful. Classes are very difficult to do well in, but usually they are set up in a way that anyone can get an A, so putting your classmates down does not affect your grade. So yes, classes are very very hard, but they are not made harder by students being competitive.

\- Is it hard to get the classes you want?

For pre med classes, not really. They are very large classes that don't generally run out of space in my experience. It can be difficult to get into other smaller classes at any time, but there are so many options that usually you can easily find something else to fulfill a requirement if necessary.

\- How hard is it to get research opportunities beginning your freshmen year? Would I be able to start in a research lab at the medical center?

\-Would labs accept me if I don‚Äôt do UROP?

I'm going to lump these two together. As long as you are diligent, it is not that difficult. As someone who did UROP, I'm not sure exactly how difficult it is to get into a lab without it, but I would consider doing UROP, it was helpful for me. Otherwise, you just have to email a lot of labs (10-20+) and show genuine interest in their labs. Many people are interested in hiring freshmen.

\- How hard is it to get other pre-med extra curricular opportunities like shadowing and volunteering?

If you have a car, super easy. If you are limited to resources on campus, a little more difficult but absolutely possible. Throughout my time here I have volunteered at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital and Hope Clinic, because I was able to drive off campus. My friends who looked for opportunities on campus have volunteered at UM Hospital and Ronald McDonald House. There are also TONS of other opportunities.

\- Is the pre-med advising helpful since there is so many students?

In my experience, yes. It's not difficult to get an appointment, but you may have to wait a week or more at busy times. There are also walk-in advising appointments every week where you don't need an appointment. They work very hard to be accessible.

\- How many students from Michigan undergrad tend to be accepted at the Michigan medical school? Is it higher than average?

Yes, it is higher than average. That said, they only accept 177 people total, so it is safe to say they only take the best of the best from UM, so it is still very very difficult. I would not base your college decision about your possibility of getting into the med school here.

\- Since I‚Äôm OOS would I still be at a disadvantage when applying to Michigan medical school even if I do my undergrad at Michigan?

Yes you would, but there would still be a consideration for doing your undergrad here. I stand by what I said above on this too.

\- Do you have to apply to be a part of clubs like at Penn or is it more relaxed to join clubs?

Some clubs you apply to, some just accept everyone. There are a ridiculous number of clubs here, so I'm positive you can find a few you would like to join. I personally don't participate in clubs so I am not an expert here by any means,

How hard is it to get into honors? How do I apply and when?

I am not sure, but you will definitely get emails about it so no worries on not hearing about applying. I don't think it's overly difficult but again, I'm not sure.

Do any of you regret your decision, why?

No, I do not regret my decision. There are things I wish I knew before coming in, especially that this school is HARD. It takes vastly more time to study for exams now than in high school, and many of the pre med classes are set up with an average grade of a B-. If you come here you are accepting that your GPA will likely be lower. Besides that, UM is an amazing place with amazing people and opportunities and it is definitely where I feel I belong.

Finally, why did you choose Michigan for pre med?

I chose UM because it made me feel better that it was a big name and that everyone would know what I was talking about when I said I was going here. I also felt the research opportunities would be much more abundant here than other smaller schools, which has held up to be true.

A few of the guys from my league played there too and said it was a pretty similar experience. Veterans also has leagues where you sign up as a team if you can get in with someone putting a roster together.

As for what the central ICC did, I was extremely unhappy with their response. They sent around workers to install permanent soap and paper towel dispensers but that‚Äôs about the only thing the central organization did. They didn‚Äôt encourage people to move out, offer rent reductions, or acknowledge the people who moved out and made houses safer for those who had to stay. They‚Äôre proceeding with summer contracts as usual, with the exception that all rooms will be single for social distancing. 

You also have to consider the behavior of your housemates, and the fact that you can‚Äôt control who they interact with or bring over to the house (which affects your risk). I definitely had some housemates who were acting like everything was normal and still being friends over.

The first half could be applicable to some interviews/leetcode problems, but the second half is pretty unlikely to be useful for such purposes.

"A few things not in the article:

* This is technically an ""expansion"" to Beyster, but the new building (CSI) is 165k sq. ft., while Beyster is about 100k. This sounds great for the CSE division, but only 100k is ""useable"" space, and half that is going to SI. In the end it's about a 50k sq. ft. expansion for CSE.
* For SI, this is great since they've been scattered across Ann Arbor in like 6 different places.
* For CSE, it'll be an expansion of the same things currently in Beyster (classrooms, offices, labs, and collaborative space).
* Unless the design changes or I misunderstood the presentation, CSI will be a U-shape with a courtyard and the bottom of the U next to Beyster (in other words the courtyard will be open to the west).
* It's unclear to me what it will look like, but Integrated Design Solutions is not the firm that designed Beyster (which was designed by Diamond Schmitt). So it might look quite a bit different.

"A few months ago while looking through pictures of North Campus in the [Bentley Historical Library Image Bank](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhl?page=index) I came across this one labeled, [‚ÄòYoung man spars with goat at Community Organic Garden‚Äô](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhl/x-hs7239/hs7239), which made me curious about what exactly was going on on North Campus in the 70s. 

In 1971 U-M, working with the [Ecology Center](https://www.ecocenter.org/) established an experimental 7 acre community garden on North Campus. It was on the northern side of Fuller Road, as best I can tell on the site of what today are parking lots and (depending on how far it extended) possibly LBME and the Ford Library. 

All members of the U-M and Ann Arbor community were invited to participate, the Ecology Center estimates that over 200 people volunteered during the first year. I couldn‚Äôt figure out exactly when the garden lasted until but it was at least through 1974. 

The [Ecology Center website](https://ecologycenter.umhistorylabs.lsa.umich.edu/s/ecohistory/page/community-organic-garden) has a more detailed write up on the project. While community gardens and organic gardening are fairly common now, it was not that way when this project was started (just a year after the first Earth Day).

He'd go through a proof for each lecture, but he hadn't prepared ahead of time so he'd get halfway through it, realise he made a mistake and try to erase things and go back to fix random parts. So my notes would be a total mess of correct and incorrect info.

It just reminds me of how crazy it is that research professors are forced to teach. It's such a separate skill set, some professors are brilliant in their field but can't teach a class and other brilliant teachers are forced to write papers and keep publishing or they can't get tenure and the students lose them.

Had no idea what was going on and one of the GSIs even had office hours during the lecture time (???) Professor was so afraid of cheating that he sent out multiple long announcements before the final making threats about how to punish students for cheating. He also made an entire seating chart for the final but students sat diagonally from one another like a checkerboard which meant we could see the full screens of the two students in front of us (???). The exam average was 47% where the highest grade was 75%. I saw multiple people crying after the final and I remembered laughing/crying for a solid 3 minutes because I knew I bombed the exam.

If you enjoy taking psychology, philosophy, econ, information science courses, then they will be a happy additional to your degree as the COGSCI major lets you pad your track with courses from the other tracks.

Should you opt not to take any more CS courses (which is totally up to you, they're hard but super rewarding both on an personal learning and employable level). Feel free to check out the other tracks since they are also very cool.

Finally, job prospects are all over the place.. I know for a fact that you can pursue software if you do computation.

"&gt;I saw my essay scores for my admission application . They were like, 1.5 or 2 / 5. This makes me really feel like my race (Hispanic) is a huge part of what got me in.

Essays matter a lot less than people like to imagine they do.  They may make a difference for a marginal applicant, one where they are on the fence.  Then great essays can either convince the committee you're even better than the rest of the application suggests, or at least make them feel like taking a chance on you is valid.  Doesn't sound like that was the case with you.  So don't think a non-spectacular score on your essay means you were ready for rejection.  There are lots of non-spectacular essay writers admitted to this campus.

Also, thanks to the affirmative action ban, it wasn't your race that got you in.  It is true that UM examines applications closely for other kinds of under-representation, so it's possible that coming from a non-affluent neighborhood or taking a non-traditional path to college was a factor that helped you.  Maybe it's thin comfort to think ""it's not my skin but it was my address"" but it's more than that, it's UM considering that your academic success came under conditions that may have made it harder for you to succeed.  

Transfer admissions can be a little less selective than freshman admissions.  That doesn't mean they make more mistakes or take worse people; it means there are fewer applicants per opening, generally, and more to the point, the folks who evaluate your application have more confidence when they've seen you've coped with college-level work before.  Yes, maybe your previous courses at a community college got you easy A's. But there are kids who *don't* get A's in those classes.  Maybe the reason they were so easy for you isn't just because they were so simple and unrigorous, but because you have a head for the subject and also you had your head out of your ass enough to turn in assignments and show up to class.   U-M may be tougher, but that doesn't mean you and your academic interests and your intellect and work ethic don't belong here.

It totally sucks to feel isolated and I'm sorry about that.  

People grow and change during college, emotionally and intellectually.  Since you are a little older, you've done a lot of that already.  So the disconnect you feel with other students when talking about topics isn't necessarily surprising.  You're just ahead of where some of them are emotionally and intellectually.  I'm not saying this to run them down, it's human development.  I know that's not necessarily comforting but understand that it's not because you don't belong.  You're outnumbered, but you deserve to be here.

I see you've had some suggestions for resources.  Another place you could reach out to is CEW+.  They work with nontraditional students.  When they were founded, they were more oriented towards women who were going back to college while juggling family responsibilities but they do more than that now.  I dunno what they can tell you in terms of ""finding your people"" but I absolutely know that they have experience in dealing with students who are trying to figure out how they fit into UM.  I also think you might find some common ground with veterans, although I don't know if the vets groups are open to non-vets.

You seem like a thoughtful, smart person.  I can't think of a better kind of person to have at UM.  I hope things get a little easier.",1589744904,1,0

"From my experience, yes. I took most of my notes on my iPad during my freshman year and it was super convenient.  There was one class out of the 8 that I took where the professor said no technology, but the rest didn't care.  Especially in larger lectures like you'll be attending during freshman year, most people have their laptop or iPad out to take notes.  So, in my opinion, it's definitely worth it!",1589744036,1,0
"For CS, definitely you can take notes with iPad. I used a Surface Pro through my 203, 280, and 281, and they allowed it.

Meanwhile, some classes in some other departments might disallow the use of such technologies. For example, Professor Brian Porter-Szucs from the History department doesn't allow technology use in class, but in that case you can just use a notebook.",1589743882,1,0

you definitely aren't going to be getting transfer credit for 281. i've seen it for 376 but never for an ULCS like 477,1589726819,1,0
"Whether you're in LSA or CoE, you can get credit for EECS 370 and 376 based on the course equivalency list for your previous institution, but I've read that they do not allow upper level CS credit taken somewhere else. However it is possible to have an upper level transfer as ""300-level department"", which would be a flex-tech if you're in CoE, but unfortunately only general elective if you're in LSA. Of the 100-200-levels, I believe EECS 281 is the only one you cannot get credit for.

I think even people who worked at tech companies before and want to get a CS degree still have to trudge through the required stuff and ULCS courses, even if they specialized in that (or higher level stuff) before. I wouldn't know of anyone testing their way out of that stuff tbh",1589726775,1,0

Someone also said that many schools like UMich end up having an air of ""corporate"" the closest friends I have here feel more like work colleagues than actual friends so that's true.

"Doing well in high school does not directly translate to doing well in college.  Maybe this is an indication that you need to step back and assess your strategy for completing assignments, taking tests, participating in class, etc. to determine why you are not meeting your goals.  It is understandable that you will slip every once in a while in life and not meet expectations that you have set for yourself.  The trick is properly adjusting to the adversity you face and coming out the other side a better person.

The following is an example of what I am talking about:  I scored lower than I had planned to score on the first Physics 240 exam one semester.  At the time, it was the lowest score I had ever received relative to the class's curve.  I was very disappointed with myself, and after a brief period of pouting and ""feeling sorry for myself"", I sat down and tried to figure out what I could have done to score better on the test.  I eventually realized that even if the test taker understood the material well, in order to achieve a high score they needed to be able to rapidly recall the required information and precisely perform calculations.  I had not been able to do either of those tasks when taking the test. Therefore, leading up to the next test, I designed a practice routine that I would work through every day.   I used a large bank of test problems and tried to answer the questions as quickly as I could to practice in a simulated test scenario.  I would give myself less time that than I would have during the test to do a similar number of problems.  I reminded myself what some famous athlete had once said (paraphrasing), ""Practice should be so hard that games are easy.""  With this new strategy, I scored up to my expectations on all of the remaining tests.

So to apply this to your situation, you first need to ask yourself a few questions and determine what the honest answer to those questions are.  Are you having difficulty understanding the material taught in the class (affecting all assignments)?  Do you understand the material, but perform poorly on routine assignments?  Are you struggling with group work in the classes (i.e. you would have performed well on a congruent single person assignment, but didn't perform well in the group version)?  Are you doing well on routine assignments/projects but not performing well on tests?

Once you have identified what areas of the class you are struggling in, divert resources to  try to fix that problem.  If there are multiple problems, try to generate a strategy that is capable of jointly solving multiple problems.  There are many routes that you can take from this point and that depends on your specific situation.  However, don't just give up.  If you have the attitude that ""there is nothing I can do"" and just give up, you are basically just writing yourself off as being unable to accomplish goals you have set for yourself.  You may be in a situation where you can only achieve B's, and as some of the other comments have covered that is not particularly a bad thing at a school such as U of M.  But should always strive to do better, and that is what I'm hoping that you will try to do.",1589725598,1,0
