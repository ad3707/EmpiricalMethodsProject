"Why are you so upset about being downvoted? If you strongly believe you are right then who cares if I downvoted you. I downvoted because using bubonic plague as your example greatly misrepresented how the virus was spread. Bubonic plague spread fast becaude it was transmitted by fleas and there was shitty sanitation. You are inciting unnecessary panic for others by comparing bubonic plague to coronavirus.

I don't think you really understand the situation. Coronavirus is being treated a lot differently than how SARS was treated. Coronavirus was definitely badly dealt with in the beginning. The officials covered it up, but China has received enough backlash from everyone who still remembered the nighmare that was SARS that they are actually putting in effort to update their infection statistics. I was definitely old enough to remember how shittily SARS was dealt with.

You also don't seem to be understanding why the virus is spreading quickly. It's lunar new year, and billions of Chinese people travelled to other provinces. If you google ""chinese new year traffic"" you may get a better idea. What I'm saying is that the chinese new year rush may have distorted the infectivity statistics because you are getting high number of infections not in a normal context, but because there is massively amplified rate of human contact and travel. This may or may not have cause overrepresentation of the virus's infection rate, we never know. But we do know that lunar new year happened so it is very likely. The Wuhan officials definitely did a shitty job of quarantining the city too late and allow the virus to spread. But now they are actually actively working with WHO to report the stats. I know we all like to point fingers at China and rightfully so, but not this time. They have amped up their reporting for the virus. 

If you say that the worrying part is its high infectivity rate and not it being dangerous then why even shut down schools for that? People don't shut down schools for flu. This year's flu season was especially bad and even then people aren't shutting schools for that. You only shut down schools when the virus poses a definite threat. One person in LA county definitely doesn't warrant that. Only when an outbreak is present then should it be a case for mass concern. 

I mean, no shit. Obviously the genetic code is different hence why it's a new strain of coronavirus and a weaker one than SARS. You are obviously contradicting your own points by saying it's not even comparable to flu and then saying it's a reason for mass panic and comparing it to the bubonic plague. Going from your point that the infectivity is a point of concern and not how dangerous it is, then cancelling schools is going to make people panic far more than not cancelling schools because then people are actually think it is super serious, and lead to panic and going to the hospitals for any flu-like symptom they think they have. That's how you overwhelm hospitals. I don't think you've considered that at all. Also if the transmission rate was really a case for concern then why aren't any universities or public schools cancelling their classes right now at all? Or surely maybe at least one person has the brain for that.  

But hey, I may be wrong and you are right. But why am I still rebutting you at all? Because unnecessary panic never solves anything and only serves to make things worse. Just keep calm and do the best preventative measures that you can.  But of course, who am I to take advice from my professor with a PhD in virology and not someone without any credentials online who thinks he knows better than someone who spent years studying viruses ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",1580101144,0,0

Regardless of it being dangerous or not if too many people get infected that‚Äôs a problem. They just don‚Äôt have that much data regarding how fast this can spread. Cancel tours seriously as if that‚Äôs going to cut the transmission rate? You can‚Äôt stop it if this virus has a high transmission rate. It‚Äôs Los Angeles for fucks sake we have a large traffic of people. And thanks for the downvote. I‚Äôm saying that this new mutated coronavirus is weird in the sense that China not anyone else has figured out why it‚Äôs spreading so quickly despite quarantine measures. It‚Äôs not dangerous, but it is definitely spreading much faster than the flu for example.

The problem is that if this spreads quicker than expected can we manage the symptoms of many many people? Obviously this isn‚Äôt a hard thing to manage, but if a lot of people have it it will be. It‚Äôs not dangerous, but it can become dangerous when a lot more people get infected especially in places where hospitals don‚Äôt have the capacity to treat everyone. You clearly missed my point. It‚Äôs unexpected because we don‚Äôt know much about it not that it‚Äôs dangerous. It‚Äôs still spreading fast in China and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs alarming.

"Look, here's the entire section about termination: (tldr, just read the first sentence of 8.b. that is the ONLY clue as to HOW to terminate the contract. It boils down to: ""ask nicely"").

\---

8. TERMINATION.

a. The University may terminate this Contract and all attendant rights of occupancy without cause by giving to the Tenant 30-day advance written Termination of Tenancy notice in the event Tenant has lived in the premises for less than one year and 60-day advance written Termination of Tenancy notice in the event Tenant has lived in the premises for one year or more. In the event state law governing such notices changes after execution of this Contract, the University may give such notice as then allowed by law.

**b. Tenant may terminate this Contract only with written approval of the University.** In the event of University approval of the cancellation of this Contract, the effective termination date will be the date of the University approval. Tenant shall remain responsible for all charges until the termination date. Tenant shall be entitled to a refund of pro-rated charges for any such charges paid beyond the effective termination date, less any outstanding amounts owed as allowed by law, provided Tenant, if in residence, has completed the established checkout procedure. Tenants who withdraw or are dismissed from the University must meet with University Apartments Management to obtain a Contract Termination Referral Form.

c. It is Tenant‚Äôs responsibility to furnish the Housing Assignment Office with evidence of suspension or dismissal from the University within seven days of the effective date of dismissal. In the event of marriage, Tenant must present a marriage certificate; this Contract will be terminated on the date that evidence is presented to the Housing Assignment Office if the marriage ceremony occurs during the term of this Contract.

d. The Contract may be terminated if Tenant fails to attend the University for any quarter or semester, as applicable, during the term of this Contract in which Tenant has contracted to be an occupant of University Housing. Written notification of nonattendance must be submitted to the Housing Assignment Office. In the event notification of nonattendance is received after the housing opens, a prorated charge will be made to the date written notification is received by the Housing Assignment Office. In addition, the Contract Termination Fee will be assessed.

e. Contract Termination Fee. A $400 Contract Termination Fee shall be paid by Tenant if terminating Tenant‚Äôs Housing Contract, unless the Contract is terminated as a result of circumstances beyond Tenant‚Äôs control as determined by the University in its sole discretion. The Contract Termination Fee may also be waived upon approval of the Director of Housing Services based upon compelling and unanticipated medical or financial problems arising clearly beyond the control of the Tenant. The Contract Termination Fee covers the University‚Äôs administrative costs resulting from Tenant vacating or failing to occupy the apartment, is agreed to be reasonable, and is accepted as the amount of liquidated damages caused by such circumstances because it is at this time impractical and difficult to determine actual damages. The Contract Termination Fee is in addition to any sums owed by Tenant for an unauthorized termination, such as, but not limit to, room fees until the end of the contract term or until a replacement tenant can be found, and assumes occupancy of the unit. It shall be Tenant‚Äôs responsibility to furnish University‚Äôs Housing Assignment Office with evidence of dismissal from the University within seven days of the effective date of dismissal. The Contract Termination Fee may be waived upon approval of the Director of Housing Services based upon compelling and unanticipated medical or financial problems arising that are clearly beyond Tenant‚Äôs control.

i. A Contract Termination Fee of $400 shall be paid by Tenant for any contract cancellation request received on or after the date the first payment required by the Housing Offer is received and accepted by the University. Requests for termination of the contract must be received no later than by 4:00 p.m. on the last business day prior to the start date of the contract.

f. In the event of dismissal, withdrawal from the University, or exclusion from University Housing due to disciplinary action, Tenant shall vacate the assigned apartment within 48 hours of receiving notification of exclusion from, or ineligibility for, University Housing, as is applicable. Tenant shall remain financially responsible for all payments until the date Tenant vacates. A prorated charge will be made for room and board until the date the Tenant vacates, provided Tenant, if in residence, and has completed the established checkout procedures.

g. Liquidated Damages. In the event the University prepares a Notice to Pay Rent/Perform Covenant due to the Tenant's failure to pay rent or to perform a covenant of this Agreement and (1) the Tenant pays said rent or performs said covenant or (2) the University agrees to rescind such Notice, the Tenant agrees to pay the University $50.00 as liquidated damages to cover the administrative costs involved in the preparation and service of said Notice.

i. In the event the University prepares and has served a Summons and Complaint and the University and the Tenant subsequently resolve their differences and the University allows the Tenant to continue to reside in the premises, the Tenant agrees to pay the University $50.00 as liquidated damages to cover the administrative costs involved in the preparation of the Summons and Complaint.

ii. It is agreed that it is extremely difficult or impractical for the University to ascertain its damages in the event of such a hold over, and that the liquidated damages amounts represent a reasonable sum calculated to cover damages to the University. The liquidated damages charged hereunder shall not prevent institution of eviction proceedings.

"Using the bubonic plague as an example is kinda... an overreaction. The plague spread around that quickly and was uncontrolled because poor sanitation led to the widespread replication of fleas. 

To be fair the mortality rate has been last reported to be around 3% and SARS was 10%. The mortality rate may have increased lately but the vast majority of the people who have died were immunocompromised people or those who already had existing illnesses. Even my professor who has a PhD in molecular biology and completed her thesis in virology says there is too much unnecessary panic. Being vigilant is good but unnecessary panic isn't going to do anything in the context of the situation. 

If the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health says there is no immediate threat and no action is required, then best take their word for it. I still remember how SARS and H1N1 was dealt with when high alert was warranted. For SARS classes were only cancelled when there were enough cases to warrant classes being cancelled. For H1N1 classes weren't cancelled at all. It would be a massive overreaction to cancel classes right now. If anything the most appropriate measure UCLA should do is to cancel their tours. Unnecessary panic and anxiety will only make you more susceptible to the virus.",1580099092,0,0

"That's pretty cool, I'm glad you've enjoyed the quarter system. I'm honestly wondering if its a problem with the math department trying to stuff too much material into a single course. I don't think I've ever gotten any review in my upper div math classes. In fact, I feel like there are things being left out that we should know in order to do some of these proofs. The amount of times where I get stuck on a problem, only to discover that I needed to know some ""trick"" that has never been mentioned or taught is super frustrating. Going to office hours my mind is constantly blown with the ""nuances"" that the professor talks about that are never mentioned in lecture because there isn't time. Often times the proofs presented in class are half baked or ""hand-wavy"", to the point where if I did the same thing on my homework or a midterm I would be docked points. Professors are constantly saying how we don't have time to go through a certain proof, or we are going to be skipping a section because we have to get to more important material. Math classes here would greatly benefit from the additional time provided by a semester system. I can only imagine what it would be like to actually go through an upper div math course thoroughly. Cause that has been so far from my experience at UCLA.",1581202991,2,0
"The biggest benefit is that you have a buffer. If something happens and you fall behind, you have time catch up. Also the more spread out semester means that class can have a more flexible and unique schedule, so there isn't as much of an issue like at UCLA with a lot of classes sharing the same week 4 and 8 midterm schedule, which can get overwhelming and hard for students to compensate for.",1581202563,1,0
percs and puppies?,1581201884,4,0
"I'm an engineering major, and I definitely prefer quarters to semesters for upper div  classes.  There's far too much variation in material to cover in semesters; even in our quarters, most classes I've been in have far too much review and repetition for my liking.  I don't even want to imagine what it would be like with 16 weeks instead of 10.

I mean, honestly, when I'm in an upper-div class that is 3 upper div prereqs deep, I cannot understand why we're going over some of the same material each of those three other upper div classes covered yet again for 1 or 2 lectures.  It's one thing to post a refresher worksheet or something on CCLE; it's another to waste class time on things that, at least officially, students are required to know before even signing up for the class.

That's not to say upper div classes in quarters are easy; they're not.  But they're not supposed to be easy.

Now, if we're talking about lower division courses, then maybe.  I took physics and math as semester classes before transferring, and even then, a couple of classes felt rushed even without review.  I blame that, though, on high school curriculum being nowhere near what it should be, leading colleges to have to cover more in lower div to ""catch up"".  I consider that another advantage of the transfer student model, however: you can spend more time on the fundamentals without affecting upper-div schedules.",1581201165,3,0
"It's literally not the same amount of material, though. From what I understand, UCLA's introductory biology sequence (LS 7A-C) is split across three 10-week quarters. At my undergrad, an equivalent sequence was two 15-week semesters.

"You can have a semester system and still ""block"" courses. There's no reason why a course needs to span the whole quarter or semester.

There are even other systems out there that result in much less pressure on the student. In my undergrad there was the semester system and all courses had to be within one semester, but they could be once every week over the whole semester or two full days back to back, or everything in between. Final exams were offered for each course once every month, for all 12 months of the year. No accumulation of several exams within only a few days.",1581200884,1,0

"**Hella**

Hella is an American slang term that originated in Oakland, California but has since spread to become native slang to all of northern California. It is used as an adverb such as in ""hella bad"" or ""hella good"" and was eventually added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2002. It is possibly a contraction of the phrase ""hell of a"" or ""hell of a lot [of]"", in turn reduced to ""hell of"", though some scholars doubt this etymology since its grammatical usage does not align with those phrases. It often appears in place of the words ""really"", ""a lot"", ""totally"", ""very"", and in some cases, ""yes"".

"They're raising fees while still lacking transparency about where their current spending goes.
https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/14/public-information-is-lacking-for-over-2-million-used-by-two-campus-committees/

&amp; historically USAC doesn't do much to benefit the student body, meanwhile they get to decide how much money we give to them on a quarterly basis ($200+ I believe?). The additional fee may not seem like a big deal but this is just a slippery slope towards them incrementally tacking on more &amp; more fees. I bet if they turned their attention towards tracking where their spending goes &amp; how to spend it most efficiently, they would have more than enough to do actual meaningful things. Instead they're being wreckless w their power &amp; forcing the burden onto students rather than taking accountability. 

Yesterday when someone posted about this fee increase (https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/fxy4rl/usac_is_once_again_trying_to_increase_your_fees/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), USAC's response was not to be civil &amp; listen to the concerns of their constituents, but instead to downvote &amp; suppress public opinion (https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/fyjyls/so_my_friend_is_a_lower_level_usac_affiliate_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), which is the opposite of what they should be doing as a glorified student council.

"WHERE ARE TRUE BRUIN VALUES

I‚Äôm making this reddit account because some of the stuff being posted on here is ridiculous. If USAC didn‚Äôt exist you‚Äôd probably be spending $1000s more every year on things like tuition, club due, laundry. USAC saves you money!!! 

I know y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want to pay $15 a quarter more. But do you want to pay the thousands of dollars uc regents want you to pay. Cause usac is who‚Äôs been stopping them. Y‚Äôall are quick to go after free stuff but don‚Äôt want to pay your dues. These $15 will specifically be helping the communities that need it the most. I‚Äôm so disappointed that there is no allyship within usac. Think about the Transfer students who don‚Äôt have a transfer resource center. Think about black students who don‚Äôt have a black resource center. Think about Muslim students that don‚Äôt have a prayer space. This money will go to building this things for communities that need space at UCLA. $15 a quarter is a small price to pay. If we come together we can make a difference. Also usac is going to take extra money that they have and make covid relief fund, so no usac isn‚Äôt blowing the extra money. 

This is bigger than you and me. This is what we need to vote for to help those that need it most. I‚Äôm thankful for what usac has done. I‚Äôm thankful for the for the people slate for stepping and running for the people. Usac doesn‚Äôt think about themselves when they make decisions, they do it for the greater good. And go ahead support Orion, support white candidates. But when this school is having a race war, don‚Äôt come to usac for help. 

Please please vote for my friend Naomi for President. She is an absolute queen and cares for the students that need help the most. She will prioritize you over herself. She is the only usac member that does not take a stipend. She is doing this for you not herself. We need a fighter

"The ""whitesplaining"" part of the module involving the Native guy and his white friend commenting about hoping his friend's necklace isn't a fake product sold by a department store was so stupid imo. 

Like, he's just trying to bring awareness that companies prey upon people wanting to connect to their Native roots by making products that are culturally appropriated and do not actually support Native artists nor have any input by Native artists. He's just like, ""I hope you didn't buy it from the department store cuz they only sell fakes.""

And this is called whitesplaining, because Mr White Guy McGee over here cares about the general populace's awareness of how big companies culturally appropriate Native art. So it's whitesplaining because the Navajo kid supposedly would already know all about it, since he's Native.

Isn't that kind of racist? Like, be honest with me, isn't that racist?? 

Like, ""you should know all about Native issues since you're Native."" As in, ""you should know all about black issues because you're black."" Like, what?

Certainly any Native individual living on a reservation or who has visited one/theirs would be aware that those are really some of the only places to buy genuine goods made by Native artists. But who's to say he grew up on a reservation, or has visited one/his? Maybe he grew up elsewhere and is trying to reconnect with his roots, and wouldn't know about that--or maybe he *did* grow up on the reservation, and then wouldn't he actually be grateful that his friend is trying to raise awareness of the fact that Native art is appropriated all the fucking time?

Stanford University is the highest-ranked school in the West for student outcomes in the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings.
Stanford is one of four Western schools that rank in the top 20 nationwide for student outcomes, along with the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of California, Berkeley.

The WSJ/THE rankings emphasize how well a college will prepare students for life after graduation. The overall ranking is based on 15 factors across four main categories: Forty percent of each school‚Äôs overall score comes from student outcomes, including measures of graduate salaries and debt burdens, 30% from the school‚Äôs academic resources, 20% from how well it engages its students and 10% from its diversity.

Six of the top 10 colleges in the West for student outcomes are public schools, including five from the University of California system. Only one of the 10 isn‚Äôt located in California‚Äîthe University of Washington-Seattle.
Overall national ranks for these 10 schools range from Caltech‚Äôs No. 5 to the University of California, Santa Barbara‚Äôs No. 71. 

See the list of top 10 schools in the West for outcomes below, and the top schools for outcomes in the Northeast here. You can also see our full rankings as well as sort the complete rankings by a variety of measures and reweight the main contributing factors to reflect what‚Äôs most important to you.

"This is great advice.  As someone who also suffered through Hlushchanka's 33A last spring and ended up with an A+ (bonus points on Final), I can confirm that spending a lot of time on the homework and reading the book before lecture is the way to go.  Even then, I was still lost in the majority of lectures, but my grades improved throughout the quarter (82 on first midterm, 88 on second, and 104 on final).  Really try to dive into the mechanism for why things work (I found making flashcards for all of the ""micro-proofs"" in the book was helpful) and you will be in great shape to answer at least one of the bonus problems correctly on the final.

One other bit of advice: do the exercises at the end of each chapter for extra practice.  I found them pretty difficult and tedious, but they really helped me develop conceptual understanding.  There should be some solutions floating around somewhere on the internet but I forget where.

This class takes up a lot of time and will make you want to bash your head against a wall if the material doesn't come naturally to you.  Luckily, I only took three classes when I had Hlushchanka, but I still think you can do well if you follow u/noottoself and my advice.",1582256604,1,0

I thought an university apartment would be much cheaper and  moving out did nothing for that since I went for a university apartment and they reduced my FA accordingly. The pros of moving out early was that I liked my roommate (whom I chose, got random for dorm) and there was a lot more space in the apartment. I hated cooking for myself and cleaning the dishes etc. I had less of a social life overall compared to living in the dorms but I was closer to my roommates.",1582243652,5,0

"The materials engineering (MSE) major mostly consists of MSE upper divs. The classes focus on the structure/properties/processing of major materials groups like metals, polymers, ceramics, semiconductors, etc. It's a very broad major that has overlap with MechE, ChemE, EE, and BioE (some make the very odd claim that it's a niche major) as well as covering some unique topics like crystallography and semiconductor processing. 

If your main interest is chemistry or biomaterials, it may serve you better to go to Chem / MatSci or stay in BioE. The Chem / MatSci major is like half MSE upper divs so you will get some but not all of the engineering coursework. You might have more opportunities to focus on the topics that interest you with the Chem courses though.  MSE here does not focus very much on biomaterials or fundamental chemistry.

"Do you know what you like? Or is there a particular industry you feel connected to (music industry, tech, medical etc.)?

"I'm \*mostly sure\* I had COVID-19 earlier this year (before it hit the news), and that I probably contracted it at school.  Shortly after winter break, which would be a reasonable time frame given that reliable reports say it was prevalent in parts of China in December and that Washington State now says it's probably been there since mid-January at least.

I could have just as easily had any of the other kinds of ""crud"" that circulate campus periodically, especially after breaks or vacations, but the symptoms line up pretty well with COVID-19.  I asked my doc, but she doesn't think there's much use in trying to test for antibodies either way (it's been over a month, so it wouldn't be conclusive).

The point is, it's probably already here and people are probably already coming down with it (I would have had to have been a ""secondary infection"", since I haven't left SoCal in ages and have never been west of Hawaii).  For most of us, it'll be an annoying, mild flu-type thing.  It's the elderly, frail, or otherwise immune-compromised who need to be protected.

Please do wash your hands regularly, even more than regularly (I work at a hospital, so this is something I'm more aware of than most).  When going through doors, try not to touch handles if you can; most of the doors have at least one direction you can open by simply leaning on them or hitting them with your elbow.  Hand Sanitizer won't do much for a virus, so that's not as helpful, but things like sneezing into your elbow or shoulder or, like I'll do sometimes, down your shirt so as least to contain anything airborne is also something you should be doing.

And if you start to feel crappy, go to Ashe or your PCP.  I know with finals and such coming up, there's going to be a lot of pressure to not miss lectures and discussions.  I'm hoping professors open up their homework submission guidelines a bit to allow people who are actively trying not to infect others to turn things in via boxes after class or electronically.

Realistically, there's probably no stemming this eventually becoming endemic.  Hopefully there'll be some kind of vaccine and/or active antiviral treatment in development by the end of summer.  We still need to do what we can to try and minimize the effects on others, as well as just generally practice good hygiene.",1583337231,1,0

"I want you to know that you're not alone and plenty of people who graduate similarly situated go through the same thing. I'm not a north campus major and I did the right things to find a job before I graduated, but plenty of friends have been stuck in that same rut your describe.

If you find that landing a job is a hopeless prospect at the moment, then I recommend you intern somewhere for 5-6 months so that it will give you a good chance of landing a salaried job, and then work nights at, say, a restaurant or bar in the meantime. If it's a trendy place, you can make way more than $12 an hour when factoring tips. The truth is that even south campus majors struggle to find a job. Just a degree and minimal experience won't cut it. If you want to be competitive on the job market, you gotta raise your stock and play the game. It may seem ""beneath you"" to intern as a graduate but it's actually a wise investment given that it can only help your prospects. If you happen to find a job while you're interning, you can always leave early. Nobody who's not an absolute scumbag would hold it against you for leaving early to take a paid position, so thus there's no need to stress about ""committing"" to anything.

Everyone has a BA/BS these days, so those who do get hired are selected mostly because of their experience. The price of admission for a salaried job is high, and you're not quite hitting the threshold at the moment. Build your worth. To be fair, I could be wrong, and perhaps there is a good job out there willing to hire you that will fulfill you. But in the meantime, find something that will keep you active and your resume strong.

That may mean you need to start working for free to build the necessary experience and demonstrate your value/work ethic--at least enough to either get a solid reference/network or convert the internship into a job offer.

Start emailing local legislators or law offices, or even a startup if you want to go into business. With a polisci degree you can at least claim to have some background/interest in the first two places. The startups might be eager to take on people because they're often strapped for cash. The census is about to start hiring people paying like $22 an hour. It's temporary but it would be a solid job, you can even do it at night. 

Look for local job ads on craigslist --&gt; jobs. Post your resume on /r/resumes and elicit feedback. Send at least two applications per day.",1583309921,1,0

"I don't want to come across as rude or anything but personally I think your chances are really slim. UCLA has a 25th percentile (as in, 75% of admitted students have higher than this) weighted GPA of like what, 4.34 and an unweighted 25th percentile of 3.92. Your *weighted* GPA is lower than the bottom 25% of *unweighted* GPA for admitted students. And this is just talking about admission to the regular college. Nursing school admission is even more rigorous. Same thing with SAT. 1190 is again much less than the bottom 25% of admits and by a significant margin. Again I don't want to sound like I'm being mean for no reason but to give you an honest opinion your ECs aren't particularly unique or impressive. Especially for someone who wants to go to nursing school 40 hours of volunteering is barely anything and you might really want to crank up thosr hours to show your dedication / passion for helping the community (I'm talking several hundred hours for it to be an actual highlight of your app). The three years of student government may help you quite a lot if you can turn that into great essays. The free ivy league course is meaningless and doesn't actually show any accomplishment, any random dude can click a few links and enroll in the course. It's irrelevant to your application. Personally I don't think adding any more club officer positions will help your app at all except pad your resume. Just focus on your existing ECs and pursue more volunteering / nurse assistant certification. After getting your CNA you can work extensively in a nursing home or dementia home or something to rack up those clinical hours, but the issue with that is that you'll need to do this in your senior year and by that time you'll already be submitting college apps. So you can't really write about it in any essays or show long term commitment since you'll have basically just started.",1587625144,1,0

No, it's literally not possible and everyone is legally required to get Bs or below /s

7B is the easiest out of the 3 LS7 core, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's an easy class. 

I think you could get an A in this course IF you take this course and nothing else, or maybe this course and an extremely easy GE or a language class like French 2 or something.

Just because the difficulty isn't as challenging as say 7C doesn't mean there's still 10 weeks worth of material to read and memorize. And 7B has a lot of material volume wise.

"Adding on to what everyone else is saying... after facing somewhat similar pressures as you do, I've concluded that all you need to be happy in life is your own approval. Do what's right for you, and let the happiness come from that, rather than chasing what others tell you to want. You can still be successful: get the education, the career, the financial security. But be successful in your own way, whatever that may be.

If you want to read more about this line of thinking, see the works of the Epicureans, the Stoics, the Existentialists and Adam Smith's *Theory of Moral Sentiments* (henceforth *Theory*). If you want somewhere to start, I recommend reading the quotes of Epictetus ("" Is freedom anything else than the right to live as we wish? Nothing else."") and Russ Robert's introduction to *Theory*, *How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life*. 

Above all else, remember that happiness must come rising up from within; in the end, you can't lie to yourself about how you feel. Your life is your own, for better or for worse: you might as well turn it for the better. Good luck, and remember to not get too reliant on external things (like luck or the instructions of internet strangers) when you can make your happiness durable and self-sufficient instead.",1587623428,1,0

I understand where you are coming from there.

That's a familiar problem to epistemology. With so much complexity, how do we really know anything about anything.

"omg yes!!!

I switched to law recently, at my fourth year at that! A lot of it was the same reasoning as you. I'm a transfer who is a bit older than most students (i'm 24 as a fourth year), and I am gonna have to take extra classes to fulfill prereqs after graduating cuz I am psychology (I got 50% done, but that means I have a lot of classes left). As such, I'd have to spent probably 2 gap years AT LEAST if I go the med route, to not only finish my reqs but also to build up my EC resume. Also, after you go to med school you have to suffer thru several years of residency if you really wanna good job, so in reality med school by itself is a 10-year commitment like you said. After all that, I'd be in my mid-late 30s by the time I start my career as a doctor. I understand that's okay for some but I really wanna start my career while I'm still in my 20s, just a personal preference of mine.

But I kept thinking about it, and as I did more research, the more I was leaning towards law. I've always loved philosophy and dissecting arguments anyways, so it does match my interests. And also, I can take the LSAT and essentially apply right away after I graduate, and plus law school is only 3 years. And while law is oversaturated, if you get into a t14 you are pretty set in getting a good job. So I decided to switch to pre-law, as I have a good gpa and I would only need to take one gap year since I don't have to take any extra classes, and law schools don't consider ECs nearly as much as med does

"Make USAC open source

Open source means transparent, and accessible, and it listens to you to give you what you want.

But why should you care about the internal structure of USAC? I get it, you care about what we deliver, not how we work. But how we work means everything about what we can deliver. 

So let‚Äôs break it down.

1. The budget should be public, analyzed, and TRANSPARENT: ( facebook.com/OrionUSAC/posts/238883897522440 )

2. Meeting minutes should be notes rather than masquerading as transcripts. They should have timestamps to the USAC Live video so people can see what they‚Äôre referring to for themselves.

3. Previously, the video and sound quality of USAC‚Äôs meeting live streams made it difficult for students to participate if they couldn‚Äôt make it in person (see link). With Zoom, it‚Äôs great (see link). Video views have spiked since the transition (\~20 vs 1925 views). So, as Council member Brandon recommended, let's keep using Zoom, even after returning to in person meetings so we are ACCESSIBLE to people who can‚Äôt come.

4. Let's centralize everything in one place so they are ACCESSIBLE. Right now things are an impenetrable morass, but we can fix that and make them accessible to ordinary students. There are too many funds to apply to, so let's combine them. There are too many sites to find info, so lets combine them. There are too many office names  (TSR, ISR, FAC, CEC, CSC, CAC ‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt even recognize ‚ÄúUSAC‚Äù last year) for students to know, so let‚Äôs stamp one name, USAC, on all the things we do. That way it‚Äôs clear what we do and what we do is TRANSPARENT. There are too many acronyms to be ACCESSIBLE so let‚Äôs stop using them (especially when one acronym can mean 3 different things). Let‚Äôs centralize the recruitment process so that there is one form to apply to all offices. And so on. Things don‚Äôt have to be this confusing.

5. Project Management Software

Imagine a publicly ACCESSIBLE board (like meister-task or monday.com) representing every task that USAC offices are working on.

Tasks could be split up into open, in progress, needing-discussion, and closed. 

Open tasks build ACCESSIBILITY by allowing more students to get involved. Just like open source projects, students can look at the list of tasks that need people and volunteer to work on a specific one. This means busy students can still meaningfully contribute without sitting through irrelevant meetings (unless they want to).

In progress tasks show students at a glance see what is being worked on, potentially eliminating the need for officer reports (new post coming soon). Instead, students can at any time just consult the list of in progress tasks for a given officer to see what they‚Äôre up to.

Needing-discussion tasks become the agenda for the weekly USAC meetings, so there are NO SURPRISES. Tell me, can you currently find the bylaw changes we‚Äôre planning to discuss at today‚Äôs meeting? How about for next week‚Äôs meeting? 

6. Bylaw change forms

Let‚Äôs require that the reason for every change be printed on the bylaw change form. This sort of record keeping of why exactly USAC does things (in addition to what exactly was changed) is essential to making things ACCESSIBLE to students who aren‚Äôt familiar with the context surrounding these changes, and to future generations of USAC officers who want to understand why they‚Äôre inheriting the bylaws they do.

7. Let‚Äôs use STV voting for budget allocation (so that surplus allocation isn‚Äôt nasty). See \[youtu.be/WXPlcUJGBXY?t=19923\] for an example of how nasty it can get - the meeting went on till 1:23AM, and in the end the surplus was allocated on the basis of everyone being exhausted and resorting to an significantly flawed system of averaging that was easy to game.

8. Let‚Äôs limit meetings to 10pm, so that it is ACCESSIBLE for students to attend the whole meeting. This is especially important since voting takes place at the end of the meeting - if it drags on till 3AM (like it did on March 10 when, we quit before reaching my discussion item ‚Äúefficient officer reports‚Äù \[docs.google.com/document/d/1bqk\_BuicQF\_fKTiMOpNq3xBrfj9qBVpcoZ\_2pTXIFcs/edit\]), it‚Äôs almost impossible for students to watch their government vote on decisions and still make it to class the next morning. As it currently stands, the most contentious (and therefore crucial) votes effectively occur privately in the dead of the night.

9. Let‚Äôs make public comment a dialog, instead of requiring officers to not respond to questions. Students should be able to hear back from their elected representatives about their concerns, instead of being met with mandatory silence.

10. Let‚Äôs improve meeting ACCESSIBILITY.  Have signs pointing to the weekly meetings, have signs that there is a meeting, have the doors open, and have signs with the rules of the discussion so that normal students know what is going on and how to participate.

PROVIDING YOU VALUE/LISTENING TO YOU: 

These 10 approaches would ensure that USAC is intimately connected with the student body and that it works on stuff that YOU want. No surprises. Just understanding.

In the middle of a pandemic this may not seem so important, but note that pandemic preparation didn‚Äôt look too important until we were in the middle of a pandemic, and wildfire preparation didn‚Äôt look too important until we were beset by wildfires. If recent events have taught us anything, it‚Äôs that we should address problems before they turn into crises, even as we work on other urgent things. 

If you want these improvements, vote Orion on MyUCLA ( bit.ly/usac2020vote ), from right now till 1PM on Friday.

"If you work hard and study = you get an A. It can be argued that weeder courses depend on the professor and the level of preparation you have for the course/what you like and don‚Äôt like. It‚Äôs not like the movies. That being said, classes are difficult. Ls7 series is NOT a weeder series in the sense that people don‚Äôt get As and it‚Äôs impossible to do so. A lot of people As. MOST of the professors are not out to get you and genuinely care about your learning, at least in my experience(Maloy, Esdin). Keyword: most.
That being said, LS7 series is truly fundamentally flawed REGARDLESS of your professor. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about memorization but more application‚Äù...so they say, but good luck navigating the midterms. This is a discussion in and of itself about Ls core. the 7 series is only a weeder series in the sense that you have to adapt FAST to the style of exams and understand how to interpret the questions. For example, people say ls7b is the easiest of the 3 but I hated that class with burning passion and didn‚Äôt do as well as I did in 7A and 7c (As in both). Again, a lot of it depends on what you like. 
Chemistry at UCLA is said to be designed with ‚Äúweeder‚Äù lower divs for 14AB and 20AB but again, it‚Äôs up to you how much energy you invest/the professor you take it with. A lot of professors in the chem dept reserve As for only top 20% of students, so call that weeder if you like. But it is very much possible to get As in these pre-med/health prereq courses. Other ‚Äúweeder courses‚Äù I‚Äôve heard of are some math and CS classes namely Cs32,33 and math 115a,131a but I‚Äôve never taken them personally so I don‚Äôt know. 

Nothing is a weeder class if you actually put the work/hours in and learn the design of the exams. Seriously, you will make many sacrifices but As are possible at UCLA.",1588680325,1,0
"Hello!! 

I was admitted as a MIMG major and according to [assist.org](https://assist.org/), I would have to take Calculus III and Stats of Biological Systems to complete my Lower Major Division requirements. However, as a Biology major, I would have completed all lower division reqs and I could focus on my upper division courses. I know both majors are impacted and Biology is way harder to get into than MIMG as a transfer, but I was wondering what my chances are/how easy it will be for me to change my major to Biology?

I know I must speak to a counselor and go through the departments to change major, however, I would only have the opportunity to do so on Orientation (\*\*unless there's a way to speak to them now?\*\*) and I am currently planning my summer courses based on whether I have a chance at switching to Bio. Some community colleges are offering Calc III during the summer so I am debating whether I should take it.

* Since they didn't slap a ""Pre-"" label on my admitted major, does that mean I am done with lower division reqs?

"Hi u/Drew_pew ,

STV (single transferable vote) is one type of ranked choice voting. There are many types of ranked choice voting, such as Condorcet, which is arguably more fair (but easier to game). 

The issue with voting is Arrow's impossibility therm, which mathematically proves that you can't have a perfect voting system. So, you have to balance strengths and weaknesses for each system. I could have made a much longer post why I like STV in particular and the trade offs, but that's for another time.

Regards,

Orion",1588672273,1,0
"Also took it with Beren last quarter. Personally, I don't think the exams were as straight forward as the exams; he tends to write his midterm questions in a very confusing way/using foreign scenarios. It still tests the concepts you learn in class, but it can take some time to digest what he's actually trying to ask. His homework can also be tough, but it's graded to completion and he has plenty of OH for students (they can get crowded though, but don't know how this will be post-COVID19). 

He's a fantastic and rly nice prof though, good guy. Would recommend his class.",1588671687,1,0

"So I started this zoom cast in which I interview/ have conversations with students from ucla to share their experiences about their struggles and successes at ucla. At the moment I have just been interviewing my friends. However, I want to expand this and hear from all sorts of student's majors, seniors, juniors, freshman and sophomores experiences to help build a network with one another &lt;3 These conversations are done through zoom and then posted on my youtube channel as a playlist while I make the transition to a apple podcast:) 

I feel as if these videos could help incoming students really navigate their time and hearing from people that have been through it makes it more personal. 

I am looking for 15 people to interview to talk about their experience at ucla regardless of race, color, major, age, any body is welcome &lt;3 

Current topics I want to talk about:   
\- relationships 

\- engineering students 

\- pre med students

\- post grad students 

\- student athletes 

\- anything ucla related

Peris is really straightforward and transparent which makes his class easy. He has clear expectations and you just need to follow them.

"First, as another user mentioned, for a retroactive you needed to have skipped the final. If you took it, I'm sorry but there's no way to change it even if you took all of the other appropriate measures.

Second, aside from having a compelling story/ legitimate reason, were you clearly communicating your difficulties with your prof during the quarter?

Third, you asked about upping a grade from an F to a C, but there too main issues with this.

A) You didn't earn a passing score in the class

B)Even if you did all of the above, I doubt a professor would raise you a bunch of letter grades on that reason alone. It would be fucked up for the students who worked their asses off for the grade, and even in the case of an obstacle I'm sure your best outcome, (provided you did everything in a timely matter and didn't take the final), would be the retroactive withdrawal.

"Yep. without a trail showing all parties have tried to fix the issue you wont be swapped. I had a case like this and it took 3 weeks to get a swap. 

If you go to the rd, they will ask if you have reached out to your RA, if not, they will tell you to do it. Then your RA will give suggestions in how to talk to roomates and will make a report and follow up. They might meet as a group (roommates plus ra) to help mediate the conflict and if nothing works, the RA will reach out to RD and have them contact you. The rd will meet with you and once again give suggestions and or see how to mediate issues. If they deemed a swap is necessary, they will contact housing and ask for available rooms and assign you one once they find an empty one. 

Essentially the last thing everyone wants (rd ra housing) is to move someone. Also  they want to know that the issues is not communication but rather something more about personalities. Because if its communication, more than likely you will have issues with your next roommates too. 


There are emergency temp rooms but you dont get moved to those unless you feel you are in danger or deem the room not a safe place to be.
