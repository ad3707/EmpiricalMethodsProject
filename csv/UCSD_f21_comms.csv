"i think the prereqs for hum 3, 4, and 5 are that u need to have taken at least one of hum 1 or 2 so probably not. maybe strive to take hum 2 in the spring so u can do 3, 4 or 5 in the summer.

btw according to my advisor, hum 3 needs to be taken at ucsd, and then one of hum 4 or 5 (not both) can be fulfilled by certain cc classes. maybe shoot a message to revelle on vac to verify everything i said

edit: looking at the hum catalog it looks like only 3 requires completion of 1 or 2, but 4 and 5 can be taken whenever?",1637788487,2,0

Now, I’d say one of the closed parking lots of Regents Lot is the best place to get comfortable on a board. I would also advise not attempting anything you think is outside your ability at that point, like roads, busy smaller sidewalks, or the steeper hills of campus i.e. voigt.

Anyway, just thought I’d offer my experience. I didn’t want a scooter because they’d need to fold and they’re generally too big. A bicycle is too big.

If you go with a regular skateboard, make sure it’s a long board. Much more beginner friendly. They roll smoother, you have more space for your feet",1632552106,10,0

"Triton mom here. Don’t think of yourself as being behind. Think of it as a reinforcement. My son (data science major) and his friend also took AP Calc in their junior year and scored a 2/1. He’s starting this quarter with Math 4C with one of his smartest friends (cell &amp; molecular bio major/pre-med), even though they both need the Math 20 series for their majors. They both need a solid foundation of math to build their future knowledge upon, so investing the time now to ensure they are experts is the smart thing to do. Don’t forget that they (and you) were robbed of a complete year of learning and a normal AP exam. My son’s school took almost a month off at the beginning of the pandemic and didn’t teach any new concepts after that. None of that was his fault nor could he do anything about it. You and your peers likely went through similar experiences. So please don’t judge yourself by what you believe to be the norm because that is how the major program is set up. That program wasn’t written during the pandemic nor was it written for students who had their worlds turned upside down during the pandemic. It is not fair to compare yourself to anyone right now because the pandemic and the challenges and life alterations it produced affected everyone so differently. If you are still concerned with feeling as though you are behind, you can always take a math class over the summer to put you back on the track you believe you should be on. College is a journey and while the checkpoints seem to be the same, the paths you can take to get there are (and should be) as unique as you are. Don’t let the lure of such comparisons cause you to doubt yourself, your intellect, or your worthiness of being where you are. You have every right to be there. You worked your butt off. You are more than smart enough and capable enough. You will succeed at achieving your goals. Squash this imposter syndrome and just focus on where you’re steering your ship. Don’t worry about anyone else. You’ve got this.",1632548438,2,0

"Yep, a fix-it order is what you have to put in for this, and that should get it taken care of (in my experience, HDH is pretty good with fix-it orders). They should send someone out soon, but for now, just don't touch anything in your room at all, leave it as-is for HDH to handle and make sure you take photos to document it before it's cleaned - see if you can find someone in your suite who has a couch or comfy chair or something you can borrow on which you can sleep in the common area (even a few thick blankets laid on the floor as a makeshift mattress should do it - sometimes, when it's really hot like it is now and I'm getting overheated in bed, I'll do this and it's really nice), or off-campus friends to stay with for a night or two (there's currently no visiting allowed between suites on campus, otherwise I would've recommended asking someone on a different floor in your building as well, if your suite is otherwise empty). 

It could've also been bad coordination between ResLife and HDH maintenance - since you were the first one in, HDH maintenance may not have been expecting anyone to live there until move-in weekend or closer to move-in weekend. It happens sometimes. As long as they take care of it in a timely manner, I wouldn't worry, but it's if things aren't moving along when you can be a bit petty and threaten to out them to news outlets, and if THAT doesn't work, then you can actually go and speak with news outlets. 

A school at the frontier of fighting COVID with a huge Return to (in-person) Learning initiative not taking basic dorm sanitation seriously will be BIG news. San Diego Union Tribune might like to hear about it (especially if other students have experienced the same), FOX News San Diego, Forbes (especially after that ""#3 public university"" headline we saw recently), etc.

"Yikesssssss especially with COVID, that lack of sanitation is HELLA sus. Reach out to ResLife. 

Do you have roommates who moved in before you who could've caused the mess in your room, and/or suitemates who could've caused the mess in the common areas and bathroom before you got there (I know general move-in isn't until next week)? That's very strange that HDH would be so disgustingly (literally and proverbially) negligent about sanitation, especially in the middle of a pandemic. If it wasn't a roommate or suitemate, and ResLife won't help you in a timely manner, you might threaten to reach out to some media outlets which will report on this (San Diego Union Tribune is the main one here in SD and is a good option if they'll take the story) - a STEM school which has been at the forefront of combatting COVID here in SoCal hearing the music about their negligent sanitation from the public and concerned students and parents will definitely light a fire under their behinds, if you reaching out to them alone doesn't do it.",1631508130,28,0

Not everyone is like this and that's ok, probably because of how raised I don't really like treating myself constantly because then the luxury wears off and gives me less and less enjoyment.",1631507378,2,0

"Freshman year I was ready to leave home. SO ready. 

I left UCSD for a couple of years to go home to NY and do CC and lived at home for those two years, and I'm really having a hard time dealing with the fact that my mom will be going back home soon. 

I have a complicated relationship with my parents - they're quite abusive (emotionally, financially, and in the past, physically), but at the same time I'm dependent on them and have always been a ""good kid"" (never hid things from them, etc.) but I'm living off-campus for the first time this year and without the supervision of a ""real"" adult (the only time I've ever slept away from my parents before college was in 10th grade, and that was for a week. It was an enlightening experience, to say the least - I was MISERABLE but I learned a lot), I'm kind of scared to live without my mom especially, she and I are quite close even though she's also very controlling and overbearing, which was part of the reason I was raring to leave home the first time my freshman year. 

A lot of young people complain that their parents are too strict - mine are very strict as well, but this goes beyond that. Until I got into therapy recently (after becoming an adult), I wasn't able to even think of functioning without them - I barely coasted by my freshman year due to my anxiety and depression.",1631506743,1,0
"Thanks for the support!

Glad you asked about power, I've currently got 4 100Wh solar panels sitting in my room that are gonna be mounted on the van. These will feed into a battery in the van that has 6 144w outlets on it. So realistically I could plug 6 house-hold appliances into my battery and be fine. Other minor things like LED lights will be hooked up to my van's battery which charges off the van's alternator.

As for parking I have a 24 hour parking pass for most lots at UCSD where I'll park at, moving every 3 days or so to not look like an abandoned car.

Hope that helps.",1631506582,6,0

"The thing about shared scooters is that if you use them every day the cost eventually builds up to a point it would have been cheaper if you just buy a scooter. Also I will worry about availability during peak hours.

Usually if you are just going from building to building you can do it on foot but sometimes i have really short break between lectures and that's when you need a bike/scooter et c. I had a bike but TBH it sometimes can be really consuming riding up all the slopes and inclines in and around the campus, so if you want less sweating consider something electric like scooter or skateboard. But if you aren't against working out a bit then bike is a fine choice. 

One problem I've encountered is that there are A LOT OF PEOPLE during peak hours and they don't always respect your right of way...Eventually, I learned to keep riding the bike while at a walking pace but that's not fun. Idk if it will be better this fall with all the new bike lanes. 

My bike hasn't been stolen, but if I will be parking it in ""less secure"" places I always lock both the front wheel and frame just in case. Also if I'm not using it for a longer time usually I bring it indoors. Just some tips. There definitely are some bike thievery going on in campus, and you can find pieces left behind on bike racks everywhere.",1631506323,3,0
"That sounds about right. On the dining plan website the 5623 plan averages out to almost $24 per day. 

Last year I used an app called triton dine to keep track of my dining dollars. It tells you how much you should be spending a day based on your dining plan. It will recommend a different amount based on if you’ve under or overspent. There’s also a category for money spent that day. Sometimes it was glitchy or slightly wrong but for the most part it worked for me. I believe it’s not working atm but it might be because the quarter hasn’t started. 

Keep in mind if you were to run out you can always add more dining dollars and if you have leftover they rollover into fall quarter of the following year.",1631506132,1,0

Currently, I’m talking to new ppl every day but I hate small talk a lot and it’s not an amazing feeling talking to ppl you don’t vibe and trying to leave the convo.

 If EE which depth are you in?

I don’t recommend taking ECE 141A for three reasons: 1. Course setup is kinda sucks — you get pop quizs every now and then 2. PAs’ are typically hard and time consuming, I would say they are harder than PAs’ from CSE classes 3. Gessner is a tough instructor and unfortunately he’s the only one who teaches this course

If you check cape you will found out both ECE 140A and 141A are ~13hrs studying time so really if you don’t have other hard classes with you you can always try it. But you stated that you have 3 UD ECE courses then taking 140A/141A won’t be a good choice.

For electives really it depends on what you are interested in. If you like coding you can take ECE 143, &lt;10 hrs studying time and an easy A course",1640924365,1,0

"Took 40BH even though I got a B+ in 40A (ended with an A- in 40BH even though ochem isn’t my strong suit). Compared to 40B, 40BH is much more challenging (eg you may get a 4-5 carbon nmr structure in 40B, and a 20 carbon nmr structure in 40BH) and heavily focused on mechanisms. That being said, you learn a lot more in less time in the honors class. By following the mechanisms instead of jumping straight to the product, you’ll get a deeper understanding of how the reactions actually occur. In addition, if you do plan to take biochemistry, 40BH and 40CH will make biochemistry look like a cakewalk.

They say you shouldn’t take honors for the grade but for the interest and challenge. Statistically your chance of an A is extremely high solely by you being in that class. I took 40cH over 40c with ternansky mostly for the grade. Hard class with a nice curve so maybe you can waitlist it and take whichever you get into first. Your chance of a good grade will probably be the same in normal or honors,1640913730,1,0

I’ve just transferred here and the people are nice you just have to go out of your way more than I’ve ever done elsewhere. Its entirely possible to have no interactions if you’re not the one taking the lead.

"Yes, this gets asked a lot. My friend graduated in 2008, UCSD was already called that back then. I have a couple of theories:
1. Academics have been so important to many of us (probably mostly our parents), that we didn’t learn to socialize during our formative years to high school. 
2. We expect others to come up to us like the movies and other media show us people meet; which happens at UCSD even less so than a place like SDSU. Same goes for meeting someone to date. 
3. We are way to fkn busy staying on top of our academics, and so is everyone else at UCSD. 
Balance is important though. 

“Be the change you want to see.” -Gretzky 
My proven solutions/suggestions: 
1. If in class (where you know you’ll be seeing these people) say a simple “hi” goes a long way. If someone outside of class; they may look at you funny, but that also builds your social muscles. 
2. Smile, as much as you can. The people that smile back are at least open. You can say hi. 
3. When put into groups in class; talk. Odds are most people feel the anxiety that you do, help them and yourself by engaging more than you have before and they will often times open up too. 
4. If you see a common interest, like someone walking around with a basketball, a musical instrument ask, even a type of food; ask where they got it, where do they practice, etc.  
5. Join a club of interest, this was the hardest for me since I didn’t know anyone, but that’s the whole point! 

This has worked for me and it hasn’t been easy, but I’ve at least exchanged Instagram with info with some and phone numbers when we’ve become better aquatinted. 
And if you have an interest in dating someone you see, all of these suggestions work too. I got a date that started by me asking how this person’s bike handled the hills.

I’m asian and have gotten ash blonde balayage for the past 2 years or so (just recently switched back to dark hair). I’ll tell you right now that you will not be able to pay a small price if you want the job done well. It is especially harder for dark hair to go lighter because obviously it doesn’t lift as easily as lighter hair colors so that means it’s going to cost more.,1638807118,4,0
"You have conflicting goals here

1) wont mess up my hair

2) cheap

You only get to choose one of these, particularly as a 1st time hair dyer who probably doesn't have all the vocab down (if terms like ""lift"" or ""toner"" are unfamiliar, this applies to you).

Especially because you hair is black, it takes a bit more work to add any color than folks with lighter hair, and the chemicals/processing to lighten darker hair can be quite drying/damaging, so you want a well trained colorist.

So for your first time, I do recommend paying well for it. Don't go cheap. If you keep it simple (just a few highlights, not too much lighter than your current color) it wont be too pricey or dramatic, and you can chat with you colorist and ask more about what they are doing, ask about the chemicals they are using, where they went for training etc to learn more about all the steps involved just in some basic highlights (lightening, but no color change). 

The more you learn about it (and get some procedures done) then you'll know better what you like and can roll the dice on a cheaper colorist or even try something at home.",1638806515,5,0

They literally went to go save this persons life. I’m sure the only information the police got was that there is a person in threat of losing their life.

While I would never do anything to jeopardize my ability to go to this school. I'm incredibly confrontational and would not let that shit fly whatsoever. I had someone try and slip an n-word with a hard r under their breath at me once on campus.

JUST WANTED MAKING SURE I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY! A N\*\*\*\*\*!? I'M A N\*\*\*\*\*? THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID, RIGHT!?""

Warren GEs are pretty good if you have a strong interest in a humanities and social science field since you can narrow your GE focus to just those two. I enjoyed that personally

I would have put Sixth above Warren because it's more flexible, especially if you leave engineering. Warren non-engineers have 6 more GEs than engineers. But for engineering, at worst Warren is 10 GEs and with APs you can knock that down to 8 classes.",1638298100,1,0

"It is a practical matter and an ethical matter that the university needs to have one common language of instruction, so that no one has an unfair advantage. That is a given, made clear before anyone arrives at UCSD. No professor and no student should be having a conversation in class that uses another language and by doing so excludes others. The professor is wrong to allow it and wrong to be participating in that conversation with you.",1638297500,2,1
"I have taken both and have found that (in my biased experience) Adderall is more helpful than Ritalin, even at the supposed 1:2 conversion ratio.

"Let’s be very clear, you have more to say when you want to be “fair” with me. There can be many facets, not limited to two, to all kinds of things, but I don’t think professionalism is your sole problem with me

If I were to address the Chinese speaking, which I don’t mind, the whole focus will be partially distracted to it. Whether you agree with me or not does not matter, because we are all allowed to have your own perspective on everything. Opinions are one way or another subjective. You don’t sit there and judge me the way I go on about my business, simply because you have your approach.

So yes, I conducted myself that I’ll be polite and respectful to other students in the first place, so even when I spoke Mandarin to my SI teacher, it won’t be based on the fact that I tryna act close or get any benefits from doing that, instead, I think it’s a more efficient way to converse with her on class-related subjects.",1638296607,1,0
"It’s probably in access point mode. You have the router connect to a wireless network and authenticate (which according to ITS is where usually the issue is) and then it acts as a secondary point where whoever connects to it doesn’t have to go through auth anymore. 

However setting this up correctly requires knowledge of networking, and specifically how the UCSD network is set up. It’s also against UCSD policy as far as I know so I’d be careful",1638296448,4,0

"On top of the other suggestions I'm sure you are getting, make sure to get some sleep, particularly after studying! After studying, take a nap or go to sleep, don't stay up to 3am. Your brain doesn't retain information without sleep, so studying to 3am and getting 4 hours of sleep is significantly less useful than studying to midnight and getting 7 hours. Not to mention when you're sleepy you are definitely doing worse than when you are rested on your exams. All-nighters are not worth it for studying unless there is an actual task or assignment that is due and you are on a time-crunch. It's okay to take the L sometimes and not know ALL of the material, just take the Ws on the material you can study and get the sleep to make sure it sticks in your brain.",1638296019,2,0

You don't need to feel pressured by that expectation, but just bear in mind it might be helpful for others :)",1638295662,20,0

"Yep. Unmedicated &amp; undiagnosed and it was a clusterfuck my first year, led to academic disqualification. Took two years off, did CC and lived at home (OOS student) and got therapy, and got a diagnosis at fukin last. 

Still unmedicated, so this quarter has again been a clusterfuck, but I'm thinking of seeing a psychiatrist through CAPS and getting meds - I'm trying to stay away from Adderall (effective but also highly addictive) and Ritalin (haven't heard good things, in general) but idk what other options are there which won't fuck up my weight (already have issues) or cause other problems, and I've also had problems with shitty psychiatrists (who really should have their licenses to practice stripped) who like to over-prescribe drugs (thank goodness I never did anything with the scripts they wrote me - my parents just put them away for records, I think) so trust is also deffo a thing.",1638295093,1,0
"1. Honestly I see some college friends every day, and others I see once a week. Doesn’t attest THAT much to closeness  
2. We text usually every day but for the ones I see every day it’s planning to meet up and then maybe once a week I’ll text the ones I see less often. 
3. We don’t FaceTime if we both live on campus. We FaceTime during break mostly. 
4. I usually get texts/messages from about 15/20 people a day but very rarely is it super time consuming to reply. 

I’m going to say something here. I grew up without any friends. My parents thought there was something wrong with me because nobody ever wanted to be around me. I realised between 7th and 8th grade that if everyone in my life felt the need to bully me, I probably was the problem. That realisation changed me totally. I came back to school and was totally changed. 
Here’s what I did 
1. Asked people questions about themselves but not in a too intrusive way. “What are your thoughts on…” 
2. Remembered what people told me and then later would send them stuff that made me think of them bc of that. 
3. Became a warmer person. More approachable. 
4. Owned up to who I was, stopped trying to find excuses. 
5. Instead of hiding things about me that people would use against me as a kid, I’d show them upfront. 
6. Became a nicer person overall. 

I am not saying there’s anything wrong with anyone who has trouble making friends. I am saying that it is never too late to try and figure out why, and change is you can. 

Your questions broke my heart a bit because I remember when everyone in my grade was getting got phones, I would hang out with them and see them getting so many notifications while I was getting zero. It hurt a lot.

There is no correct number anyone can answer to your questions. My introverted friends rarely reach out to me first, whereas my friends who are extroverted reach out constantly. It depends. All that matters is you’re feeling fulfilled.",1638294838,1,0
