"In the policy world, petitions are seen as valuable as upvotes (aka no value). If Change.org and similar petition orgs would mandate real names and statements of standing, they'd have more value. 

For example, which *should* have more value? 

1. 200,000 anonymous/pseudonymous digital signatures saying, ""UCSC should ban the use of bicycles on campus.""

2. 10,000 Real name digital signatures, verified with UCSC email addresses saying, ""UCSC should ban the use of bicycles on campus.""

In scenario #1, 200,000 is a lot, but being that the petition could have circulated to people who neither are nor have been affected by bicycle riding on campus, it means nothing. 

In scenario #2, if 10,000 UCSC affiliates were demanding this, it would **definitely** be looked into. It would be a massive change to campus circulation and culture, but you can't ignore 25% of campus affiliates.",1605206219,1,0

"Hi!

This sounded really familiar to me so I wanted to respond. I went through high school with strong grades but had a tough junior year, which I also worried would impact my chances at university. However, colleges like to see improvement, and it's great to see that that seems to be the trend for your GPA, and it's especially good in combination with extra involvement and good essays. I think you'll do amazing here, so I wouldn't worry about that too much!

I went into UCSC with similar interests to what you mentioned, I love psych, and loved the idea of psych in combination with the tech world. I declared general psych as my first major and later declared cog sci-hci as my second, which is decently common. I'm a junior and have not been able to take many upper-division classes yet, as psych is highly impacted and I had a relatively late start, but the ones I have taken have been incredibly interesting and engaging. I have taken neuroscience-related courses, cs courses, and of course a variety of psych courses, all of which I have enjoyed. The professors I have had have been amazing and impressive as well. 

Everyone's college experience is unique, and while I can't say my time here has been traditional, I have managed to make the most of it, and hope you will to wherever your journey takes you, UCSC or elsewhere. Good luck!",1605186871,1,0

I love to tell people that even before the pandemic my school had like a month and a half of protests that shut down classes, and before that we were having rolling power outages that would have the same effect! Yeah I feel for you friend. Luckily there will be a vaccine rolling out soon, and although it will take a long time to disburse, I have confidence that the citizens of Santa Cruz will be responsible enough to drop our color coded safety tier down so that people like you have more opportunities to safely socialize and meet new people.

"There are tons of places all over campus to use your computer. If you mean places to use a public computer because you don't have access to one, then the answer is still a resounding yes.

There are also individual student service departments that have them but I've never used them so I don't know too much about those... but they do exist haha. All of these places are clean, the computers always work, there are both Macs and PCs, there are support staff nearby, and it's always quiet if you needed to do some reading or study.",1605165141,1,0

"I was an intensive psych major and attempted to go to grad school after, ended up realizing I didn't want to be a therapist, and then went into tech. I had 1 official internship and 1 volunteer experience. I also was a TA and worked in a grad psych lab as an undergrad. I'm going to be brutally honest but this was based on my experience (class of '15), idk what options you have esp with COVID complicating things. 

What to do:

1. Make friends with Professors and grad students. Don't be a kiss ass but genuinely build a connection, this is easier to do if you actually like the class topic. Don't be afraid to take a class even if it doesn't 'count for anything' (i.e. a major req) as long as you like it. It is in these classes you can build the best relationships. Also, classes taught by grad students / summer classes are also a great way to build relationships w/ the professor easier
2. Always be applying. You literally should have started in high school
3. Do volunteer work if you can't find anything paid or a ""real"" internship 

This was my experience and how I managed to do it 

1. IA / Lab role: Make friends with professors and grad students. Faye Crosby is no longer there but she was the person who helped me get an IA role and then intro'd me to another professor who ""hired"" me for her lab. I got 5 credits for it but they counted towards nothing. (my 2nd year)
2. TA: After working w/ the lab for 4 quarters, I was a TA for the same professor when one of her grad students went on w2 of the quarter. I got a really nice reference letter and credits for this. (3-4.5 years; I stayed an extra 2 quarters to finish a minor)
3. Volunteer: I was a volunteer in the radiology department of Kaiser when I went to high school and managed to get a volunteer role in the hospital in Aptos. I had a car and drove there 1-3x a week to volunteer for 2-6 hours a ""shift"". Basically was responsible for letting people in and out of the doors but hey! It counted? 
4. Internship: Honestly, I got it through applying to a million places and a local office got back to me. I think I had a really nice resume and references, so I got to do it over the winter/summer. It was ok, I was responsible for doing intakes and answering the phone line, but wasn't allowed to learn anything specific or ask about things because I wasn't licensed.",1605146180,1,0
You could go to the ucsc psychology department’s website &amp; look over their field study program. It’s an internship opportunity in which you can shadow/volunteer at all sorts of places. It spans anywhere from developmental based volunteer opportunities to even clinical ones!,1605145469,1,0
Idk!! Try looking for an answer on the ucsc web pages on this topic or meeting with a counselor. Good luck lol!,1605143452,1,0

I wouldn't say Tantalo teaches a watered-down 101. He's easier than other professors because his tests are similar to his previous midterms/practice midterms and because he gives soooooo many extensions on assignments. The material is still there and you can still learn from him. Only thing I don't like about Tantalo is the pacing of the class can sometimes be too slow.,1605140757,1,0

"Yes societal pressures are a bitch, but I promise you it is better to remain true to yourself.",1605136226,1,0
I would advise talking to your professors during their office hours and get comfortable talking to them whether it be to ask questions about course material or just getting to know them better. Once you get near the end of the quarter you can ask them about any internships that they know of and it's likely that they'll be able to connect you. You'll be surprised by the amount of connections that professors at the school have and even if it doesn't work it's always good to know your professor better.,1605136016,1,0
"If you were on campus then walking into the advising office and research centers theres always stuff posted on the cork boards. The pysch major advising website probably has opportunities and if youre not shy you can always ask your professors.

Teaching to live video of students is indeed nicer, but we completely understand if you want to turn off your video. Having said that, one potential reason to turn your video on is that it may encourage you to pay more attention to class. Just as you probably wouldn’t want to sleep in lecture (though I’ve seen it often enough), you might be more likely to focus if you know others, including other students, are watching you.",1605125409,1,0

"112 will be hard to get because There is a backlog of people trying to get it. 102 and similar classes will generally have 2 professors teaching it, one very difficult to get into, and the other as an overflow basically. 

The absolute hardest one to get into right now is 130, because they changed the prerequisites of the DC requirement class intro to software engineering to require 130.

Other upper division electives will also be hard to get, but they kind of depend on the popularity of the subject and the difficulty of the class. 183 web dev is pretty easy so it fills up fast. All of the Machine Learning and related classes will fill up quickly too",1605122389,1,0

Try buying a WiFi adapter or getting laptop that will work better with WiFi networks. 3) Contact ITS. Depending on the severity of the issue , they might be able to offer you a solution.

The key to getting a six month lease might be to show some sensitivity to this reality.

"For your first question:

As compared to the game design degree, the BS CS degree has required courses in multivariable calculus (MATH 23A or AM 30), Computer Architecture (CSE 120), Analysis of Algorithms (CSE 102), Computational Models (CSE 103), a programming languages course (CSE 112 or CSE 114 or CSE 116), a computer systems class (CSE 130 or CSE 131), and a statistics class (CSE 107 or STAT 131).  To the extent that you don't take these courses as electives in the game design major, you ""lose out"" on taking these courses. For a complete set of requirements, see: [https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/curriculum-charts/2019-07/CS\_BS\_19-20.pdf](https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/curriculum-charts/2019-07/CS_BS_19-20.pdf)

As compared to the BS CS degree, the CS:Game Design degree has required courses in C++ programming (CSE 111), game design (CM 80K, ARTG 120, CM 176), history and visual elements of games (ARTG 80H, ARTG 80G, FILM 80V), game development (CM 120), and a capstone game project sequence (CM 170, 171, 172 - the ""170"" series). To the extent that you don't take these classes as electives, you ""lose out"" on taking these courses. The 170 series has a long prerequisite chain, and so realistically you would not be able to take this sequence as a BS CS transfer student. You could realistically take ARTG/CMPM 120 with some planning. For a complete set of requirements, see: [https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/curriculum-charts/2019-07/CSGD\_BS\_19-20.pdf](https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/curriculum-charts/2019-07/CSGD_BS_19-20.pdf)

Both degree programs have five elective courses that involve taking upper division CS and CM (games and HCI) classes. Broadly speaking, BS CS students tend to focus these either on artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) or software engineering (CSE 115/116/117), though students can and do choose a wide range of courses to satisfy these electives. CS: Game Design students tend to choose CM (game) classes, such as Game AI (CM 146), Game Graphics (CM 163), Procedural Content Generation (CM 147), Interactive Narrative (CM 148), or a game design project class (CM 179). But, game design students also take some upper division CS classes as well, often AI/ML.

For your second question:

It really depends. Overall, there have been far more game design graduates who have gone on to work in the games industry than BS CS graduates. UCSC game design alums work in every major game studio (except Nintendo, because they're very Japan-focused). There are certainly BS CS students who have gone on to work in the games industry. Many games companies have large numbers of back-end server and web app development positions that game design students are typically not interested in, for which BS CS students are well positioned.

As other posters have noted, getting a job in games, especially at the entry level, is very challenging. Blizzard regularly gets low thousands of applicants for each internship position. So, neither degree can offer any kind of guarantee of getting into the games industry. There are just too many interested and qualified people chasing too few jobs.

That all said, the CS: Game Design degree gives you the opportunity to build up a portfolio of game projects, and gives you the ability to learn some leading-edge skills (game AI, procedural content generation, interactive narrative) which are not generally taught elsewhere. This allows you to better tailor your resume, Linked In profile, and portfolio website to game specific jobs, which does help with job applications. That said, core skills like basic data structures and linear algebra frequently come up in game dev. interviews too.

CS: Game Design students who don't end up working in games tend to work in web application development or mobile application development, where the degree's focus on creating interactive experiences in code gives them an edge. 

If the goal is maximizing total possible job opportunities post-graduation, the BS CS degree has the edge. If the goal is increasing your chances of getting technical game positions, the CS: Game Design degree has the edge. More than your degree choice, doing project work outside of your coursework (individual projects, club projects, research with a faculty member, internship) will give you a big edge over students who stick with their coursework.

Hope this helps!",1606248536,1,0

"I wouldn’t count on it... there are some classes called “summer steadies” which are courses guaranteed to be offered every summer. This past summer though, CSE 101 / 12L was not offered despite both being classified as summer steadies. 

I called this empty promise out to some people in the department and those who did respond seemed super upset that summer session was making promises the CSE department couldn’t keep. Since then *all* CSE courses have been removed from the summer steadies page. 

Furthermore, I think the SOE sees people taking 101 over summer as a threat to enrollment rather than a way to ease the number of students enrolling in 101 come fall quarter. Why do I say this? I won’t say much but basically I was able to take 101 my first summer at Ucsc as well as another upper div cs course. Furthermore I had priority enrollment for fall quarter bc I was in the scholars program and since I had 101 completed I was able to enroll in most of the upper div cs classes I pleased just in my second year.

It was amazing, it was the first quarter I had all the classes I wanted and I was learning so much with such great professors. But when it came to talk to advising they all seemed upset that I was enrolled in so many upper divs. Now I’m not going to imply anything but after that some of the courses I enrolled in that fall later had CSE 130 as a prereq which made no sense other than to bar first years from enrolling in specific upper divs.",1606242156,1,0

"EWRT 2 at DA, ENGL 1B FH

You'd need to submit prerequisite clearance to take the class, which may be an issue. I was briefly a UCSC student, and ended going to De Anza instead. I took the college core class and had the ELWR satisfied via the written assessment. I contacted the De Anza english department but they did not accept that to clear me for EWRT 2 (there are some documents from ucsc saying that College Core + ELWR should allow students to enroll in a WRIT 2 equivalent class at a CC). I ended up having to take the 1A level class.

These are the documents I presented along with my UCSC transcript

"As others have noted, your choice of major isn’t a significant factor in “getting into” law school.  How well you do in school (GPA, primarily, but other indicia as well) is far more important.   Your choice of major might be of other benefit, including training you to think analytically, exposing you to legal concepts and process (which may give you a sense of whether you will like law school), and providing you with an alternative career path if you decide not to pursue the law.  All of those considerations have value.",1604152665,1,0

Now you have to jump through so many fucking hoops that it would drive any normal person to a mental breakdown. If you do not want to become a doctor, you will not survive your upper divs, let alone the MCAT or admissions process. By continuing on with this process, you are just setting yourself up for failure. Even if you do make it into med school, almost 20% of med school students end up dropping out, and the average physician burnout rate is over 40%. 

Seriously, do not continue on this path. Your parents think it is really easy but it isn’t. Its a nightmare. I’m only clawing my way through because of my burning desire to become a physician due to my childhood medical history. If you do continue on this path you will not only be unhappy but will end up with a lot of debt too.

Your parents will get angry and yell at you, threaten you, etc. but you gotta take it on the chin and move on with your life. Don’t let your parents’ stupid ass ideals force you to live the rest of your life miserably. It may take weeks, months, or even years, but eventually they will accept it and they will continue to love you. I’m sorry I don’t have any advice on what career you should pursue instead, but I sincerely hope that you end up doing the things you love.",1602054864,1,0

"MCD Bio and Human Bio are the most common for premeds. Human bio provides an internship, which is really great bc its hard to get hours in Santa Cruz. People who choose MCD over human bio is usually bc of the Spanish requirement in HB. There isn't much of a difference between the two majors as a lot of the premed electives count for both degrees, you can take the labs you need regardless of major, etc. Tbh I wouldn't recommend this school for premeds as there isn't much support, i.e. no MCAT study support, lack of advising, hard to get healthcare experience.

"There are ~300M people in this country to vaccinate. If we vaccinate 800,000 every single day, it will take *an entire year* to vaccinate all of them. Throw into the mix the reality that Pfizer's vaccine needs to be stored and transported at -90F, and there are some serious logistical issues that will impede vaccine distribution. These numbers also assume all vaccines will be delivered solely to US residents, but some argue that people in other countries are actually in greater need, which may also slow down the US vaccination rate.

At the more likely rate of 200,000 vaccinations per day, it will still take more than two years to reach a 50% vaccination rate that *might* allow restrictions to be lifted safely. All of this means that chances are, we'll still be having this conversation about Winter quarter next year, and unless we give up and return to class without a vaccine (which is what happened with most K-12 schools this Fall), in-person classes for Spring quarter are a pipe dream.",1602023397,2,0

"It’s possible to transfer to other UC campuses but very unlikely because they prefer CC students and first year undergrads. I transferred to cal and fall semester this year and I think there were about 200 UC transfers total. There’s like three things that help a lot or are vital to transferring.

1. GPA 3.5+ 
This is probably on the low side, but they’re probably not gonna let you go from an easier school to a harder one if it’s not likely you’re going to succeed. STEM transfers are even more rare 
2. Have other things that you do other than school. If you can show other schools that you can succeed even when working 15+ hours a week that looks pretty cool.
3. Finish GEs. Most uc schools require you get the letter of reciprocity. You transfer in your junior fall year so you’d basically only take major courses.

"There is no realistic scenario where the pandemic will be any different in January. Daily new cases are holding steady at higher than June levels and there have been no real recent advances in treatment either other than continuing vaccine trials. The Regeneron antibody treatment will not be approved or produced in quantities enough to steer the pandemic any time soon.

Vaccine distribution is beginning of winter quarter at the absolute earliest. It will likely be two doses. It is unlikely that vaccination rate will be high enough by end of February to have changed the risk vs benefit of returning to campus by the beginning of Spring quarter. Therefore while it's borderline possible, don't count on returning Spring either. Best to assume you won't until summer and be happily surprised in the case that there's a Spring return to campus.",1602019837,9,0

"`git.ucsc.edu` is the “official” ITS-supported `git` server for the campus. Unless you hear specifically otherwise, you’ll be using it. `gitlab.soe.ucsc.edu` is the `git` server I supported for several years until ITS finally agreed to host an official server. There’s no reason to turn it off, so I haven’t. However, I don’t have the time to provide official support for it, either, so most classes have switched to `git.ucsc.edu`.

Having said that, both `git.UCSC.edu` and `gitlab.soe.ucsc.edu` use the same (open source) software.

In general, questions about `git.ucsc.edu` should go to your professor first, then to ITS if s/he can’t answer them. Questions about `gitlab.soe.ucsc.edu` should go to your professor first, and then to `gitlab-admins@ucsc.edu` if you can’t get an answer.",1602019485,4,0

"He curves when the class’s average is worse than previous years, which in this quarter case it was worse than last year (quarter) cause this is his first time turning the class to fully online.

But he would accept a range of answer like 303.8 or 304.7. This is why the comments on RMP is saying the class is hard, you just need to double check you calculations and make sure every number is right, other wise you will mess up the whole calculation process on the questions later on.

This really helps put it in perspective. Thanks. The RMP reviews made it seem like the class had so much work and no help from the professor. Does he curve or anything? And is there partial credit for the quizzes since they aren’t multiple choice?,1609281647,1,0
"Depends on your learning habits, for me the class was pretty easy and chill. My grade was a B+ at the end but he curved to an A. The class had weekly modules where you will learn 2 sections per week, with section quizzes followed with it. Every homework will have 2 attempts, it will show ALL correct answers once you complete the first attempt. So pretty much you are guaranteed 100% from your homework. The quiz on the other hand was easy at first and slowly build up in later modules. They are not super hard, as long as you learned through the homework(not just keep attempting them and getting the correct answers), you will know how to do the questions on these quizzes. But one thing about these quizzes was that, the questions are all connected together, the answer for one question would lead to the calculation and answers to the following questions. So make sure you check your work for all of them.

I also don’t think students should foot the transition bill since we should be paying for the quality of education, what it would eventually reach already considering the transition.

"1. How strict are the covid testing restrictions? Do they actually check every week or not?
   1. Yes; after less people started showing up to weekly tests, they began enforcement.
2. Do RAs actually care if you have people over to your dorm or apartment?
   1. Yes; however, it is possible to sneak people in if you are quiet/smart about it.
3. Does the campus care if you party off campus? I'm guessing not but just want to confirm.
   1. No way of them knowing
4. If you get caught partying on campus, what is the most likely punishment? In addition to being sent home, what are the other punishments?
   1. You WILL get caught. I was caught 3x in Winter (thankfully by different CSOs) for having \*1\* guest, just because they heard us talking loudly through a window.

"Tbh,

You should probably just stay 1 extra quarter, or even three extra quarters. I could graduate in 3 years, however, as a CS major, I'm choosing to take the 4th year just to get exposure to 9-10 more upper division classes to expose me to a few more things, diversify my skill set, etc.. Looking at the CS graduation requirements, I personally would feel very unprepared with only the bare minimum of courses. 3 Upper-Div Elections + DC + Capstone? It's definitely the bare minimum, and you may find yourself a bit behind in interviews and other stuff.

Plus, taking 4 CS upper division courses at once is almost impossible. If you can even get scheduled properly, which isn't too likely given waitlists a hundred students long for critical courses, the labs for upper division CS courses take dozens of hours per week. More than 2 at once is unfeasible.",1605070001,1,0

editing to add that if schools don't want students to use resources like chegg then, imo, they need to provide a more diverse, inclusive environment where students can feel safe asking questions, and offer more support academically to students. My physics professor at my community college was a HUGE advocate for resources like chegg, in the way that you and I use them, b/c she understood not everyone can make it office hours and she wanted us to use whatever resources we could to grasp what was going on.

Especially when lab0 is basically write your name and copy paste something onto a doc, I think it's pretty fair to lose 20% when you mess up something that simple lol.",1602947094,1,0

"I work at a job where I am looking at a screen all day too. I found that two things really help:

1. Look away every 10 or so mins. Its not good to keep looking at something so close up. You need to relax your eyes by looking away at something a bit farther away than your computer. Look out your window for a bit. Then once your eyes are relaxed again, continue working.

2. Get glasses. Even if you think you don't need them, they can really help. I have had 20:30 vision all of my life and was never bothered by it. One day I decided, what the heck, why not see what it would be like with glasses. And it turns out it is way easier for me to look at a computer screen with my glasses than without.",1602939700,1,0

"As far as I'm aware, you get the amount of credits that it was worth in CC (multiplied by 1.5 too if it was a semester system school). I took psych 1 at my CC and got 4.5, but at this school the exact class is 5 units.",1602932063,1,0
"I finished pa1 like a week ago as well. I understand your frustration but you’re coming off a tad inconsiderate. Instead of complaining why not offer to help these students? I’ve been helping as many people as I can in the discord whenever I have free time. Like someone else previously stated, wouldn’t it be a win win for students at every level if we just convinced him to publish the next assignment earlier? And allow the other students to catch up. Lots of people going through hard times right now with the pandemic. Lots of transfer students that weren’t prepared in c programming or even data structures.",1602931834,1,0
