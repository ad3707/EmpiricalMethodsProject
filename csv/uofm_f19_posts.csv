Study advice for Chem 210?,"I'm having a hard time finding a good study plan for this class. I know everyone always says to do the coursepack but I'm having a hard time figuring out the best way to use it. I've always been a big self-studier, but the lack of answers makes it really difficult to study if youre not in a study group. I've always liked to see what topics I'm falling short on, and see exactly where I went wrong and why. I've also had friends use study groups in other classes and they've told me it didn't have a huge impact on their grade. Furthermore, how do you do practice problems throughout the semester if the questions aren't categorized by which topics they address? It seems like they're just thrown together.

Computer Science vs. Data Science,"Hi,

I'm currently a freshman in CoE. I'm deciding between Computer Science and Data Science and wanted to ask you guys some advice. I'm really interested in AI/ML. Data Science seems to be the perfect major in terms of my interests. However,

* DS seems very narrow in it's focus (in terms of name of major, subject area, etc). CS is general, so I can apply to various SWE jobs, not just DS related. I can specialize in ML stuff specifically within CS.
* At the same time, DS is booming, so there are probably going to be a lot of jobs there.
* CS + DS double major is an option and doable in 4 years, but I might want to do the 4 year BS/MS program instead.
* I am also very keen on minoring in business, but it is not doable to do CS + DS + business. It will probably come down to CS + business, DS + business, or CS + DS. Not sure how the BS/MS deals with minors (can doing a business minor still fit in that program?)

UHS still doesn't cover...,"According to that recent e-mail that was sent out by Dr. Harper (VP for Student Life) &amp; Dr. Ernst (UHS Executive Director) regarding the STI testing coverage thru UHS, it seems like now STI tests are going to be covered again under our ""Health Service Fee."" However, our personal health insurance is still going to be billed for other laboratory testing (excluding STI, pregnancy, and hormonal testing for trans care), radiology x-rays and ultrasounds, and allergy injections. 

So we students are still going to be charged for all of these things, even though they were included in our Health Service Fee before? Can someone please clarify this for me. I feel like all the talk regarding this issue has died down after we found out that STI testing was going to be covered again.

STD screenings are once again free from UHS! Email from Dr. Robert Ernst and E. Royster Harper:,"Dear students:
 
We want you to know that your personal health and well-being are our highest priorities.  
 
We’ve heard your concerns about confidentiality and cost associated with testing for sexually transmitted infections and the worry that these concerns may result in barriers for some students seeking important preventive health-care services at UHS. 
 
After careful consideration we are modifying the policy that was put into effect in July to bill students’ health care insurance plans for all diagnostic testing services, including STI testing.  
 
Effective today, UHS will cover, from the student health service fee, the cost of testing for sexually transmitted infections. Under the policy we will continue to bill insurance plans for other necessary testing and services.
 
You have helped us understand just how important it is to maintain confidentiality in this process all the way through how those tests are paid for. We would never want the payment process for these important medical tests to stand in the way of any student accessing important medical services or testing.
 
We want every student to have access to all forms of health care they may need – from flu shots and mental health counseling to eye exams and contraception services or STI testing – at a cost that is reasonable.
 
The good news is that since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, nearly all students who come to study on the Ann Arbor campus have health care insurance. In addition, the on-campus location of UHS makes health care accessible by a short walk or bus ride for most students.
 
Paying for health care is an ongoing issue that our society continues to explore and at UHS we work hard to leverage all available sources of funding – including health care insurance plans – in order to keep the student health service fee as low as possible. There was no increase in that fee this year.
 
It’s also important to know that UHS has long had in place programs to help students pay for their health care and to keep billing confidential. Addressing a student’s health needs has always been our No. 1 priority. Paying for that care takes many forms – including providing care at no cost for students who may not have access to appropriate resources.
 
We want to personally thank the many students who have helped us understand just how important this topic is. We’ve heard you and we are changing our billing process because of the concerns you have raised directly with us, the UHS staff and other campus leaders.

Another bus question,"I’m a grad student who just started at UM this week.

I commute from Ypsi and park in the commuter lot on south state street.

I’ve used Apple Maps to figure out which board to bus (#62) to get to Central Campus. 

I’ve downloaded the U of M app &amp; DoubleMap but when I try to get an ETA for a bus arrival, it never seems to work. 

Anyways, what’s the usual wait time for the buses? This morning I waited over 20 minutes (along with everyone else) to get picked up and taken to central campus. Yesterday, I experienced about a 20 minute wait as well getting from central campus back to my car in the commuter lot.

I know Apple Maps says “bus comes every 7-10 minutes” or whatever, but I’ve definitely been waiting longer than that. I heard some others complaining about the wait time and was just curious if this is typical or if there’s a reason for the delay.

I’m not trying to complain because I really love the buses and drivers &amp; it’s such a good way to get around campus! Thanks in advance.",1567802092,0,0

How many opportunities will I have to do robotics-related stuff? 

Thanks for the help in advance.",1571428249,4,0
"The ""Secret Society"" within The University of Michigan","I figured I would do a short writeup on this, as in my time at the University of Michigan it seemed that a lot of people, students and staff alike, were unaware of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Order of Angell, formerly (and perhaps more often) known as ""**Michigamua**"", is an odd, secret society that exists at the University of Michigan. The organization began in 1902, and, by all accounts, has continued every year since then - only allowing around 25 students in per year (though how accurate this figure is is unknown). Potential members are contacted privately, but casually, often through connections such as fellow students or staff. They're instructed to meet with some of the other members, and to consider joining. These members are typically students with some prominence or leadership roles- Football Quarterbacks, Hockey Captains, Fraternity/Organization leaders, sons and daughters of prominent figures, even former president (and football player) Gerald Ford was known to be a member. These students are often contacted in their junior year- to become a part of the Order for their Senior year (though how involvement persists after graduation is something of a mystery).  

&amp;#x200B;

Their intended purpose is unknown. Initially, in the few releases of information they would give, they would simply say something among the lines of ""Connect Proven, Diverse Leaders"", to ""Fight like hell for Michigan"", or to otherwise serve as leaders in the University. Despite this, there are sparse if *any* known events, actions, or initiatives directly backed by The Order of Angell, making their true purpose a bit of a mystery. 

&amp;#x200B;

At some point in the 1970s, it was determined that the group had started performing ""Rituals"", perhaps similar to those performed by modern Freemasons (think less sacrificing lambs and more performing theatrical performances in somewhat silly outfits).  Details on this are unfortunately also somewhat unknown, but their official(?) website and other sources state that this had a Native American bend to it, which was found to be controversial (read: racist), leading to the name change from Michigamua to The Order of Angell. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are some accounts of an internal mascot of a Wolf, though I had some trouble substantiating this. 

&amp;#x200B;

That about all there is to it. While ""spooky"", in these situations the most boring and mundane answer is often the correct one. I would theorize that The Order of Angell, for the most part, is largely simply a tradition bound organization for wealthy, well-connected, and/or typically ""elite"" students within the University of Michigan to talk and 'network' and generally organize stances on various topics within the University of Michigan and surrounding areas. I could be jaded and wrong, but who knows. 

&amp;#x200B;

It should also be noted that the group went through some significant rebranding lately. While it was more of a ""secret society"", it's now rather public if you know where to look- even offering an entire members list. That being said, it still seems like it ""prefers"" a low-profile, and it's system of only recruiting 25 ""elite"" students every year is still particular. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Again, by all accounts it's probably just an organization that originally started so wealthy elite white students could hang out and now only continues for tradition, with just ""networking"" and making sure major groups have roughly the same public stances on things.

"Changes of getting financial aid with a 146,000 household income","Hi! 
I’m applying on transfer to UM next year after getting my associate degree from a community college. I will have to study there for 2 years and I pay in-state tuition. According with FAFSA, my expected family contribution will prolly be like 33,000 dollars/year (I haven’t submitted it yet, but that’s the average for my income). This is basically the entire cost of attendance for UM. Do I still have chances of getting any financial aid, if my expected family contribution is the cost of attendance? 
I understand that my family has a high income, but we only have 25,000 in savings and moved to the USA in 2017. Before living here, we would make about 35,000 dollars/year considering the currency conversion and had no money left for savings whatsoever. The savings that we have cannot be fully used as we do not have a house in the US, and part of it should go to the down payment of the house we are planning to buy. 
Do you think it’s worthy talk with financial aid and explain my situation? Has anyone with a similar situation got some good financial aid?

"Win $20,000 to do self-directed work next Summer through optiMize - apply by October 10th!","Chances are if you are not a freshman (don't worry we love freshies too), you've seen the big white boards on the Diag that are painted colorfully in response to the question, ""If you could change on thing in the world, what would it be?""

If you haven't seen those, you've probably seen the baby blue sweatshirts, or the enormous amount of flyers. Well now there is a reddit post too.

I am here to promote the *Social Innovation Challenge.*  It is simple: we, optiMize, a student-led social entrepreneurship incubator, ask you what you want to change about the world, we put on workshops, connect you with mentors in your field of interest, and in the Spring, you apply for up to $20,000 per team.

We accept everybody that applies! The application is really simple, and there is no pressure to have a fully fleshed out idea yet - lots of people who end up winning money only have a vague idea of what they want to do when the challenge starts.

If you have questions, or are interested in applying to the challenge, I got the links for you. You can apply at [optimizemi.org](https://optimizemi.org), or apply directly at  [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2FjmQ2EA-CcZMqgr2AYdpdCW9wH8t93ZOR5OnirwY5E85kg/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2FjmQ2EA-CcZMqgr2AYdpdCW9wH8t93ZOR5OnirwY5E85kg/viewform) .

Is there some law that says you (as a pedestrian crossing a sidewalk) have to yield for a blue bus?,"This afternoon I decided it was time to take a spin scooter from North Campus down to Central because I needed to take it off my bucket list. It was smooth sailing, and I had a lot of fun until I approached a crossroad with traffic lights. I saw the pedestrian traffic light was white, so I just gunned it... because I thought I had the right of way? 

As I was about to leave the sidewalk and enter the road, I saw this Northwood Blue Bus steer left, into my way, and it did not stop even though I was gesturing to enter the crosswalk.

I saw it steer into my way and I slammed on the brakes of my scooter, and I flew out and ate shit on the pavement. The bus just kept going. I didn’t catch what number it was, just that it was a Northwood bus. This was about 5:40 PM. I have the exact location of where I crashed on google maps. It’s right next to the University Hospital. Someone saw me trip over and offered me a ride, but I told her no because I thought my left knee was good but that was just the adrenaline. It fucking hurts right now and my thumb also hurts like shit because I landed on it wrong. I don’t have a recording of this, but I did take a picture of my spin and the spot I was at. 

I sat at the curb for a while before riding the spin back to my dorm. So here’s the question in hand. Why the hell did the blue bus not stop for me when the pedestrian light was white and I could pass?",1569368692,2,0

Help with professional events,"Hi all,

Just a few questions regarding clothing and etiquette for things like career fair, networking, etc.

I’m a sophomore looking to land an internship, I’ll be going to the fall career fair as well as various networking/informational events in the coming months. I know I’m a bit late to the game, but whatever.

Just wondering, what is the dress code like for men at the career fair, networking events, etc. Full suit works for all of them? Networking/info sessions more casual? I asked my mom and dad (both work in finance) and they said the popular look for business casual nowadays is a sports jacket with an unbuttoned collared shirt and jeans, something like [this](https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2015/09/jacket1.png). Would that be acceptable for “business casual” at university recruiting/info events?
 
Does it matter if my suit is black? Was thinking of getting a nice charcoal or grey one, not just black.

On to etiquette for networking events, what do you even do? Should I go with people I know? I have literally 0 experience with what I’d like to intern in (actuarial work, consulting, quant, whatever really, I’m going to do either data science or actuarial math) so I wouldn’t have anything to converse about. 

I tried to formulate my questions well, but I don’t even know where to start. Neither of my parents have been to a “networking event” or career fair in decades so they don’t really know. Any tips would be appreciated.

Also I’m a tall, slim guy (6’2” 36 chest), I was thinking Zara or H&amp;M for a suit, has anyone had a good or bad experience with them? I didn’t find much at the jcpenny event to fit me, often hard to find stuff as a tall skinny dude lol.",1569341212,2,0

Favorite study spots open early morning?,"I know there have been a million posts about nice study spots but I'm looking for pretty much the opposite environment as most people and hopefully compile a comprehensive list. 

I like waking up really early to study (think 4 am) and I'm tired of staying in my dorm to do it, I can't concentrate in the same place I live. The earliest place I know is Starbucks, but that opens at 5:30 and I don't like studying in cafes bc strong smells give me a headache. I know there are a few 24 hour places like the Ugli and the Fishbowl; can I get into those buildings that early? From what I understand I'd have to swipe into Haven Hall by 11:30pm. Any other areas? I don't know if I'd have access to one of the other dorms at that time either or if it'd be weird to be there.

Outside of the weird timing, I'd love general recommendations for busy, natural lighting spots. I like the UMMA, the BSRB, and Ross the one time I've been there lol but my main thing is that I want it to be open. I don't know how to explain it; I like cold glass buildings? It keeps me from getting too comfortable and tired lol. Same with noise level - I want to be in a busy place (but I hate the smell of coffee and I don't really like the Ugli so that rules out most of the loud areas).

The Diversity Staff at the University of Michigan Is Nearly 100 Full-Time Employees," 

Year after year, media note and sometimes bemoan the ballooning cost of higher education.

There are various reasons for surging costs, but the primary one is the remarkable expansion of university administration in recent decades. As Paul Campos, a law professor at the University of Colorado, wrote in the *New York Times* a few years ago:

Universities are large and require administrators to function, of course. The problem is there seems to be no end to the expansion. This point was recently illustrated by Mark Perry, an economics professor at the University of Michigan-Flint.

Perry, who also is a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, used the University of Michigan as an example to highlight the rise of “diversicrats” (diversity bureaucrats) on today’s campuses. The numbers are astonishing.

1. The University of Michigan currently employs a diversity staff of nearly 100 (93) full-time diversity administrators, officers, directors, vice-provosts, deans, consultants, specialists, investigators, managers, executive assistants, administrative assistants, analysts, and coordinators.
2. More than one-quarter (26) of these “diversicrats” earn annual salaries of more than $100,000, and the total payroll for this small army is $8.4 million. When you add to cash salaries an estimated 32.45% for UM’s very generous fringe benefit package for the average employee in this group (retirement, health care, dental insurance, life insurance, long-term disability, paid leave, paid vacation, social security, unemployment insurance, Medicare, etc.) the total employee compensation for this group tops $11 million per year. And of course that doesn’t count the cost of office space, telephones, computers and printers, printing, postage, programs, training, or travel expenses.

If you fell out of your chair upon realizing that the University of Michigan has a full-time diversity staff of nearly one hundred employees, one of whom earns more than the president of the United States, you can be forgiven. I nearly did too.

Which EE Program to Follow?,"Hi, I'm currently a sophomore in Electrical Engineering and am unsure which program guide to follow.  EE has a new guide that they require people who entered in the Fall of 2019 or later to follow, but I entered in Fall 2018 so I am able to choose between the old one or the new one.  The new one replaces the EECS 320 requirement with 2 credit and 3 credit design courses (EECS 200 and 300), but I would likely still end up taking EECS 320 if I choose to do the new one.  I met with an advisor and they suggest the new one because apparently no requirements on the old guide help teach topics that 200 and 300 cover which are nice to have for industry, but as someone who would likely want to work in the semiconductor industry, I don't know if it'd be beneficial and I'd rather take one less class.  Any EE people have experience with either the new guide or old one and have suggestions on which one is better? Thanks!

What Do I mean by the way they did things?


I'm guessing teaching the really basic things, throwing in a lot of group work, making people do basic home work AND team homework, which consisted of insanely complex questions in comparison, and then giving tests that are similarly if not more complex and that by far is the majority of your grade .. . and the team homework only counted for 5 percent of your grade, shit like that

How does off-campus housing work?,"Hello there! As a first-generation college student in my family, I am a little out of the loop of how things work.

So I am interested in living off-campus for the next school year. Let's say I receive a certain amount of financial aid and tuition is $7-$8k. The rest of the money that's leftover, will that get sent to my bank as a refund check and I can use that to pay rent? I'm mostly worried about the cost but if I get a decent refund check, that'll help me a lot. 

Also, on my FAFSA when it asks, ""will you be living on-campus or off-campus?"", I put on-campus just in case my off-campus housing plans fall through. Should I change this? Will this affect anything?

Help.,"I'm not like most of you. I didn't do well in high school. Low B average high B at best. I didn't try hard enough, was and am now even more severely depressed. Recently am working to get a diagnosis for severe ADHD and anxiety and that's looking good at least. I got lucky and got in as a transfer. I did shit my first year as an art student but was inspired by people like you guys doing amazing things in STEM majors-something I wanted to do but gave up on a long time ago. So I took the leap and transferred to LSA with the hope of declaring as a comp sci major and art and design minor. As it stands ill be fine for a minor....probably... I hope. But this semester was a disaster. I've never hated myself more, and that's saying something. I've never had less willpower to do anything. I did terrible obviously and I'm worried about my future. The worst part? If I actually addressed these issues I think I'd have a shot. Its not lack of understanding, its lack of effort. And who knows, maybe I really am not cut out for it, but Ill never know because I haven't done shit. 

I blame no one but myself for my failures. I'm reminded every day by friends and others around me going above and beyond while I cant muster the willpower to even meet bare minimums most of the time. Fuck I can't even take care of myself, I treat my health with such disregard it might as well be on purpose. While worsening anxiety has made it harder lately, I'm a pretty outgoing person and I put on a happy go lucky persona because that's who I was and I SHOULD be. But pretty much no one knows how bad it really is and at this point I don't know how to talk about it with anyone, which only makes it harder because I'm more and more isolated from the people around me. In darker moments where I think about suicide I normally kill the thought quickly as I know how selfish it would be to the people supporting me. But it scares me how much the thought of people finally realizing just how bad my mental state is, makes me want to do it. 

If there's anyone who can say something, anything, that might help-even if its just to say that I'm not the only one blowing the best thing they've ever had happen to them, please. I need something. Sorry you had to read this stupid shit.",1575564248,1,0

In the twentieth century, what one did, or was able to do, in one’s spare time became more than merely personal choice, but battles over women’s rights, civil rights, respectability politics, citizenship, and class status.""

I WANT to take this class, but I worry about taking up space in a class that isn't really meant for me (i'm a white cis woman). Participation is also a big part of the grade, and I worry that i won't feel totally comfortable in discussion because i won't be able to speak to some of the struggles.

I feel like not only is this preventing students from taking courses they actually want to take, but it also may be preventing students from taking courses period. Finding enough qualified staff seems to be an issue, in addition to ballooning interest in CS.

Should I Switch My Major From Pre-Med?,"Hi everyone,

Some background here- I'm currently a freshman about to begin their second semester at U of Michigan, in the college of Literature Sciences and Arts. I started out intending to major in bio pre-med, but after taking my first biology class and hating it, I changed to neuroscience pre-med. As I just said, I really did not enjoy my first science class at Michigan, to the point that I am thinking of trying to transfer into the School of Kinesiology and become a sports management major. Sports are another one of my passions (like medicine) and I think this would overall give me not only an easier path to a degree, but a more enjoyable one as well.

I have a lot of reservations/questions about this, most of which I'll need to answer internally, but I was hoping for some advice from someone who may have been in a similar situation in the past. 

Essentially, I'm worried I'm folding too early and not trying to stick out pre-med, at least for a little longer. I know that I enjoy medicine and helping people, yet my first semester was such a turn-off, per se, that I am scared that I'm heading down the wrong career path. To me, sports management seems like a safer and more enjoyable option, I'm just not sure in the long run it will be as fulfilling to me as pre-med is. 

I'm more than aware that this post is extremely vague, but I'm hoping someone will be able to help me. Please let me know of any advice/people you would recommend talking to.

I really liked 101 and 102 because I felt like a lot of that material will be useful for me going forward.",1577544946,1,0

Ann Arbor High-Rise Apartment Guide and Rankings,"I think this is something that has been long overdue for this sub. Every year, people have questions about the high-rise ""luxury"" apartments around campus: which are the best, which should be steered clear of, and whether or not they're even worth it at all. There is little guidance outside of anecdotal stories from friends and Google reviews to go off of, so if you are considering living in one of these buildings, consider this the only comprehensive guide you'll ever need to assist you in your search and when deciding which buildings to tour.

The buildings I will be discussing in this post (alphabetically) are ArborBlu, Foundry Lofts, Hub, Landmark, Six11, University Towers, Varsity, Vic Village, YOUnion, Zaragon Place, and Zaragon West (not The Yard on South Main or The Courtyards). Obviously, these are NOT the only places to live around campus, and there are plenty of quality low-rise apartments and houses to live in if you so choose. Yes, these buildings are pricey, and some people may not be able to afford them, and that's ok. These places are not the only places to live in Ann Arbor for students. This post is primarily geared towards those who have the means and are looking to live in one of these buildings anyway, not to persuade everyone to live in one of these places, so I hope this post is helpful to those in their apartment search.

To begin, I have lived in a few of these buildings, and I have had multiple friends who have lived in every single building on this list, meaning I have experience with all of them. Some negative aspects are common among most of the buildings, among them poor management, hidden costs, and expensive parking, but they are different enough that some are definitely better than others to live in. These 11 buildings will be ranked within 3 groups. I'm sure there will be some people with an attachment to their building who will disagree with me, but this is merely meant as a guide exposing what each building is and isn't good at.

Let's begin:

# Group III: Do not recommend

This group is self-explanatory. It is not recommended to live in these places, there are much better options. They are low quality, incredibly overpriced, or both.

# 11. University Towers

Quality: 1/5

Amenities: 1/5

Location: 4/5

University Towers looks like a drab Eastern European Soviet concrete high-rise like you might see in the show Chernobyl. To put it plainly, this building is so incredibly outdated compared to the other ones on campus that nobody should even consider living here. This building targets college students who are inexperienced with finding housing, usually by spam-emailing people's umich email addresses, and then takes advantage of them. The rooms are tiny, the quality is lacking, and the residents complain that the heat in uncontrollable. There is constantly something wrong with the units in this building and maintenance is notoriously bad. There is also no laundry in-unit, so there is a central facility like there is in the dorms. The management of this place is some of the worst around, and tend to give people a very hard time.

This place offers rooms from singles to triples, and the location on South U is probably the only good thing U-Towers has going for it. U-Towers tends to be among the cheaper high-rise options in the city, but my advice is that if you can afford it, live somewhere else, and if the price is the only place you are considering this place, you will be infinitely better in a house or low-rise apartment with the same money than this hellhole of a building. This is the only building on this list that I will definitively say do not live here under any circumstances.

# 10. Zaragon West

Quality: 2/5

Amenities: 2/5

Location: 2/5

Zaragon West is like the little brother to the ""real"" Zaragon on South University, and is inferior in pretty much every way. Its location is strange, as even though it's still close to the university, it's not clustered with any of the other high rises and E William Street tends to attract a much different crowd than the South U and Huron Street areas. Everything is walkable in Ann Arbor, so no matter where you live you can get places, but when you are paying to live in downtown the difference of every block in distance can't be understated. Zaragon West rooms are small, and they have been getting in the habit recently of squeezing 4 people into units made for 2 where each person has a twin bed. One year I had a friend who was forced to share a room smaller than the rooms in Markley with a roommate, and the closet couldn't even fit half of one person's stuff. There really is almost zero storage space in these rooms. Nobody paying this price for an apartment should have a twin bed with a smaller closet than the worst dorm on campus.

Common areas and kitchens are actually pretty nice, but are small as well compared to the other high-rises. Bathrooms are in each bedroom, meaning you will have to share one if you are in one of the forced double rooms. There are washer-dryers in-unit, and there is a gym on the first floor that is not high quality. Since the units are small, sometimes incredibly cramped, and the experience is no better than a dorm suite, I would highly, highly recommend not living here.

# 9. Hub

Quality: 2/5

Amenities: 2/5

Location: 3/5

The Hub was actually built pretty recently, but it is definitely the worst choice in the cluster of high-rises right around Huron Street. The rooms have poor dimensions, and most of the units have long, dark hallways, giving a cramped feel. The rooms are very small and the common areas are not great. The walls in the units are incredibly thin. In the vast majority of units, bathrooms are not attached to the rooms even if there is one bathroom per bedroom. Hub management is poor and usually condescending and the place will nickel and dime you to no end, even more than some of the other buildings. The units are incredibly overpriced for what you get with this place.

Hub offers rooms from studios to 4 person rooms. There is a rooftop patio with a hot tub that is sometimes fun to use. There is a gym in the building which is also ok. Overall, this apartment just doesn't have enough going for it to justify the incredibly hefty price, and you will be living in a cramped space with not a lot of upsides for what you get. There are four high-rise buildings right near each other in the area, so while some of the others aren't great either, this should be your last choice in the area.

# 8. YOUnion

Quality: 2/5

Amenities: 2/5

Location: 3/5

YOUnion has been around for a little while relative to the other buildings in the area. They tend to do renovations for extensive periods of time which can disturb the residents. The strangest thing about the bedrooms in each unit is that there are no overhead lights and no closets, only a small lamp and an armoire. The rooms are a fine size other than that. The walls in this apartment are also incredibly thin, and the heat tends to be very unevenly distributed between the rooms. A huge drawback of this building is that there is no washer-dryer in-unit, which some of the worse apartments even have. Instead, there is community laundry which is similar to the dorms. The common areas in the units are actually pretty spacious and pretty nice. Rooms range from studios to 4 people, but it seems that they have started creating forced 5 people rooms recently, in which case if your apartment has more than 4 people in this building stop and turn around immediately.

A few things about this building are just not up to par, For starters, the wifi in this apartment is sometimes pretty unreliable and cuts out frequently. There is a gym, but it isn't really that great. They also charge a fee to every resident for utilities that is around $100 a month, which is just absurd and borderline theft. This place makes no secret about taking as much money as possible. The location is good if you like being near state street and pretty close to Main Street, but if you want to live in this area, there is really only one top quality choice, which is much later on the list.

# 7. Six11

Quality: 2/5

Amenities: 2/5

Location: 5/5

Six11 has a fantastic location which makes up for a lot of things. This place has a lot of people in Ross due to the fact that its brand new and it's right across the street from the building. It's pretty new, but the walls are very thin and the rooms are pretty small compared to some of the better apartments in the cities. The common areas are big, and the bathrooms are mostly not attached to the rooms, although every room does have its own bathroom, none shared. The kitchen is nice and the maintenance staff is pretty decent. Washer-dryers are in-unit.

Already mentioned but by far the biggest drawback is the size of the bedrooms. They are VERY small. Heating is also kind of inconsistent throughout the rooms. Management has had mixed reviews, with some people saying they are really helpful and some saying the opposite. There's a gym that's just ok in the building too. Six11 also favors larger groups, there are studios but all of the rest of the apartments are for 4, 5, or 6 person groups. Honestly, this place is not stellar by any means, and is kind of like the Hub just on South U, but it gets this ranking by virtue of its location and not having as many drawbacks as the places lower on this list. Seriously, the location makes me a LOT more lenient on some of the drawbacks. It's for sure very, very overpriced, but just fine enough that if you can afford to live here you won't hate it and might just like it well enough.

# Group II: Fine choices to live

These buildings are quality choices to live in, but still have some drawbacks that the top choices don't have.

# 6. Foundry Lofts

Quality: 3/5

Amenities: 4/5

Location: 3/5

Foundry is such a contradiction. I lived here one year, and so many times was I caught between saying that the management sucked so bad that it was the worst place and then visiting other apartments and being grateful for how big my room was. I came to realize that this place has some big positives but also some of the biggest negatives of all the high-rises in the city. Foundry offers rooms from studios to 4 person units.

To begin with the positives, every room in every unit has a private bathroom in-room. I cannot understate how much of a plus an in-room bathroom is vs a shared or not in-room one is. Once I had one, I knew I needed to live in an apartment which had this feature in the future and couldn't go back. To continue, the rooms are decent size, the common areas are huge, and the kitchens are great. There is a 7-Eleven in-building so you don't even need to go outside, and there is a hot tub and outdoor patio that are must-use amenities along with a fine gym. Washer-dryers are in-unit and there is more kitchen storage than you'll know what to do with.

Now for the bad stuff. The furniture used in the apartments is the cheapest by far in any of these buildings. I'm talking wooden slabs and metal stands for tables, uncomfortable plastic chairs, and low quality sinks in the bathrooms with no storage underneath. The thermostats in this place are not quality and determine the heat for the whole space, so if two roommates disagree on how cold rooms should be at night vs common area temperature there are going to be arguments. Not to mention this place HEMORRHAGES heat in the winter. My room was about 50 degrees in January, and they needed to give us space heaters to not give us frostbite in our own rooms. Hot water for showers runs out after about 15 minutes. Finally, management will straight up steal your money. I'm talking losing rent checks and then charging huge late fees for ""missing"" rent. It costs $500 to sign over a lease which should be illegal so subletting is a risk. Parking is off the walls expensive. Finally, one of the elevators is almost always broken, forcing you to use the stairs all the time.

This place has some big positives most places don't have, but the management here is some of the worst in the city and are straight up incompetent at times. They even took my security deposit for damages that didn't exist. I enjoyed being closer Kerrytown and Main Street in addition to being close to State Street, and the private bathroom is a game-changer, but the management here is so incredibly bad that it ruined the experience for me and so many others. Definitely a gamble living here, and there is a better option if you want to live in the area.

# 5. ArborBlu

Quality: 3/5

Amenities: 3/5

Location: 5/5

ArborBlu is in a fantastic location. It is similar to Six11 in the sense that is houses a lot of Ross students due to its location as well as being one of the priciest options among the high-rises. I will start by saying that is ArborBlu wasn't through the roof expensive, it would be even higher on the list. Apartments in ArborBlu tend to cater to smaller groups, as the vast majority of rooms are for 1-3 people. There are a few apartments that can fit 5 people that are really big as well. As for the apartments themselves, the furniture is high quality, and the kitchens are great. The rooms in the apartments are nice, not too big but definitely not small either, with huge closets. Although bathrooms are not attached to the rooms unless you live in a single, the bathrooms are big, quality, and the showers have a bathtub which most of the other high-rises don't have. Washer-dryers are in-unit.

I debated a lot whether to put ArborBlu before or after Foundry. ArborBlu definitely has fewer drawbacks, but the price is just insane, similar to Hub and Six11. Foundry is less expensive if you sign early enough, but the cheap furniture and bad heating just is too big of a drawback even when considering the in-room bathrooms. ArborBlu gets a lot of points for its location, which is the best in the city right off of South U and so close to campus. There is a great study space and the rooftop indoor lounge is phenomenal as a study spot. While definitely specific to only a few apartments, some rooms can see the Rick's line from the window, which is a huge plus for going out if you're into it. The apartments used to not be individually metered for utilities, which if still true is a huge red flag. Overall, just like a lot of the high-rise apartments, there are a lot of drawbacks to go with the positives. The ridiculously high cost cannot be overlooked for this place, but there is enough quality and fewer drawbacks than the place on this list that it can be a good option if money isn't an issue. Definitely live here over Six11 in the area if choosing between those two. In reality, the places that are really worth it most for the cost are the four buildings above ArborBlu on the list.

# 4. Landmark

Quality: 4/5

Amenities: 3/5

Location: 4/5

Landmark is a classic in the high-rise community. It is one of the older ones in the city, but it has been a fine choice since it was built and remains a fine choice today. Landmark offers rooms that range from studios to 6-person rooms. The common areas are nice, and the rooms are a good size. Most units in Landmark do not have their own bathrooms in-unit and it is likely you will be sharing a bathroom if you live here, but some people do get their own. The kitchen space is nice and there are washer-dryers in-unit. An interesting feature of Landmark that is pretty much unheard of in other similar apartments is that you can actually open the windows in the bedrooms. In other high-rises, you can't open the windows at all which can lead to places sometimes getting stuffy, but Landmark doesn't suffer from this issue.

Landmark has a fantastic location right off South U, and is located right above a 7-Eleven. The gym is alright and there is a hot tub and hammocks on the rooftop. However, this place loses some points for being a little outdated compared to some of the newer buildings, and management is notoriously not the greatest to the residents. Overall, it is a bit cheaper than places like Hub, Six11, and ArborBlu, making it more worth it for the price. Since it has been around longer, it isn't uncommon for maintenance requests to be more frequent and some parts of the apartments to be showing wear and tear. Walls are thin and elevators are frequently out of service. Hallways here are frequently littered with trash from residents. If you're not careful, they will nickel and dime you to no end. Overall, Landmark is a fine choice to live in, but you have to beware for the typical traps these corporate-owned high-rises pose to residents. If you can navigate them, consider giving Landmark a shot.

# Group I: The top places to live

These buildings are the best the high-rise market has to offer. Definitely take the opportunity to live in one of these places over lower ones on the list.

# 3. Varsity

Quality: 5/5

Amenities: 5/5

Location: 3/5

Varsity immediately gets a lot going for it by being less expensive AND higher quality than all of the other buildings in the area. It is a lot less pricey than places like Six11 and ArborBlu and is just better overall anyway. The bedrooms are actually a good size and the bathrooms are high quality. The common areas are spacious, and the furniture is of good quality. If you want to live here, try to get one of the units that has one bathroom per bedroom, as again this is such a game-changer, but if you do end up with one with a shared bathroom it isn't the end of the world. Specifically, the 4 bedroom apartments are some of the best around. Washer-dryers are in-unit too.

Varsity offers rooms for 1 person, 2 people and 4 people. There is a gym in-building which is quality, and the indoor rooftop lounge is very nice. If you want to live in the cluster of buildings around Huron Street, highly recommend living here over Foundry, YOUnion and Hub. There aren't a lot of drawbacks to living here, and it is more likely than not that you will enjoy your experience here. Everyone I know who has lived here has enjoyed it. When you're living in an apartment this nice for the price, the location is also pretty good even if it isn't near the much more desirable South U neighborhood. Living right near State Street and the CVS definitely has its perks. If you want a quality apartment and not pay absolutely through the roof compared to some of the other buildings, live here.

# 2. Zaragon Place

Quality: 4/5

Amenities: 4/5

Location: 5/5

Zaragon is probably the most classic high-rise apartment building in Ann Arbor, it's been around for a little while, but it has quality and the vast majority of people who live here enjoy it. Apartments in Zaragon are only offered for 2 and 4 people, each of which has one bathroom for every 2 people. The exception is the penthouses, which are two floors and can fit up to 6 people. These penthouses are hard to get and really not worth living in because they're constantly trashed from parties, but they're definitely fun to visit. If you're going to live here, live in one of the regular apartments.

As for the apartments themselves, the common areas are huge. They are great for gatherings, and the furniture and kitchen are great quality. The bedrooms are a good size and the bathrooms are quality too. One notable thing is while a lot of the high-rises have thin walls, people generally say that Zaragon's walls are much thicker. Washer-dryers are in-unit. Zaragon's rooms are just generally great quality, spacious, and definitely worth the price relative to the other buildings around town. The location can't be beat, and you won't be overpaying like you would be in ArborBlu or Six11. I already mentioned this, but Zaragon Place is NOTHING like the sister building Zaragon West. Zaragon West is not a good apartment and is small, while Zaragon Place is in a fantastic location, has better quality rooms, and overall a much better experience. If you can afford a high-rise, Zaragon should be at or near the top of your list. The only thing that would make it better is if each room had its own bathroom. For a while, it was actually the best option in town to live in all things considered, and was only surpassed recently for the best place. Live here if you can, unless something is available in the next and best building. 

# 1. Vic Village

Quality: 5/5

Amenities: 5/5

Location: 5/5

Vic Village has everything. It's brand new as of Fall 2019, and you will not find any better high-rise in the city than this place. This has been my home this year, and I can attest that between living in and visiting every place in the city that no place comes close to the quality that Vic Village has to offer. Before I get into the positives, let me start by saying that it's actually cheaper to live in than almost every other place on this list, which is insane given that the rooms and common areas are so much bigger and nicer.

Nearly every room in Vic Village has a private bathroom in-room. There are a few exceptions, but the vast majority of the apartments has one bathroom per resident in each room. Once again, the importance of how great this is cannot be understated. Next, the rooms are huge, definitely the biggest out of all the high rises. My room this year is probably twice the size of my room in Foundry and probably two and a half times the size of a room in a place like Hub or Six11. The closets are incredibly spacious too. The bathrooms are crazy nice, with rain showers and granite top sinks in each room. The common areas are very spacious and have a lot of glass windows that let in natural light, especially if you can score a corner apartment. The furniture and couches are very quality, and the kitchen is top-notch. A small but notable plus is that they bolt the TV to its stand so you can't break it, which believe it or not can be an issue due to potential damages.

Rooms in Vic Village range from 2 to 6 people, but there is no difference in quality between the sizes of apartment. I currently live in a 6 person apartment and thought it would be overwhelming initially, but it is so spacious and nice that the size has never been close to an issue. Do not be scared to live in a 5 or 6 person apartment in this building. A huge positive that no other building has in the city is that you can get an app to put your key on your phone. I haven't used my physical key fob all year, and don't need to worry about losing it when going out. It also means if you have a best friend or boyfriend/girlfriend who is in your apartment very often, you can set up keys on their phones so you don't have to let them in every single time if you are comfortable with it. Another huge plus is that the thermostats are brand new and digital, letting you customize a lot of heat settings for the apartment. Not only that, there are separate thermostats for the bedrooms and the common area, which can be huge. Washer-dryers are in-unit.

Vic Village also has some of the best management in town. They are helpful, understanding, and work with the residents, which is pretty much unheard of in all of the other high-rise buildings. The gym in building is the best one in any of the high rises, and Joe's Pizza being located directly underneath the building is a huge bonus, especially due to its late hours. The rooftop is really nice during the window when it's warm outside at the beginning and end of the school year. Really the only negative I can think of is while the walls are not thin, sound can carry throughout the whole apartment through the vent above the beds and couches. Considering how amazing the place is though, it's a small price to pay. The location is the best in the city and is about a minute and a half walk to the Diag and about a minute walk to the South U restaurants and bars. Nearly every place on this list can have a case made against it for one reason or another, but you'd be hard to find a Vic Village resident that doesn't think every penny is worth it. If there are any rooms available, try your hardest to live here before considering any other place on the list. You just can't beat the location, price, quality, and amenities that Vic Village has to offer. Perfect score.

I hope this post gave you a lot of insight into the high-rise apartment living in Ann Arbor beyond what you'll see on Google reviews and the fluff these places show on their websites. When choosing a place to live, consider all of the positives and negatives, including the price, to determine if it's ultimately worth it for you.

Does LSA get more challenging?,"Hello all, first year here looking for some advice.


I’m a freshman in the college of LSA and after a semester of comp sci, first year reading, cognitive science, and math (115), I’ve started to worry about the difficulty of LSA. I don’t mean to come off as arrogant, but this semester was pretty easy for me (all A’s and A+’s except for an A- in math which I could have avoided). I’m choosing challenging classes for next semester (physics, astrophysics, math (116), and comp sci), but they are all STEM related because I was afraid I wasn’t going to be challenged enough in other classes.

I guess it might be part of the culture of LSA? My advisor told me “take ___ because it’s an easy A and could lighten up the schedule.” What?? I came to Michigan to be challenged in LSA (I’m not quite sure I want to be an engineer), but now I’m afraid, and I know it won’t be a cake walk or anything and that I’ve only taken lower level classes thus far, that it won’t be as challenging as I’d like it to be.

Should I look to transferring into another college that has more challenging liberal arts? I want to explore various subjects but I also like to be challenged.


I’m sorry if I came off as arrogant, but I’d like your input. Also, if anyone has any class recommendations that would be appreciated. Thank you and enjoy your break.",1577424507,1,0

Math 214 F19 PSA and Complaint,"I just completed Math 214 this past semester and got my final grade back a few days ago. I was talking with a friend who also took the class and we both felt we did better than our grades showed. 

So I used an excel spreadsheet to calculate what my grade should be according to what is in gradescope and it turns out both of our calculated grades using the syllabus weightings are significantly higher (1 to 2 letter grades) than our transcript grade we received recently.

This is only my first semester here but I even know this class was organized pretty poorly this semester and the fact that we still have ungraded homework from the beginning of October and we already have a final grade is obnoxious.

Anyways, if you took math 214 this semester I'd encourage you to calculate your final grade to double check the accuracy of your transcript grade. Because I believe that there may have been a mass error with the grade calculation unless there is a discrepancy I am not aware of. I emailed the class coordinator about my concerns so I'll see if he gets back to me as well, and I'd encourage any one of you with a concern to do so as well.

As far as my spreadsheet calculations went, I used the syllabus on the course site for my weightings and the final project description pdf to calculate the weightings of my overall final project grade, as well as the webwork website and gradescope for grades. I ignored all of the ungraded written homework and the 2 unreleased webwork assignments that I just discovered (9 and 10).

There are 2 places my calculation method (or the class's grading calculations) may be wrong:

1. For the webwork grades page, it says there are webworks 9 and 10 that were never released but are counted in the overall grade. On the course site it was explicitly told that there are only 8 webworks and I never had my professor mention the 9th and 10th ones. Also when you click on them, it gives an error, so im not sure what that means. Anyways, even if I count the ww 9 and 10 as zeros in my grade I should still have a higher letter grade than my transcript shows.
2. The written homeworks 3, 4, 6, and 7 have not been graded yet. This is obviously potential for a major change in grade but with my personal grades, there is still enough of a gap between my calculated grade and the next letter grade mark boundary for a change in my homework scores to not affect the resulting final grade. I'm not sure how the professors calculated our final grade already without 4 of the 7 homework assignments or if they will even grade them eventually but this is also a major complaint about the class as already discussed in another post.

Anyways this whole matter is very frustrating and there hasn't been much transparency between the students and the class staff other than a few scattered canvas announcements saying they are running behind.

So please check your grades with the syllabus's weightings and the recent announcement on canvas of letter grade boundaries and make sure you are getting the grade you deserved.",1577253388,1,0

I'm not discouraged at all about being a CS major and i feel like i'm a much better coder than what my grades reflect. My issue with 280 this past semester was I would procrastinate far too much and i didn't have any motivation to do the labs(both of which i need to change).

Where to complain about a class without course evals,"Math 214 was a bit of a shitshow this year. As of ~3 days before the final, they had only graded 1/6 homeworks and 0/2 projects. Even now, they still have 4/6 homeworks, the final project, and the final exam ungraded. I know the 72 hour deadline for final grades isn’t always possible to achieve, but having this level of grading backlog after classes are over is not OK imo. 

To give an idea of when they expect to be done, they have set the regrade request deadline for the final exam as January 31. Even assuming a generous 2 weeks after the exam grades are out to submit regrades, the grades would be out mid-January, a full month after the exam. I think I’m pretty reasonable in being unhappy with the situation.

Math 214 didn’t have course evals so I don’t really know where to complain about this, is there an email or contact form for the Office of the Registrar (or some other office that handles these things) someone could point me to?",1577051847,1,0

Question about EECS Course Selection over the Spring 2020 Half-Semester,"Hey guys, sophomore transfer student here. I'm going to be completing EECS 280 during the Winter 2020 term, and I'm interested in continuing my studies over the Spring term. I've very studious, and I've always loved CS and programming. I have had a good few years of experience with programming in particular.

What I wanted to ask about was this: I'm definitely going to take at least one EECS course over the Spring. Seeing some of the posts here, I think it may not be a good idea to do both 281 and 370 together, at least over a half-term. However, would it be doable to do 281 and 376 over the Spring if they are offered? Or should I do 281 and work on my foreign language requirement (French)?

EECS Advice!,"Hey  I'm a sophomore in LSA with intent to major in CS. 

Last semester (2019 Winter), I took EECS 280 and EECS 203, but unfortunately ran into some personal issues ( really heavy depression  and family issues), which caused me to have poor performance in these classes. I got a C in EECS 280 and 203. (I didn't bring up issues to professors I just felt embarrassed and weak). 

Over the summer, I worked on my mental health issues, and decided to retake EECS 280 this semester (fall 2019) in hopes to still declare CS.
 I performed much better this semester, and before the final I had a B+ projected grade in the class.
However, I just took the final exam and despite studying a crazy amount and taking the final, I'm not sure I'll make the B grade I need in order to meet the 2.5 GPA requirement to take EECS 281. 

The easiest thing to do if I don't meet the 2.5 GPA requirement would be to retake EECS 203- but I really don't want to do this, as it would delay graduation. 

I don't know how to feel, and am pretty stressed about this. Any advice for who I could reach out to, or what to do.

Online Masters of Applied Data Science vs. Masters of Science in Information with an emphasis in data science vs. Data Science Masters Program through the stats dept?,"Anyone in any of these programs who can share some insight on the differences as far as curriculum and career outcomes? I know the masters of applied data science (MADS) program through the school of information just launched this semester but if anyone has any knowledge about this that would help me out. 


I’m about to graduate with my masters of social work and want to go down the data science route to help use data to solve social problems and develop better therapeutic interventions as well as boost my salary. 


From what I can see online, the MADS program is 34 credits (1 year) taken online and the MSI program is 48 credits (2 years) taken in person. The masters in data science through the stats department looks like it has more prereqs. 


Is the MSI program just broader? Does it look better to employers to take one of these programs over the other? If I did the MADS, will I be able to work as a data scientist? I’m skeptical due its online and shorter nature.",1576528782,1,0

Looking for a motivated undergrad volunteer in my DNA repair lab,"Hello, I’m posting here because UM actually doesn’t have many good resources to find undergrads interested in research outside of URO, which is not exactly what I’m looking for. 

I am a laboratory technician studying DNA double strand break repair in yeast at the BSRB. I am currently working on data for a publication and I would love some help. Activities would include general lab duties such as streaking plates, washing glassware and making reagents but I can also offer training and experience in many current laboratory techniques such as droplet digital PCR, next generation library preparation and more. I also have some ideas for an independent project that you can work on. 

I’m looking for a motivated undergrad in a STEM major that can put in around 10 hours a week, about 2 hours a day.

SSD accommodations process,"I submitted the SSD accommodations form at the end of October for a medical condition and didn’t hear back until the end of November from SSD. They requested paper work to move forward and my doctor submitted paper work directly to them right away because we were both nervous if I could get accommodations in time for finals. I then didn’t hear back until a week after that asking me to email a staff member with times I would be available to register. I sent the email and received confirmation that they would get back with me for the meeting time. At this point it was the last week of classes and definitely too late to submit accommodations for my classes this semester and I had to take my final exams without accommodations which put me at a severe disadvantage. I also still have not heard from the staff member or SSD for an appointment to register.  I think I may not pass a class due to the final alone which I would have had a fair chance at with accommodations.

Does the website automatically remove those applications once the listings themselves expire? I will contact the ECRC, but I was wondering if anyone had the same experience.",1570221213,6,0

I’m a reporter at Business Insider and I’m working on a project that I thought some of y’all might want to get involved in. **We are interested in writing a feature story that would focus in on what a day in the life is like for an average University of Michigan student.** We wrote a piece similar to this about an Oxford student in the past. (link included below). If any of y’all are interested, we would love to work with you to tell your story!

All we would need is about **15 to 20 photos of you documenting your day as a student.** These photos can be as mundane or as crazy as you like. I would also want to briefly chat with you about it all since I would be writing the story. This would be a great way to get your name out there in a major publication and tell the world a little bit about yourself.

Separately, we are also **interested in students who might be willing to share a copy of the essay (or essays) they wrote that may have helped get them into the University of Michigan.** If you are really proud of your essay and still have a copy, we would love to be able to publish it. **We’d be willing to pay you for your essay.**

If either of these sounds of interest please let me know! Thank y’all.

"Honor Violation ""I"" grade on transcript - does it lapse to E?","Long story short, I'm being investigated for an honor violation for an EECS class I took in the summer. Professor puts an ""I"" on the transcript in the meantime.


However I get an email saying that unless you have permission to get an extension to complete your coursework, the ""I"" grade will lapse to an ""E"", which counts as zero GPA. I obviously don't want this to happen even temporarily. Also this isn't a case of uncompleted work, just a placeholder grade, so it doesn't seem to apply to me. Whether or not the system is aware of that I don't know. I've tried contacting the professor but he's not responding by email.

Requirements for Math 297,"Can someone explain to me how registering for Math 297 works? I am currently taking MATH 217 and I want to register for 297 next semester. I have talked to my current 217 instructor and they said that I need an A+ in 217 to take 297, but I also scheduled an advising appointment and the advisor said you only need an A in the class.

Can someone who has taken Math 297 before explain to me how you registered for it? Do I need an A or an A+ in Math 217 to take it, and how would they even know what my final grade in 217 will be if my registration date is before the end of this semester?

Should I bother with a minor?,"I'm a sophomore, and I've struggled to decide on a major. I've finally decided on Sociology and Social Work. With all of the jumping around I did my first year, along with dual enrollment credits I brought in, I'm not really behind. I can easily graduate in time taking easy semesters. I want to work in the criminal justice field either as a clinical social worker at some sort of forensic psychiatry center, or as a correctional treatment specialist. Because of this, I'm thinking about doing the crime and justice minor. I can fit this in and graduate in time, but with heavier semesters (at least 17-18 credits each semester). Another thing to add is with the sociology and social work major, I can start grad school classes for social work (what I want to do) my senior year, and get a head start on grad school. I probably couldn't do this with the minor. Should I even bother with the minor? Will it help me in a career at all? The classes are very similar to my major classes, so I'm not learning much more. It would essentially just be for the title if it would help in my career.",1573064376,3,0
Need to get this off my thoughts,"I don't even know where to start. As I'm typing this I feel extreme anxiety because I know by typing this out, I'm using up time that could be spent doing course work or working my at home research position. 

But yeah, I transferred here last year as a junior and had a pretty rough junior year. I genuinely tried harder than I ever had in school and got a fucking 2.45; granted I took the three hardest classes my major (econ) offers, you still have to be dumb to do that poorly, so it was nice learning that I'm an idiot, but TBH it really doesn't bother me THAT much, like it's such a light concern that I almost never think about it, except when I get rejected from jobs, but still I'm being 100% honest when I say the GPA isn't that much of a pain for me. 

Now, starting to get to the juicy stuff. I made one total friend last year and it was only because we met through a Facebook group. He's not anywhere close to a close friend, someone I saw four times last year, and have hung out with four times this year, but we only have a couple of similar interests and he doesn't like going out very much so I don't really have opportunities to go out. 

This year has been just as bad friends wise. 

Anyways I dreamed of coming here since I could form my earliest memories. When I got accepted as a transfer I envisioned this being my fresh start. I had lost almost all of my high school friends by then (ironically I was extremely popular senior year of HS, still don't understand that), and had no girlfriend and all of the girls in my hometown probably thought I was extremely ugly and weird. I am a virgin and have never taken a girl on a date or gotten even close to kissing a girl.  Everytime I've asked a girl out I've gotten rejected or flaked on last second. I figured THIS would be the opportunity to have some success with women. I thought it was a no brainier that I would at least lose my virginity here, and not too far off to think I could get a serious girlfriend here, I mean I'm literally the biggest Umich athletics fan I've ever met...Surely there'd be at least one girl here that was into Michigan sports and would dig me; NOPE, just more of the same. 

Since I have no friends, going to parties is hard. I go to every club party alone (I do drink at these parties, only time I ever drink), and try really hard to socialize...Some people are cool enough to talk to me and like my social skills aren't that bad, but I'm sure no wants to be the guy/girl caught interacting with the loser that has no friends and went here alone. 

I just don't get it though...I have no facial deformities, I work out for 90 mins a day and adhere to a super strict diet (for the last five years), brush and floss 2x a day, do my facial skin care routine 2x a day, wear deoderant, shave everyday and groom my facial hair. I've frequently posted on r/amiugly and the consensus literally every fucking time is ""you're a 6/10, if you shaved your beard and got a new hairstyle you'd be even more attractive,"" well I don't wanna shave my beard because I love it and I'm not into fancy hairstyles. But for fucks sake, I've worked my fucking ass off to be a6/10 and being a6/10 last time I checked makes me both fuckable and dateable, like I highly doubt 90% of girls would be embarrassed to bring a 6/10 home. 

The worst part about all of this is that everything I've done from exercise and diet to facial skin care has been solely to be more attractive to women, and I still can't even have sex, let alone get a date. Idk, I look at myself in the mirror naked everyday and just think about how sexy my body is , and just if my face was more attractive and I had whatever girls think is a cool personality I would be in the top percentile of attractiveness at Umich.

Anyways I recently had a really bad experience in a club here at Umich that's bothering me a lot. I'm not saying the club or getting too deep in details because I'd be identifiable. But I have a leadership role in a club and we had an event recently and it just sucked, I had no meaningful conversations, I could've done a better job with my actual position and have been kicking myself mightily (I apologized to the club leader), other people in the club tried to over power me and do my job for me and I just felt like shit and so awkward that I kinda froze up and yeah. That was a random interlude, but just something I had to get off my mind and an example of social problems. 

I didn't really think I had bad social problems, especially because I had 1-3 best friends my whole life from kindergarten to 11th grade who I hung out with all the time, then senior year I had a huge friend group and about 5 best friends, and hung out with people literally every day and it was just a great social experience. Well, being at U-M has proven to show me that I do have serious social problems, considering I can't make friends or connect with girls. 

My cousin suggested I'm having these problems because I was severely verbally and emotionally abused by my brothers growing up and my parents neglected me emotionally, and there was a brief period of a few years where my mom was physically abusive (because my older bothers complained that I was never beaten like they were.) 

I'm currently trying to tackle these problems with this online course I bought that is supposed to get you to master confidende and social skills with women by making you go out of your comfort zone for 30 days straight, giving you progressively more difficult challenges. For example day one was call a business that isn't a movie theatre and ask for movie suggestions, day 2 was stop three girls and ask them to take a pic of you using your phone, day 3 was interrupt 3 girls talking on the phone and ask them for directions. I guess these have started to make me feel sightly better, but that experience at the Umich club is killing me and makes me not want to continue it.

After that club experience I just sat in my room and cried for a while before going to bed. Before I went to bed I took an online autism screening to see if that's the reason why I can't get girls. The results came back ""likely to be on the light end of the spectrum,"" I was pretty crushed honestly, I started crying again. With everything going on, the last thing I wanted to learn was that I'm autistic and completely doomed of ever fixing my social problems. 

Yeah I just feel like shit, I've never had the courage to seriously, legitimately consider suicide, but every failure in my life (the club being the most recent) brings me closer to thinking it may be the only option. Sorry, I really just had to get that off my mind, I think the probability of me actually killing myself this school year is ~.00000000001%. 

But yeah I just had to get that off my mind. I know there's nothing you guys can say or do to help. No, not going to CAPS, tried four different sessions with two different workers and it was a humongous waste of the. I'm not looking for you guys to feel bad either, it was just eating me alive on the inside and I couldn't take it. Considering this school enhances all of my shitty feelings, I felt like this was the best subreddit. Thank you. I hope you all have a wonderful day. Seriously, actually reading this whole thing means a lot.",1573058045,0,0
