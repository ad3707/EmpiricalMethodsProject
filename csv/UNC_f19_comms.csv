"Are your parents cutting you off anything else or just tuition? If they're not supporting you anymore, you're no longer their dependent and can file FASFA independently. Also, as a UNC grad with student loans, I saw way too many old high school/college classmates drop out due to being scared of student loans. I'd be surprised if any of them make more than $10/hr now and they're not very happy. 

If you're studying for a degree that is employable, graduate on time (early even), and don't spend loan money like a moron, you can pay off student loans just fine. The key is making sure you are studying something that opens a career for you. Living at home over summers would be helpful, but if your relationship with your parents is poor then that may not be possible. 

Are you in state or out of state? What are you studying? If you're massively nervous about it, you may think about going to a community college for an associate's to work for a few years and save up if you decide to go back for a bachelor's. Side note, but lots of companies are starting to offer student loan repayment assistance as a benefit. My job pays $166/month towards my loans in addition to my payment.",1569381901,1,0
"yeah i feel horrible for “complaining” about my situation when it’s what everyone has to go through. it’s just even more frustrating when there are external factors playing into it, and it’s building on top of all the other things that’s been just crashing down at me the past few weeks - like my parents are doing this for specific reasons and there’s more to it than just this. i’m going to drop in at the financial aid office tomorrow and ask about it. like, i honestly don’t even want to be here anymore. it’s like i’m at school but i’m not a student here because since the day i got here i’ve just been dealing with personal things it doesn’t feel like i belong here because i’m preoccupied with personal things all the time anyway.

"Gonna make this pretty clear and dry. You cannot work and be a full time student and graduate with 0 debt. My dad did that in school in the 80's and told me to do it when I am in college, but that won't fly nowadays. So, you need to accept that you will graduate with debt. No one likes it, but its the American life. Second, go to the financial aid office. You are NOT the first to have this happen to. My parents EFC was...A LOT. What FAFSA doesn't know is I will get 0 from them, so i'm here on loans (private and federal). I am sure there is a way to get help even when your parents income fucks it up. I thought it was comedic how my parents income prevents me from getting ""easier to pay back"" loans because they made an x amount of money, and in a sense makes me not want to be here.

"Sup, I'm in Army ROTC

1. This year we are operating on the PFT, next year we will transition to the CFT.
2. Airborne and Air Assault aren't too competitive, most cadets who want a slot will get at least one over their 4 years, just have a good PT score and decent GPA.  You do get the tab, you go to the school like any soldier, there's no special school for cadets.  Any other school is possible, but you have to be very high speed to get Northern Warfare or Sapper.  Like, maxing the PT test and 3.9 GPA.
3. We have had people study abroad during the school year, its definitely possible. Army will still pay for it too if you're on scholarship, I'm pretty sure.
4. Balance with academics is tough, I won't lie.  Getting up early 3 days a week, plus lab on Wednesday, army class, and volunteering definitely takes up time and effort.  Typically volunteer 12 hours a semester.  That being said there are plenty of people with 3.4s and up.  I'm a chem major, and I have a 3.3 as a Junior.  Classes depend on your year.  Freshmen have 1 class/week, Sophomores, Juniors, and seniors have 2.

"I'm NROTC so it's at least somewhat different, but I'll answer what I can.  
1. No idea.  
2. I'm told they're pretty selective nowadays. You generally need some sort of justification to go, as well as high scores. They used to let NROTC and AFROTC go on some of them, but now we explicitly can't. I've heard they've gotten pretty overcrowded.  
3. Nope. If your academics are in a good place and you're performing satisfactorily, they actually encourage you to study abroad. This includes Project GO over the summers or semester programs. You often need to justify these too though (i.e. related to your language and/or major).  
4. The balance is pretty rough actually, rougher than they'll tell you. While it's not impossible to get a 3.75+ GPA and certainly not hard to get over a 3.0 (provided you're not doing something like physics or theoretical math or whatever), balancing between your life, homework, sleep, classes, and ROTC leads to a very full schedule. You have at least one ROTC class, as well as a weekly ""lab"" (battalion event), several PT mornings, and periodically events outside of those. Expect many late nights before early PT mornings, and, when you get to more senior positions, more responsibilities. Just remember though: you're in it to be a commissioned officer, not an ROTC cadet.

I wouldn’t stay in a program I didn’t want, though. From my understanding, the CODA process is a weed-out process.",1568241330,1,0
"I had to make this decision 5 months ago, and honestly, you don't have a bad choice to make here. Both universities are excellent places that will land you a job if you have the right projects and internships as another poster here said. State's CS definitely has a bit of an edge in the quality of education you will get in it. Honestly, if you asked me 6 months ago where I was going in the fall, I would have said state.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I will say though, and the thing that made my decision, was \[CODA\]([https://www.engr.ncsu.edu/academics/undergrad/coda/](https://www.engr.ncsu.edu/academics/undergrad/coda/)). This means that you actually have to apply into your major AFTER you finish your freshman year, even if you were admitted for CS Engineering First Year. And about 15% of EFY students are rejected from their CS CODA yearly \[(Source)\]( [https://ir.engr.ncsu.edu/coe-coda-statistics/computer-science-coda-statistics/coda-computer-science-2017-2018/](https://ir.engr.ncsu.edu/coe-coda-statistics/computer-science-coda-statistics/coda-computer-science-2017-2018/) ). If you get into State for CS, that is still 15% of people in the program who were about as qualified as you to enter that program. I personally find this disrespectful of the students time who worked hard to fulfill prereqs and the like. At UNC, you don't have to apply for CS, you can just declare it as your major. If you are deadset on doing CS, then you have a chance of actually not being able to do it. Also, if you are not deadset on doing CS, you can change majors at UNC a lot easier (just declare another major) versus State where you have to do CODA. State is also very much an engineering school, so if you find you aren't interested in engineering there, you may have to go into programs that are markedly worse than UNC's, which I find to have a broader range of majors they are good for.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you are entering with AP/IB credit, those apply towards your GPA accordingly at State (where a 5 is an A, 4 is a B, etc.). Even if you are getting 4's, that can pull down your GPA for entrance into the program. At UNC, you just get the credit for the class.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I just think the social situation at UNC is better. You have to take a lot of gen eds, which puts you in classes with people from all sorts of programs rather than just engineering, which is very much a bubble at State (you literally have to go to an entire different part of campus). And I personally think that UNC kids are more well rounded in general as compared to the extremely. An anecdote, I went to the admitted students day for both UNC and State and went to the CS sessions for each. The kids at UNC seemed to be more laid back and just generally enjoying themselves, while the kids at State seemed to be very on edge and stressed out.

Anyways, I'm just telling you how I made my decision, but the choice is entirely up to you, and remember, you can't really make a bad one.",1568240928,1,0

From a job hunt perspective, State gets more tech recruiting opportunities because it has engineering, so if you choose UNC and want to work in tech you’ll need to focus on networking and opening those doors yourself instead of relying on the school to help out. 

That being said, UNC is more we’ll known (it’s #5 best public school in the US), so if you aren’t sure what you want to do then UNC will likely have more options outside tech. You just need to decide on what you want to do.

"I don't really know too much about State's CS program, but I'm pretty familiar with UNC's, so I offer this:

I have taken 7 CS classes at UNC. Of those 7 classes, only three have actually had no shit coding requirements. Three of them have been centered around using discrete mathematics and set theory to analyze data structures and algorithms. One of them heavily featured learning just enough assembly code to solve what can best be described as logic problems.

I have learned a lot about programming since coming to UNC, but I don't actually spend much time coding for classes. When people say that UNC is very abstract, it's mostly in the sense that a lot of your required classes are focused on algorithm analysis. You look at how an algorithm works and learn how to provide Big-O and Big-Theta time analyses to determine which algorithm will be faster (and therefore more useful) for a given purpose.

Consequently, I can probably do a halfway decent job of answering whiteboard questions for an interview, but if you stick me in front of a computer and tell me to write a program that solves a problem in Java, there's a good chance I'm going to spend a large portion of my work day Googling what the fuck I'm doing.

"Something to consider if you’re interested in quantitative finance, UNC has two sub sect study areas (wouldn’t really call them majors) both are very code/ comp sci driven. One is through the economics department it is called the QFE program. The other is through the physics department (look up quant finance UNC physics dept. ) both of those could be tacked onto the comp sci major with some ease. you would really stand out as a recruit with that combo and the prestige of UNC. Some incredibly prestigious hedge funds/ asset management firms/ i-Banks recruit through UNC. DE Shaw, Merell Lynch, Point 72, and plenty of others I am sure I am  forgetting. These institutions pay coders massive sums of money and the potential for growth is amazing. It’s easy to pull 100k plus out of undergrad with these roles. In a few years with the right firm double or more than that.... All of this is to say, you will not find that level of recruiting at a school like state. I know this isn’t totally in the vein of your question but as some one with interests in coding/ computer science this is stuff I would’ve loved for some one to tell me. Best of luck in your decision.",1568171944,1,0

"Honestly, doesn’t really matter in the long scheme of things. Comp sci is all about what you make of it and personal projects, internships, etc. whichever campus fits your personality, interests, etc is the best one to go to. UNC does have a certain name attached to it that State doesn’t, if you’re looking at postgraduate work. But honestly, in the grand scheme, where you school doesn’t matter at all. Pick what fits you best and where you think you’ll do best.

Some things I think are worth noting:

* It can be hard to get into the classes you want/need. The department has grown a lot over the years and will likely continue growing. I know they've hired more professors last year, but can't comment on how things are this year.

* The major requires a lot of theory-heavy classes. If you want to go into data science, work as an actuary, go to grad school for stats, or just really love the material, do the major.

Your graduation will take longer most likely, but recently they passed that part time students have the same resource access as full time because they pay the same fees (new this year) so that won’t be impacted. Financial aid WILL if that matters for you, so talk to the financial aid office. Otherwise; you will have to stay in part time for 2 semesters not including summer. So if you drop to part time for this term spring will be part time as well before you can come back full time. You can still transfer credits from another institution in addition, just make sure it is under the limit you can take elsewhere. 

Overall they told me when I decide for sure I’m doing it to schedule an appointment with the advising office and they will walk you through it and get it handled. 

The deadline is November 1st, so if this is just about one class I’d recommend trying to appeal that specific one first (I can give info on that too if needed). Pass fail is also an option, but if it’s major required or multiple I understand and can relate. Just know how it impacts your future semesters and financial aid.

"CAPS is kinda good and kinda bad. It helps a lot of people with what they are going through, but will probably not help you out more than making you aware of cognitive behavioral therapy. As a person who went to CAPS for panic attacks I quickly realized that going was not the silver bullet, that only I could change how I approached triggers. I stopped going to CAPS within 2 months after I did some personal research to how to effectively approach triggers and how to mitigate panic attacks when they happen, but I would say a large part of this was personal motivation and not due to CAPS. CAPS did however keep me aware of the need to practice behavioral therapy though, so I would recommend going as a promise to yourself to try and be better. 

Please do not interpret this as ""lmao stop being anxious/depressed"" because that is horrible advice. 

CAPS is definitely a good step, but I would not say CAPS is great. Keep in mind my only experience in therapy is CAPS, and that the word on the street is indeed get a private therapist if you can afford it. 

On another note: here's something that bother me, and its really problematic with therapy in general. People who go to therapy are likely to get better because they are actively seeking out how to improve their condition, and likewise people who do not go to therapy are more likely to not improve because they are not actively seeking out ways to improve their condition. (You can see this all the time manifest in couples therapy posts: if both parties are willing to engage in therapy it usually works out, but if its one sided it never does). So deciding to go to therapy can be a confounding factor in determining the efficacy of said therapy because you are predisposed to improving your condition.

"Yaya's MILK tea isn't so good, most seem to be powdered and cheaply made (if that makes sense?) Cha House is really the best place.

The boba is made in house from scratch and is of high quality, it's some of the best that I've tried. They have some other Taiwanese-esche food that I really like as well. The ambiance in Cha House is really nice too! I think the decor in yaya's is a little random, but they tend to be less busy than cha house so it's easier to get a table to study. If you do wanna go to Yaya's though I recommend getting one of their fruit teas or a rice ball, that's my typical order there, BUT definitely I would avoid getting anything milk based.

"Depends on what you're comparing to. It is very gay friendly relative the to the South in general. But it's still in the South so you still have a slightly heightened of running into homophobes than at a similar institution in some other areas. 

I think the university and town are gay-friendly policy-wise but if you're talking about experience with individual people, it's always going to depend on which individuals you happen to interact with.",1573435957,1,0

"383 is generally a pretty chill class if you have the right professor. It starts out with some relatively simple methods you may have seen before, and then branches into more interesting first and second order ODEs. You will most likely not have to write any serious proofs in it, and the homeworks are not bad at all. Some of it might be online (via Pearson) but it's much more forgiving than physics or chemistry. Towards the end of the course you might end up learning some simple linear algebra, but it's very straightforward and not comparable to any real linear algebra course. The classes are normal-sized, with 30 or fewer to a class, from what I have seen and experienced. Overall I would say it was the easiest 'calculus' class I have taken.

That being said, never ever ever ever ever take it or any other class with Mark Williams. He teaches the entire curriculum in only a couple of weeks and then goes on a tangent to other stuff, teaches as if you already know how to write proofs, and is generally not good for an introductory class. His tests are extraordinarily hard and demoralizing, with often only a couple of very difficult questions. I think he may only teach 383H now, so if you aren't looking to take that then this may not be relevant, but regardless your best bet is to avoid his classes at all costs. The other professors are generally fine.

Overall, not super hard, better than the prerequisite calc classes, but avoid Mark Williams.",1573427928,1,0

"Second-year physics major here. PHYS 118 and 119 are definitely not easy, but it certainly helps to have a background in high school physics if you want to do well in them. That being said, there are a couple of things in them that make them much different from high school physics, namely special relativity and quantum mechanics, but that's mainly it. The online homework software you use (Pearson Mastering Physics) sucks, but you only have to use it for these two classes. If you can, I would suggest that you take these over the summer, so you don't have to rush to take the other classes in the major. In these two classes, make sure to utilize the office hours of everyone involved in the courses, including the professors and your studio TA/LA. The 118 professors tend to be hard to approach, but they are very willing to help you with whatever you're struggling with, and the 119 professors are very good with pretty much everything. In terms of self-studying for these two and taking the placement exam, it's not a bad idea if you're sure you have a good grasp on everything in the curriculum, but it wouldn't hurt to make sure of it.

Since you'd be doing a BA with a QF concentration, there aren't as many difficult classes you would have to take as there are for a BS, but in general the 200-level BA classes are really just the 400-level BS classes with fewer homework and test questions. They are taught at the same time as the 400 classes, so you learn the same stuff with both BA and BS people there. 211 is a continuation of the E&amp;M you learn in 119, and is pretty standard from-the-textbook material, but 201 is completely different from 118; the professor is very unique in his way of teaching, so be prepared for something totally different from what you learned prior to it.

A couple of the classes in your major are taken by everyone, regardless of whether they are doing a BS or a BA. 281L is a good class to take over the summer, but be prepared to do a lab and write a lab report that will be graded harshly pretty much every week if you don't. Take 331 in the spring semester, as the professor who teaches it in the fall sucks. Thermal starts out a lot like basic chemistry, but it gets a lot harder in the second half of the semester. Your business major may cover for your additional required classes, but in the event that they don't, PHYS 332 is a nice class with a good prof that you learn a lot of neat things in, and MATH 547 is a pretty standard basic linear algebra course.

If you have any specific questions about the QF major, Stefan Jeglinski (jeglin@physics.unc.edu) is the advisor for those majors, so he may have more or different insight about it than I do.",1573420795,3,0

"Overall, like someone already posted, college is what you make of it. UNC is a large school that is easy to get lost in, but also provides infinite opportunities that can easily be finite if you don't capitalize on the opportunities. This is to say nobody will make you join a club, go to the interest meeting, attend class, sit in the student section, etc. You will have to do this yourself to meet people. Once you do, campus becomes much smaller and more exciting. I honestly think its an exponential thing: you start out slow but eventually you become more and more involved at a faster rate. The sooner you learn to do this the better you will be (socially, I mean). I believe that the better your social life is, the more you will find going to class and studying bearable. 

&amp;#x200B;

To address academics, it varies greatly from program to program and class to class. Med students will tell you that school is very different from that of a communications major or a history major. Some programs will require much more effort than others. Business is one that comes to mind where students have to work their butts off to get into the B-School sophomore year, but then grade inflation makes life easier after admittance. It really depends on your program but expect to work hard and learn a lot. Almost all departments provide ample opportunities for success after college. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to receive flak for this but here it goes: UNC has a under-performing lower echelon that some other top schools (that are comparable to UNC by most metrics) don't have. Yes every school has a group of slackers, but UNC inherently has a larger population of low-performing students because it is a state school that must admit certain students. That is not to call out any group in particular it is simply that a school of this size must accept some students smaller schools don't. This all means that this is sometimes good as grades can be cruved more or easier in some cases. This does not mean classes are easy. You will have to work at UNC, but if that scares you away, you won't be successful at any school of this caliber.

&amp;#x200B;

The attendance policy was mentioned below. Clearly, someone misses a lot of class for what I am sure are valid reasons, but in the workplace absences aren't tolerated either. I haven't found it to be overly strict, but again it depends on the class. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dorm life is fun. No it isn't pretty but you will meet good friends and you likely are only going to sleep in there if you hate it. If you like it, you might study there too, but if not there are plenty of places on campus to study/relax. I wouldn't worry as you make it work just like everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

The faculty/student body is quite liberal leaning. This was somewhat shocking to me at first, and it will definitely become apparent quickly, but ultimately as a college student you are able to think what you want and it should be a nonfactor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I love Carolina and it has been one of the best decisions I've made, but it depends on the individual. OP, if you or anybody reading this is a prospective student, message me and I will show you around campus whenever works for you, or can just text you some more information specific to programs/areas of interest to you.

Another interesting issue this brings up is centered around funding. The B School has admissions advisors that go through the applications each year. Being that the CS major hasn’t required admission in the past, the CS department hasn’t needed those same advisors. So now the CS department will have to either make people in the department review applications each year or the will have to *hire* people just to read through applications each year.

"Part of my experience with STOR 435 is that I took it over the summer, so I didn't have a lot of time to absorb the material but I'm not sure it would have helped. The biggest challenge when I took it was the amount of material and how abstract it was. The calc stuff actually wasn't bad for me, all we really did was take simple integrals to find the area under a density curve.

I think COMP 411 and STOR 435 would be your most time-consuming classes. If you felt confident enough registering in all four of these courses, you can probably handle the material but I am an LA for 411 and you just have to put a ton of time and effort into the labs so you can properly understand assembly.

"Hey! I LA for 401, I’d say that the biggest problem for students coming from 116 was just getting used to Java in general. Java is strongly typed, which can be weird especially if Python was your first coding language. I’d look up some online Java tutorials so you can get the basic syntax down, since the assignments start pretty quickly and there’s no really any introductory assignment.

Beyond the basic syntax, next thing you’ll learn is object oriented programming. Again, you’ll be able to find plenty of online resources for it, but I’d focus more on the syntax since object oriented programming gets a decent amount of focus in 401. You won’t need to know anything about it going into the class. Later on, the semester will focus on design patterns and also learn some Java UI.

TLDR: Just focus on learning Java syntax and getting used to Eclipse. Pay attention in class, even if it’s difficult at times. It’ll pay off.",1576563392,1,0

"Heard the recitation sessions were crowded so you might as well just look at the slides posted afterwards and ask the group chat for help if needed (that being said, it relies on someone in 102 sending out a link via Sakai to a GroupMe). Make sure you do all your WarmUp and Graded HW, also put in an answer on your iClicker for everything during class, those are all free points (minus the Graded HW but any grade is better than a 0 and you want your point buffer to go to that rather than not answering an in-class question). Do the Dynamic Study Modules and Adaptive Follow-Ups for practice where needed. The peer mentors are helpful and better than professors for explaining stuff (at least compared to Tiani lol). For 102L, Hayden-McNeil is surprisingly helpful when completing both pre-labs and post-labs, so use the Data Analysis tab for post-lab and the second tab (forget the name) for both where needed. They do take the difference in TA into account at the end of the semester and also give you an incredibly helpful study guide for the exam (as in, questions will be slightly changed from it to form exam questions). Make sure you follow all the instructions for labs too, my worst grade on a post-lab was in the C range because I didn't notice a last step and it screwed all my calculations over big time.

"Took CHEM 101 and 101L and I hope to God you didn't have the same problem, but if you're given templates for labs you may have run into a policy that states if you mess up the formatting on the template when filling it in you'll be deducted an exponentially increasing amount of points each time (i.e.: 2 points 1st time, 4 points 2nd time, 8 3rd time, all the way to a 128 point penalty). I got negative points on assignments thanks to that, but I digress.

As for me, when I tried to figure out what I was doing wrong, the automatic grader was no help, only stating that something was wrong and not telling/highlighting *where* it was (which was a great pain in the ass for the tiny errors I couldn't find until it was too late). So I asked my TA, but they and the syllabus gave me conflicting answers on what constituted as ""formatting errors"" (TA told me just not to change the textbox size while syllabus said no changing textbox size or ""font styles""), which was rather confusing as I was told the TAs made the syllabi and their word overrules it. I tried either's qualifications, but both unfortunately yielded penalties.

This was also compounded with ambiguities in what specifically counted as a ""font style"". What I had assumed it was was just the typeface and size, but apparently **bolding**, *italicizing*, ^exponentiating and even `highlighting` text counted as changing the ""font style"".

Even when the template had explicitly said to change things like removing highlighting or things like telling to remove placeholder text outside of textboxes, this penalty rule still applied full force and effectively decimated my grade.

I even had a template which was made rather poorly, with inconsistent fonts and large swaths of unnecessary whitespace that I changed to make more compact and easy to read. 

I'm attempting to challenge my grade with the Adminiatratives above and request a repeal based on what I perceived as arbitrary grading practices. I understand why they had to implement a penalty for formatting, to allow for faster automated grading with standardized formatting (and to force students to keep their papers concise and easier to read) but such stiff penalties for formatting, especially when the readability by a human of the lab report is not impacted (and sometimes improved) is to me absolutely absurd.

So whatever you do, ***do not change the formatting of any template at all***, even if your eyes bleed by looking at it or it looks like it was made poorly.

Also watch out for small formatting changes Word or Google Docs can add to your lab templates (like tiny amounts of whitespace added between lines in paragraphs or tables) as any tiny discrepancies such as those will throw a penalty your way too.

I lived in a 2 BR and paid about $900 each, I believe, before utilities and parking. Don’t get me wrong, C2 is nice and the location is fantastic, but it’s also incredibly cheaply built. I liked living there, but ended up leaving for a 1 BR at Lux for my senior year because of how shit the management is and how cheap the apartment itself is. 

Everything is cheaply built and it’s not even furnished. The worst part is the sound insulation, however. You can hear everything clear as day.

"People love to pregame there because of the proximity to bars and frat court, so it makes it a great place to party. Also, the pool is a major plus when the only other pool for undergrads that’s relatively close is at Lark. Location is definitely the key here, as it’s within short walking distance of campus, on top of high end amenities.",1577589115,1,0
"7/10 tbh. 
*Great classes and great profs so far. I'm sure it varies between departments, but the Poli Sci department has been great.
*Most people I've met have been courteous and nice. 
*As its reputation suggests, UNC doesn't mess around when it comes to coursework. Nine times out of 10 you can't half-ass the work. If you coasted during high school, you'll probably have to crank it up several notches.
*The libraries are awesome, and probably carry any book you could ever want to read. 
*Chapel Hill as a town is pretty good, and has quite a bit to offer (especially when comparing it to a smaller town in a rural county or a suburb). Not really my cup of tea, but it ain't bad as far as college towns go. 
*It's an ""elite"" school on the state level, so elite kids who couldn't get into Duke and didn't go out of state probably end up here. And rich kids will be rich kids. 
*If you're like me and enjoy camping and hiking and that sort of thing, the options are pretty sparse in the area (especially if you don't have a car), but I guess I kind of got spoiled at App lol.",1577588110,1,0

"I have not taken the 119 placement test, but I have taken the actual 119 class/final exam, so I can offer some insight into it. Those Knight chapters are the ones you should study, and working on problems at the end of the chapter will also be great for practice. You should pay special attention to the parts on solving problems relating to the integral forms of Maxwell's equations, as well as understanding how to use symmetry to simplify a problem. Circuits weren't super heavily emphasized in the class, but being able to identify various features/graphs in AC and DC is a must. Make sure you are familiar with how lenses and mirrors affect the size, orientation, and reality of images, especially in situations that aren't the most simple or straightforward. Know how Young's double slit experiment works, what terminology is used to describe it and the patterns that result from it, and what things can be done to change the results. The hardest part of the quantum section is normalizing wave functions, but a lot of it is just memorization of facts and other things that aren't on the [equation sheet](https://physics.unc.edu/files/2019/07/119-Placement-Exam-Eq.pdf). It's absolutely doable with plenty of practice beforehand. In my opinion, the exams are a bit less intense than in 118, mainly because the questions are similar in style, with the exception of several multiple choice questions. They can be tricky, but studying the material is plenty for succeeding with them.

Just in case you didn't know about this already, since most physics majors find out about this when they take 119, the professor who organizes the class, Dr. W, is a great resource for planning things out school-wise, support, and other advising-type things that are helpful in the long run. It might not be a bad idea to shoot her an email or talk to her if you do end up placing out.",1577584607,1,0

"I gotta say this, I know I'm not the only one (student and faculty alike) who were a bit perplexed and now worried that he became the new PWAD chair after Dr. Wayne Lee this past year

Bapat is the only PWAD chair in the history of the major who has a strictly academic background with no professional experience in the related fields (military, government, intel, etc).  he also feels a bit unapproachable compared to Dr. Lee, who was quite literally one of the best, funniest, and most welcoming professors I've had

Also, don't use your tongue to stroke it, that's almost as weird as not stroking at all.
