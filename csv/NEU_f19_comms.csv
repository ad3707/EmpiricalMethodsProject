I did a few campaigns through NUTRS and was always the only girl. There are other girls in the club though, and if I had made it a priority I could have selected campaigns with other girls in them, I just chose based on interest instead.

I'd say NUTRS felt welcoming overall. I enjoy playing female characters but I also feel uncomfortable with them being sexualized so I pretty much always play as kind shaman grandmas. Everyone thought that was great and I had a fun time playing with them.",1569398720,1,0

"ok not defending the the thief per se, BUT i am here to victim blame spotify for the following reasons: 

1. why would you pass around ipads at an event like this? do what everyone else does and have the ipads at a booth/table and have people line up to type in their info. that way the ipads’ whereabouts are accounted for and are presumably being supervised by whoever is manning the booth. OR —
2. not to be a baby boomer but why even use ipads for people to provide contact info? ever heard of paper? it’s a great alternative if the loss of one (1) ipad to a billion-dollar company is really such a huge deal. 
3. where did this event take place? did you have to show your student ID to get in? if not, a non-NU student could have easily been responsible— seems pretty extreme of spotify to blacklist the entire student population from co-op opportunities because one (1) dumbass stole their toy. even if this person was a student here, still seems fucked to write off the whole school because of one individual. if one student with a demonstrably poor moral code makes an entire university population unfit to work at spotify, maybe spotify should consider blacklisting.... every university in the world??

"Hi, third year psych major, bns minor, whose is currently on coop here. I would say that the gpa matter less than you think, as long as it’s not under 2.5. I don’t think there are any ‘popular’ psych coop, but the one that pays by the hour or in the big hospital are a bit more competitive. I would say there are a lot of teaching jobs and crim justice job (from what I remember). But the main two would either be doing research or hands-on care. Research ones usually give you stipend or not paid at all. The one that are paid hourly are rare but they do exist (McLean, although so fucking far). Hands-on care involve dealing directly with psych patients, kids and/or adults. These usually paid hourly but prepare to get bruises.
I don’t think you have to worry too much. Just remember that if you are picked for an interview (which will happen), it means you they think you are a great fit skill-wise. So your experience and grades is not the problem here. So what you’re doing at the interview is proving that beside from your skills, you are also a great person to be around and your personality fit with the culture of that workplace.

Fill that out with your notes and you should be in great shape. He will do a review lecture before the test so if there’s anything you didn’t catch from lectures you can ask him about it then.

"The thing about animation is if you are doing it, all the other stuff does not matter.  I would say that if you are 100% sure that you want to work in games or VFX in 5 years, you should concentrate as hard as you can on that.  the field is very competitive and while learning other things is great, except for Comp sci or programing, not much other then your skills/experience/work ethic are relevant to the hiring process.  All that being said, there is somthing to going to a large university with a diversity of quality education and people, and the CO Ops are really great.  At the end of the day you will learn more about 3D animation at a school like gnomon, but you will also have to deal with a small art school things vs the big uni experience AND you have less flexibility to change your major should you suddenly want to do communications or engineering.

 IMO you shouldnt feel bad if there wasnt anyone waiting for it and the gym is relatively empty. Finish your sets and move on. I mean no one really does like 7+ sets of curls, most people do 3-4, so in reality its probably a 5-10 minute wait. I just like using the barbell sometimes instead of dumbells.


edit: look I know its a meme and I know it can be annoying but shit like this honestly makes other people self conscious and curling a barbell is different from a dumbell. if there is more than 2 people waiting for a powercage then yes it can be obnoxious but honestly its not a big deal. yall are making it a bigger deal than it is.",1570323349,-1,0

DP:
Max common subseq, edit distance, knapsack (general idea of 2d memos is helpful)

"Yes, although it doesn't have a Web site. There's really only six students from Northeastern who participated in ICPC this year, so we're a pretty small group.

Also, there isn't really a good explanation of how ICPC in our area works, so I think it is worth it for me to give an explanation below:

In the greater Boston area, the ACM-ICPC competition starts at the [BOSPRE](https://hc3.seas.harvard.edu/hc3/bospre/) competition, and we sent two teams to BOSPRE: Husky Alpha, which was our primary team consisting of people who had competed in BOSPRE before, and Husky Beta, which was a secondary team consisting of all freshmen. (Also, since this was an ICPC contest, there were three students per team.)

I was on the Husky Beta team, so I participated in BOSPRE, but our team did not get farther than that because Husky Alpha solved more problems than us, and only the highest-scoring team from each university is allowed advance to the next round. However, Husky Alpha did advance to the next round, because they were the third-highest ranking team, not including the secondary teams of other universities (the top two universities were, not surprisingly, MIT and Harvard).

The next round after BOSPRE is the [ICPC Northeast North American Regionals](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~icpc/), which is a competition among ICPC teams from universities in Eastern Canada, New England, and New York. Husky Alpha [placed fifth at Regionals](https://nena19.kattis.com/standings), so they advanced to the next round after Regionals.

The next round after Regionals is the [ICPC North American Championship](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~icpc/), which is a competition among the best ICPC teams from universities across all of the United States and Canada. This competition will take place on February 19-23, 2020, so right now, Husky Alpha is practicing in order to prepare themselves for this upcoming competition.

Now, if Husky Alpha manages to win a medal or win the ""wildcard"" spot from the North American Championship, then they will advance to the final round, the [ICPC World Finals](https://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/worldfinals), which is, obviously, the most famous ICPC competition.

Right now, it is too late to join our ICPC team since new students can't really join in the middle of the competition, but you could join our ICPC team next year when we go to BOSPRE in Fall 2020. If you want more info about ICPC at Northeastern, feel free to e-mail me at mushtak.n@husky.neu.edu",1576719147,1,0

"Not necessarily. The thing about 19 semester hours is that it's typically 4 four credit courses and 3 one credit courses, and DMSB doesn't really offer a ton of stuff like that. 

You can work with an academic advisor to set up a plan to graduate in a specific period of time, but you have to be flexible and understand that they know what they're doing and they'll be able to help you find realistic options so you don't burn out.",1576717193,1,0

I don’t really know what other options aside from possibly deferring or trying to apply to many small online scholarships to try and detract from some of the cost

I was thinking of asking NEU for a deposit extension because I really don’t want to miss the opportunity but the finances are stressing me out and other colleges still haven’t given me my decision, do you think it’s possible if I call and politely request an extension they might do this for me?

Hm.. the lack of choice of countries that come with majors is definitely something to consider.

The thing is, I‘ve lived abroad on my life and as much as I would love to stay in one place for the next for years, I wouldn’t mind going to London for comp. sci for a few months (by the way, is this even available in the college of arts and sciences?), as I could later go to the Boston campus and finish up there.

Generally speaking, it was a bad time. The only reason I don't regret it is because of the friends I made, and I'm just hoping it'll be better at the Boston campus.

I dont feel like I learned much from either class (especially 4200), though I’ve heard the upper level DS classes are better. The major has a lot of flexibility, and the quality depends on the classes you take for your major electives.

"Was a MATH/CS major. 

Easiest class: Logic and Computation or Theory of Computation. If you take these classes after some proof-based math classes, then they'll be a breeze for you. The reason being that the class assumes you're CS and don't have a background in rigorous proof. But with a math background, you'll already have those skills (they'll literally spend a week EACH on teaching proof by induction) and be able to focus on the real meat of the subjects.

Hardest Class: Personally it was Rings &amp; Fields or Cryptography. But those aren't required for your major so I'll give you my hardest *required* class: Group Theory. It starts off slow but things get very abstract very quickly. Normal groups, subgroups, automorphisms. It's a class that easy to fall behind in and very hard to catch up in alone. It's also probably going to be your first taste of abstract algebra which is a huge part of math in general. So being introduced to all these new concepts will make things difficult. Real analysis is a close second. It's just calculus but from a very rigorous perspective. You answer questions that took for granted in calculus before by proving things from the beginning (and by beginning, I literally mean the first proof you do is proving that 0 != 1). And then you dip a bit into Topology near the end. 

So yeah, Group Theory / Real Analysis are probably ones to watch out for. The hardest CS class was probably Algorithms -but I'd say it was easier than my average math class.",1577740704,1,0

* Definitely put some extracurriculars on your application—two clubs will usually do, as well as anything else you can think of
* Do your best in your classes. Show up, do the work, and make a good impression with your professors.

"There are very few clubs that won’t accept new members at any time. You probably won’t get a leadership position or anything, but you’d happily be welcomed I think.

There are endless volunteering opportunities, you could try a part-time job (easy way to meet people with something in common you can bond over, and worst case you have extra $), you could try intramurals or something like a climbing gym.... lots of potential.

I really recommend talking about the beef with your roommate. It’ll be uncomfortable and might even end with you guys deciding to just coexist/not have much of a relationship, but at least you’ll know and things won’t feel so tense. There’s obviously upside too if it goes well.

Last, and I say this to every freshmen because they all seem to struggle with it: don’t believe what your high school friends say on social media. Unshockingly, people only post the highlights. They’re all saying they love college (and they very well might!) but I promise they’re doubting themselves too. I had a few fun nights out and of course they were all over Snapchat, but at the same time I felt like I didn’t really have a place here and also thought about transferring. I was finally settled by like February of freshman year, and for other people I know it was even longer, but it came. Don’t get me wrong, transferring is the right choice sometimes, but this sounds like normal social adjustment which is unfortunately just hard sometimes no matter where you are.

Hope any of that helps. Just remember you’re not the only person feeling like this.",1572531845,1,0

2. You should probably talk to your roommate. Yeah it's going to suck but it will probably suck for less time than just sitting on this stuff. But also I am a hypocrite because I had roommate issues and I mostly just avoided my roommate forever after that. RAs are shockingly good at mediating if you need that.

"Chin up son, if I may ask, what exactly about Northeastern do you not like? Because if it's the fact that you don't have a friend group, I am not sure transferring will actually solve your problems. 

I do believe however, that joining a club, intramural sports team, or doing an instructional program like a martial art, could help you find like-minded people who might be your friends. You honestly don't have to be a member for a club to just hop in during one of their meetings, you just need to find out their meeting time and location. Plus, some clubs like the Entrepreneur's Club for example, is pretty low-commitment and the executive team seem like really good people. 

Honestly though, if you really wanna make friends, you're going to have to put yourself out there and join a club, fraternity, or some organization. It's literally what everyone has told me, because people here are sorta clicky. The N.U.in kids will also already have their established friend groups by the time they arrive on campus in the spring. Membership signup periods may be over for most organizations this semester, but they'd still be around next semester. And the great thing is that because everyone goes on co-op every 6 months, there's a lot of turnover in the club, so a lot of people will be new there too.

"I disagree with this - I did not read a single page of the Fundies II notes, and I was able to test out of Fundies 2 and get an A in OOD the following semester. I also interviewed with Lerner.

I do agree that most people should not try and test out of Fundies II, and only people with prior \*formal\* schooling in Computer Science (not AP Computer Science), should try. The concepts that they teach in Fundies 2 are important, and if you haven't learnt them in a formal environment, you should. And if you think that it will be too easy, then its an easy GPA padder, which is always a nice thing.",1572462035,1,0

Outside of avoiding him, this class is so stupid, we just build some arbitrary project in any language we want and every week we get new specs/requirements that would have been initially helpful in our code structure/ design. The workload is definitely a lot and annoyingly so...There's really no way around it but I'd recommend making it easier on yourself and try to take it with anyone that isn't Matthias.",1574625137,1,0
