well you said that you don‚Äôt see any professors  violating this..which is false.

"I guess I'm confused as to why area measures damage when we're talking about the human body. For a sheet of metal, I can see why this works, but for the human body there are entirely different considerations.  For one, the high energy rifle bullets will definitely have a cavitation effect on the body; as the bullet passes through tissue, the space left behind will form a permanent cavity, and then a secondary cavity will form due to the pressure wave that'll force tissue out and away. This is exacerbated by the tumble/deformation effect of the bullet once it enters the body, and at higher kinetic energies, this effect will lead to more damage. If you scroll down to section 1.5.3 of this [assessment](https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/99527/2/02whole.pdf ) , they go more in detail.

There may be ways around having to retake it because it sounds like you have taken a subsequent course? (Sorry, not literate in CS courses.)

So I will drag the ""write essay"" card to Tuesday at 4, and I won't think about it or worry about it until Tuesday, at which point I'll just sit down and do it.

You can also see how long you've spent on each task, and what working sessions you have planned. You can sync your events from Google Calendar to Plan, and you can sync your tasks to Google Calendar.

"Some good points that I didn‚Äôt touch on, I‚Äôll try to answer

Rifles are much easier to aim with three points of contact (left hand, right hand, shoulder) and are much more accurate, definitely

Comparing energy of the bullet is irrelevant to the damage a single round can cause. For example, a .45 caliber handgun has over twice the cross-sectional area as rounds for a standard hunting rifle (.30-06 or .30-30). Much of the extra energy/increased range of a rifle manifests in a much higher exit velocity from a wound than for a handgun‚Äôs bullet, but this is irrelevant to the damage done to the body: which is precisely proportional to the caliber of bullet squared. I should also mention this is assuming the bullets are FMJs not JHPs

What balances out the increased accuracy of rifles is that usually in encounters where a gun is needed, rifles are much more cumbersome. They‚Äôre much more difficult to adjust to a quickly moving target at close proximity than a handgun, and have much more area for an assailant to grab to try and disarm. I‚Äôd argue that roughly counterbalances their accuracy advantage over handguns in cases of self-defense considering targets are generally very close",1599956485,5,0

"Yes, but damage is generally going to be measured simply by the caliber of bullet used assuming FMJ are used. While a rifle bullet may have much greater exit velocity, handgun rounds are on average much larger in area/caliber than rifle rounds, creating much larger wounds, thus creating more damage. The disparity in energy levels simply manifests in a higher exit velocity",1599956015,-1,0

"Assuming that damage can be measured in terms of kinetic energy, the AR wins that one. A Glock 21 has a muzzle velocity of about 835 ft/s, assuming a standard 230 grain 45 acp bullet. KE = 485 Nm. Assuming a muzzle velocity of about 3100 feet per second with a 62 grain bullet for the AR, that KE comes out to 1785Nm! That's over 3.5 times more than the pistol. Perhaps there are some more questions, like how much of that energy will the human body absorb? Maybe it depends on the body part hit by the bullet and how far the bullet traveled. Will the bullet exit the body? At what speed, and how much of the bullet will be left in the body? Honestly I don't really care enough to research this and don't know it off the top of my head, but if there's an argument between the efficacy of handgun versus rifle, it comes down to far more than which bullet is bigger.",1599952982,2,0
"Didn't downvote, but I think there are a few reasons why you'd generally be more scared of a rifle rather than a handgun.

Rifle rounds have significantly more energy than pistol rounds. Compare two of the most common rounds of each, 5.56x45 or 7.62x39 vs .45 or 9mm. The rifle cartridges will have easily 4 times the amount of energy compared to a pistol, each with an average barrel length. Also, rifles are significantly easier to aim. Finally, it's bolder to commit a robbery with a firearm that is harder to conceal. 

Not going to comment on bolt action rifles but I find it unlikely that one would be used in a robbery.",1599952757,8,0

"I am voting this year because I decided that voting is the only way to make pollsters care about your opinions. If you are not a likely voter, which you become by voting, politicians won't listen to you.

However, in the past I have chosen not to vote. I am well informed. I read a variety of news sites. I have read the constitution more times than I can count. I have strong opinions on all elections and issues.

I care about democracy too much to see voting as anything but the worst form of democracy. I am a big fan of recent political philosophers. I grew up on Locke, Voltaire, Rawls, and Nozick. I love Habermas and Young. I know they would all disagree with my conclusions from their work, but the truth is that ultimately I believe that voting is a tool to end debate and suppress minority opinions. I do not like the idea that anyone is better off in any organization after a vote is taken because voting stops the conversation and allows one side to declare victory.   
I acknowledge that voting is an important part of a modern democracy, but in my mind, the appearance of successful and highly legitimate elections is far more useful to the upkeep of democracy than the existence of successful and highly effective elections. I could vote, and I would vote in a small organization where a vote is held following a substantive debate as a way to build consensus, but I have a limited amount of time, and I generally prefer to spend the time I would spend voting on activities that aid in legitimizing elections. For example, during the primaries, I often prefer to volunteer with an organization that facilitates voting to voting myself.",1603069740,1,0

"I don't vote due to my belief on neutrality. I mean if i cared enough i would vote on certain laws and referendums.  However, My thoughts (which you may disagree with) are that no matter the outcomes (what or who is voted on) things will still work out just fine.   


Unless i'm really passionate about something i don't give my support or vote. Things such as petitions and elections I simply don't vote in unless i truly understand and agree with what is presented. 

However, I do vote on small stuff that doesn't really matter like hall council (sometimes ) or some sort of vote in class.  Yet, when it comes to people and electing them i can not. It's not that i'm disinterested in  politics quite the opposite! I just find it immoral to vote particularly how the political system is today.    


Also, I don't think the drafters of the constitution intended for political parties. I bring that up to simply say voting seems  to me more of a vehicle to influence how ""much power"" a party has. Instead, of electing officials to represent there region. Hence, a representative democracy. Voting in my opinion has become too partisan for my taste.  


 I guess i say all that to simply say i believe in the intent of people. Whom ever is voted whether I agree or disagree with him or her will do their best to represent their region. If its found they are not then they will most likely not be re-elected by people who are very disappointed in their actions.  If it ever came to a point where i was angry with an elected officials actions then i would first sue them in the courts and if that didn't work would probably register to vote to elect them out.

"I was really hoping someone would go with that, because it is just not true.  Perot had fuck all to do with the balanced budget.  The Republican Party had a balanced budget in its 1992 and 1988 (and probably earlier) Platforms.  They also had been pushing for a balanced budget amendment.  Those were not adopted because of Perot, but were longstanding policies of the party.  And the only reason Clinton ""balanced"" it was because the Republicans took back the House for the first time since the 50s in the 1994 landslide midterm election and blocked most of Clinton's initiatives.  Before that, Clinton's budget deficits were higher than the pre-recession deficits of the late 80s despite the US having come out of the early 90s recession.

To his credit, Clinton did run to the right/center after the '94 midterm elections as part of his triangulation strategy for winning in 1996, which required him to play more ball with the newly energized budget hawk Republicans.  But even with that, the Republicans hardline stance on the federal budget led to two government shutdowns because Clinton wanted higher spending.  The divided government (i.e., different party control of the Presidency and Congress), with a Democrat president who ran to the right/center as part of an election strategy, ultimately resulted in the surpluses.  But Perot had nothing to do with them.",1603060279,1,0

Don‚Äôt let avid members of either side get mad at you for not voting for their party, get mad at their party for doing nothing to appeal to you and then expecting you to vote for them anyway. This country hasn‚Äôt always been Democrat and Republican, but both parties benefit from the delusion that it‚Äôll always stay that way, because they know even if they lose this election, they‚Äôll be in power in another 4-8 years. Don‚Äôt let them just bullshit you based on that assumption. If a third party can gain even 5% of the vote, the FEC will allocate 8-10 MILLION dollars for their next presidential run.

"PM'd, but for the others reading this -- if you find yourself in this predicament, try contacting your department's IT support. My dept will certainly sign equipment out to our majors. Your mileage may vary by department policy, but the worst they can tell you is no, right? 


For the students whose department won't loan them a GT laptop: do yourselves a favor, and spend a few hours installing ElementaryOS or Ubuntu on an old laptop. Have that machine ready, and you won't find yourself sidelined during exams by a busted laptop. 

This question comes up pretty often -- when a student's laptop breaks, they're often just left without any kind of support. From initial recommendations, any discussion of how to choose hardware why to go with Linux for a college curriculum, to fixit stuff like troubleshooting skills, work-arounds, recommendations for backup devices, to availability of loaner equipment, there's just not enough coverage for the (frequent) case where a student's essential equipment breaks down. 

Students should have stronger hardware and software support from Georgia Tech, in my opinion. It's just baffling to me that GT doesn't instruct students on basic computing skills like installing Ubuntu. That's basic FASET stuff - an essential supportive skill that takes just a few hours to learn, and eliminates countless IT-related emergencies. They teach students how to navigate other essential parts of the Institute, but when it comes to your primary working tool... you're on your own. This is a low-hanging-fruit problem: small investment in a basic familiarity skill, major load off your mind. It's a good fit for the GT community: tech that reflects our values. But so far, we're leaving that money on the table. 

It's hard enough to be a student in 2020 - just being introduced to basic Linux skills would make so many students' lives a lot easier (having a backup bootable pendrive for emergency hard drive failures; being able to turn older or cheap/used PC's into secondary computers or backup systems; being able to get your work done without worrying about license availability or malfunctioning DRM cutting off your access), but it's like no one's really thought of it.

"CS1100 TA here, I agree with matchagom. Software development is taught in the Core CS classes such as 1301, 1331, 1332, 2110, and 2340. Those classes are the basis for software development.

I'd argue that the CS Threads are to build on this basis in different sectors of CS. So after you learn about software development, what kinds of things do you want to develop? Do you want to learn how to develop for and around humans (People Thread), or maybe learn about design and aesthetics in development (Media Thread). Perhaps you want to develop and design for extremely low-level systems (SysArch, Devices), or learn about how the internet works (Info Internetworks). Maybe you want to develop software for simulations (ModSim) or maybe you're more a fan of diving deep into the methematics of CS (Theory).

All these threads are specifically to give you a leg up in different areas of CS applications, and will help you excel in that area of your choice.

Intelligence is a great thread pick! It focuses on learning how things like algorithms, machine learning, and AI actually work and how to apply that knowledge. This can pair well with many of the threads.

&gt;""anti-enforcing-wokeness"" is still just edgy kid silliness. The fact that you have a history of defending confederate flag use backs that up.

I admit it is not the term I am looking for. Let just say I am generally against the woke movement. And while there are some problems I agree with them should be addressed, definitely don't agree with how they want to fix them. A recent example of an event in this category is Trump stopping critical race theory from being taught to government employees, an action I support. Is this really edgy kid silliness? I see it is as an ideological battle. I don't call subscribers to the different woke movements ""edgy kids"", I take them very seriously and will debate them. 

About defending the confederate flag, I will say that I defend people who use one, or its design, against being labeled automatically racist. And I will defend against arguments that the flag is strictly a racist symbol, or oven predominantly a racist symbol, and for that its meaning very subjective. I will also defend the BLM protests. I will defend the existence of Black-only militia groups. I will defend the freedom of speech of communists, socialists, monarchists, fascists, and even racists (of any ethnicity or race).

However, I am stressed in regards to cancelling for Spring 2021. I know that the only way to get out of the housing contract is to essentially graduate, get a coop/study abroad, enlist in the military, get cleared by the military, or simply get married.

Niemi, Richard G., Michael J. Hanmer, and Thomas H. Jackson. ""Where can college students vote? A legal and empirical perspective."" *Election Law Journal* 8.4 (2009): 327-348.

Key takeaways:

The 'intent to stay' concept for residency that, in the context of voting, is at odds with the constitutional principles that have all but eliminated duration as an appropriate requirement for voting.

In Dunn v Blumstein, the US Supreme Court struck down durational requirements to vote, setting the standard that for purposes of voting, residence cannot include a durational requirement, either reaching backwards in time (that is, durational residency requirements before voting) or going forward in time (that is, requiring an intent to remain indefinitely or permanently).

"I'm an Army Brat. I grew up in Germany (as a German citizen) for the most part, but my dad's last station before he retired as a Sergeant Major with 30 years in service was Ft. Gordon, although he was still active military when I was at Tech. Being able to shop at the commissary at Ft. McPherson with my military dependent ID saved me some money, and I also worked at the Class VI store (base liquor store) for the last 3 years before I got out.

I went to a high school in the Augusta area that was probably (serious guesstimate here) 50%+ Army dependents. If you looked up and down my street in the morning, most guys getting into their cars wore OD Green or Khaki, depending on their assignment for the day. One of my high school classmates that I roomed with at Tech was also an Army Brat.

I'm sure there are other Military Brats on campus and I would have no idea how to go about finding them, but I am quite sure you are not alone.

Make side projects and academics an equal priority. Many students join engineering clubs because they realize, like you, that they lack the practicalness of what they learn in theory.

"Glad I can be helpful!

TLDR: I'd worry less about specific classes and more about getting the degree while being personally interested and exploring on your own time. Pick whatever classes you like and what works out logistically.

That's funny- I'm just now wrapping up 2015 with Dr. Babcock, AFTER I've completed an entire chemistry degree and now this CS degree (which is to say I am already familiar with research and stats covered in 2015) and CS 3750 and some other stuff. I mostly laugh about it, but I was pretty surprised when I learned I had to be taught hypothesis testing as a \~6th year. I also took combinatorics before discrete (CS 2050) due to my weird non-trad path, so I guess I have a habit of taking stuff out of order, which adds to the feeling of redundancy.

I can't speak too much to career stuff because I've only been told what I will be doing (developer experience), but the position doesn't start until February. That said, I'm fairly sure that I got the job because I talked about how I quickly go through libraries and technology, kind of as a weakness. But it's a reasonable trait in DX because you have to evaluate lots of dev tools. In the past month I've played with Arch and Kali OSes, SpringBoot, some .asm, React, Bootstrap, Postman, Android Studio, Flask, Django- I don't know any of them super well (and at this point, I don't have to), but I at least have a sense of *why* you'd want to use them and well as their context and relations to each other.

All that is to say- 1331, 1332, and 2340 gave me skills for technical interviews, my People classes probably helped with behavioral stuff, but I think the real reason I got this job and not a different one is because I personally like tinkering and exploring whatever computer stuff catches my interest. I really enjoy Bob Martin talks, Ben Eater (youtube), 3blue1brown (youtube), Coding Blocks (podcast), and I'll check out r/programming every once in a while. I do leetcode and CtCI problems for fun (these should not end once you get an offer, imo). I'd say that in terms of getting into a career, you can draw on classes, internships, and/or personal projects. I'd say it varies between folks, but I lean most heavily towards personal projects. The most important thing is that interviewers (and companies) want to see that you're actually excited about and have a personal interest in whatever realm they may put you in.

Sorry for the roundabout way of saying ""classes matter, but I feel that enthusiasm and personal experience matter more."" I think many would agree that your threads are very loosely deterministic of your career, so pick what you'll enjoy and explore on the side.",1607295048,1,0
"Former 1332 TA. Enjoy your break, and don‚Äôt stress. Everything you need to know you will learn during the semester. If you want to do leetcode for fun go for it, but you should not have to do anything out of fear of not enough preparation.

Hello! On Friday I received my decision letter that GT is offering me the First Generation Transfer Pathway to their school. I had a couple of questions hoping some people in this subreddit could answer for me. I plan to go to Georgia State as my college for the first year.

I applied to GT as Business and applied to Georgia State as a Comp Sci major (I plan to major in Computer Science and minor in Business if accepted into GT), for the transfer application in March will it put my major as Business since I originally applied as Business or will I be able to switch it to Computer Science. I also will be taking both course requirements for Business and Computer Science @ State first year before the transfer.

They said I need a minimum of 30 semester or 45 quarter credit hours before actually applying to Tech with the transfer. Do my AP Exams and Dual Enrollment (Georgia State) courses subtract the amount of credit hours I will need to do at Georgia State before transferring to GT (If I submitted my 5's on AP exams and I took ENG 1101 &amp; 1102 will it make my required hours go from for example 30 to 18 hours?).

Therefore, it's much more valuable to understand the structures at a deep level, rather than knowing how to apply them.

Not OP but I second this--I was deferred when I applied a couple of years ago and made my supplement about an Intro to AE course on EdX I was taking (since I applied as an AE but didn't have any AE or engineering extracurriculars at my school).

It could be a free ISyE related course on Coursera/EdX/MIT or some club you're in that involves some aspect related to that major--you'll have to do a bit of your own research on the field and what would best tie into that (that of course you're passionate about and show that in your written supplement).,1607286511,1,0

The professors have justified this behavior by saying they are just trying to make the class as fair as possible/cheating free.

"A lot of people have offered great advice for academics so I don't really have much more to offer other than go!! to!! office!! hours!!. However, here are some resources/suggestions for financial relief that will hopefully also help the academic side:  

1. [GT Student Emergency Fund](https://studentlife.gatech.edu/content/student-emergency-fund):  This was started in the spring for covid financial relief. They have since changed some of the guidelines and made it more structured but if you can in any way connect your financial situation to covid, even if it's just general, they are really looking to help you the most that they can. 
2. [GT STAR Services](https://studentlife.gatech.edu/content/star-services): I know you're probably already locked into housing and a meal plan as a freshman, but these are resources you should definitely look into a bookmark should you find yourself needing it after this year. I can personally speak for Klemis Kitchen -- Mr. Fazenbaker is the kindest person ever and really looks out for students. Would highly recommend just getting in touch with him, even if you don't need those services right now. Also you don't need to provide proof of x amount of financial need btw in case you aren't Pell eligible for whatever reason. 
3. [Ty Cobb Scholarship](https://tycobbfoundation.com/new-applicants/): Need based scholarship for Georgia residents. There is no essay or writing involved. 100% absolutely apply. It will take you less than an hour to put together all the paperwork. 
4. Keeping Zell is part merit part strategic. If you need all As next semester to raise your GPA, then only take classes you are confident in. Not getting Zell will hurt more than delaying graduation, taking summer classes, taking core classes later, or whatever. 
5. For on-campus jobs, if you have Fed Work Study, here are the [job postings](https://osfa.gatech.edu/fws-jobs). It will probably take emailing a handful of them. If not, I swear the CRC is like always hiring. Shoot and email or check the website. 
6. Lastly, you can take a semester off from school. Typically the default is just summer, but one scenario you could do would be to do school Summer and Fall semesters and then work full time in the Spring to pay for the last 2 semesters. That way you can have income to pay for things but it also won't take away from being able to focus on academics. Working more than 20 hours, esp off-campus, AND trying to do schoolwork is not just hard because of the time commitment but also because of focus and energy. Another suggestion is to only take 12 hours each semester if you're going to be working a lot. It is not a race to the finish and you should do what you need to do to take care of yourself mentally and financially. 

tl;dr you're doing AMAZING! Bearing financial burdens, attending a difficult school and a challenging major, and doing it all in such an isolating and non-ideal learning time is amazing, truly. Usually things like ""I was a freshman"" or ""I was still adjusting"" are acceptable reasons. Not only do you have that, but ""bc corona"" is acceptable within itself. Failure is okay, and you'll actually be asked about failure a lot in interviews and such. It's a sucky experience but a necessary one. It's not over now -- it's the steps you take now that will determine what actually happens because of this semester.

We're all rooting for you and here for you. I hope you will rest this break and be proud of everything you've accomplished.",1608342740,1,0

"Hey, I share your same pain as a freshman myself. I started iGniTe like yourself over the summer with little to no trouble, and compared to my other friends I was relatively ahead and on the up-and-up, but my academics derailed quickly over fall semester. I was taking only 14 credit hours at that time but I had a part-time job that extenuated to full time with the amount of hours I got, and I was off-campus taking online courses. It sucked real bad. 

I‚Äôve never been to the Georgia Tech campus and I‚Äôve been to the UGA campus a plethora of more times. At one point in the middle of the semester, my grades plummeted from high B‚Äôs and low A‚Äôs to D‚Äôs and failing. It just hit me all of the sudden. One setback in such turbulent times lead to a series of others. At times I wanted to transfer and just drop everything, I had every reason to, I thought to myself. I was depressed and lost, and I hated myself for feeling such a way for only a semester and a half off of campus. That quickly manifested to imposter syndrome and I felt like I did not deserve to be at Georgia Tech. I dropped many classes and I was borderline a part-time student. Still, even without the stress of many classes, I only borderline passed thanks to me emailing my professors my situation. It was embarrassing but I‚Äôm slowly forgiving myself. I may have lost Zell but I haven‚Äôt lost hope (yes and the scholarship) yet. 

Just know next year will be a different year, and it doesn‚Äôt matter what day you choose to start forgiving yourself and giving it your best, the only day that matters is the day you start. Resource yourself and give it your best OP.",1608302610,3,0

Our suggestion is to use an application like Thunderbird if you wish to have multiple accounts in one interface.

"Man so much good advice OP, I‚Äôm not sure I can add too much. But I have been in your situation, matter of fact I was dismissed from Tech due to my bad grades. But I managed to graduate this semester after being readmitted back to Tech so maybe I can reiterate some of the advice you‚Äôve received.

1. Use forgiveness, I didn‚Äôt which has kept some unsavory Fs in my transcript. But doing so will help you clean up your record and help maintain your GPA. 

2. Go to office hours. Even if it feels like you have a moderate understanding. Going to these has two reasons the first is it‚Äôll help you affirm your knowledge but the second is you become a familiar face, the professor knows you by name and will be willing to help you out. That has been something that has helped me out multiple times throughout my undergrad. 

3. The Center for Academic Success for me was amazing. Go to plus sessions they‚Äôll help you a lot since working together with others will help you see how others grasp material and that will allow you to take some of their strategies. If you feel like you need some more, take 1on1 tutoring. For a lot of the core classes 1on1 tutoring helped me out, the fact that for about an hour I could sit down and discuss with someone who has experience with the class all kinds of questions helped me learn. Finally get some academic coaching, when I was dismissed and then readmitted we had to take GT2100 which is basically academic coaching, we figured out how to manage our schedules to maximize our progress. I think this might be helpful so you can figure out a daily schedule that will allow you to get your work done.

4. Don‚Äôt overburden yourself. This is very important. Don‚Äôt take too much, I understand the feeling that you must take classes or you want to get it done but keep it manageable. It‚Äôs better to take a bit longer but do it well and not be stressed out as opposed to trying to plow headfirst through the wall and suffering from it. 

5. Ask around what people think about classes, what professors people find the best. Make friends this‚Äôll help a lot. These will be people who can help you out, they also know the struggles of Tech. I find learning with others the best since your peers will understand things a certain way and that might help you, and when you try to explain something it helps you learn. 

Lastly, take a deep breath and relax. Nothing can be achieved while panicking. I understand it‚Äôs a struggle sometimes and the weight feels overwhelming but you belong here. It‚Äôs a long marathon so just square up and keep moving. I was dismissed, it took me six and a half years to graduate but I managed to. I even managed to get a job lined up before graduation. 

It‚Äôs not the end OP, the story still has a lot left to be written so keep going, keep your head high and you‚Äôll make it. If you ever need to chat or anything just message me. I‚Äôm always willing to have a conversation.",1608299337,3,0

"Oh yes! First off, there is no ""good enough"" when it comes to these types of events. I did HackGT my first year with just an AP CS credit from high school. I didn't win anything, but I met some fun people from other schools and together we made a little mobile game app (that ended up glitching out before presentations). 

I know this year they offered beginner and experienced paths for HackGT 7, which provided mentors for people and teams who felt they needed some help. But HackGT is more than just the one event. If you want to start even smaller, there's HackGTeeny (an intro workshop-like series), BuildGT (if you're more comfortable with building and less so with coding), and Horizons (focused on art+tech). 

To me HackGT is about the experience and applying your knowledge into practice, whether that knowledge be the infinite universe or one AP CS credit. Go to an event to meet phenomenal people, network with the amazing sponsors, and challenge yourself. You'll complete more than you'd ever expect.

"I can give you my purpose perspective as a 2015 CM graduate who took classes in both the People and Media threads. I'm a product manager for music industry web tools though. Not exactly game design. 

The key difference between CM and CS is, probably obvious, the LMC component.

I describe my degree as divided into thirds. 1/3 was taking CS courses, 1/3 was taking LMC courses, and 1/3 were courses that lectured like LMC courses and graded like CS ones.

Meaning, in CS you will go much much deeper in the raw mechanics and theory of computer science. In CM, you go plenty deep, get a slice of a liberal arts education, and take challenging courses that demand you combine your technical skills with your understanding of the ideas discussed in class. It's no cake walk for sure. 

The plus side is that many of my final projects were games, and some people made some incredible portfolio pieces that no doubt landed them in a interview at a gaming company.

You'll have to decide what is it about game design that you are most interested in. If it's the nitty-gritty ""how do I write these math equations to get these physics engine to work"" you might be happier as a CS major with People and Media as your concentrations.

If you like the more complete perspective approach and want to be involved in more than one aspect of game design I would say at least set up a meeting with the academic advisor.

At the end of the day, the degree is just the starting point. Whatever you want to do you can work your way there so don't sweat trying to match the exact degree with the exact position you think you want. 

Just make sure your genuinely interested in the material your studying. Or your doomed :)",1609294471,1,0

I park in the upper deck of peters because I live on east campus. I just received and email from GT PTS saying that I have to relocate my car to a lot across campus from Nov 25 to Jan 17.

I have had to move my car for football games this whole semester even though covid has limited the amount of attendees. During the games the garages dont even get close to filling up. 

With the current campus population (which is declining rapidly with the new mandatory break) the garage isn't even a 1/3rd full and GT PTS is STILL making all of us relocate our cars for athletic events and commencement. On top of this, they dont give us specific dates to move our vehicles, we just have to relocate our vehicles for a blanket period of two months. If we dont move our cars, we get towed and fined more money.

This is a personal FUCK YOU to students from GT PTS. If I have to pay ALMOST A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR to park my car, I shouldnt have to park it a mile away from where I live. I especially shouldnt have to park a mile away if THERES ENOUGH ROOM IN THE LOTS WITHOUT MOVING THE STUDENTS.

As with all things like this, there's rarely concrete evidence because they are smart. I believe in simulation theory. I think, similarly, we have two possible realities at Georgia Tech: a) we are, in fact, a non-corrupt institution that just needs businesses and extraordinarily heavy administrative involvement to operate, or b) there are larger forces at play to squelch the student voice and use GT as a big corporate vehicle. I know which one I believe, but each student will need to come to their own conclusions. There's no evidence to either one; just the words of the admins saying nothing of substance, and the words of populist students who think they've been disenfranchised, also saying nothing of substance. 

""Why would the administration lie, though?"" oh, dear student, you've never been bribed.

"Time to tell a favorite story of mine again:

I once extended an assignment by a day at the end of the term because I was asked to, and two students filed a complaint that I was therefore violating what was then dead week policy. It wasn‚Äôt clear what they wanted to happen instead. The obvious thing was to move the assignment back a day but that seemed cruel. It wasn‚Äôt as cruel as what I came up with instead:

So, my final assignment is designed to be the easiest. It is even worth more‚Äî15% instead of 10%‚Äîto give students a chance to raise overall scores. By contrast, the final exam‚Äîworth 25%‚Äîis legendarily harder and the mean is something like 30 points lower than the final assignment. I gave students the option to not do that assignment and instead have the final worth 40%. Clearly a dumb idea.
But there‚Äôs more.

My course is meta-commentary on machine learning.

So, after computing final grades I go back and look at every student who does better on the final than the midterm and substitute the exam score. If it would raise the grade I then look at the assignments and see if there is improvement, more or less, across the four assignments and if there is I assign the higher grade. This process impacts a good 10-15% of the students each term. Of course, if one doesn‚Äôt do the final assignment that‚Äôs not an option, so it‚Äôs clearly even dumber to not do that assignment.

I explained all this to the class and predicted that many of them would do it anyway and it would lower a significant number of their grades. Afterwards I took the students who didn‚Äôt do the assignment and substituted their average scores on the assignments to see if it would have made a difference and for the vast majority of them, of course it did.

"This article was poorly researched, as the AJC published a more up-to-date article back on Aug 28 on the same topic. The NY Times should have at least READ the AJC article before writing their article. In particular: 1) background: a judge ruled in 2016 that the state brought charges against Laskar too late. They were dropped not out of a decision of guilt or innocence, but because the state took too long to file charges. 2) In a 2-1 decision in Aug 2020, the judge dropped two school officials named in the malicious prosecution charge, but allowed the charges against the auditors to move forward.

"LibreOffice can open all Microsoft template documents, but there's also a basic template for resumes: https://www.libreofficetemplates.net/preview/Entry-Level_Position_Resume

Definitely do not use Microsoft Office. As a long-time technician who's supported MS Office since the DOS days, I'm no longer recommending it to anyone, for any purpose. 

LibreOffice is much closer in spirit to what used to draw customers to Microsoft Office. It's got stability, interoperability, reliability -- everything but the brand name. If someone sends you their MS Office template, you can open and edit it in LibreOffice, save it as a Word docx, and export it as a PDF. 

Not much is designed to edit a PDF after export, but if you do need to, then LibreOffice is also the best-working program for that, even compared to Acrobat.

I'd second that.


In the olden times, when I was at Tech, we had a professor who forgot about the final exam and went to Poland instead.   So we sat in the room for hours with no exam and no final grades.

We went quietly to the Chair  and without making a public spectacle, he took care of everything.  Any good Chair would help you with this but the Professor is right - better to not make a lot of noise about it, just ask to have a polite talk and it surely will get fixed.

"I graduated IE in 2019 and work in a programming-type role. Your career doesn't necessarily have to be related to your major, and starting a CS degree now may take a long time (you'll have to figure out how many semesters it will take, and maybe add an extra semester or two since there aren't even enough spots in all classes for CS majors). Also keep in mind that it may be socially isolating to switch now - you'll be an older upperclassman in a class of freshmen/sophomores, and forming social bonds with your peers may be difficult. I considered switching to CS as an IE major but ultimately decided against it and I'm glad I stuck with IE, even though the later classes were a bore (and keep in mind that CS majors often groan about their upper-level classes, especially the ones in the threads they're less interested in).

Ultimately it's up to you to determine whether to switch. My advice is to consider how many semesters of work to add, whether the potential social isolation is worth it, whether it's something you'll be genuinely interested in for the long run (incl upper-level non-programming classes and long lines at the CS career fair), and most importantly, whether it will actually make a big difference in your career (you can still apply for programming jobs without a CS degree, no one would be stopping you and IE skills are actually valued in the tech world).",1599435973,1,0
