"IMO, as a person who reviewed resumes for a company hiring process, I wouldn't put any additional emphasis on Beta Gamma Sigma, other than the fact that they're in the top 10% of their undergrad business school by GPA (which many people just write on their resume without paying for BGS).

I don't know anything about the Beta Gamma Sigma group at Penn, but if it's just ""pay money and we let you use our name to signify you got a good GPA"", it's not worth the money.  If there's a group on campus of BGS folks who manage the money and spend it to organize events or activities (like many student orgs or fraternity/sororities), I'd value that ""leadership experience"" on a resume.  So check if there's any opportunity to be involved in a ""BGS"" social group or organization, but if not, it's not really worth it.",1633553864,3,0

Even though I considered it totally out of my comfort zone, what ultimately helped me was rushing in the spring. Through this, I found a small but vital group of friends. From there, it was a domino effect. I stayed on campus the summer after freshman year to take some classes, and those smaller class sizes made it easier to make some friends. The confidence boost made it easier to put myself forward for other social opportunities my second year.

By the time I graduated, I still didn't feel like I was wholely *successful* socially while at Penn, but I had enough friends that I was happy.",1633534396,1,0

It is also helpful and important to remember that dining services makes significant efforts to employ people who are traditionally less likely to be employed - like people with disabilities and personality disorders, which can contribute to staff needing to follow the letter of the law instead of judging based on the situation.

"&gt;Personally, I really dislike macroeconomics and especially the macroeconomics faculty at Penn. All are the conservative Minnesota breed such as Krueger, Villaverde, Rios-Rull, Cole. But again most of modern macroeconomics is based on microeconomic theory and so doing well in ECON 101 would you set you up well for ECON 102.

I am sorry I don't think he is a genius. And how can you know that he is a genius, he teaches a course on economic history (where he sometimes just randomly puts youtube videos on in class) and that is no signal of being a genius. Surely, he has varied interests and knows a lot of different topics as a scholar but so do several scholars and they just don't go around and create as much noise as he does. 

He also goes around and teaches mini courses on computational economics across various top economics departments and I have personally heard stories of him telling his graduate students/research assistants that he needs something by tomorrow morning the evening/night before given his ""busy"" schedule. This is typical behavior of a couple of people in the economics department but something I have specifically heard about him. 

Now his academic record shows he is no genius. His record is okay and average. He has published around 6 papers in top 5 journals (3 AER, 2 Restud, 1 ECMA) in economics enough to be tenured at Penn but not at any of the Top 7 economics departments given its been 20 years since his PhD. At Harvard or MIT, top macroeconomics researchers produce that output in 7-8 years and still fail to get tenure. He hasn't had any prolific students if we look at his advising record. The best placement he has had as an advisor is Georgetown and the median is Federal Reserve Board. 

He used to be the DGS as well and I know for a fact that he is very biased. There have been cases where the student who finishes first in the macro preliminary PhD exam and first overall in all the preliminary PhD exams finished their PhD in 9+ years. Sure he is a genius. Even James Heckman (who doesn't go around and call himself a genius) trains his PhD students for 7 years but generally places them well for their substantiative efforts and provides substantial coauthoring opportunities. The same cannot be said for Villaverde.

Now onto the ideology, the behavior of Penn macro faculty is really concerning. I remember that one of my friends was working on Senator Casey's campaign and he told Greenwood about it and Greenwood looked at him with disgust. Since the student had a close relationship with Greenwood, he jokingly said you can't be socially conservative and that Casey was still more of a centrist and then Greenwood conceded hastily. It's very likely that all the macro faculty would have voted for Trump over Clinton in the 2017 elections. Do we really want these Professors to make policies? Not quite!

Now, I know Villaverde goes on to write letters for law school as I am sure he would be for you. But according to him, if any math econ major gets a B or two (which they count as B+ too) he simply asks them to go to law school instead of pursuing economics graduate school or any technical career. He considers himself to be an expert on everything and considers himself to be a God in these matters and his word is Gospel. He is also very biased in that I know the economics department creates opportunities for students who suck up to them even if their math skills may not be on par with students who get a B or two for whom he won't even write a letter for law school.",1634609968,1,0

OP, we’re still early enough in the semester that you can catch up and pick yourself back up again. Try to catch up little by little everyday on things you’ve missed.

Harvard was chartered in 1650 though. But people do get weird about technicalities with school ages for some reason. I went to St John’s College before Penn. St John’s is the 3rd oldest college in America after Harvard and William and Mary. Buuuut some people try to say it isn’t because it was chartered as King William’s School and wasn’t St John’s until about 90 years later. I can’t think of how that type of argument would apply to Harvard and Penn though. I think they’re just wrong.,1631400591,3,0

"Hi! So last year Stat 471 was distinct from the grad section Stat 571/701 with the former taught by Katsevich and the latter taught by Zhao. Disclaimer: I was a TA for Stat 571/701 last sem and will be again in the spring, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt. 

To address your questions with respect to the section I TA’d:
1. The workload was pretty manageable if you work well in groups. There were 4 HW assignments, each with 3 weeks to finish that were practical case analyses done in groups. There was also a midterm and final project, but these were all done with the goal of giving you practical project experience that you can put on your resume. 

2. The class wasn’t curved, but Linda was generous with grades if it was clear you were putting effort into the class. Grading on individual assignments was pretty chill. 

3. None! There’s a R tutorial at the start of the semester developed by the TA staff to help you get situated. Fwiw we’re all hoping to develop some class materials in python for next spring as well.

Edit to add: I say this because one of my biggest regrets from undergrad is not taking advantage of easily accessed counseling services. Years later I'm kicking myself for not getting into a good habit when it was so simple.",1635531766,2,0
"Absolutely agree with this perspective. My time as a premed (both as a student, TA, and now med student) has really shown me that a lot of high GPA kids get that high GPA through finding loopholes in the system (taking classes to pad GPAs, easier professors, befriending TAs, etc). Ultimately, I view a 4.0 as something along the lines of a pink flag. it could mean the person is literally the hardest worker out there, or perhaps it just means they never took a class that genuinely challenged themselves.",1635530945,5,0
"Grades have nothing to do with your worth!

The piece of paper is what matters. 

If you want to go further up in higher ed, grades to matter. But not completely. I ended undergrad with just under a 3.0 as a first Gen student from a non-(nowhere even CLOSE)-to prep school. They let you write an addendum to applications to explain stuff like that. 

In your case, knowing nothing else about you, the fact that you’re in school during the worst global crisis and worst national crisis of the last century or so will help. 

You’ll be fine.",1635530686,1,0
"I used to run a small startup. Hired many scientists and engineers. Once hired a kid from Harvard straight out of school, had a 4.0 GPA, seemed to be smart and eloquent in interviews. Also hired another kid from a relatively unheralded local state school with a 2.7 GPA but liked her tenacity and willingness to learn. The 4.0 GPA guy we had to dismiss within 5 months because he was bad at communication, responded negatively to feedback, and would produce pretty sloppy code. Turns out the guy was just a genius at faking until making it. The person with the 2.8 GPA replaced the Harvard guy, learned the ropes quickly, and ended up working her way up to a team lead after a few years. I learned that GPA can be pretty noisy in terms of signal for work performance and we decided to give almost little to no weight to it when evaluating candidates. We ended up encoding it as binary - did the person have at least a 2.5 GPA or not - so long as they did, they were golden in that regard.",1635529718,1,0

"I'm in grad school at Penn and did engineering for undergrad, so I definitely had the ""grades = worth"" stamped out of me, or I wouldn't have survived!  It's hard when you start taking harder courses, because you're used to getting As in high schools or freshman courses.  It's also a big problem in the workforce (I worked a couple of years before returning for grad school) and the whole ""work performance = human worth"" is really an issue.  That is to say, don't feel bad about not having worked this out, plenty of 40-50 year olds still feel this way about work performance!

&amp;#x200B;

But it's good to get it stamped out early in life if you can.  It helped me to think of the standard triangle of ""good grades -- good health/sleep -- good social life"" (pick 2).  It's a meme but sometimes it's good to remember your worth is not just grades -- you can purposefully demote some grades to be better to your body/mind or to connect with friends or network with people.  And you're at Penn!  People will know you're good at the grades part of it.  If you end up with subpar grades at Penn, people know you were really smart but may have decided to prioritize other things in certain semesters.  That doesn't mean don't try hard, but it does mean don't set the rest of your life on fire trying to keep the grades part warm, it's a trade-off you choose to make.  The other parts are just as important for success in the world past Penn.",1635527955,27,0

They are about to refurbish the Quad too. As far as the food, not exactly sure why Penn can't do better with the food service.

"Masters in BioE here.
I didn’t look into biotech but from the website, the curriculum looks a lot more restrictive for biotech than BioE. You could essentially get a BioE degree by just doing the biotech stuff, but not the other way around. It also looks like you need to choose a track, and some of them don’t even seem to allow for a lot of research time/don’t give credits for research (I might be wrong). I also don’t see a lot of informatics/comp bio classes in that list, more drug delivery/nanotech/molecular bio stuff.

In BioE, anyone can do 2 semesters of research for credit, which sounds like it would be good considering you are hoping to do a PhD and therefore should probably join a lab while you’re here. BioE also allows to complete a thesis, which imo would sound much better for a PhD applicant coming from a Masters than having a course-only Masters.
I think the more relevant website for you to get the freedom of the BioE curriculum is this one:
[https://be.seas.upenn.edu/masters/degree-requirements/](https://be.seas.upenn.edu/masters/degree-requirements/)

Note that you are required to take a more math intensive course, a more bio intensive course, etc., but the definitions are pretty broad. Most of my courses actually ended up being outside of BioE and I did some in the bioinformatics department at Perelman, some in medical physics, a robotics class in MEAM, a machine learning class in CIS, etc. The list in the link above isn’t even complete, and you can argue for anything reasonable to be included in those “SEAS/ Biological Science Elective” credits.

Considering you are interesting in Comp Bio/Bioinformatics, I’d also recommend looking at the[Masters in Biomedical Informatics](https://www.med.upenn.edu/mbmi/), which like I said, is offered at Perelman (the College of Medicine). The classes I took from the department have been great. It does also seem a bit more restrictive than the BioE degree

"240 in the spring with farmer is a ton of work, so plan on it being your hardest class for the sem. Despite it being a big boy If you put in the time, go to class and OH, you should be able to do fine and get a good understanding of how a really simple computer works from the ground up. 

The class was a ton of work, but it reaffirmed my interest in cis and despite feeling a bit out of place in cis after a rough first sem, helped me realize that I’m more than capable of doing well in cis.

If you like 240, you’ll like 471 and 380. Together they are a large portion of the cis core. If you don’t like 240 and you also don’t like 120/160, you should jump ship on the degree because you won’t like any of the curriculum",1640909038,1,0

"This is so depending on what classes you took. If you took a language and writing sem, you should probably expect to have a higher gpa compared to those who didn't. If you took some of the hard classes that freshmen take (Math 104, Chem, Econ) you would probably expect a lower first semester GPA. I would guess average GPA across penn this semester will be around 3.6, average first semester GPA probably closer to 3.65-3.7. Low means different things to different people, but below a 3.0 is probably considered low, but that doesn't mean getting below a 3.0 is bad, especially as a freshman.",1640907732,1,0

"Former physics major here. A good first step is to contact professors directly and ask if they have openings in their group for an undergraduate researcher. You’ll have to do some reading beforehand to get a sense of what they’re working on, but expressing interest in the specific work they do can go a long way. Some research topics, like certain areas of theory, are very difficult to work on as an undergrad, so try to be realistic and look for topics you can approach more easily. Even if they don’t have an opening, it’s still a great networking opportunity.

The main program I know of is Vagelos MLS, which usually sends out invitations with your acceptance letter. They let you do physics research and (at least used to) give funding for the summers after your sophomore and junior years. If you’re okay taking some extra coursework in chemistry, it could be an option to consider.",1640899647,1,0

"Physics graduate student here - I’d start by looking at Penn for profs doing research you’re interested in. Finding REUs (Research Experience for Undergraduates) in any STEM field rn is a bit of a nightmare competition-wise, so your best bet is to do some good work here at Penn in our kickass department. Once you have a physics professor who’s willing to write a rec letter for you + some work in your portfolio, you stand a much better chance of landing a summer internship or fellowship placement at another university or lab.

Slightly related: doing work at Penn to figure out /what/ kind of physics you want to do will be personally valuable as well. I knew I wanted to do particle physics before I entered high school, but even then there are many pathways in which to specialize (neutrinos, dark matter candidates, accelerator physics, heavy flavour jets, lepton universality… you get the picture). Working in a high energy group at my undergrad university taught me what I wanted to do and what I wanted to avoid if at all possible. You’ll be hella competitive come graduate app season if you can point to a very specific subfield and say “this is the physics I do and here are the experiences I’ve tailored within that space”",1640898927,1,0

"I'd actually recommend taking a 19x class instead of 240 bc low-level programming is a big hit or miss (I personally hated 240).

19x classes are taught by students so they're (mostly) super chill, project-based, and you can pick and choose from a variety of topics depending on what you're interested in (mobile dev, web dev, python, devops, etc). You learn a LOT and get to build cool projects without the stress of a normal CIS class (plus they're easy A's) :)",1640898636,1,0

"It’s worth it. Yes our gpa may be lower, but you tend to get some slack from Adcoms. As much as people in r/premed say that undergrad doesn’t matter, I think it does tend to matter. Penn has a lot more resources (in terms of research esp) at your disposal with a relatively small pool of individuals competing for those resources. Eg I’ve never had to apply to a research position, but I know my other friends at non ivies have to since 10-20 people can be competing for the same position.

"Um the experiences of the other commenter are basically the exact opposite of my experiences. GPA is probably the hardest to keep high at penn (our avg premed gpa is a 3.6/7 I think?). I really chalk this up to the fact that a lot of our courses are far more rigorous than what you’d find in another state college. MCAT is probably the “easiest” to score well in (avg is 516 at penn vs 511 nationally). since…let’s face it, ivies tend to attract people who do well at standardized tests. 

Schedule wise I think I basically tried to keep it so that I only took 1-2 premed reqs a semester. That was very manageable and you shouldn’t feel pressure to do more than that unless you want to matriculate immediately after graduation (not advised since most people nowadays are taking a gap year or two -&gt; gives you more time to prep for mcat, more EC/volunteering time, etc).",1640887040,1,0
