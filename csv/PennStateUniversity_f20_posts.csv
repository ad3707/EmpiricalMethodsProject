Living off-campus tips and experiences,"Hey, I am a freshman currently at Penn State. I opted to stay home for my first semester and just take my courses online. I am wondering about my living situation next year. 

I do not want to live on campus if possible. 

I have two friends from my hometown that offered to live in a house with them. I get my own room. The rent is $700 plus amenities like heating and internet access.

I was wondering if this was a fair price, plus just tips in general about finding the right place. I just think it's ridiculous that most places need a deposit down so early in advance.",1602029101,1,0

What dorm to try to get into as a freshman on UP?,"I'm applying for Penn State UP as well as the early summer start program (whatever it's called) and was wondering when come time that my application is accepted (hopefully!), what dorm should me and my roommate try and shoot for? We are both relatively big PC Gamers with expensive rigs and large monitor stands and I heard that the unrenovated East Halls have the most desk space? 

Walking between classes isn't too grand a deal because I plan to hopefully bike to my classes to get some exercise across the day. 

I suppose, what's the best student-residency for someone who values desk space &gt; anything else? Any insight on any of the other dormitories is also appreciated and feel free to tell me about your experiences! I have a feeling I might be spending more time in my dorm than I might like to with COVID, so I'd like to be as comfortable as I can while doing so!",1602014678,1,0
[Serious] This goes out to all my people struggling out there and hitting their low point:,"I don't know who out there needs to hear this, but I want you to know you may be in a dark place right now, but the sun will rise again at some point. I know there's some of you out there who having trouble with class or friends and possibly spiraling into unhealthy thoughts. It's okay, I've been there. Just take a deep breath and talk with me for a couple of minutes.

So, as little background; I graduated High School in '07. I had fairly mediocre grades; I was never really motivated to do much outside of video games and football. I was infatuated at the time with the idea of being a pilot, so I applied to Penn State Worthington as a Comp Sci Major (I didn't really care one way or the other about the subject, but I needed a major, and I was the family nerd, so it felt right), and the Air Force ROTC program, and with a little help from some good SAT scores I got in.

Now, my study habits were god-awful. I got through High School just by rushing through the homework and paying enough attention in class to pass with B's and C's, but outside of HW, I never opened my books. Well, as I'm sure most of you already figured out, that shit won't fly in college. I rode the struggle bus all through my freshman and sophomore years. I still have no idea how I managed a C in Math 141, outside of Divine Intervention.

So I roll into Spring '09 treading water, just barely above a 2.0 GPA. I'm getting my ass kicked in PHYS 212, and MATH 230 because, again, I fell ass-backwards into a passing grade in MATH 141, and those classes are nigh-impossible to do if you can't do Calculus. I felt like I was dumb, like I'm wasting time and money, like I was never going to amount to anything, and basically started getting really intrusive thoughts.  If I knew then what I know now, I'd have recognized I was falling into a pretty bad depression. 

Well, to top it all off, my grandma, whom I was super close with, passed away the Monday of Finals Week that semester. I'm sure any professor would've taken that as an excuse for a make-up. Problem is, and anyone who had major depression can probably attest to, it gets *REALLY* hard working up the motivation to do even the most basic things. So I just never brought it up with the professors, and skipped like half my Finals and bombed the others. I think my GPA that semester was a whopping 0.7.

Well ROTC doesn't tolerate grades like that, so I got called into the Commandant's office and was basically told the Air Force doesn't want me as an Officer. So in the span of a week, I lost my grandmother, got 4 F's, and had the door shut on my dream job. Again, had I been thinking more clearly at the time, I probably would've taken a step back and re-evaluated where to go from there. But I wasn't thinking straight, and I sure as hell wasn't about to admit to my dad that I failed 4 classes in one semester.

So I went to State College to try to salvage my degree. And it was there I discovered the joys of alcohol. So I partied and drank and binged video games because it helped me not have to think about the seemingly-bottomless pit of debt and failure I was falling into. And then one day I woke up and realized I haven't left my apartment in 3 weeks. I'd gotten an email explaining that I was being kicked out of the College of Engineering. It was at that point the 4-story drop off of my balcony started looking \*really\* tempting. It would've been easier than explaining to my parents that I just pissed away 20 grand to get drunk and play Mass Effect all day. I cried myself to sleep, I cried myself awake. I hated myself. I hated what I became, I hated all the opportunities I pissed away. I would watch people out my window just being happy and going about their day. I would watch people at night on the news just being happy (it was 2010) and going about their day. I would watch people on Facebook just being happy and going about their day. I would think about those people and how the entire world was completely unaffected by the **absolute hell** I was in. And that just made it so much worse. I would fixate on everything that hurt. I couldn't tell you why, maybe it was some kind of mental self-flagellation I was doing to punish myself.

Then finally one night, I was on my balcony, staring at that 4 story drop. I don't know how long I was up there, but every second I was up there I got closer to just letting go. But at the back of my mind a little voice was telling me that I needed to call somebody. Anybody. This wasn't good. This wasn't right.

So I pulled my phone out, and called the one person I knew who would answer the phone at 1 in the morning. My mom. And I told her everything. I cried like a baby. And she listened, thank god. She explained that her and dad would be in State College the next day to get me, and that we'd find some way to get through it. And we did. My dad was beyond **pissed**, but to his credit he swallowed that anger and helped me out. It sucked going home and admitting to everyone I failed out of college, but honestly, it felt actually **good** to get that all off of my chest. It was liberating. I didn't have to hide in my apartment all day, I didn't have to avoid phone calls anymore. It was like for the first time in months I could breathe fresh air.

And now, 10 years later, following an Academic Renewal, I'm back, going for Electrical Engineering. I've since discovered I have a real passion for electronics, and class is actually pretty fun now. And the best part is, I'm happily married (7 years on the 26th!), with the cutest, smartest little 3 year old boy ever who gives me all the motivation I need to succeed.

And I just sit back and look at where I am, and I look back to those dark days of 2010. All I can think of is how much I just needed to talk to someone and admit that I had a serious problem. I wanted to share my story with anyone else out there who is in that same pit I was stuck in so long ago.

If you need to talk to someone, anyone, drop me a PM, or call the Penn State Crisis Line at 1-877-229-6400. I remember how much despair I felt looking out the window at those people oblivious to my hurt, and I just want you to know that at least one of those people out there knows the pain you're feeling.

Spring Semester and the Bizarre Case of MLK Jr. Day,"After reading PSU's plans for the Spring semester something felt off to me. Doesn't seem like they are easing restrictions of any kind, so why do we get MLK Jr. Day off? I guess it gives us an extra day to sleep in and push off having to care about school again, but it seems odd to start off on a Tuesday. I would have thought the school would have just plowed over it like they did to Labor Day and Spring Break and start that Monday. Just doesn't make sense to delay the inevitable since most people will probably be coming back over the weekend anyway.

Any thoughts?",1601906659,1,0
Anyone Else Experience This?,"In all of my classes this semester, I am being assigned ridiculous amounts of menial, time-consuming assignments that are due almost every day that count for almost nothing. I'm taking 18 credits this semester as a senior, and I have taken this amount of credits before, but even in my electives and classes that are meant to be easier, I am constantly forgetting about assignments due because they just pop up unannounced most of the time.

Resultantly all of my grades so far are hovering around 70-80% and I consistently forget to do assignments for all of my classes. Examples of the type of work I have to do almost every day and submit for almost no points are...

\- Reading 40 pages of a textbook and answering 16 free-response questions with multiple parts (3x a week, 5 points)

\- Reading 20-40 pages of dense research articles and papers and answering 2-4 questions essay style (2x a week, 5 points)

\- Discussion boards that pop up unannounced with barely any notice (once? a week, 5 points)

Is it just me, or is anyone else experiencing a disproportionate amount of work for their classes that are almost worth nothing? It would be nice if there was a schedule these professors could follow or some consistency... but some assignments are given no announcements while others are, and some are not given any at all. Could professors just take it easy and stop compensating for remote classes by making us do hours of work outside of class for almost no grade? I have so many ""Missing"" assignments on my grades, it's not funny. And the best part is, that the assignments that ARE completed aren't even graded, even from August.

After my freshman year my Dad passed away suddenly when we were on vacation and that caused even more problems so I went with online school. I didn’t really care about anything at the time so my grades were not great. My first two years of high school resulted in a 2.35 GPA and a 2.65 GPA. After that I decided to dedicate myself to my work and get good grades. I will emphasize this in my essays.

My junior year I ended up with a 3.64 GPA and that brought it up to a 2.7 overall going into my senior year.

The first channel has all sorts of general content, including calculus, biology, physics, and astronomy.

Am I overreacting or is this normal?,"For one of my classes, our weekly HW are split into parts and graded by different TA/LA. The problem comes in when one of graders gave me a 0 for a question I got wrong, while another grader gave me partial points for a similar question that I got wrong. Both questions required a decent amount of work, even though they were 1 points each. When I emailed the former grader about the 0, their response was that they believe 1-point questions should be all or nothing. 

Something about this situation feels wrong, even though it is just over half a point.  The most suspicious part of this was that said grader graded their part a day before the HW answer key was even scanned, while other graders were after. Before this HW, all the graders graded after the answer key was posted.",1601257112,1,0

Question about my professor,"I know it may seem like a bit of an overreaction, but I feel like such a fuck up now. Sorry if this is ridiculous. 

It’s my last semester. I’m taking one specific class just for credits, but the professor is someone I’ve worked with before. A close relative passed away recently, and I made sure to email everyone to give them a heads up that I need time. This Professor even replied and said that was fine. 

Now my problem is that they are marking in 0s for every single assignment I’ve missed. It’s such a motivation killer that I wanna curl up in a ball and stay there. Which is fine for grading purposes, but today was awful, they went so far as to preemptively mark a 0 for today’s assignment. I was actually going to work and do it to start catching up, but I just feel so lost and I don’t even want to anymore. 

Am I overreacting? Do I go see someone about this? It just seems cruel to me that I get a 0 before the assignment is even due. I even got a zero on another assignment (before my relative passed), but I had already done it. After I had done it, they apparently added a submission box and said to get credit, you had to submit a question from the assignment so they know you read it. I didn’t catch that because it had been done. 

I’m really sorry if this sounds stupid but it honestly hurts. I don’t care if I seem like a snowflake or whatever you wanna call me but I’m at one of my lowest points right now and this is not helping. Please tell me if I truly am overreacting, or what I can do to just make it stop. Even just how to approach this subject to the professor, because I’m not sure how to without looking like an idiot. Thank you for any help and I’m sorry.",1601252762,1,0

Study on academic integrity experiences,"  

Hi there- I’m a Ph.D. student working on a study analyzing people’s experiences with academic integrity in college. I’m creeping around on Reddit looking for international students who have had experiences at universities in the DC area, particularly people from China, KSA, and Korea, and that’s why I am writing to this community now. I’m wondering if you would be willing to participate in an interview about your experiences dealing with academic integrity in college- dealing with honor codes, being accused of cheating, not being sure if you have broken a code or not, seeing someone else break the code, etc. Everything is kept confidential (I want to be clear about this- it’s all CONFIDENTIAL!) and it is IRB approved through the University of Maryland (#1515891-1). If you are willing to talk, I know your input and experiences will be valuable. Please feel free to DM here on Reddit (I’m around on Discord too) or email me at [decoster@umd.edu](mailto:decoster@umd.edu). If you think you know someone who has a story to tell, please let them know that I would love to hear it too.

Also: many thanks to all of you who have participated so far in my study on academic integrity! I am grateful for your help. Several important things have emerged so far, and I was hoping to share them with you here:

\-Schools almost never provide information about the code of academic integrity outside of orientation- sometimes on the syllabus, but not really. 

\-Almost everyone has seen multiple cases of cheating in courses, and professors seem to ignore it for most students, but not international students

\-Most students would like to know more about the rules regarding how to cite papers, how to avoid plagiarism, how to paraphrase, and how to give credit to sources

\-Everyone reports that schools are not doing anything to help international students understand what academic integrity means

\-Almost everyone reports that time and course design are the biggest reasons for copying, plagiarizing, or trying to get answers from an online source

Once again, if you have a story to tell, I would love to hear it. Please contact me at [decoster@umd.edu](mailto:decoster@umd.edu) if you would like to participate- every story remains anonymous.

Thanks,

Brendan",1603917252,1,0

When to apply as a transfer?,"Hi, so, I’m a first semester freshman not at PSU and know you need at least 18 credits to be eligible for transfer. After this semester, I will have exactly 18 credits using the transfer credit tool (current classes and AP credits). 

Couple things: Should I apply for 2021’s fall semester, or the following year? My current school is cheaper but finishing the degree in 4 years would be optimal. 

Should I apply when this semester ends next month, or right now? Will my current courses count toward that 18 credit requirement if they aren’t finished? I’m guessing if it is acceptable then I’ll need to send another copy of my transcript when this semester ends or something like that. 

If there’s anything else you feel is relevant, I would be really interested in hearing it, thank you :)",1603805492,1,0

Dealing with social anxiety and loneliness.,"Okay first off,. I hope this post doesn't get removed for being too much of a rant. Moderators, if you were wondering, I made an alt account to post this.

I am an international student. I attended my first semester in Fall 2019 at Penn State because people said it was a very social school. I attended several club meetings and attended most events that were held around me. I tried to talk to people and form connections but nothing seemed to work out. I had a few acquaintances but all of them seemed very superficial. Over time, I gradually started spending more and more time alone, leading to me getting lonelier, which finally led to an attempt on my life. I started using vapes and getting shitfaced at parties off campus alone. The spiral just got worse and worse to a point where I couldn't go a day without self harming or crying at least twice a day.

I would like people's opinion on this because I see everyone around me having so much fun. People are smiling and seem to be having a great time. Is it just me or are other people facing similar issues? I feel like everyone is hanging out or going on dates and stuff. I feel left out completely. I don't see what I'm doing wrong because I've tried tons of times to ask people to hang out or asking people on a date when i find someone attractive. I would consider myself slightly below average but definitely not ugly (just in case you were wondering, I am bi). I would really love some input when it comes to dating and making friends in general. Also was wondering whether and where I could find someone I could cuddle with platonically. I guess that comes with the friends part but I don't know anymore.",1603596105,1,0

State College School District - Return to in person Sep 28,"Strongly suggests minimal community spread. 


Email below:

Dear Parents and Guardians:

After careful consideration, we have decided to return to in-person learning next week. This shift is unanimously supported by our health and safety team, which includes physicians, epidemiologists and our nurses. The team has analyzed the ongoing data for local COVID-19 cases and determined that we’re seeing low incidence rates in the community beyond the college-age population. In light of this information and multiple other factors, some of which are listed below, we are reopening schools on Monday, Sept. 28.

Since Sept. 1, Geisinger Health System data shows a 3.0 percent positivity rate from its 434 tests of people in the district zip codes. Out of 13 total positive cases, two were under the age of 18, and eight were 18-24 years of age.

Since Aug. 26, data from Mount Nittany Health, which includes Penn State Health, shows a 1.1 percent positivity rate from its 2,598 tests of people in the district zip codes. Out of 29 total positive cases, four were under the age of 16, and 18 were 16-25 years of age.

Since Penn State began random testing of employees, there has been only one case reported out of 700 tests.

The trend of our countywide 7-day case average has been decreasing.

One positive case has occurred from among the approximately 2,100 students and employees of preschools, daycare centers, and private and charter schools who have continued to attend school on a daily basis since Aug. 26.

In the name of safety, we have enhanced our already extensive protocols. Beginning Monday, we will randomly screen students and employees with temperature checks. Also, we will begin weekly random COVID-19 testing of employees.

In addition, we need your help to keep everyone staying safe while in-person learning continues. If children exhibit any of the symptoms from the screening checklist, they should stay home. We encourage you to take the time to conduct the screenings; they’re vital to our efforts to remain in schools. For more information, please review our health and safety plan. If your child tests positive for COVID-19, please fill out our reporting positive cases form and follow your physician’s directions. 

For Monday, in-person learning will be A-L for secondary, cycle day 5 for middle schools, and cycle day 5 for elementary schools. Should you desire to change your educational model choice, please contact your building principal. If you have specific questions regarding the health and safety plan, please contact your school nurse. 

While I am pleased students will return to buildings, this was still a difficult decision. Keep in mind, for this plan to work, our entire community must stay vigilant and abide by the safety measures in place to contain the spread of the virus. That is, please wear a mask, wash your hands frequently and physically distance as necessary.

We appreciate your cooperation as we make this transition next week. Our hope is to remain in school for as long as possible, but for now, we will continue making our decision on a week-to-week basis. Whether students are learning remotely or in-person, I’m confident our faculty and staff will be providing valuable learning experiences next week. 

Sincerely,

Bob O’Donnell

If you're having trouble with that link, try registering here: [https://iwillvote.com/](https://iwillvote.com/)

While Pennsylvania doesn't have an official early voting period like many states do, you can effectively vote early by requesting a mail-in ballot and hand-delivering it to your County Board of Elections office. You can even walk in the door, request your ballot, fill it out right then and there, and hand it back.

If you're not sure where your County Board of Elections office is, you can check here: [https://www.votespa.com/Resources/Pages/Contact-Your-Election-Officials.aspx](https://www.votespa.com/Resources/Pages/Contact-Your-Election-Officials.aspx)

If you decide to mail your ballot instead of hand-delivering it, you should send in your ballot as soon as possible. With everything that's going on with the postal service, don't risk mailing it too late and not having your ballot arrive on time.

You can apply for a mail-in (absentee) ballot here: [https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/OnlineAbsenteeApplication/#/OnlineAbsenteeBegin](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/OnlineAbsenteeApplication/#/OnlineAbsenteeBegin)

Which Team(s) Would You Want Added to the BIG 10?,"Nebraska Leadership's reaction to the BIG 10's decision to postpone the College Football season, continually evaluate a return date, and announce a subsequent restart has created an opportunity to revisit conference membership and possible conference realignment.

Which team(s) would you want added to the BIG 10?

My choices below are the frontrunners I would like to see replace Nebraska and fortify the BIG 10 as a 16 team conference.

1) Notre Dame - An obvious answer, but the 
     time to strike is now. Brian Kelly just signed.   
     an extension. Notre Dame can benefit from 
     conference affiliation, specifically, a
     conference championship game. The BIG 10 
     can provide enhanced Athletic and Academic 
     support beyond what the ACC provides 
     conference members.

2) Pitt - Pitt would solidify the BIG 10's presence 
     in the East / Northeast. Pitt would join Penn 
     State, Maryland, and Rutgers to provide 
     Athletic and Academic opportunities in a 
     targeted population base. Yes, the BIG 10 
     would poach an ACC member, but ultimately
     each school will have to make that decision.
     Realistically, an Institution would have a 
     difficult time justifying not joining the BIG 10. 
     The BIG 10 can provide member schools 
      more funding, resources, and prestige both 
      Academically and Athletically, than any other 
      conference.

3) Cincinnati - This may be viewed as a shocker, 
     but Cincinnati would immediately enter the 
     Big 10 as a more valuable asset than 
     Nebraska. Any matrix evaluating Athletics, 
     Academics, and Demographics
     (Access to Top Tier athletes and students) 
     favors Cincinnati over Nebraska. It can be 
     assumed that Cincinnati will quickly enhance 
     facilities and boost infrastructure with BIG 10 
     membership and support. (Another area.    
     Nebraska was woefully negligent of 
     capitalizing on as a BIG 10 member).

Why not let covid-19 burn?,"So where humanity is headed with climate change, the environment out of sorts, all because of the overuse of resources, I ask you, why do you care if COVID-19 Kills 200,000 people. Look, I don't support trump at all and what he's doing with COVID-19 and the containment of it, but due to the fact that were at the point were at, why not let it burn, Natural Selection take its course, and thin the herd. If this were to happen, ultimate as it was seen, the environment benefits, with pollution clearing up on a global scale due to less people existing. Sure, would the loss of such mass human life would be awful, yes, but would it be for the best of humanity so we can survive as a species and not kill the planet, yes. Plus, I predict (note just an opinion loosely based off the curve if we don't bother containing it as we are now) that COVID-19 would be over in a month. And if you are so afraid of COVID-19, stay home until it ends, if your at risk, stay the fuck home and don't go out until its safe if you are so at risk and let the people not at risk take the hit from the virus with mild symptoms and able to move on with there life. If you're so at risk even with a mask you're putting yourself at higher risk going out all because everyone else has to wear masks because of your risk factor. Point is, in the end, I feel like people aren't overreacting, there just not taking in there own facts and the bigger picture, with the fact being that valuing everyone's life when your planet is facing the brink of extinction is inevitable, is not the best path, as it'll lead to the end of humanity as a species by 2100, as Stephen Hawking predicted humanity would not live past.

"Does it get any easier after finishing physics 211, 212, math 231, and 251?","I'm a 3rd year student, second year in engineering. Im an energy engineering major. I can't seem to ever pass all my classes if I take physics and math together. Last semester I dropped physics because it was too difficult to take with math 141, this semester I'm doing it again because it is too difficult to take alongside math 251. Next semester my advisor suggested I take 2 electives, my final gen ed course (US cultures), and physics, which she says would be a good idea if it is difficult for me to make it through physics while simultaneously taking math. Then she suggested physics 211 in summer. My question is this- does the course load get harder after finishing physics 212 and all maths needed? I see that 3rd and 4th years are all major courses, which scares me a lot. If I have this much trouble taking 1 math and 1 physics together in a single semester how will I do in a semester with 15-18 credits of all math and science? I've spoken to my advisor already and she's said a lot. I figured I'd come here to hear student input. I feel trapped. Im a 3rd year student, I'm already supposed to graduate in 5 years rather than 4, and because of credits I can't change my major to something easier. And even if I could, I'd have to take 6+ years of college to complete the new major. I don't want to feel this stressed anymore. For energy engineers- does it get easier after you get physics 211-12, math 140-141, 251, 231, and MATSE out of the way, or does it become more difficult as you get into your major courses?

"Full remote student picked for a random COVID test, cannot get ahold of anyone","Hey there, I'm a fully remote UP student this semester. I let the University know at the beginning of the semester that I was fully remote, and despite that I was picked for a random COVID test.

I searched this sub and saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/iqr7m2/randomly_selected_for_covid_testing_even_though/) that said to contact 814-865-2121. On that number, a recording told me to call 814-867-5050. I have called that number three times, have waited on hold for 15+ minutes, and at some point each time, a recording would come on and say that no one was available, and to call back later.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, also in the aforementioned post, they said to fill out [this form](https://pennstate.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3I3bgSF6VDikGH3). I filled that out yesterday (again even though I have already told them I am fully remote at the start of the semester), yet again this morning, I got a reminder message stating that I must get a COVID test or I am at risk of disciplinary action.  


I'm sorry if I come across as pissed off in this, but I can't deny that I am extremely frustrated since I have told the university I am fully remote numerous times and have attempted to call them many times and I cannot get a hold of anyone.  


Does anyone here in this sub have any other contact numbers, emails, etc. that I can reach out to in an attempt to clear this up? I am really frustrated and worried that some sort of disciplinary action will be taken against me.

How was the tuition cost for students who did the 2+2 program?,"Basically guys I'm an in-state student. I go to a branch campus and I want to transfer to UP. I meet the criteria to transfer although I'm already a junior and going into my 6th semester in Spring 2021.  
I'm within the credit window because I used the alternative grading to my advantage in Spring 2020, and have a high enough GPA for my major to transfer to UP.  


I'd like to know how much of a difference in price was from transferring from a branch campus to UP. In my branch campus, I commute from home and the only billable expense I had to pay was the tuition and student fee. If I transfer to UP however, I'd have to pay for the tuition, student fee, room and board, meals, etc. which would obviously be a lot more than what I paid at branch campus. Keep in mind though like I said, I basically would have only 3 semesters of college left if I were to transfer this Spring 2021.

PS. I'm asking because there's issues going on at home and I think some space would be best, but at the same time I don't want to put a dent in my parents pockets.

Selfish UniPark student exposes everyone to covid in UHS,"* Source: My mom is a nurse at UHS.

This girl was under the misconception that if she had covid symptoms, she wouldn’t be allowed in the building, even for treatment. 

The process is pretty much as follows:

* If you have covid symptoms, you are required to do your initial medical/nurse meeting via Zoom, and then another appointment will be scheduled for treatment/testing at UHS.
* People who don’t report covid symptoms can have their initial appointment in person
* The regular staff operate with basic masks, While the covid staff are separated into another part of the building with a different entrance and pressurized rooms to make it difficult for viruses to travel through air. 
* The covid staff use face visors/shields to be way more safe while treating/testing patients
* Many of the regular staff use basic masks with patients that don’t report covid symptoms in the “safer” part of the building.

Well, this student didn’t want to do a virtual appointment, which is required for people with covid symptoms. So, she lied to 3 different clerks on her way in saying her ear hurts or something. When she and my mom were in the patient room together, she admitted that she lied about her symptoms and that she pretty much checks all the boxes for covid. As many of you know, simply wearing a mask isn’t enough for point blank range interaction with covid, and the virus can enter through your eyes on some occasions. This person walked through a good portion of the building putting regular patients and nurses at risk. My mom got sent home early today because of this and will have to quarantine. The supervisors at UHS don’t care and even blamed my mom for not wearing a face shield, even though the girl lied her way inside and exposed everyone (including other patients) on her way to the patient room. I don’t really expect some email or statement to be made by the university, so I just wanted to give everyone a heads up. This girl wasn’t reported for lying and causing danger. She was likely just reported as a +1 statistic. Sorry if this was too long",1604957192,1,0

Impersonator/Stalker problem??,"Hi Penn State University subreddit!  I know this is a bit off topic but I have a legitimate question to ask. I hope mods don't take my post down because I really don't know where else to turn to at this point.  

So my name is Melody, and I lived here in State College from 2018 to beginning of this year 2020 when I moved states.  But apparently, over the past few months I've been getting random adds on snapchat via search (meaning you have to manually search the username) from people I didn't know and didn't have mutuals with.  First off, I don't add people I don't know (let alone strangers) and I've never gotten so drunk to the point that I don't remember who I talked to.  But somehow, these random adds were saying they ""met"" me at the Brewery and that I was drunk and gave them my snapchat username.  I thought okay, maybe they were lying but considering that this has happened multiple times over the past few months with the random adds, it just can't be a coincidence.  

I'm also currently visiting in town and last night, someone randomly added and said they saw me at the Brewery and eventually gave me a description of the girl.  They said she was also an Asian girl, about 5', wore a leather jacket, corset and jeans and had little shorter than shoulder length hair.  He also said she went by the name ""Mel.""  Now, I was with my girls all night long and didn't even go close to the brewery.  I've tried various ""misspellings"" of my username but the closest possible was some guy and the other was an lsu.edu.  I've checked the actual brewey downtown by Yallah Taco, and Happy Valley but no one's seen her.  Am waiting to call like Ottos and Voodoo tomorrow when they open, but I'm genuinely freaked out and concerned as to why someone is giving out my personal info.   Thankfully, I don't know if there's anything else they're trying to impersonate (like credit card) but I wanted to see if anyone might know what's going on.",1602904388,1,0

Would you support a separate Canvas page on each class or class that allows you to express your thoughts?,"While mental health problems have always been around, they have definitely taken a spike in recent months because of COVID-19. 

**Would you be willing to support implementing a discussion forum page on each class, or creating an entire new class (doesn't affect GPA or anything else:** **NO OBLIGATION** **even if you enroll to ever use it) that is entirely anonymous in which you can share your thoughts and anything else you want to?**

**Creating a forum right on canvas improves accessibility** to a student as the mental health resource is right in someone's class. It also **normalizes mental health issues** as it's still often seen as not a real problem by many.

A support forum will **foster a helpful community in which professors and students can better understand each other** admits a horrible time. Especially since the largest complaint from professors and students is that they don't understand each other. Professors are able to post on these forums as well. Anyone can.

Also, if you'd like, you can simply request to be a friend with someone and you can remove your anonymity to that person, making a friend. This increased level of interaction can make up, at least partly, for the lack of social interaction physical classes provide.

I have struggled much of my life with mental health problems due to parental abuse, which led to physical problems and many thoughts and one attempt of suicide. I know many of you also struggle the same way. This shouldn't happen to anyone. Therapy is too costly and not very accessible and support calls never really last, it's only temporary. However, communities and friends in-person and online have helped me a lot. Especially with my health conditions. Finding someone who goes to the same college will create a stronger connection.

**Having healthier students, mentally, emotionally, and physically will lead to better education!!!** However this forum would be for anyone not just students!

Creating a discussion board on Canvas or another class is **cost-effective** because the infrastructure is already established to provide the needed functionality.

I'm seeing or at least noticing similar behaviors (stress, depression, suicide, lack of motivation) more frequently now. So it should be time to do something about it.

If you'd like to support this goal now, please consider signing the petition here:   [https://www.change.org/Help-PSU-implement-discussiong-boards-on-Canvas-for-mental-health](https://www.change.org/Help-PSU-implement-discussiong-boards-on-Canvas-for-mental-health)

Math 230H or Math 230?,"Hi all, I'm a freshman engineering major currently in Math 141H (I'm in the honors college), so next semester I might be taking Math 230H. However, I'm now starting to question whether I should drop down to 230 because I think the professor I have now is also the only one who teaches 230H, and I seem to be the only one in the world who doesn't like him (or rather his ""teaching"" style). I'm sure he's a brilliant mathematician, but he couldn't teach someone how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without making it needlessly complicated. 

Not to mention, although he gets rave reviews on RateMyProfessor, the fact that a lot of them mention how he ""doesn't actually teach you the material"" is *extremely* concerning to me. I can get away with it for now because I took Calc BC in high school, so I already know most of the material in Math 141, but I've never done anything with multi-variable calculus before, and I'm afraid that if I get this same professor again in 230H, I'm going to flounder once I get to even higher level math because I won't have the proper foundations.

Why Do TAs Have So Much Power Over Grading?,"I came from a branch campus where the TAs were just responsible for small things, like grading minor homework assignments or tasks like that where they don't have a huge impact in your overall grade for the course.

But this semester I have this one class where every grade is determined by the TAs. I get no feedback from the professor himself. Homework, lab reports, even exams are all graded by TAs. This is for a class that has 96 people. (Before you say, ""That's too many people to grade for one professor"", I had  a class with at least 120 people in which the professor and the TA (singular, not plural!) split the grading 75/25, so clearly it's possible for the professor to have more of a say in grading)

What this results in is very inconsistent grading schemes. I will get points taken off merely for using the word ""introduced"" in a lab report (nowhere anywhere was it specified that I could not use a word like this, so this is total BS), while a classmate may get points taken off for mentioning ""mobile phase"" in a notebook page without explicitly defining what it is (despite having mentioned it already a sentence before). One assignment, I will do very well in, and the very next, with putting in the same level of effort and understanding of material, I will get barely above a 50% for that grade. 

What I'm trying to say is, that the TAs are wildly inconsistent and they don't have the experience that a professor might have of teaching and analyzing undergraduate work. Yes, they have to follow a rubric, but given my two examples above, they seem to often wander outside of that rubric and make their own rules up and decide to dock points for trivial and unavoidable things. 

I can guarantee that if I were to submit the same exact thing to my professor, his feedback would be much more constructive overall and would nitpick way less. For having 100% of my grades being determined by TAs and the professor not really getting to grade anything, that is incredibly unfair.

Is it difficult to change major from Finance to Accounting as senior?,"I have already finished my junior year and still haven’t come back to Penn State yet due to the pandemic. 

During this pandemic, I’m back in my home country and doing internships. I realized that majoring in Finance at Penn State is not very ideal for my future career here. We don’t have such a strong financial field that focus on investment banking, securities, or advising, etc like in the U.S. 

As I observe the job market here, the financial jobs are primarily accounting, auditing, and commercial banking. So, I’m pretty lost and stressful now. I don’t know what I can do with the Finance degree in my country. 
Also, after 3 years as a Finance student of Penn State, I don’t feel that I’m very well prepared for a particular field. The Finance courses taught me about investment management, corporate finance, etc. but I feel like I’m a jack of all trades.  The program isn’t very concentrated on one field. Maybe it’s only my problem. 

Therefore, I’d like to ask if it is possible for a Finance major senior to switch to B.S Accounting or MAcc? If so, how many extra semesters would you think I will need? 

All suggestions and advice are appreciated!",1599844827,1,0

Corona testing info on campus!,"Since it took a while for me and my roommates to figure out what the deal was, I figured I’d share the info here. To get tested, schedule an appointment through my UHS. It will ask you to list your symptoms (if any). You can put your test reasoning: you think you’ve been exposed, asymptotic, or symptomatic testing. Within 24 hours of your test, my UHS will require you to click some consent forms under the forms tab of the site. Only takes a few minutes. Make sure pictures of your insurance card are on file on my UHS too! 
Before your appointment, you will need to set up a quest diagnostics account to receive your results. It is through pennstatetesting.com/up . You will register here using your Penn state ID (the xxx1111 style ID, not the numerical student ID). Have your insurance card with you. This does not take long at all, and if you have trouble, the nurses at testing site can help.
Testing takes place in Eisenhower parking deck. It’s a nose test, so you can eat or drink beforehand. Test takes less than a minute, and it’s not that bad. You should receive your test results within 1-2 days (they say 4 but it’s not that long). They’ll ask you to stay in your dorm/apartment for the duration of that time until you know your results.
If you test positive, you will be required to socially isolate. If you live on campus, they will move you to isolation dorms, or you can go home. The isolation period is between 10-14 days. If you live off campus, they offer you housing in isolation dorms. Obviously you can remain off campus, but if there’s issues with roommates the on campus isolation is an option. 
On campus and off campus students who test positive will be contacted by contact tracing, who will ask you who you’ve been in contact with lately. Your roommates will be required to isolate as well (although extent of it has been iffy). Pretty much just can’t go to class or do on campus stuff.

Paid user interview for Penn State students interested in mental health or psychology,"Hi there! We're the team at [Ensu](https://ensu.com/) and we're looking for Penn State students to help us with user testing as we look to build a free tool to help students with mental health.

We all go through a lot of shit in our lives, and it's super easy to feel like we're the only ones who are going through what we're going through. The fact is though that this isn't true, and there are a lot of other people who've also been through what we're currently facing, and have made it out the other side stronger. Something that helped me a lot (I've been through pretty severe depression and anxiety in the past) was the help I got from my friends at the time, even if they didn't really know exactly what to do or how to help.

We're building something to make it easier to help the people you care about in similar situations - all while being fully free!

For user testing, this will be a \~45 minute call with out Head of Product, [Chris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-robeck/), who will ask all sorts of random questions about mental health and interactions between friends, and we will compensate $10 for the call. We also have some longer term involvement options that we can touch base on at the end of the call.

If you're interested in helping out in testing, please please fill out this google form [https://forms.gle/YUWzgMkfGhtpPDjM8](https://forms.gle/YUWzgMkfGhtpPDjM8) and we'll get back to you very shortly with more information and details.

Switching from CS to IST-ISDEV. Should I do it?,"Hello everyone,

I am currently a CS major at Penn State and I am currently thinking about switching to IST. Here are my reasons...

I am currently 22 years old hitting 23 soon and I am nowhere near done my degree. Right now I may finish school in the Spring of 2023 and that's only if I take 5 CS core classes per semester which may be an overkill and may end in me failing because I rushed them. So realistically, it may seem more like Fall 2023 or somewhere in 2024. I started off as an IST major then switched to CS mainly because I heard it was a better major. 

If I switch back to IST I will be able to finish a year or 2 earlier in the Spring of 2022 since I already completed some of the requirements and have all my electives pretty much completed.

I would like to know if you all think this is a good idea? Also, if you graduated with a degree in IST were you able to find a good job afterwards and how much of a disadvantage will I be with someone who has a CS degree? I know the CS degree is a better degree, but given my current situation I am very indecisive.

Thanks for your input.",1606019198,1,0

"Roommate scammed my deposit money for apartment, is there any way to get it on her student record?","This might be a weird place to post this, since it’s not directly related to our school. But, I am very frustrated at this situation.

Here’s the situation. My roommate subletted her room next semester and took her name off the electricity account, all without letting us know. Ok, not a big deal. 

But, after I put my name under the account, the electric company told me that my roommate never paid the deposit because she was enrolled in some sort of financial aid that waived it. This was in the beginning of the semester, so she had scammed me and my other roommate from the very start. The total scammed from us is $264. 

When I confronted her about it and asked for the money back, she ghosted me. However, when my other roommate, who is an international student, texts her, she responds. After that confrontation, however, she ghosted her too.

I have physical proof that she didn’t pay the deposit, and they are also refundable if she had paid them.

Does this count as student misconduct, since we are all Penn State students? Is there a way to get it on her record? I’m not really counting on getting the money back, but I don’t want her to get off scott free.

I wanted to know if anyone could provide some insight as to which campuses are the best for my intended major and specialization, as it appears to be hard to change campuses once you’re in. Thank you! 

Additionally, I’m curious as to whether or not I should stick with bio or major in environmental science instead.

Lioncash over real cash,"I've been thinking about what ways students living off campus without any school meal plan benefit from using lioncash. I can't figure out any consistent reason to use it over just regular cash/card. Say a student's parents want to send them money, they can just paypal/venmo/transfer other ways. Then the money stays as real useful money rather than a currency that can only be used at select stores (such as on campus where there is huge upcharge on every item) and can't be transferred out of the account.

The only real use case I have is if I were to get an occasional meal at ome of the dining halls since lioncash has a discount there.

Self reported academic record issues,"Penn State is asking me to report my coursework and exams in my all my grades. It’s asking to enter my 2016-17 course work and in the option there’s a part that says “Courses/Exams were taken in - Equivalent to U.S. High School 9th-13th grade). There’s no option for 8th grade. I assume 13th grade is post graduate.

The only problem is in the 2016-17 academic year I was in 8th grade(year 9 in British school), not 9th grade. So idk what they want me to do here because i have 16 subjects in 8th grade and it’s not on my high school transcript because it’s not part of middle school. I want to report my 9th grade courses in this bracket but I entered 9th grade in the 2017-18 academic year 

Not to confuse anyone but UK schools have a different system where year 9-8th grade 
Year 10-9th grade 
Year 11-10th grade 
Year 12 (or A levels first year)-11th grade 
Year 13(second year a levels)-12rh grade

I’m also a guitarist and a songwriter, and I’d like to continue pursuing these things at whatever college I end up at. Is there a decent music / arts scene in State College? 

Some other schools that I’m considering are UVM and Umass Amherst. I’m a MA resident, and Umass’s In-State tuition is very appealing, especially compared to Penn State’s Out-of-State tuition. Are there any compelling reasons to choose Penn State over Umass despite the potentially higher price tag? 

Obviously visiting the campus would be the ideal way to get a feel for the school, but that's not feasible atm for obvious reasons. Any advice or perspective would be greatly appreciated!",1608155332,1,0
"I left my book receipt in my dorm and I'm off campus, how do I return my textbook rentals to the campus bookstore?","Firstly, when are they even due? Is their any chance I could just sort this out in person next semester, or do I have to mail them like I suspected?

Then, there is the issue of the fact If I want to print the mailing label, it asks for a stupid order number, which I don't have since I don't have the receipt. It also does not offer a way to find your order number, although the remainder email says they will tell you before its due, but of course, they are yet to do that for whatever reason, so I don't even know how to return these things.

I have asked my advisor several times about this, but I keep getting vague answers and my requirements are still not corrected on my academic requirements section.

3. Is there grade deflation?
4. PSU's rank seems to have deteriorated significantly from about 5 years ago, when it was in the 30s and 40s according to the major sources. Is there any reason for the drop, or is it just due to arbitraryness of these things?

PLEASE HELP! Do I Have A Chance Of Getting In After Bad Freshman/Sophomore Grades?,"Hey guys. Could somebody please give me some honest feedback about getting into Penn State?

Freshman Year: I did poorly in Honors English with a 74 and ended up getting kicked out of the class into a CP English class for my sophomore year. I also got a 71 in Algebra and a 68 in chemistry. I got a 91 in Italian and Biology, an 87 in history and health ed, in 88 in intro computer science, a 94 in financial literacy, and an 88 in communications literacy. Communications literacy is a graduation requirement at my school where we pretty much write essays the whole time. Overall, my freshman year GPA was a 3.1 weighted out of a 5.0 scale.

Sophomore Year: Besides the 68 in chemistry, I earned 3 As and 4 Bs. 83 in history, 85 in business, 80 in English, and 88 in Driver's Ed. My Sophomore GPA weighted on a 5.0 scale was a 3.07. My cumulative GPA from these two years combined is a 3.11.

Junior Year: I am taking Honors Latin with AP CS Principles and AP Environmental Science. I was forced to drop Italian since the new private school I transferred into this year did not offer Italian. I was planning in taking AP Italian online this year and reporting my AP score with the application. I was also gonna take high school Latin courses over the summer to go from Latin 1 Honors to Latin 3 Honors my senior year at this new private school I just started.

I will definitely raise my GPA from a 3.1 to a 3.4 or maybe even a 3.6. After raising my GPA and getting a high ACT score like a 27 to a 32, would I still have a chance of getting into Penn State? Also, would it look bad on college apps to explain that my school did not offer certain clubs that my old school offered, therefore, which is why I had to join completely new clubs like Model UN or the Foreign Language Club that my public school did not offer? Any feedback is deeply appreciated. Thanks!

Extracurriculars: Freshman Year. I did not participate in many clubs.
