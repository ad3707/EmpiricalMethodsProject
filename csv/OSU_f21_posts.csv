Something needs to be done about Basketball Courts,"For as long as I have been a student hear the basketball courts especially at the RPAC have been horrible.

Considering how big the school is you would think they would take care of the courts better considering how popular basketball is among students.  Courts being so slippery is dangerous as well. If you work at RPAC, ARC etc and have any connections try to let them know cuz its getting ridiculous. At least put some brooms out they're and let us sweep it ourselves.",1639849429,1,0

Also was wondering if students are allowed to install their own school since the dorm I’m looking at does not have it..?

Is it worth it to contact SLDS about part of a final that I felt wasn’t very accessible with my situation? I will pass the class either way.,"It isn’t my professor’s fault or the department’s fault.  I should have requested an alternate format beforehand, but because I had not been assessed in the course this way before, I had no idea what was going to be on the online portion and what was going to be on the written portion. I assumed what was tested on the online portion would be on the written portion so did not anticipate any issues beforehand. 

The part of my exam that was written was totally fine. I will pass the class either way so the final not will make or break my grade, however it is disappointing that I got a really low score on part of my exam because of these issues, as I studied like crazy for this exam to try and get a B+ in the class!

I have tried my best to keep up with my courses, but I have one class that I've fell behind in &amp; so far the professor hasn't been the least bit understanding.

I get that the last year has been rough on everyone and it's that point in the semester where a lot of people are hitting burn out. Maybe a lot of students are contacting this professor and they're fed up about it or something. I have one missed assignment &amp; I've missed a bit of class bc I had to drive my parent to their biopsy &amp; a couple of other necessities. Like, I'm an adult and I can get that some people don't care if you're struggling-but when I've tried to talk to this prof I've been told ""okay, and?"" and ""No, get out- I don't have time to talk"" when I've tried to discuss the matter.

Is any transfer student looking for on-campus housing for second semester? (repost),"I am a current freshman on the Ohio State campus living in the dorms.

Also, do you think it’s possible to take either of these courses without taking 5410 first?

How to get over my pride?,"I’m currently a molecular genetics/microbiology double major and I’m pushing myself too hard and too fast. I’m burnt out and exhausted. I’ve honestly considered dropping out a lot, but my parents are paying for my schooling and I’m too far into it at this point. I have about 4 semesters left. Or did until today. I slept through a midterm worth 20% of my grade and now have a 0, and received a 30% on the first midterm for the class. I was on vacation the entire break and our flight didn’t get in until midnight last night. Despite that, I had studied a ton and was ready for it and ready to get my grade up. My only options now are continue in the class and get a D at best, which isn’t passing because it’s a major class, or drop it and have a W on my transcript. Which would be fine but I already have a W from summer semester. I have a lot of pressure to graduate on time, and my only option now is to drop my double major. It’s what’s best, but I can’t get over my pride. I have this idea that if I don’t continue doing what I’m doing (destroying my mental health and mind) then I won’t get a good enough job or won’t be able to get a job at all. Or that I won’t look good enough to others. All of which I know are stupid, but I can’t get past those thoughts. I can’t the shake the feeling that I’ll be less “impressive” or less “worthy” if I go back to one major. Any advice is appreciated.",1634567290,1,0

Insensitive professors,"Long story short last week I found out I lost a friend to suicide. I hadn’t seen her in about a year since moving to Ohio for school but of course it still hurt like hell. I know we all get the same BS speech that if we’re going through something tell your professors, but I like to grieve in silence. I hadn’t been thinking clearly since that day, but decided to hop on Carmen after 4 days of not checking anything- to my surprise an exam was due at 11:59pm. While taking the exam I experienced some connection issues and decided to email my professor about it. The problem is I wasn’t supposed to take the exam. my professor canceled class because she was feeling sick so the exam much pushed back and meant to be taken the next week. The professor just forgot to lock it, in addition it was announced in carmen that the exam would be pushed back to this new date. While I do now recall the announcement, it wasn’t something I remembered especially with my new circumstances. I just went from crying to telling myself to focus and get some work done, since the world doesn’t stop for me and I can’t fail despite my pain. My professor emailed me back furious about the fact that I took the exam early and we have essentially been arguing for a day straight. she refuses to come up with a solution and I said she could make an alternative exam but she shouldn’t have to do that for me. paragraphs upon paragraphs about how I’m irresponsible and how much inconvenience I’ve caused her. There were also apparently questions on the exam in which she hasn’t covered yet. I explained why it slipped my mind that I was not supposed to be taking the exam even though I had no intention of telling my professor this in the first place. and surprise she does not give a single fuck. she slips in a little sorry then continues to ridicule me for not following instructions. how the hell am I supposed to feel comfortable with expressing what’s going on in my life when this is how you guys react?

Need some advice/motivation/shared experiences etc.,"Alright, hopefully this isn’t too long. But I feel lost. Ok I lied it ended up being long but I feel all the background info is essential. 

I started here in 2016. Went a full year - failed out and was dismissed. My dad died during the year so I did a retroactive withdrawal (so basically I got all my failed classes changed to a W, and kept my A and B grades) and was admitted back in in-time for Fall 2017. Failed out again and was dismissed. Didn’t come back until Fall 2019 - failed again. Yup 3 times with 2 officially failed out. My gpa was as low as a 1.7 I think. 

Once again came back Fall 2020. Took 3 classes got 1 B and 2 B+ ‘s. Alright getting back in it. Spring 2021 I took 14 credit hours and got a 3.78 and on Dean’s List. 2 more classes in the summer and got a 3.85 plus 2 more at CSCC. I successfully raised my grade from as low as a 1.7 to now it’s a 3.05 for start of Fall 21! I’m started to feel good and motivated again. 

Im technically an Economics major through the Arts and Science program but my goal has been to get my gpa up to 3.1+ and get into Fisher. I just need to do well this semester in order to get in it. All my requirements done except the GPA of 3.1. I have a lot of business classes completed while I was at CState trying to get back to OSU. Ex) marketing, business law, bus comm, stats, bus calc, idk what else. 

This semester I start to have harder classes. ACCT 2200, ECON 4001.01, Logistics 3380, CSE 2111 and international business, then couple of gpa booster &amp; fun classes in order to be full time. I start off first two weeks well: doing well on all my quizzes and homework and all that. Then my gma died 2 weeks ago. I’ve been down and fell behind ever since. I’ve now dropped 4001.01 and about to drop 3380 and will most likely drop 2200 as I’m so far behind on them now and exams are next week. 

I just feel so hopeless that I’m ever going to graduate. I’m 25 and about to turn 26 and I don’t want to be in school another 3 years and I’m dropping freshman/sophomore level classes. I’ll probably lose my financial aid by then too. Then I feel more down by looking at Spring 22 Schedule Planner and seeing practically every class in person again and I hate that because online works for me great in order to work. 

Tried to look to see if I should just actually do an Econ major through A&amp;S instead of Fisher but I’m just as behind there as I kept only doing business classes even tho I’m not even in Fisher yet. 

Since I dropped those classes, I should have a high gpa this semester and get my gpa requirement in order to apply into Fisher. But I don’t know if I’ll even succeed in it or even get into my specialization. I wanted to do accounting but I’m about to drop the first one. (I actually took it at CState in 2018 but bc I want to do the major, I’m taking it again here since it’s been so long). If I don’t get into it, I guess Econ in Fisher but other than that, I don’t know. Idk what the gpa cutoffs are. 

I have no idea how to succeed in a full time difficult course load and also work enough (I’m self employed). No clue how I’m going to graduate and I just want to be done or drop out. I don’t know which major to do. Don’t know if I can catch up in my classes in time - 3380 and 2200. Just feeling down about myself about every choice I’ve made since 2016 and dont know if I can keep doing the college life for few more years.",1632375556,1,0

Just Another Hometeam Rant,"I knew renting from Hometeam wasn't the best idea in the world, but they seem to have a monopoly on off-campus property and I couldn't find anything decent (1 bedroom) that they didn't own. So I decided to trust my luck and rent with them. 

Fast forward to now, part of my ceiling falls in the middle of the night, so i make a maintenance request and go back to bed. No response from them. 2 days later it starts dripping, so I put in another maintenance request. They send a technician out 2 days later to look at it and he tells me they'll have a plumber call me and schedule a time that works for me and the apartment above me to get it fixed. The next day I'm at work and I get a call from my security system that my alarm was triggered, so I have them send emergency services. Turns out the plumber had just let himself in without any notice or heads up, not what the technician had told me would happen. That was 3 weeks ago.

Today, I get the same call from my security system. Looks like they let themselves in again without giving any notice to me whatsoever, but at least they're finally fixing my ceiling.

I wish we could rate advisors,"I’ve got an advisor ~who I won’t name~ but I am so tired of him. He never answers my emails till I HARASS HIM 3000x or call his office and ask them to ask him OR I schedule an appointment with him and he acknowledges he saw the emails but still does not reply or give me an answer till I repeat the question 10x in person. AND THEN he talks over me in the meeting and acts like I don’t know anything, tries to pull shit over me then I call him out on it bc I did my research and he’s like “oh yea, you’re allowed to do that” after he just said I wasn’t. Shows up late to meetings (like 10+ minutes) and does not apologize. But he’s the only one who can handle certain things so I can’t just switch (I’ve got a regular advisor outside of him who is great!). Anyway, just needed to rant because I’m tired of this man. Hasn’t answered multiple emails in 2 months. I wish we could rate these advisors so they’d get some kind of penalty that incentivized them to ACTUALLY DO THEIR DAMN JOBS. Because our educations are on the line here that we are paying for so take a minute to actually care damn it. And some are great!! Super helpful! But POS advisors like this one shouldn’t be advisors because they take advantage of and make life harder for students who don’t understand the system. I’ve had a few friends think they’d have to stay an extra year or do XYZ bc their shit advisor told them so, but I took the time to look into it with them and proved their advisor wrong and saved them money + time which should be the advisor’s job 😤.

Want to donate to support some kids or find something to do this Sunday?,"Hey Buckeyes! 

I’m with a student organization called College Mentors for Kids. It’s pretty much exactly what it sounds like; a bunch of us college students spend time with kids in grades 1-5 doing activities that get them thinking about their future. At risk of sounding like I’m tooting my own horn, CMFK is a really positive thing for these kids, and I can say it’s been a positive experience for me as well!

One of the benefits of CMFK is that it’s completely free for the kids to participate, but that means the money comes from somewhere else. That’s why I want to ask for your help: if you are able and want to, please donate to my fundraising page linked below! Any amount helps you give helps ensure that CMFK can continue to provide weekly activities for our little buddies. 

[Click me to donate!](https://secure.qgiv.com/event/collegmentorsohiostate/account/1178309/)

Alternatively, CMFK is hosting a 5K fun run this Sunday on the west side of the RPAC. There's more information on the registration link [here](https://forms.office.com/r/E0fUbq7z6A). You can participate in the run for $10, and if you sign up on my behalf, half of those dollars count for my personal fundraiser (and all of it goes to CMFK of course!).

Another Sublet Post! Two open rooms,"Hey Redditors!

I'm looking for TWO subletters to take my and my housemate's place on the lease! We live in a two bedroom, one bathroom apartment near south campus and a short walk away from N. High street.

Perks:

\- dishwasher  
\- washer/dryer unit IN the apartment  
\- off street parking in the back of the building  
\- a block away from the public library and Kroger  
\- nearby bus stops  
\- relatively quiet neighbors! you will hear some footsteps and guitar playing, but nobody's throwing a rager every weekend.  
\- pets allowed! if you have a pet smaller than a cat and dog, you can probably get the pet fees waived! (for example, snake and hedgehog  
)- close to the Wex Med center!

Finances (not each. it's total):

\- $980 RENT  
\- $60 SPECTRUM (though it can be $45 if you apply as a new customer instead of paying through my account) (the building also accepts WOW)  
\- Gas/Electric/Water variable (water is charged in the Tenant portal)

This Semester is Really Stressing Me Out Bigtime (Freshman),"I just finished a CSE exam today knowing there is a good chance I did poorly. This semester has been so difficult, I keep trying to get good grades, however, my exam grades do not reflect that. I figure that there is more that I can be doing, but I feel so limited. Like I feel so stuck I don't know what questions to even ask. I have ok grades right now, for the 12 credits of classes I am taking, all 3 credit hour classes I have an 86, 87, 88, and 92. I just don't feel like that is good enough. I work part time on Sundays pushing carts at a retail store. I am also a commuter, and I live 30 minutes away. Saturday is my sort of day off, I watch/go to the game if there is one. Other than that, my week is just so demanding. I really am not in a good mental place right now either.

I worked an 8 hour shift on Sunday, after walking 11 miles pushing 750 pounds of carts, came home and studied until 3 in the morning for an Honors Macroeconomics exam, only to get a 72%. The average was 83%. I feel like an absolute loser when it comes to my grades. In high school, I took 68 credit hours of college classes at a local community college, getting an A in every class except one. And I was top 1% in my class. I just feel so disappointed right now. I am planning on sticking with it but it is so difficult. I know everyone here is going to tell me not to beat myself up, but I will lose my Maximus Scholarship if I get under a 3.2 G.P.A.

Each week we learn a different aspect of Java, but I feel like we never learn how each aspect connects to each other. Now I’m here week 12, and what used to be super simple projects and labs are now starting to become way more time consuming and difficult. The quizzes are fair, but they are also increasing in difficulty as well. I feel like it’s comparable to learning an actual foreign language straight from a textbook.",1636500657,1,0

"For the average international CS major that has a 3.3 GPA, how do you go about getting scholarships?","Hi all!

International student here. I'm thinking of majoring in computer science at Ohio State. However, it's expensive to attend for an international student. I'm thinking of applying to some scholarships to help decrease my financial burden while I pursue a rigorous education. I don't think I'm an outstanding student, so I predict that I would only be able to get average grades since there are many smart people around.

Nonetheless, I think I should still try my best to apply to scholarships. I've looked at many resources about scholarships located in the university's website as well as others.

Unfortunately, I'm really overwhelmed by all the information and need some help. Most important to me is that I'm not sure how to effectively and efficiently go about getting scholarships that suit my circumstances.

**Because of this, I would be grateful if there are any international students who are willing to provide an informational interview about getting scholarships more effectively.**",1633574937,2,0

"Y'all realize it was our USG, not just OSU admin, which ended Safe Ride?","I remember confronting the vice president of USG about this issue two years ago.

Like she saw her job not as an advocate but as another technocrat for the university. Well a few months later it came out that the same VP I talked to spent thousands of dollars on special jackets for a camping retreat so I know she was full of shit when she said USG had no more money for safe ride.

I'm 100% certain she worked the deal out with Lyft in order to get an internship there after graduation in exchange for turning safe ride into Lyft tokens.",1631498481,1,0

Need to replace iPad received through Digital Flagship for third time in two months..,"Basically the title.

Campus security,"We have to do something about the crime around campus. I know it’s hard for us to formulate something on our own, but the crime is just absurd. From robberies, to sexual assault, to straight up gunshots ON campus, this year has been a total shitshow with crime and I don’t see any higher ups actually caring about safety.

To begin, I think we need to advocate to bring safe ride back. Lyft is limited and only after a certain time and honestly, drivers have been sketchy as hell. It’s just ridiculous bc if we had safe ride, I’d like to believe that at least some of the cases will go down.

I’m also not trying to start a riot here, so if you disagree please comment and explain because I’m honestly scared for my safety.

I myself cannot come up with ideas to increase safety alone, but I think if we come together we can create something really great. I’d also like to mention that the catcalling on and off campus is gross and I genuinely fear anytime I walk off campus past 7. 

I think we can do something if we really try. I know we can’t fix crime, but we can increase security on campus, and in university owned off campus housing. 

Again if you feel I’m wrong feel free to comment but anyone who says they’re not even a tiny bit concerned with their safety is either lying or not paying attention",1631468799,1,0

Parent of Ohio State student identified as victim of yesterday’s shooting; shooting appears random and they were no interactions between the victim and suspects,"Shooting victim identified as a parent of an Ohio State student; shooting appears to be a random target

Emergency Management just sent out an email regarding yesterday’s shooting near Drinko hall. 

&gt; At approximately 5:20 p.m., police responded to the incident in front of Drinko Hall, near the intersection of N. High Street and Chittenden Avenue.

&gt; A female was walking south from W. 12th Avenue along the campus side of High Street with four friends. As she walked past a bus shelter near Drinko Hall, the victim heard a loud bang or gun shot. She looked down at her right leg because she felt pain and observed her leg bleeding. The victim, who is the parent of an Ohio State student, received medical aid from bystanders until law enforcement and medics arrived. She was transported to the hospital in stable condition.

&gt; There was no interaction between the victim and an assailant, but several witnesses observed two men immediately run from the scene who are now persons of interest.

This is absolutely awful. She was doing everything you’re supposed to do to stay safe. She was walking on the campus side of high street, with friends, during daylight hours. This wasn’t a argument that escalated. This is a random person deciding to shot someone in the leg. The fact that she got shot basically on our campus is horrifying and the lack of response from President Johnson and other administrators is telling. Praying that the victim has a fast recovery and doesn’t suffer any permanent damage.",1631465664,1,0

Disappointed in our University,"I'm a full time student (a little older than most) and a bartender of the past 5 years. I feel compelled to speak out after watching videos and seeing what transpired at the Shoe yesterday. The mask requirement at OSU - which I gladly comply with - seems like a double standard after seeing the lack of organization and public health/safety procedures in place at the game yesterday. 

At my high volume bartending job I'm expected to enforce the mask mandate for the city, I'm an involuntary gatekeeper serving public health. Then I see what is going on at the stadium and I'm just dumbfounded. I feel heavy hearted for our health care professionals who will be feeling the brunt of the uptick in cases caused by the game.

The worst part is that I don't believe that the university has the means to do better. I'm just at a loss here and feeling extremely disappointed in an institution, that I belong to, that seems to have been trying so hard to soften the blow of the pandemic, putting the community they serve at risk of infection.

TLDR: OSU seems to care more about ticket sales than public safety.",1631463172,1,0

"What happened at the south gate of the shoe today was not safe, not okay, and someone needs fired over it.","Seriously, if you weren't there it's hard to explain how legitimately scary it was. I was fighting off a panic attack for a good section of the time. It was so tightly packed that I couldn't lift my arms up. A girl near me kept saying she couldn't breathe. I saw another girl start to fall, me and another guy caught her because we were scared she was gonna get trampled if she hit the ground. 

There would be pushes forward that would nearly knock you off your feet. My friend and I got almost all the way to the gate before realizing that there was a fence -- we knew we couldn't walk around, so we ended up just jumping it. I think it was supposed to be a line forming on the other side of it? No clue.

Once we got to the gate itself, it was chaos. No one was checking tickets, people were just pushing through. At the entrance into the actual seating area, there was another pileup of people. Turns out one lady that took her job too seriously was trying to stop the flow so guards could check tickets. Literally arms outstretched, holding people back. We went around her, but she was putting people in danger.

This mobile ticketing system is not working, and I'm scared if it's still like this for Penn State someone is gonna get badly injured. OSU, please fix this.",1631417114,1,0

Worried About Failing a Class,"I’m a student in STAT 3201, and the recent midterm grades really really messed me up. I was perfectly fine on Midterm I, then Midterm II came along and I just…failed. Completely bombed the exam. Granted, our exams are curved and I’m unsure of whether the curve is currently applied, but regardless I currently have a D in the class according to Canvas. 

Going in to the last week of classes, we have only a few more assignments left. One project worth 10% of my grade, one homework assignment (worth 25% of my grade, homework is out of 5 assignments, the lowest grade is dropped and my lowest is currently an 81), and the final, worth 25% of my grade.

Of course, my plan is to nail these last assignments and give them everything I have. But my abilities in this class are not particularly strong and I’m worried about my performance not being up to par. I have no other option than to do well on these assignments, though, and I’m really really nervous.

CHEM 1210 - retake?,"So here’s my situation: going into the final exam, my grade in 1210 is a 63.

However, I’ve come to realize that med school and pre-med in general isn’t really for me. 

I’m kind of at a crossroads here. There’s a very chance that I don’t even pass 1210 when considering the final, but I have some questions:

1.	If I pass the course with a D, could I still take 1220 based off of my AP Credit?
2.	Is it worth it to use grade forgiveness to retake it again next semester?
3.	If I fail the course, is it a good idea to just suck up the bad grade and work hard to improve my GPA? Also- i can’t find 1210 on my scheduling portal, are all the seats taken?

Steven Bibyk for ECE 2020 for a CSE major,"Hi I am a CSE major and already enrolled in ece 2020 with Isabel Fernandez. However there is new course offered for CSE students which won't have labs. I was excited about it but saw that it would be taught by Bibyk whose RMP is making me change my mind. However here on Reddit the opinion by some is that though you won't learn anything, it's an easy A. since I am in CSSE. I might not care about learning ECE much. And I have heard ECE 2020 is hard for CSE students. So should I take the gamble? I am not a self learner as far as ECE is concerned so i might BS but won't be able to do good on my own.

Availability of CSE 3903: SP22?,"Hello!

I'm filling out my schedule planner for next semester (SP22), and it seems like there's only two options available for the CSE project course: Web Dev (3901) and Game Dev (3902). What happened to the systems option?  When I took survey they made it clear that we had three options, but schedule planner only shows the two. I was really excited to get to write some lower-level code :(

I'm guessing the course just isn't available/offered this upcoming semester? The most recent instance I've found a mention of online was SP19. Is it a lack of interested students? Where would I go to tell the university I'm interested?

Where can I see the status of the course? Schedule Planner doesn't seem to know that it even exists, and the Course Catalog Search doesn't mention availability.

Hoping someone more experienced with the process here at OSU could point me in the right direction for more info. Thanks!",1634271466,1,0

• Extracurriculars: Spanish Club, Tennis, Current Events, Book Club, Academic Team, Key Club, DECA

I can't stand the audacity of some of the students at OSU- some people pissed on top of my car.,"Disclaimer: This is coming from an OSU student who's working 36 hours a week in order to cover the cost of rent and a portion of his tuition. I can't stand the audacity of some of the frat- party crazed students here. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely understand how important it is to socialize, enjoy the nightlife, and have a great time. In fact, I go out all the time and go out to parties and do fun crazy stuff with people. This, however, is never at the expense of others. Last night, I got off a 10-hour shift at my job at 1:30 AM and drove back to my apartment to find that someone without a parking pass had parked in my spot- a spot that I paid $400 for. I looked around my car to see if there was anyone around who might've left their car there and checked to see if my neighbors were having a party or something so I could ask them to move their car elsewhere. My neighbor's place was quiet and it was around 1:50 AM at this point of the night. I decided to get some taco bell and then look for street parking, but then I realized that I would need a city permit in order to park there without a ticket the following morning or would have to wake up at around 6:30 AM to move my car. I had homework to do last night, so I knew I wouldn't have enough time to sleep and wouldn't make it to my car in time to avoid a ticket. At this point, I was pissed AF. I paid literally 3/4ths of my rent for a parking spot for the year and was now forced out of being able to park in it because someone wanted to have a couple of brewskis with the boys. It was around 2:15 when I swung back around to, yet again, see the same car parked in the spot. Because of this, I called the towing company and got them towed, pulled into the spot, and proceeded to head to my apartment when I heard ""Hey asshole! did you tow that car"". I simply ignored them. I had no time for any BS- I worked the next day at 10 AM and had over two hours of HW to do. As I was eating my Tacobell, I had a thought that the dude I had towed would vandalize my car. I ignored it because of my hunger. Maybe 15 minutes later, I hear a thump while sitting in my apartment. At first, I thought that it was the AC unit in my building whirring, so I ignored it. Eventually, however, the thought of someone potentially slashing my tires or breaking my mirrors made me extremely anxious, so I ran outside to check on the state my vehicle was in. At first glance, it looked as if nothing had happened to my car; no key marks or missing parts. The mirrors and tires were in good condition and there was nothing off about it. I checked the hood of my car to see if anyone threw a beer bottle or something at it, to which I saw a thin layer over the top of it. As I closely examined my front windshield, I saw that it had a bunch of droplets on it and that they reeked of urine. I decided to go to the back of my car to see if there was anything similar to see that there was a liquid dripping down the back of it, dripping from the top. Because of this, I peered above my car to see two puddles of piss ON TOP of it. I instinctively look around my parking lot for cameras to no avail, I guess my apartment doesn't have any installed in the back so it's not like I can press charges. As pissed as I was (pun not intended) I was somewhat relieved that they didn't cause damage to my car, but this had me thinking- why on earth are OSU college kids such entitled pricks. Who in their right mind parks in a parking lot with a sign that says ""violators will be towed"" and gets so mad to retaliate by pissing on top of a person's vehicle. Regardless of whether I got them towed or not, it is THEIR responsibility to park where they are allowed. Are they paying my bills? Are they doing my homework at 3 AM because they worked from 2pm till 1:30pm to pay for my rent? If not, why are they so entitled to think they can do whatever the hell they want with a service that I paid for. Screw OSU culture.
