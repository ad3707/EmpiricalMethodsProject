It's tough to adjust to an environment where you're no longer the automatic best student. But at the same time, failing your first midterm is not a big deal by any means.

"Might be a little late to this - I think the best way I'd describe Penn is as follows:

If you are the perfect student/if you manage to maintain that 3.7+ and get the right job etc. Penn will be fantastic. I think Penn as a whole is very difficult to be happy at for most people - there is an ingrained culture of cutthroat/hyper competitive behavior which can push those select few of people to their highest highs and thus serves them very well. But that is also why you see the things you've mentioned such as Penn Face and burnout - you will be surrounded by a constant and unceasing stream of friends/contacts getting high power new jobs, amazing internships etc. that linking back to my first point - will be AMAZING if you are also one of those people and extremely frustrating and depressing if you are not. I'm speaking from a combination of anecdotal experience I had and what my friends said during their time there. I was fairly well rounded while I went to Penn (graduated '18) and was a part of one of the varsity sports teams and did research etc. There were great opportunities and I had fantastic experiences with many of the professors in the school - and I'd say as a baseline that if you are someone that only cares about the pursuit of knowledge etc you will have plenty of opportunities to push that. However, if you are someone that is more realistic/pragmatic and you care for your career prospects and future like I was, you'll spend a big amount of your time stressing and worrying and those things I mentioned earlier will only exacerbate that. 
Short way to put it - if you wind up in that top 10-20% of students you'll think Penn was awesome. If you're someone that wants a more holistic community with a focus on things outside of career development etc, or you don't want to be in a position where a single semester of poor performance could weigh on your mental for the rest of your college career, I'd strongly suggest looking at another fit. I can answer any specific questions you have in PM - just let me know if there's anything else I can help with!

Good luck!",1569106892,1,0

"Bruh professors have told u to drop 2.5/4.5 of your classes.  Literally the majority of your CUs.  Many people take 5.5 CU or even 6.5 CU in extreme cases, and do fine.  I don‚Äôt mean to be harsh but you have to face reality.

Develop some better study habits.  Dropping classes every semester bc u can‚Äôt do well on the first midterm will not fly as a long term strategy.

Use the tutoring center and talk to your advisor about how to keep up with the material and do better.

Bombing a midterm is not a result of having an off day.  It is a result of not doing homeworks, not going to classes, or not paying attention in class.  Cramming does not tend to work as a long term strategy.

The primary focus of my application was, indeed, around all the activities I did at my previous institution (SGA, hospital volunteer, research, and honors activities) and how I can use the new UPenn environment to augment those activities, which I did! I also tied in some high school research to show how dedicated I have been to my work over a long period of time. Lastly, you want to be genuine! I genuinely thought that going to UPenn would help me and I believe that showed through in my app. In all honesty I don‚Äôt know what goes on in admissions and it differs case by case.

So not super personal. But its still a pretty high quality experience. Can't speak firsthand about the courses beyond the intro courses, but I imagine the class size goes down a lot.",1568086984,1,0

***Do interviews really matter?***

*Yes. Time and again, Admissions Officers tell us how helpful the interview report is as they evaluate applicants. In addition, applicants say the interview strengthened their perception of the university, and increased their desire to attend Penn.*

My personal theory is that interviews are very unlikely to sway an admit into a spot but can potentially take them out of one if something goes dreadfully wrong during the interview, buuut I really don't know anything.

I do think the second part is key--Penn hopes that interviews will sway admits that get in.",1571426706,1,0

"Alright y'all. Update time. Here's what I have learned from my first day as a Person With The PennRides App: 

1. The UX is fucking horrible. Like, when you request a ride, if you navigate away from the page, your ride disappears and you just hope for the best. It still shows you where the vehicle coming to get you is, but it'll show the ""request a ride"" button and the ""for pickups and dropoffs blah blah blah"" text. I wasn't sure if I had accidentally cancelled my ride or not by navigating away from the app. It's kind of a shit show, but I guess it works, and their ""where is the bus right now"" map is actually pretty spot-on? 
2. The shuttles become active at 6 pm, but you can only request AT SIX PM. You can't put in a request at 5:55 PM to get picked up at 6. You gotta wait 'til six. 
3. Also, if you want to pre-book a ride, it has to be two hours in advance? So, like, I tried booking a ride for 6 PM at 4:30, and I couldn't.
4. Anyway, I was confused about whether or not my request for a shuttle went through, because the app is a disaster, but I ended up just grabbing the Penn Bus West instead. It worked.

Some other good ones:

Lyns: big, oily, breakfast sandwiches and simple lunch hoagies. She loves her customers, its a shame theres so many that the line becomes prohibitive. Its outside the lower quad gate. 

Breakfast truck two doors down from Lyns: The asian lady is a sweetheart, the breakfast sandwiches are just as good as Lyns imo with less traffic, and shes got salmon burgers! Coffee is yummy too. 

Chez Yasmine: A former Wistar biology researcher whose traveled the world and brought his favorite global tastes back to this food truck. he LOVES his customers, so much that he honors them through pictures, menu item names and shout-outs. I like the couscous, but its pretty pricey. Takes venmo!

Don Memos: best burritos. Lunch line is prohibitive tho. 

Halal trucks: DRL, 46th/walnut (takes card!!!), 41st/walnut, 34th/walnut and the one across from so bol that takes venmo (!!!) (not to be mistaken with the one across wawa) are the good goods. 

My personal ""meh"" trucks: Magic Carpet, the indian food truck (for a samosa fix), the mexican food truck by the quad. I like Schmear it, but its way too expensive for their tiny ass bagels. 

Didn't like: Hemos, that giant green food truck next to schmear it, mexicali. Was also told to avoid yuckee.

it is hard in the sense that it will be difficult to find a ""data scientist"" opportunity. titles and job responsibilities are stupidly vague in the industry (FB infamously calls all its analysts ""data scientists"") but what I mean by ""data scientist"" is a more technical, engineering-focused role where you actually spend time building models. there is a lot of demand for data analysts regardless of your education level. these roles are usually much less technical, more reporting-heavy, and include little theory or model-building. for proper data scientists the easiest way to open the door is to have either a higher degree or a lot of experience. then one level up is research-level data science, where you absolutely will be wanting a phd.

"Hmm, I was assuming let's say you don't get your ideal recitation and it's alternate which you put in the 2nd ranking. Would it not be better/safe to put another recitation and alternate let's say at place 8 (after your main selections) so you can at least get into the lecture? Afterwards, you simply have to wait for a spot in your ideal  recitation to open up rather than have to wait for the lecture to open up. I'm not too sure how the AR process works, but I assume it's simply randomly picked order of students and the computer goes through every person's ranking sequentially I.e. first random person's first/alt choice, second random person's first/alt, etc. --&gt; reshuffle students ---&gt; first random person's second/alt, second person's second/alt.

"We even talked about this in the medical school. My classmates who went to undergrad explained it to me, and also noting the string of suicides here. It‚Äôs where ppl put on a look that everything is fine, even if it isn‚Äôt. I have definitely seen this culture at Penn, especially with undergrads, and to a lesser extent, its diffusion to grad/professional schools. 

It‚Äôs a stark contrast to my state school undergrad, where nobody gives an f what others are doing. You just do you. Here, it was a weird adjustment seeing how everybody watches everybody. People put on an appearance, and I‚Äôve noted ppl put on an appearance even if things are fine, they just have to maintain a certain image. I have certainly adjusted my comportment. For better or for worse, I am not sure.

For example, a simple question about what profession their parents do - back home ppl just say it. Here, and idk why, but ppl skirt around these types of personal questions. I‚Äôm interested in them and how they grew up, and love meeting all these cool ppl here with their back stories and how they got here, but for some reason ppl are very secretive. Most are unwilling to put themselves out there cause it can lead to vulnerability. People are also afraid to fail, cause many have never truly failed. 

I guess if you put all your information out there, including your hopes of getting into a competitive specialty, and then later on, you get a bad step score, and match into family medicine - not cause you wanted to - you can‚Äôt backtrack later and say, FM was your desired specialty all along. I have seen this happen. 

Optics is certainly a forceful concept I have learned since coming here. It is certainly not a bad thing to conduct good optics in professions like being a physician. To a certain degree though, the extent is kinda weird here tbh. 

This is just an opinion of mine. Idk what you undergrads think. I came from a totally different undergrad culture big on sports and too big for anyone to care what others are doing. Transitioning to med school here was a little bit of a shock honestly. Interactions with many undergrads, esp pre-meds was even a bigger shock. I really do see Penn Face here.",1573425068,9,0

"516 is a good course that often covers some niche topics that are not highly emphasized in other electrodynamics classes. As a result, a lot of the material does not explicitly require 361/362 background knowledge. Many of the basic concepts of 361/362 will be covered in more detail/faster in 516 (but this may come at the cost of not thoroughly understanding the basic material). 361/362 was taught by Gene Mele during my time at Penn, and even now through graduate school I think those two classes were the most thoroughly well taught classes (physics or otherwise) that I've ever taken. If you want to be a physicist, 516 will give you facility with tensors (which you may also gain by taking Vijay's GR class or one of the QFT courses if you want), but it may leave you lacking in some basic E&amp;M knowledge if you decide to completely forgo the undergraduate sequence. The grading of 516 also has a reputation for being slightly not generous, but I'm sure you're familiar with Nelson's grading schemes, having taken a class with him already. 

Regardless, 516 will be fun, and Phil Nelson is a wonderful lecturer with a ton of energy. At the very least get a copy of his E&amp;M book (not sure if it's publicly available but I'm sure if you just ask him he'll provide it to you).

"2 weeks should be fine. I think the problem here might be how you review then.

When you do ""every practice problem"" what does that mean? My routine was to acquire every single problem I could (all homework, all lecture questions, all textbook questions etc.) and treat them like a giant test. I'd work through them all in exam conditions (no help, no checking notes, nothing) and if I got any wrong I'd have a good student/TA explain it to me until I understood it.

When you ""read over notes"" what does that mean? For me, I only ""knew a lecture"" when I could deliver it myself. If you put me in a room with a whiteboard and someone else, and I couldn't teach them the concepts of the lecture, I didn't ""know it""

You don't need to do everything I did (realistically I only did it for the subjects I struggled in), but I think it's worth being honest about your test prep process.

"Gotcha, thank you. This doesn't make me feel like there is a different process for M&amp;T--much more likely that these people were matched up with an M&amp;T alum volunteer. 

This comment from this thread specifically says that most questions came from the Penn Alumni website, which are the same questions that I posted in the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9xyhli/penn_mt_interview/ea1x11p/

For context, here's how interviews work. Every region has interview coordinators, whose job is to notify alumni volunteers that they have been assigned an interview. Alumni volunteers note how many interviews they would like to do (for example, I say three per application cycle). The coordinators use this info to try and match applicants to interviewers based on availability and fit (school to school). I usually get matched up with people in the College, but at times I've had people from other schools too. 

You not getting an interview and someone else getting theirs soon can happen for multiple reasons. Perhaps you were assigned with someone who only wanted to do a few interviews but was assigned many. Perhaps you were assigned to someone who likes to space out their interviews and may have saved you towards the end of the interview cycle. Perhaps you haven't been assigned anyone yet because all volunteers have had their quota met, and you are one of the odd ones out that they may try to assign during the ""superhero"" part of the cycle (towards the end where they recruit volunteers from all over the country to do phone/video interviews with applicants). 

Either way, I see zero reason to change what I first told you:

Getting or not getting an interview has everything to do with available volunteers and nothing to do with quality of the application.


Also, not getting an interview will have no bearing on whether or not you get in. Hoping you get one, and there is still time, but I suggest chilling about it as there is zero reason to worry about this (and there are so many stresses during senior year as is). A good interview will not get you in, and if you are rejected, it won't be because you didn't have an interview.",1574482334,1,0

"Hi! I'm a Mathematical Econ major. Math Econ is intended as preparation for advanced graduate work in economics, which is fairly math intensive. If that's something that potentially interests you, then you should continue working your way through the calculus sequence and see if it's a good fit.

There's not really any point in doing it if you're not interested in grad school. If you just really love math, you're much better off doing a math and econ double major (or some combination of major and minor), because you'll be far less restricted in the classes you have to take and can pursue your interests. Math Econ restricts the econ electives you can take (to just the quant ones) and you can only pick math electives from a specific list, of which only a few are actually in the math department. So you're unnecessarily restricting your academic freedom with Math Econ, unless you know that those classes are what you want because you really want to go to grad school. 

Btw, if you do love math so much that you do the double major, you'll still be highly qualified for grad school. Math Econ is just a more targeted way to get there and save a bunch of credits. 

Also FYI in case it's relevant, math Econ counts as a STEM major for visas for international students, which would be a reason to do it over just econ alone.",1576683887,1,0

"rule #1 of investing: take risk but avoid ruin.

rule #2 of investing: if someone tells you to invest in a particular stock or a particular financial instrument, it's probably worthless advice. If they're so confident in what they're saying, they wouldn't be telling you, they'd be pouring their own money into it and making piles and piles of fat stacks of cash.

--------------

Academics: you want the key economic concepts. You're free to take econ classes but they're not necessary to get the really fundamental stuff.

You want to have a strong grasp of these things: opportunity cost, inflation, interest, concept of equilibrium, capital vs. labor, market structures (e.g. perfect competition vs oligopoly vs monopoly), market failure, public goods &amp; externalities,  supply and demand for different market structures, elasticity, basics of game theory (prisoner's dilemma, nash equilibrium, dominant strategy).

Then, some investing-specific stuff: what is a financial instrument, difference between asset and liability. common types of financial instruments: stocks, bonds. understand that bonds are essentially debt. Maybe take ECON 246: Money, Credit, Banking for a very academic view of things. 

--------------------

from a personal finance perspective: read Ramit Sethi's _I will teach you to be rich_. Buy the actual book, don't pirate it. I know it sounds like a scam based on the title but the advice is good. Nothing new to an experienced investor but if you're completely new to investing like I was when I first read the book, you'll find it helpful.

"Actually I knew I wanted to be premed from the beginning. My point is that penn premed classes require a lot of time. Definitely more time than at a less competitive school. Even if I did CS and premed at some other school I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôd get a lighter workload and not have to worry about the curve as much.

Main idea: premed at penn is more work than other less competitive universities. Provides questionable edge in the application process.",1575589799,1,0
"Most people would recommend applying directly to the school you want to enter. Honestly I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôd even want to be going though a bunch of hoops just to get to the program you desire rather than simply applying there directly. If you‚Äôre truly interested in engineering, your essays will probably be better with it in mind anyway. The SEAS acceptance rate is certainly low, though.

Based on what people say on this sub, transferring out of the college and into wharton is very difficult and exclusive, so I‚Äôd assume the same goes for transferring to SEAS (at least to an extent). 

I‚Äôm pretty sure you can do an uncoordinated dual degree in the college and SEAS, which may be easier to be accepted to as opposed to transferring to SEAS. It would definitely be a very demanding course load though if you were to pursue the dual degree.",1575589348,1,0
"Double majoring with cis definitely changes the ballpark. Did you initially wanting to combine cis and biology in order to pursue that computational biology research path, but you changed your mind and you just want to go to med school now? 

Cis is really tough here, so I get how your perception of pre-med was affected by it. Overall then, doing pre-med at Penn shouldn't be too bad with a single major (or even two science-related majors). A second tough major though, like cis, can really make it more challenging and possibly a more negative experience.",1575588663,1,0

"I think the main thing to keep in mind is also that I took on a non traditional course of study with a double major in cis and bio. I‚Äôm sure if I just did a single major that was more humanities based like HSOC I‚Äôd be singing praises about being premed at penn since there‚Äôs more time to focus on the science classes. 

One path that not many ppl really look into is PhD/grad school. The natural thing for me would be computational biology and the research opps I‚Äôve gotten make a strong case for pursuing that path. 

But I want to cut ppl for a living so premed it is.",1575585458,1,0
"Kind of off-topic, but since you slightly regret doing pre-med here, is there any other path/major you would have wanted to pursue or just thought would have worked better for you?",1575584356,1,0
this was very helpful thank you. I do not have any engineering related ECs just many math and science ones such as tutoring and honor societies.

"Those statistics in a vacuum are fine but your extracurriculars and essays and recommendations are going to be at least as important - if you want someone to chance you, you'll have to give more details.

"Exactly. Blaming the stress of an individual on the framework and culture of the university is purely harmful to the self. If you‚Äôre feeling depressed or lonely, there are actions you need to take to find freedom from that. Sure, the context of one‚Äôs environment has an impact on the emotions they feel, but blaming exterior sources for your own stress removes your own actions from the equation. Finding happiness and fulfillment requires personal action and blaming your problems on the culture at Penn rather than considering your own responsibility is dangerous. 

No one should blame their stress purely on themselves, but they should consider that person actions do have different impacts on the emotions they feel. It‚Äôs not all the fault of others.",1575554946,1,0

"Your GPA is what matters and, at penn, classes are graded on a curve, effectively meaning your percentile rank in the class determines what grade you get.

The saving grace is MCAT in a sense. For penn kids, you don't have to work too hard to get a 90th percentile score provided you did decently in your premed reqs. For less competitive schools, you probs have to invest more time into content review since classes may not cover all the materials. on a fun note, I've seen research done by my profs here show up on mcat exam passages (and they usually teach us that stuff which is cool).",1575510831,1,0

Doing both would be a great way to get bad grades and burn yourself out before the fall semester even starts. 

In regards to the question about what school year it is considered part of, I'm not sure.

You'd end up with about $4,000 in loans. Also, if you're not classified as ""highly aided"" then they straight up won't give you a grant, so make sure they classify you as highly aided first.

Weekly labs involve doing a bit of computational work in class then going on to do work on your own time for the rest of the lab, usually involving an excel graph/chart. Two tests and quizzes in class that are pretty much what you'd expect. Honestly I didn't like it because I had already taken AP Environmental Science and the course felt like a rehashing of that, so unless you're an ENVS major/minor if you've already taken AP Environmental Science I don't recommend taking it. Other than that the class is decent, last year a TA taught for a couple of weeks since the main professor was out but the teaching style was overall pretty good, imagine a lecture course but with less participation. If you're interested in Environmental Science and haven't taken a lot of courses on it in the past I'd say go for it and see if it works out for you, but if not then there's other courses to fulfill the sector requirements and foundational approaches it fulfills.",1577662170,1,0

"Ghrist is one of my favorite professors. Homeworks are lots of challenge problems, but the grading isn‚Äôt too hard. The exams don‚Äôt allow cheat sheets, but you get tested on the big idea as opposed to algebra tricks designed to get in the way, as in most math department courses.",1577628016,1,0

General idea is that classes graded on a curve are easier to get higher grades in during the spring because less people are taking it. But content wise usually the classes are the same.,1577550049,1,0
