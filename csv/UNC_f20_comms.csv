"Out-of-student here! I honestly don‚Äôt feel like reading an essay and I‚Äôd say be careful when sending stuff via Reddit. However; I‚Äôll give you some advice and hopefully as your looking through your application for probably the millionth time it‚Äôll provide you some insight.

Getting into Carolina as on OOS student is hard but you don‚Äôt have to be exceptional to stand out amongst in-State students. When writing your essay make sure that it is authentic. When it comes to the application for OOS students, Carolina focuses more on authenticity: show them through a story who you are, the things you‚Äôve experienced in your life that gave you your unique characteristics. Second, it‚Äôs probably too late for this but make sure you have a lot of community service hours and passionately speak about them and any leadership positions you‚Äôve had. The University is very big on public service and wants to create citizens who will serve the NC Community. Also,  consider mentioning something about  North Carolina- what you like about it.",1603055168,1,0

And what you said about GPA is a relief, I guess I was just so caught up on what my midterm grade meant about my understanding of 210, which still is true, but I guess in the end it's just a grade. Even if I don't do so hot in this class I'm going to make sure I understand it.

I definitely need to do more research on grad school and reevaluate what I think of cs in general, and also decide if I want to do grad school.

"The only reason not to do this, in my opinion, would be if the change affects your ability to graduate on time. If not, I say go for it. 

I guess another factor to consider is whether the major will give you more than just fulfillment in the moment. Will it lead to some level of marketability to help you get a job when you graduate?

"I've used it a bit.

To be honest, most of the videos I've seen are kinda boring, they're basically monotone training videos, but even so they are still pretty valuable. If you want to get anything from them, you should definitely try to make notes or follow along by doing what they're doing.

LinkedIn Learning is definitely aimed at professionals which is nice in some ways although negative in others. This mean that there's a lot of very applicable courses, often stuff that university classes might not cover much of, like for example, using React.js, AWS, and Node.js (stuff barely touched upon if at all in COMP 426 despite being widely used). However, topics that are a bit more academic, like advanced mathematics and say compiler construction (stuff I'm personally interested in) is hard to find.

"Can only speak to my grad program:

1) Yes - they have predetermined seat counts for the cohort. For example, all of the incoming class, save a handful of people, have to take our core courses, so the seats are determined and allocated accordingly (e.g if we have 200 people coming, there's 200 seats). For my specific concentration, our required courses that are usually for us-only have the seat count for our size. Electives can be more of a moving target for seat counts - depends on the professor, department rules, etc. - I've been in ones with 15 people and ones with 50 people. 

2) For core courses and concentration-required courses, etc. yes scheduling is set up in tandem so you aren't creating conflicts - sometimes the times aren't lovely (here's looking at you, current 8am class) but that's how the cookie crumbles in grad school. My core courses were usually MWF, my concentration courses have usually been TuTh. The Friday classes are almost always (for my program at least) morning ones because even the faculty want to be done by noon!

3) Only time there's potential for competition/space issues is for electives --  99% of the time in my experience it's way less competitive -- some really popular elective courses can fill up, but 50/50 chance if it's that popular the prof might expand the seat count (if they're okay with that, can maybe hire on a TA to help) anyways. Additionally, if I want to take an elective that is another concentration's required class (ex. I want to take a stats class that's required for the stats people), they get first dibs and I have to hope the class still has space. Sometimes that works out, sometimes not.",1602044134,1,0

"&gt;the great times had jumping over fires.

I did volunteer work at the Orange County EMS medical station in Hill Hall for a couple Halloweens and also for the two NCAA games in 2017 and I saw the aftermath of that tradition - students screaming in pain with third degree burns on their arms, legs and hands. Getting drunk and attempting to jump over a fire is a mistake you will regret for the rest of your life.

What company is it?",1602018961,1,0
"I'm a sophomore, and I'm starting to apply for internships for the first time. It's super early but there's at least company that's pretty seriously interested in me, probably will be others since I applied for basically every CS internship in North Carolina, and I'm a bit ahead with classes plus have some personal projects.

Honestly I wished I applied for as many internships as possible as early as possible. I know two students who applied for STEM internships (CS and engineering) in high school and actually got into them. These two students are very smart and talented, but honestly not exceptionally so, like mastery of CS1 level of programming. But they applied for everything they could and eventually one company bit.

Internships are pretty much a numbers game. It's worth it to apply for all internships you can take imo, even if you figure you're pretty underqualified. If you fail, but apply again next year, that won't go against you; if fact, *it may even go in your favor* since companies like to see persistence and growth and see you coming back as a sign of genuine interest. In any case, getting practice with the process is good.

Also there are a fair amount of internships that are aimed at freshies/sophomores, definitely look into those. Someone mentioned Google, I think Microsoft also has a program for people who are new in CS, and also SAS has something similar. There's a lot you can research online for more.",1602018632,1,0
"Also you probably shouldn't be transferring to one that's going to be open. If UNC isn't open, I'd be wary of the judgement of any school that is. Take a semester off if being on campus is important",1602018319,7,0

"I interned at Amazon this summer and got a return offer - I am a senior now. I would suggest going to career fairs to talk to recruiters (virtually nowadays).

Most people don‚Äôt get internships until the summer between junior and senior year, but it‚Äôs not impossible - Google has a STEP internship just for freshmen and sophomores. A lot of companies in Raleigh like to recruit at UNC as well.

If you want to prepare, I would say get to know professors as references, talk to Stephanie (the UNC cs career development person). She is great. And have a nonempty github with a few projects of yours. And attend a few hackathons. Right now you don‚Äôt (I‚Äôm guessing) have much experience, so your resume will look a lot better with personal projects and hackathons - they show initiative and passion.

"The class is designed so that you can do poorly on exams and still come out with a decent grade. That‚Äôs why each exam is only worth 10% of your grade. Almost half of your final grade is based on things that you‚Äôre expected to earn 90%+ on (studio is 30%, HW is 10%, lecture questions are 5%). So while a low exam score may scare you, if you‚Äôre simply completing the rest of the course, you‚Äôll still likely end up with an ok grade. 

Also, the email not only pointed out the bell curve of the scores, but also this it was consistent with the historical average. That‚Äôs the main reasons for not applying the curve. Dr. Young specializes in physics education, meaning he‚Äôs been collecting data from scores from the class for many years, and knows that ~70 average will result in a final grade distribution which he feels is fair.

My favorite things to do when I have a guest in town:

‚Ä¢ Tour of campus. If you don‚Äôt know it already, look up the lore for Old East, the Old Well, the Davis Poplar trees (there are three), the David Poplar kissing bench, and the dunce hat over Wilson Library. I also like to take them to the Student Store because it is truly magnificent. In the spring it‚Äôs worth walking through the arboretum. Finish with a stop at the UNC Basketball museum and then pop into the Dean Dome to quietly watch a bit of men‚Äôs basketball practice. Go Heels!

‚Ä¢ [Maple View Farm Ice Cream](https://mapleviewfarm.com/). I didn‚Äôt like ice cream until I had it here. It‚Äôs impossibly delicious, creamy, and you can spot the dairy cows right across the road at their farm. It‚Äôs a pretty drive out there. After getting ice cream I love to drive around White Cross and show off the gorgeous countryside that‚Äôs just fifteen minutes outside of campus.

‚Ä¢ Other great bars: Goodfellows, Back Bar, trivia at Linda‚Äôs, Steel String, Vecino 

‚Ä¢ Dine at [TOPO](https://www.thetopofthehill.com/), a Carolina institution. Point out the back of the menu and explain what rushing Franklin is. Show your own videos and photos and mems of the great times had jumping over fires.

‚Ä¢ Other notable restaurants: Al‚Äôs Burgers (once named the best burgers in America), Mediterranean Deli, Acme Food &amp; Beverage, Kitchen or Bin 54 for fancy/expensive/celebratory dinner, Carrburritos, Backyard BBQ Pit in Durham for some deeeelicious Carolina-style bbq, and COOKOUT (world‚Äôs best fast food in my opinion, do not miss getting a milkshake ‚Äî you can combine any flavors together to make a dream shake!).

‚Ä¢ [Ackland Art Museum](https://ackland.org/about/). This is a cool art museum that often gets overlooked. William Hayes Ackland originally wanted to donate money to Duke for the museum, but put in his will one stipulation: for Duke to get the money, they‚Äôd be required to bury Ackland at the museum. They declined. Carolina, a fine public institution with great appreciation for donors of the arts, offered to take the money to build a museum *and* bury Ackland there. After years of litigation, it was approved, and the museum was constructed. So when you enter the museum, immediately on your left you‚Äôll see his golden tomb. Pretty neat!

‚Ä¢ Carrboro Farmer‚Äôs Market and Weaver Street Market/Carr Mill Mall

‚Ä¢ Go treasure hunting at Community Works Thrift Shop in Carrboro (not the Chapel Hill one, which is vastly inferior)

‚Ä¢ North Carolina Botanical Garden

‚Ä¢ Do yoga with goats at [Spring Haven Farm](https://www.springhaven.farm/)

‚Ä¢ See a new movie for dirt cheap at Regal Timberlyne Theater or relax in style with wine and dinner (for more money) at Silverspot Theater

‚Ä¢ Spend a day renting electric scooters in downtown Durham. You can also learn axe throwing at Urban Axes (look up requirements like closed toe shoes ahead of time), play vintage arcade games at Boxcar, visit the many breweries, or visit the Sarah P. Dook Gardens. You can also scooter around Raleigh if that‚Äôs more your scene and see all the historic homes! Raleigh‚Äôs bar/restaurant scene is really good, too.

‚Ä¢ Attend a sports game ‚Äî we do have sports outside of basketball and football! They‚Äôre often very cheap or even free to attend, and still great energy. We have some of the best teams in the nation.

‚Ä¢ Take a [pontoon tour](https://jordanlaketours.com/) of Jordan Lake, or simply drive around the beautiful area. Eno River State Park is also gorgeous.

You're right to wonder why this class is required. If you're not interested in machine learning or one of a few other specific CS topics that use probability heavily, you'll probably never use the stuff you learn in STOR 435 again.

"&gt; You indicated that I *do* have control because I have the choice to not attend this university this semester. However, I can flip that around and say professors *do* have control because they can choose to not work this semester if they feel unsafe teaching in the classroom. While the professors' choice does affect their income, as a student I am paying for a service and they can choose whether or not to teach 

So u/pfdanimal covered this in his comment, but that's not quiiite the same equivalence (I have a closs relationship with my professors and graduate students/some of my friends are in graduate school rn) since it doesn't quite work that way/it's not that straightforward/if it did it would possibly lead to a situation where you have basically no on teaching or severe teaching shortage...which would not only be the same thing as one student taking the semester off, but a bunch of other students not being able to get classees as well.  


Then there's also the issue with orange county area housing and on campus housing, which again is not so straightforward in a spring semester.

In your case though:

 

&gt;For some of the other things you mentioned, it would be silly for me to take classes outside of my field because I only have one semester left and need the courses I have left to take. So, I guess, my choice then is to skip the semester completely or attend zoom university despite paying to go to an in-person school (so it doesn't seem that I have much control as a student after all).

You're basically at the finish line! I know it's hard but it's also one more semester and you can just be done. Even if you can't do it, delaying for the next semester while you recuprate isn't so bad; all hope is not lost (at least /I/ hope not since I ended up in a situation where I need to delay graduation because of my covid so I just should have taken off in the first place lolol).   


Another explanation as for ""why"" they're possibly doing it remotely: so from talking with the math department,  they're expecting some of the lower classes (ie calculus) to possibly need in person stuff but by the time you're a junior or senior you should be basically able to learn independently so they're expecting upper division courses to be online. I would agree with this logic; I think it makes more sense for juniors/seniors (non natural science majors) to stay home as opposed to freshman (and maybe some sophomore) who sometimes....can't (for various reasons; including housing related).  


Again, I agree there are basically no good options but unfortunately this is kind of the world we live in. :/  And reopening some things that could be argued to be redunant/unncessary might make a bad problem worse.",1604158327,1,0
"&gt;I am sorry to hear you got covid, and I hope you are feeling better now. I can imagine that if you get covid, staying on top of schoolwork would be very difficult (if not impossible).

Thank you! One of the annoying things is that there were some people that were kind of unsympathetic (both fellow students and professors ignoring my emails; hence the dropping to part time studies) so this was refreshing!   
Yeah; that's basically exactly what happened. In one of my classes (one of the classes I kept lol because the professor is being flexible because they were understanding; shoutout to the STOR department!) there are 3 straight weeks where I didn't submit any homework. The brain fog was so bad that I literally have not a single clue what happened/no recollection of that period. I know I sent an email during that period to the professor and he responded with flexibility but I stg I don't actually remember doing it lol.  
So the thing about the virus is that it's kind of a crapshoot: for reference, I do have asthma which is (possibly?) a risk factor for your reponse. But in basically all other categories I'm considered to be low risk: I'm in my early 20s, I'm female, my BMI is on the lower end of normal, decently athletic. I still ended up getting hilariously sick; first with the covid and then resulting pneumonia, I was coughing up not an insignificant amount of blood and I was oscillating between sleeping a ton and not sleeping at all (because of vomitting and so on). Then I was on medications that in and of itself gave me really bad brainfog so taking classes (especially online) was kind of a big ??????? for a whole week.  
I tried really hard to save one of my classes but it was REALLY difficult to get a hold of one of my instructores so I just ended up dropping it, as well as another one I had to sacrifice to reach part time status (even though I wanted to keep it).  


My advice: Take easy classes. so if you plan on taking in person classes at all, you are at risk (or if you're around family members who still work---which was my case, or you're still going out and so on, or if you need to work in perosn yourself.) If you do get sick, you could have mild symptoms or no symptoms or the aftermath of it could come well after the fact (for me the first little bit I was just a little sick, just felt like allergies---the pneumonia was really screwd up, though). Or you could really get sick right at the gate. It's kind of roll of the die.  
Don't risk it with harder classes (I know this is kind of hard to control if you're a junior or a senior in a hard major and need to knock out some hard classes to graduate, which was my case). If I could do it again knowing what was to come, I would have started on part time studies; or I would have taken easier classes with professors I knew for a fact were understanding and repsonsive.  
If you can avoid it, you don't want to mess around with your GPA/degree completion/etc, so take the next semester easy.  


 

&gt;I think I am just frustrated because students seem to have no control whatsoever.

I definitely understand this feeling for sure; in my case it was a total crapshoot whether my instructor would actually respond to my emails and work with me. I kept my STAN classes because both of them were really responsive and flexible. But there were so many factors that were really out of my control and there was nothing I could really do about it.  


 

&gt;I guess where I'm coming from now is that UNC said some classes will be in-person, and NC does seem to be opening up a lot more. While we are not in a really different place now then we were at the beginning of the semester regarding covid (eg not having a vaccine and cases are rising), I don't understand how the entire cs department decided to be remote-only.

I think it's because CS (as well as math, and STOR) is one of the most straightforward to do remotely without it being horrible (rip natural science majors and their labs). As far as the opening vs not opening, this is probably a result of like.....NC in general kind of half assed stuff (partially due to political polarization, and politicization in general). I have family in NZ and Aus and things are basically normal now. This is one of the cases where we need binary logic: you go full balls to the walls, or you don't.  This could have been easily taken care of with some temporary unpleasentness ; ie like ripping the bandaid off real quick, but that's kind of....not what we did. We're doing a slow wax which prolongs the pain.  


So now as students and young people we're basically held hostage by our boomer administators and the BoG. The decision in the beginning of the semester to reopen (but not test? and 3 ft apart? and no singles) was lolworthy, and resulted in something extremely predictable.  One step forced forward, and then several steps hella backwards.  


One of my STAN tutors was able to predict that it would take a lot longer (and thus he set aside funding to delay graduating on his PhD in case) than people were saying, explicitly \*because\* of these reasons (DM me if you want more details on that by the way/ if you're interested in covid models at all or like statistics).

In order to ensure more equitable access to upper division computer science courses, the department will be putting into place mechanisms to ensure that all declared computer science majors that have not completed their major program of study are given a chance to register for 2 upper division COMP courses before any student is allowed to register for 3 or more upper division COMP courses (i.e., beyond COMP 311).

It sounds like if even a single declared major decides that they only want to take just one COMP course that semester, everyone else has to wait before registering for more than two.

"I completely agree that zoom is more work for the professors and tas, so I do not think these choices are being made out of laziness (at least I hope not).

"Thanks for your reply, I appreciate hearing different perspectives. I, for the most part, do agree with everything you said (professors deserving to have control over their own lives, potential lawsuits if UNC does reopen, no good solution to the current situation, etc)

You say that we will reopen when 'people feel safe again'; I cannot support this mindset because it is not a concrete measurement (are we going to take a national poll to determine when everyone *feels* safe?) and it has the potential to last years (which cannot happen because it will cause irreparable damages to people's lives and to the economy).

For some of the other things you mentioned, it would be silly for me to take classes outside of my field because I only have one semester left and need the courses I have left to take. So, I guess, my choice then is to skip the semester completely or attend zoom university despite paying to go to an in-person school  (so it doesn't seem that I have much control as a student after all).

You indicated that I *do* have control because I have the choice to not attend this university this semester. However, I can flip that around and say professors *do* have control because they can choose to not work this semester if they feel unsafe teaching in the classroom.

"&gt;
I think I am just frustrated because students seem to have no control whatsoever.

A much higher percentage of instructors are likely to be at risk, have someone in their household that is, or have childcare issues than students. Students can make individual choices about what works best for them, but instructors' choices affect students. You do have control - take classes outside your field if you want to be in person, or try to find a way to make zoom work for you, or take a semester off if this whole shit show isn't for you. But instructors need to have control over their lives. If they are forced to be in a classroom when they aren't comfortable, you're not going to have any better of an experience than if that course were online. The whole situation sucks for everyone and there is no good solution. 

&gt;In addition, I do not understand when UNC can actually decide to go in-person (is it just when there is a vaccine, and what if there is never a vaccine?)

When people feel safe again... So not anytime soon. The second they require those in risk groups to teach in person is the second they get hit with a pile of ADA lawsuits...which will cost more than the lost of tuition, room, and board income of students who choose not to come. I am optimistic that there will be a vaccine, maybe even widely available before next fall, but until there is, they shouldn't return to in-person overall. It sucks, but do you really want to risk being responsible for someone else's serious illness or death?",1604095971,1,0

Staff on edge called 911.

Then police take it seriously because someone said weapon on campus. Alert Carolina goes out. If dickwad was actually there, he runs immediately. Police secure the area, and since they know who dickwad most likely is, they call the ""all clear.""

It's really hard for those of us from what I'd call traditionally non-academic and non-overly rigorous backgrounds to excel at a school like UNC, but it's so worth it in the end being able to setup that legacy better for your future children's success in school (if that's something you plan to one day have).

It's most common (like higher than 80% of people who go to talk to a professional) for people to be uncomfortable and not open up much in the first handful of sessions.

Sometimes they do it by just being patient and letting you decide where you're comfortable. Sometimes they ask questions to prompt the conversation.

"Hey, as someone who was depressed pretty much all of high school, I really really need you to remember this: you do not have to give 100%.  Right now is a really tough time, and our brains are not meant to deal with high levels of stress over a long period of time. In regards to the pandemic, and in regards to getting through this semester, take things one day at a time. It can be super overwhelming to think of things far in the future or even next week, but you‚Äôve made it through every day of your life so far, so I know you can make it through some more.

In regards to school, you sound like you‚Äôre a pretty ambitious person and you probably have high standards for yourself. But something really important to remember is that anything is better than nothing. Your first priority is yourself. School is pretty shit right now, but hey, we‚Äôre already a third of the way done! So for a short term survival plan to just get through this semester - do what you can, and more importantly don‚Äôt beat yourself up for not doing everything you‚Äôd be doing if we weren‚Äôt in a pandemic. We ARE in a pandemic. It‚Äôs totally okay and normal to feel the way you are feeling. You are not insane. You are not alone. 

If you can‚Äôt get out of bed to watch your lectures, watch them in bed. If you can‚Äôt bear to change out of your most comforting sweatshirt, keep it on. If you wish you had a teddy bear to hug because it would make you feel better, get a goddamn teddy bear. Whatever gets you through the day - don‚Äôt hold yourself to any meaningless standards like ‚ÄúI need to wear a better outfit‚Äù or ‚ÄúI need to stop feeling so unmotivated‚Äù. You do not! You just need to figure out healthy ways to keep going. Don‚Äôt compare your mental health to anyone else‚Äôs - comparison is the thief of joy, and your progress is your own. 

Bring this up to your professors, let them know you‚Äôre having a really tough time. Most profs barring the shitty ones will be understanding given the circumstances. Last spring semester, things were pretty hard for me, and I set up an arrangement with my physics professor to just turn in my assignments whenever I could, because there were days where I just couldn‚Äôt do homework. Physics was the class that took the most work for me last semester, so make sure to bring it up especially w the prof of your toughest class! Hopefully they will be as equally willing to work with you. Also, think about pass/fail for some of your classes. 

I hope this helps a bit! You‚Äôre not alone, I promise!",1599867413,6,0

With that said, myself and many others don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs foolish to be skeptical of masks because there are reasons other than the science to be skeptical. Some argue that it‚Äôs government overreach, or that mandates should actually be law passed through legislation, not executive authority only. Some are skeptical that without uniform mandates and instructions as to the type, positioning, etc of masks that they‚Äôre ineffective. 

I also would disagree with your point that ‚Äúif everyone would just wear the damn mask we‚Äôd all be fine.‚Äù Sweden has almost gotten rid of the virus completely without mask mandates or lockdowns. 

On the flip side, some countries, like Australia are STILL in lockdown despite dwindling cases of the virus.

Regarding speed of spread: maybe it‚Äôs significant, but certainly not in all cases.  I would measure significance more by the total damage done and severity of that damage rather than the speed of spread. If some new virus was introduced to the population, but it didn‚Äôt cause any symptoms in humans, how fast it spread would be irrelevant. Likewise, if in a population of college kids COVID spreads fast but doesn‚Äôt cause significant damage, that‚Äôs something to consider.

My suggestion is to have a balance of both classes that fulfill gen eds and classes you can take for fun. If you find a course that you think you'll enjoy, or one that might lead to a minor you might like, it's always worth taking! Although gen eds are important, it's absolutely OK to take your time, explore, and take classes just because they sound interesting.

It's also very possible to find courses that both fulfill requirements and are fun. Check out Coursicle, it can help you with that. It has a filter option that helps you find classes that fulfill specific gen eds.

Also, keep in mind that some classes have year restrictions, and you won't be able to take them once you get to your senior year (which was a little bit of a bummer for me).

I‚Äôm sure major growth presents a ton of challenges. When I was an undergrad the cs department was dealing with a surge in demsnd that I wasn‚Äôt sure had abated. 

I‚Äôm genuinely happy to hear about the curriculum changes. Thanks for the correction.",1607227989,1,0
"It sounds like the department has changed quite a bit since your experience, mostly for the better (though the growth in majors has been a real challenge to keep up with). For example, the intro sequence was redesigned (no longer has 401 in it). For the past five and a half years I've been the instructor of record for COMP110. I'm a teaching assistant professor with no research agenda and am 100% focused on undergraduate pedagogy. Over the past few years we've been hiring more teaching focused faculty to help lead the rest of the intro sequence and some upper-division courses.",1607227020,2,0
"I am not aware of any requirements needed to take a course in the department. This student was asking about taking a single course. 

Yes, cs110 is required and I honestly didn‚Äôt learn a single thing from the instructor when I took that course as an overworked PhD student was being asked to teach it.  So I don‚Äôt entirely fault them. 

Us news heavily weights ‚Äúreputation‚Äù and research. Neither of which are helpful to an undergraduate seeking to learn a subject at the base level. Many researchers know their subjects intimately but cannot communicate that subject to students. Instruction and exploration are different skill sets. 

I understand that in intro courses you cannot hand hold every student. However, the fact that graduate students are being asked to handle many undergraduates first foray into the field is not helpful. 

Additionally, if a full time lecturer is being asked to lead, say comp401, they will likely prioritize their research over student conprehension. At least, this was my experience. 


My experience at unc boils down to the school not really being a school. It‚Äôs a research incubator. If others have had a better experience, I am happy for them.",1607226365,1,0
"Tabulate what major requirements you have left and what gen ed requirements you have left in a spreadsheet. Then pick classes that satisfy them. I've been doing 1 gen ed and 4 major classes each semester. Use rate my professor to gauge gen ed difficulty. 

For planning future classes, the biggest thing to be mindful about is the seasons in which some courses are offered, since that might mean you need to take certain prerequisites in the spring if they are not offered in the fall and vice versa. 

For example, if you are a math person, you might want to take 522 this semester since it is only offered every spring and it prepares you for graduate analysis which is only offered in the fall. 

I am a math and CS major and I am aiming for grad school in math or CS or statistics, but other than that I don't have a future planned. I just take what seems interesting and difficult or (in the case of CS) has open seats. I am still trying to find a PH class, but none look easy based on rate my professor.",1607226332,1,0
"Generally what I‚Äôve heard is that for certain subjects such as bio it‚Äôs fine to not retake as long as you meet the requirement with a higher level class. For example, med schools tend to only require a semester of intro bio + lab, so you can replace that with a higher level bio + lab (common one is 252/252L-anatomy and physiology) to show comprehension and mastery in bio. It‚Äôs more difficult with AP credit for chem tho since med schools explicitly require higher level chem in addition to intro/gen chem, but AP credit for bio should be fine.",1607226093,1,0

This past Fall was the last semester of that, so this Spring all students coming up will pass through 211 and then 311.

Good news is, if you took 211 this (the fall) semester (with Professor Jordan and also me, hi I'm an LA for 211 o/ ), it'll be much easier for you to get 311 than future students, since many students this semester choose to take 411 so you're competing against less students.

"Currently, I'm taking Kor 101 and I'd say I nailed down most of the conjugations and some of the grammar for the language, but some of the uncommon words and vocabs never stick in my brain. We did a lot of practice exercises and constantly had breakout rooms during class that helped us practice with our classmates. I assume your class may have been structured a little differently, but you can always have a talk with the professor and see if they have any resources you can use over the break (if you aren't planning to do anything) and practice then. You can also maybe look to form an out of class group if you and your classmates are determined to nail everything before you start up 102.

I don't think you are supposed to ""understand"" the language until around 203 where the uni marks you as proficient enough in the language. Even then, it may be hard to even hold conversations because you are going to have limited vocabulary from just what you have learned in class. This doesn't even take into account slang or formal/informal words (idk if German has that) that people may use.

I wouldn't sweat it honestly, but it sounds like you should try to study slowly before you end up cramming before the final. You still have a week so you can try and recap a couple times a day, even if it's only for 10-15 minutes. I'm sure you'll do great on the final!

"You need to divide the number of quality points by the number of earned credit hours. Consider the two following examples:

* You are taking two classes for a total of 7 credit hours - a three credit and a four credit class. You then earn a B in the four credit class and an A in the three credit class. Your GPA would be calculated as follows: 3.0 x 4 = 12 quality points for the four-credit B and 4.0 x 3 = 12 quality points for the three-credit A. 12 + 12 = 24 total quality points. Divide those 24 points by the 7 total credits = 3.43 GPA
* You are taking two classes for a total of 6 credit hours. You earn As in both classes. You still have 24 total quality points (4.0 x 6 = 24), but they are spread over only 6 credits. Therefore, the GPA is 4.0.

At the end of the day, doing very well in a four-credit class has a greater positive impact on your GPA than doing equally as well in a three-credit class. But, the opposite is also true. Doing less well in a four-credit class has a greater negative impact on your GPA than doing the same in a three-credit class.",1605112261,1,0
"They aren‚Äôt the same, because you divide by total number of hours to compute the GPA. In the case of a B in a 4 hour course you get 12 quality points but divide by 4, which should move your GPA slightly towards 3. An A in a 3 hour course is 12 quality points but is divided by 3 so your GPA should move slightly towards 4.",1605111940,2,0

"No. You must divide the quality points by credit hours to get the GPA. For example, let‚Äôs say you get a B in a 4 credit class and an A in a 3 credit class. 12 quality points for the B, 12 for the A. But you divide the 24 overall points by the credits taken. The GPA would be about 3.429.  The lower grade you got in the 4 credit hour class weighed heavier in the calculation, because if you got the same B but in a 3 credit class along with that same A in the 3 credit class, your GPA would be 3.5.",1605111711,2,0

"I think 241 is one of those classes where you can get an extreme range of answers because people either struggle significantly or do really well because something clicks for them. I‚Äôm going to be as objective as possible: regardless of how easy chem is for you, you‚Äôll still have to work hard to get an A in 241. It is a challenging class because of its emphasis on quantitative calculations that require solid knowledge of the details involved in the theory behind the chemistry. Try not to skip lectures, it‚Äôs harder to play the catch up game with this class then a bio class for example. There are 4 distinct units but they have interrelated concepts. Over break, definitely brush up on your acid-base chemistry - once you have the theoretical aspects down, practice practice practice with variations of the quantitative calculations, especially for titrations and polyprotic acids/bases. As a tip for the class, spend less time taking detailed notes from the textbook and more time making summary/cheat sheets with the key ideas and formulas. Once you have concepts down in theory, focus your time on practice problems and be sure to analyze why you got problems right and wrong when you self-grade.

I am a little more optimistic. UNC has ramped up testing and requires 1-2 tests per week for each student. Testing and failing to prevent spread off campus were the two main weaknesses that lead to the off ramp in the fall. Finally the 25max number only applies to outdoor settings and there have been few cases spread outdoors where air exchanges are far more frequent.

"Hey man, good luck with your application. I‚Äôm C-step in my first semester at UNC. So I‚Äôll give you a bit of my background so you can maybe judge based off of that.

I dropped out of high school because I had a brother that needed a double lung transplant. I got a ged and started at a community college when I was 18, right after he passed. When I was 19, I was diagnosed with cancer. From there I pretty much had no interest in school anymore. So after surgery and chemo, I just started working. At the age of 26 I realized that I had to do something. So I started at an nccc with the goal of transferring to unc. I worked hard for a couple semesters and applied to c-step. I had some pretty strong essays that made a compelling case for why I was ready for unc. I also had the grades at the cc to prove it. I did have an f on my transcript, so when I applied I think I had a 3.6 or 3.7. I graduated with a 3.9 after retaking the failed class. But I do have a friend that did c-step and he graduated with like a 3.27 or something lol. I honestly think they put wayyyy more weight on your essays and Rec letters than grades. Yeah, you def want to have good grades, but you don‚Äôt need a 4.0. Also, if you can‚Äôt get the grades there, in my experience you are going STRUGGLE here.

"I am further along the policy curriculum and took policy 101 with prof. Goldsmith and I think I have some valuable insight about the major as a whole. I don't know if this is how you are viewing it , but this has been my experience. 

A lot of freshman (including me) come in to UNC expecting it be more technical school-y than it is. I came in thinking the major would prepare me for a career in Washington, frankly it does the opposite. I was also surprised by what felt like the lack of opinion I could have. But that is what is suppose to make the policy major challenging. A lot of people expect the coursework to be similar to writing stuff along like the lines of what Thomas Paine, John Locke, etc. work was like. Essentially describing an ideal and logically exploring and supporting it in the scope of politics. 

Take the ACA, which I am sure you have discussed a lot in Goldsmiths class. I bet you have your opinions on the legislation, my guess is that you probably do not like it. My second guess is you have a list of things to say about it. My third guess is that you feel like the policy major doesn't allow for you to say those things, because you need to cite everything you are saying . A lot of people find this annoying (I did too!), but it is important because the policy major is here to teach us how to be critical of any and all evidence and to base the work in empirical findings and to shift away from values and beliefs. It tries to replicate scientific procedures as much as possible. I am not here to tell you your list is wrong, just make sure when you have your list it is backed by evidence. And trust me you can find it.  I think Goldsmith did an adequate job of opening the floor for a variety of thinktanks and sources that represent different ideologies. PLCY 210 does a great job of explaining the major and study. Summerlin-Long (albeit a little slow at uploading lectures as of now) does a good job of explaining the framework of thinking. PLCY 220 (if you didn't like Goldsmith, I doubt you will like Kreitzer) will finally get into the intersection of politics into policy.

As for Goldsmith. I hated the structure of this class. I honestly think the department needs to reconsider offering this course, because frankly I feel like I wasted the semester taking it. Everything important to the policy major that was talked about in policy 101, is better explained in PLCY 210 (the real intro class to the policy major). I read that you think the major is journalism-esche, my guess is because of the amount of research and emphasis on empirical evidence that is a given with the major. I would reccommend taking policy 210 before deciding.
