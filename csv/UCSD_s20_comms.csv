"So I spoke to prof. Neal today and he basically said all he expects of an undergrad is to show up, take notes and study off that, and he traditionally curves generously. 

But the ""traditionally curves generously"" part really irks me...what I took from that is that the final will either be too hard or too random, and that most undergrads usually get destroyed. I can't take any chances on my GPA haha so I'm thinking for the next week I'll start actually reading the papers and try to summarize it, basically try to understand it fully as if I was a grad student.

I'm planning to know what the paper is about, why it might matter, what we can do with it, and some basic science in it. The priority will be in that order. And instead of notes, I'll definitely be using Anki and just memorize all the facts. 

I hate feeling unprepared and leaving things up for chance, and that's exactly what I'm feeling about the upcoming final!",1582271583,1,0

"&gt;If you have a runny nose and sputum when you have a cold, you cannot be a new type of coronavirus pneumonia, because coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough without runny nose.



According to a journal, most common symptoms of 2019 novel coronavirus were fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue; less common symptoms were sputum production, headache, haemoptysis, and diarrhoea. Also, more than half of the patients had shortness of breath[1].

they also had observed few patients with 2019-nCoV infection had prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms eg, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, or sore throat [1].

"For some background, I'm now working on another degree online at another school, but I went to UCSD for undergrad. The below helps me get stuff done and actually hit my personal study goals more consistently. If what you're doing now doesn't work, I suggest giving some or all of this a shot.

Take inventory of what you have to do this quarter and realistically estimate how many hours per week you need to accomplish everything. Not just to complete the homework, but also hours to study the material and actually learn; learning makes everything easier in the long run. You may have an insurmountable number of things to do in your mind when you first take inventory, but if you break it down into bite-sized bits you can check off each smaller task and get that burst of accomplishment.

Schedule out how many hours per day (and days/week) you need to work towards finishing the tasks you've got. If you want to emulate full-time work, schedule 8am-5pm or 9am-5pm as working hours and give yourself the evening off since that lets you transition between working mode and relaxing mode, gives you time to recover, and let's you recognize what you accomplished during the day. Work 2 hours on + 30 minutes off, 30 min on + 5 minutes off, whatever keeps you on track. Prioritize hitting the minimum number of hours worked you scheduled from the start.

Time off is important to keep you sane, but time off is only useful if you can honestly say you were ""on"" during your working hours. Don't half-ass your working hours. If you were your own manager - would you rate your work ethic highly, or were you padding the time by pretending to work? Take pride in your work and don't waste your time.

I've found when I focus on time-oriented study metrics I tend to accomplish more because I stay in the get-stuff-done mode much longer. When I set task-oriented study goals, if I have 5 steps to complete a task my brain wants to relax too much after each step, plus I procrastinate so much more since ""Of course, I can finish all those things before the deadline"" when I really should have been spreading that work throughout the whole week to avoid that last minute time crunch.

I feel like the lectures have the potential to be interesting when the professor is good (shoutout Herbst) but the final paper feels so isolated from whatever core curriculum the class series is trying to teach us. The worst part by far is the TA grading though, it feels too random with how subjective the essay rubric is. I can't  blame TAs for being a hivemind that always gives a perfectly fair and objective grade on every writing assignment, but when one student gets an A on an assignment and another student with a different TA gets a C- for a paper of similar quality, it's pretty easy to see why people hate on the class and feel like their effort is wasted.",1588681141,1,0

"I am admitted to Revelle College as a 2020 Political Science Transfer. I emailed in regards to petition on switching colleges because of my inability to complete the graduation requirements on time. I noticed Rev is more STEM-based in terms of there GE's. It is very intimidating to see that. I also regret not making Marshall or Warren my top 1st because it coincides with my major heavily. I have heard back from admissions on the process and it was quite discouraging as well as what students on Youtube have said. I feel very skeptical to fully commit to UCSD because of how intimidating I feel with Rev. 

\- Are there any students who have successfully switched?

\- How is the petition process on switching inter-colleges for you?

"Hey I‚Äôve been an IA for a few times now; you‚Äôre right that an A is not enough to get the position since that‚Äôs the minimum just to apply. It‚Äôs important to remember that a lot of people apply so I think less than half get it if I remember correctly. It also helps to have a close relationship with the professor so they can recognize your name and rate you as a preferred IA. Finally the departments (for bio at least) make the final choices. 

In general, you want to have a combination of an A, a high GPA (the higher above the minimum to apply the better), a good relationship with the professor, and you need to luck out with the department who makes the final choices. It‚Äôs also helpful to not select classes that are very popular to IA for (examples are the lower div bio classes and certain upper divs like genetics).

Edit to add a few other things: 
1) They tend to prefer more senior students (3rd-4th years) as the departments are aware that 1st/2nd years often either have higher GPAs because of GEs or are worried that they might not yet have the experience to balance IAing with a courseload (it's basically an extra class if you care about teaching well). 
2) It may help to submit applications early - I submitted mine the day it came out for Spring 2020 (for bio department) and got a few emails about interviews the very next day (not all profs will do interviews). It doesn't guarantee anything, but some profs (like one that I just interviewed with last week) tend to start looking at the apps early so it could help to get your name towards the top of the pile.
3) Even if you have a prof who you know will put you as their preferred choice, you still might not get it - I know I will be put down as a preferred choice for a professor, but he told me he knows it does not guarantee that I'll get to IA for him as again it's the department who makes the final choice. 
4) Though you probably knew this, your choice of preferences is visible to the profs and they actually do assume it to mean your level of genuine interest! 
5) Do try to fill out the app with something - I know a few profs who automatically ignore applications if they don't answer questions like ""why do you want to be an IA?"" seriously. 
6) If you do not know the prof, it's best to reach out to them to let them know - profs tend to pick from students that they know, but not always (for example, when I IAd for Fall 2019, at least half of my fellow IAs took the course with the professor).
7) Once you actually get to IA, the next time you try will be much harder as then they'd have to pay you (this is just a heads-up).

Good luck with it! :)

" As announced at the final exam, the grade breakdown will be posted on Piazza early this week. I also announced that my deadline to submit grades is Tuesday. Asking about the course graded before the grade deadline is like me asking for your programming submission before the assignment deadline. However much the question is asked, however much you want know the information, however much I want to know the information, when the information is still unknown, there is no answer to the question. I'm not in the situation where I know the answer to your question and am withholding it from you. Reading and responding to your question about the course grade breakdown before the information is known just causes the very information you seek to be delayed for everyone since I'm taking the time to respond to you instead of continuing with the analysis needed to determine the course grades.

After being at the CSE 12 final exam until after 10pm on Friday night and after spending all day Saturday grading final exams until after 6pm, any questions about your course grades asked Saturday or Sunday show no consideration to me or to the course staff in allowing a day of rest or a reasonable amount of time to pass before expecting the course grade to be determined. You've waited more than 10 weeks to know your grade in this course. Can't you wait a few more days before demonstrating your impatience?

Your question is worthy of a professionalism deduction. Knowing the answer to your question benefits no one, not even you. Knowing now doesn't change your grade, and it doesn't provide insights into the course content. Specifically, your question is an example of interactions to avoid such as ""asking questions where the information will eventually be known.""

At the beginning of the course, we awarded you 100% for the professionalism portion of your course grade assuming that all interactions would be professional. Your interaction above indicates that our initial prediction of your professionalism was incorrect. I've made an adjustment in your score to reflect the error in our assumptions.

If you'd like to explain how your question above demonstrates consideration, patience, and professionalism, please let me know.",1581195612,2,0

I don't really think that way. 80% of cases of COVID-19 are very mild to mild symptoms.

There is more and more evidence that people who had their lungs infected with covid-19, get some of their normal lung tissue substituted with connective tissue and thus would end up with reduced lung capacity for the rest of their lives. There are a number of cardiological conditions that may arise from that. And generally, you might not die but even so, I don't wish anybody experience of being intubated. Trust me, it isn't fun.

1. As an incoming out-of-state transfer into Revelle, how likely is it that my writing/composition classes (which are standard English 101&amp;102) will satisfy HUM 1&amp;2?

I was nervous when I first went.  I even asked the CAPS staff, ""so, what do I do?""

"I took it with Steiner (fall 2019).

The notes for Steiner are mostly complete, with missing things that you fill in during lecture (but these tend to be examples so you don't actually need to attend lecture to learn the material, nor is attendance mandatory).

The class is actually not too difficult at all, with a total of 5 quizzes every 2 weeks (the 5th one is actually your final too!) consisting of 25 MC questions. They're very straightforward (vocab, application, etc.) and he even adjusts quiz scores if the average is too low or if 75% miss the same question; averages were usually B to B+s on the quizzes. The material is pretty basic, and if you've taken PSYC 60 it builds off of that. You don't really have any true statistics/math (that's what PSYC 60/Math 11 do), but instead just learn how to design studies with the various methods, what is ethical, how to write a paper, etc. There is an APA paper we had to write, but it was broken down to mini assignments throughout the quarter (ex: find your papers by week 3, do the introduction by week 5, materials+methods by week 7, complete/compile everything by week 10). It's really short (only around 5-6 pages double spaced) if you follow the minimum guidelines (which is enough to get an A on it). The final was also just a normal quiz itself (25 MC) and was not cumulative either! He also gives some extra credit for things like capes.

Topics overall are things like: independent/dependent variables, correlation vs experiments vs quasi-experiments, research ethics and codes, types of sampling, experimental design and correlation designs, validity vs reliability, etc.

"Hi, I believe I answered this a few days ago with this:
The computing paths are just a bunch of non-CS majors that may be what you're looking for. Specifically, Math-Scientific Computing and Physics with Specialization in Computational Physics are the scientific computing majors. 

Is there anything I could clarify here? You wouldn't choose both majors, you would just pick one of them. It's not a combination of majors, it's just two separate majors that UCSD put into the same category due to their similar usage of CS. The paths are not majors themselves.",1585467039,1,0

"I'd like to second most of the stuff sciberz said. First off, no college is inherently socially dead. If you choose to talk to people and make friends, you'll be fine. And you're not necessarily limited to only making friends within your assigned college. As for academics, I wouldn't say that any of the colleges are toxic either. Yes, Revelle has some pretty rough GEs, but they won't have a major impact on the rest of your college career. Revelle dorms/apartments aren't that bad; they're a bit old, but they're quite decent and fairly well-situated campus location-wise. In terms of being more inclined for STEM majors, I'd say Warren is suited for STEM than Revelle, so Revelle isn't that bad for non-STEM. As for switching colleges, it's very difficult and really not worth it. It's better to enjoy the good things about your college, rather than focus on the negatives! :)",1585463271,1,0

The Keeling apartments are hella nice, so once you hit second year you might be in for a treat. Revelle also isn't really STEM inclined either. Revelle made a college where everyone, including STEM majors, would obtain a basic liberal arts education.

"Cognitive science is a major in the cognitive science department whereas cognitive behavioral neuroscience is a major that is advised by both the psych and cognitive science department. CBN majors thus can take both psyc and cog sci classes. The behavioral part of cognitive neuroscience are such things as working memory, neural networks, and cognition.

All cognitive science majors have a courseload similar to each other and after the second year or beginning of the third year they can choose a specialization (specialization means upper division courseload, classes designed for upper class men juniors and seniors) if they desire or even choose a double major. Here‚Äôs a list of [specializations](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/major/19-20-specializations_030620.pdf) within the cog sci department.  What your interests describe is the clinical aspects of cognition specialization. What I suggest is start off as a cog sci major and see what peaks your interest when it comes time to specialization.

For home workouts, this has been my strategy:

\-Try to look for heavy things around your apt or home. Do deadlifts with the couch, pick up a chair and do back squats, find a heavy water jug and do kettlebell swings. If you have a roommate have them sit on your shoulders and squat them! 

\-Add more reps to burn out, or do more compound movements with multiple muscle groups (like a biceps curl in a squat position, overhead press in a lunge position, etc.)

\-Add plyometric moves to make basic moves more difficult. Do jump squats, split squats, press your hands off the floor during push-ups, etc.

\-Work on eccentric or isometric movement to challenge yourself. If doing a pull-up, do 2 sec pull upward (concentric), then four seconds on the downward (eccentric) movement. You actually grow stronger in the eccentric phase. Or for squat, sit down slowly, stand up quickly. Or add in some isometric holds--in a push-up, hold at the bottom for five seconds then push-up. You will definitely feel it!

"**If you're instate**, the entire tuition/fees are almost fully covered - it ends up being a couple hundred (\~200) at the end. However, you also get an income from TAing which is around $20ish an hour and is paid biweekly. Depending on how much time you get assigned (typically 0.25 but can go up to 0.5) **this ends up with around $1000ish monthly assuming 0.25 employment that you should have to spend on food/rent after covering anything else that the TAship doesn't cover**. You get this in biweekly payments so every 2 weeks you'll receive a payment for the hours you've worked.

**Otherwise, if you're out of state/non-resident**, the above still applies however there's a non-resident fee that essentially makes it 2x the price of instate students - so you end up needing to cover around 5k a quarter. After accounting for the roughly 1k you'd get per month **assuming 0.25 time, you'll end up needing to pay the school around 1.5-2k a quarter.**

This is basically what I was able to gather from the BS/MS info meeting a while back (just applied) as well as some stuff that was given to me since I work currently as an undergrad tutor and also got accepted to another graduate program here (not the BS/MS one). It may vary a bit by department and I rounded some numbers to simplify things, but should work!

Here's a nice chart about the different pays and actual amounts given - though I believe they're based on full time so you have to adjust accordingly (ex: 0.25 or 0.5 time) - [https://grad.ucsd.edu/financial/employment/Student-Academic-Title-Rates-2019-2020.pdf](https://grad.ucsd.edu/financial/employment/Student-Academic-Title-Rates-2019-2020.pdf)

-This is with your assumption that complete lockdown for months on end is indeed the best solution. This wasn't the solution for S. Korea.

Certainly families without homes were fighting the elements (and starvation) and nature surely didn't compromise in such instances. 

What similarity does this have to the Spanish Flu other than that it spread worldwide? Technically the regular influenza virus could mutate in such a way..but you aren't recommending lockdown for influenza now, are you? Look to the virus family for indication of how it may behave. The last SARS essentially disappeared in the summer.

"UCSD Political Science Data Analytics vs SDSU Political Science Degree  
 

Hello all,

I  was looking for feedback regarding the political science data analytics  degree and how intense the math/data courses are in this major

I am also debating between UCSD, with UCSD being my first choice, and SDSU.

Seeing if anyone has any insight on the pros and cons of each political science at the respective school.

"I totally agree.  Like many have pointed out, you want to keep those notifications on to make sure you don't miss anything, but it takes you time to sift through and find the important ones.  I relate to the around-the-clock sentiment because often my professors and TAs will send announcements in the middle of the night.  One of my classes had an announcement that came from the professor at 2:44 AM yesterday.

Right now I'm struggling with only having time during the week to complete required assignments instead of catching up on lectures: one of my professors refuses to use Zoom and instead podcasts in an empty classroom.  Two big problems with that: (1) no ability to ask him questions during the lecture, and his office hours are a direct conflict with another one of my classes; and (2) it takes a couple hours for the video to become available and by that point I've already moved on to something else.  And I don't have time to watch the lecture because I'm busy completing homework assignments.  So then the vicious cycle continues.  You're not alone - I've been anxious a lot this quarter too.

The monotony is also frustrating - when I'm on campus, I'll usually have lunch in a different place every day.  Now I have like two places in my house where I can eat lunch?  Seems insignificant but a lack of variety in your days really drains your willpower.",1587615545,1,0

Unfortunately, some people are going to suffer, but it will beat a much larger section of the population dying. Plus, the less people die, the easier economic recovery will be.
