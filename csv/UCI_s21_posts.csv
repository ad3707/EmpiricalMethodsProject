ENGRCEE 20 SSI,"Hey guys,

I'm currently a 2nd year math major looking into changing my major into civil engineering. I was currently considering taking physics 7c during SSI, but on the change of major website it mentions I have to take ENGRCEE 20 as a requirement to be considered into changing majors. Additionally, I don't think it'd be the smartest move to take physics in the 5 week period haha. Overall, I just wanted to ask around and see if ENGRCEE 20 is a difficult class?

Classes to Take,"Hi, I am registering for classes today,  and spring is going to be my 3rd quarter at uci as freshman. I am starting to fill up my ge's,  and am planning to switch from psychology to informatics.  Right now, I have ge 3 and 4 to clear left, and I plan to take the ics 31 to 33 series at a cc over spring, summer,  and fall. So, according to assist,those 3 equivalent courses at the cc should clear ge 2 and 5 I think. That means I'd only have ge 3 and 4 to clear.  However, I need to make sure I continue taking 3 classes to meet full time student req for aid. Does that mean, if I run out of classes to clear ge's,  do I just take classes I find interesting at that point? Because I can't take any of the informatics classes yet until I clear the ics 31 to 33 series,  I can only go through the ge's for now. I'm worried I'll end up taking classes without much use, as I'm locked from informatics classes until maybe winter of next academic year.",1614911958,4,0

Question about retaking Physics 7C,"Hello, I am currently taking 7C with Taffard and at this point I may or may not finish the class with a C- minimum, it could go either way depending on what I get on the final exam. I need the C- minimum for fluid mechanics in junior year, but I don't think I need it for 7D. I have a later enrollment so I might get stuck with Dollar for 7D instead of Guerra, but I was planning on getting LARC for this class.

I will be asking an advisor about this, but in the event that I don't get a C- minimum, I was wondering if I should take 7D for spring quarter and retake 7C for summer, or retake 7C next quarter and 7D over the summer. 7C is being taught by Xin in the spring and I feel like I would be able to redeem myself if I retook the course with him.

P.S., I am also aware that Math 2D is a corequisite for 7D, so would they even let me take 7D in the summer if I took 2D in the spring?

My chances,"Hey guys so I am aware that CS is super hard to get int at any school nowadays which I'm sort of loosing hope with.

Long story short, I graduated high school in 2014 and right after I went to a CC and I took my same lazy habits of HS with me and I did really poorly. Only classes I did good in were in programming classes which I actually enjoyed.

Anyway eventually in 2015 I stopped going because I didn't feel the motivation and just honestly didn't want to go to college at that time in my life. Throughout my time off, I kept up my programming and what not and was a freelancer.

In Summer of 2019, I had this random thought of not wanting to regret not getting my degree and I had found this new motivation to actually try and finish up my CC courses and transfer.

Since coming back I've had Bs and As, my last two semesters were 4.0s finishing up GE and transfer requirements. I've taken most if not all CS classes at my CC and gotten As in all of them if that matters.

But because of my initial poor grades in 2014 after HS, my cumulative GPA is around 3.38 right now. (still have about 2 semesters left or so)

I know that's low considering other's who apply with 3.8+.

I suppose I was wondering, does UC admissions take into account of cases like mine where I left school and then came back years later with new found motivation and did well?",1614851445,9,0

Crisis,"Sorry if you guys are tired of reading about this, but I‚Äôve been bottling this shit up for 2 years now. 
I am currently a second year chemistry major trying to pick up a double major in psychological sciences. But I still have no clue what I am going to do with my life. I don‚Äôt like school, but I‚Äôm in it because i am forced to so I am not planning to attend graduate school willingly. 
The only reason why I chose chemistry was because I did good in it in high school and I understood it, so when doing college apps I had no idea what I was looking for or what I wanted but I knew I was somewhat good at chemistry. 2 years in I regret my decision every single day, and search the web for hours trying to look for a career with a chem degree. But really, nothing interests me. I tried switching majors, but again nothing interests, and I truly feel im not good at anything else but chemistry at this point. Also, the only reason I‚Äôm trying to pick up psci is to have a back up plan of some sort, but I obviously still don‚Äôt know what to do with it. 
I planned on transferring out and look for something that interested me in some other school, but I never found something that I truly felt was meant for me, until recently. I have a deep love for animals, but veterinary school did not catch my attention since I have no interest in being a doctor. Of course I found other careers that also specialize in some animal interaction or care, but I feel it is too late now to transfer out since it‚Äôd happen until my senior year. I do not want to be in school for more years than necessary, and worse stand back and watch how I wasted 3 years of my life in school for nothing (also I wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford school on my own once I run out of financial aid lol). 
Anyways tho, who knows what‚Äôll be of me in the future, but I have a feeling it‚Äôll be unhappy and full of regrets. Thanks for listening!",1614819760,102,4

Discussion with MCS students at UC Irvine,"Hi everyone,

I've got an admit to the Master in Computer Science(MCS, not MS CS) program at UC Irvine. I wanted to connect with people who have already graduated/currently studying in the program. Some questions I want to ask:

1. Does the program cost a lot more than traditional masters programs? I understand that the tuition amounts to \~50k USD not including accommodation and other miscellaneous expenses. I just want to make sure that the amount is not high enough in comparison to the returns from available job opportunities that I end up taking a huge financial burden.
2. What is your review of the courses offered, and which courses do you like the most? I wish to study distributed systems, operating systems, and machine learning, so please let me know about your experience with these courses.
3. I understand getting job opportunities is more of a numbers game, and people have to apply via referrals, LinkedIn, and connections, but do recruiters differentiate between a MCS and a MS CS graduate?
4. Any things that you want a prospective Anteater to know before he joins campus?

I read that you can get jobs such as a data analyst (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong), which honestly piqued my interest, but I feel like CS majors and whatnot would be more sought after. From what I read, it sounds like BIM is a very broad major, and I feel like it would deter employers from hiring people with a BIM degree because it‚Äôs broadness.

UCI MS Mech/Aero vs Cal Poly Pomona MS Mechanical?!?!?!,"Hi everyone, 
I was recently accepted into both UCI and Cal Poly Pomona for masters in Mechanical engineering and don‚Äôt know which school would be best for me. 
I‚Äôm not really into research and heavy theoretical classes I want to primarily build things which is why I‚Äôm leaning towards CPP in that regard.
My focus is also on robotics CPP‚Äôs MS has a robotic emphasis with classes like signal processing, robot motion planning, control etc 

UCI doesn‚Äôt seem to have too many robotics courses although they do have a bio robotics course and a course on computer controlled robotics. 

UCI obviously has a better name and they do have robotics research but again I don‚Äôt want to write up research papers and focus a lot on novel robotics theory. 

If UCI has any clubs where you get the chance to build stuff that would help me more with my decision??

Employment wise does it really matter which school?

This is pretty long so I‚Äôll cut it short I just wanted to know if anyone has any good input here to help me decide I‚Äôd really appreciate it!!!!",1612471690,10,0

Do I have a chance?,"Hi y'all :)

I'm a freshman(sophomore technically bc of ap credits) atm at my state's flagship and have a gpa of 3.59. I'm majoring in Japanese with a minor in ESL teaching, but am looking at transferring over to a college of education (whether it's here or uci)

Some more background:
Passed preliminaries and competed in Japanese speech contest with contestants from 7 states and came in 6/10
Competed in other state Japanese contest 3 years in a row. (Did not place top 5, unfortunately)
Worked a job junior and senior years of hs whilst also doing volunteer service. 
Planning on working through next school year as well. 
Am a low income latino-white mix. 
By the end of this semester I'll have about 50 credit hours.
By the end of this semester if things go as planned I should have a 3.7(or higher) GPA, hopefully will be able to keep that through soph year

Was wondering if y'all could guess my chances of being accepted if I applied for transfer my junior year. Dunno if any of this info outside of the gpa was even relevant, lmao but I'm just super anxious about all this.

Considering drastically changing major on second quarter,"* Psych 9C ‚úî A
* Psych 10A ‚úî  A+
* Math 2B‚úî  A

GPA so far: 4.0.

I am freshman psych B.S. major. I am playing with the idea of transferring in to Civil Engineering or Computer Science (I have been getting uneasy about the 8yr of education needed to get a *useful* degree in psychology). I love psychology, but I also like these other two topics. This quarter I am taking:

* Humanities Core 1B - worth 8 credits - on track for A
* Psych 9A - on track for A+
* Psych 10B - on track for A

I am genuinely concerned that it may be too late to change majors. Apparently, I need to take one more quarter of math, two quarters of physics, one chem course, and ENGRCEE 20 to change to civil engineering, for example. And I should be ""on track to complete prerequisite coursework by the end of the first year"" [\[source\]](https://changeofmajor.uci.edu/engineering/#civil).

Is It Wrong To Email Professor About Something Other Than Academics,"Hey Fellow Anteaters!

I know this sounds weird but ever since high school (Like 3 Years Ago) I've been really trying to figure out the direction I want to take for my future career. I've finally settled on a major and minor I want to pursue, but I don't know many people who decided to take the career path I've decided to try and take. I guess my question is if it's okay to email one of my Professors and ask for some advice and what they did to become as successful as they are in the major they chose. I know it's a dumb question, but it definitely would help me out a ton to get advice from people who are as successful as they are. Thank you for any responses!

Help! Failed a class that could cost me another whole year (EECS),"I failed EECS 150 (Continuous-Time Signals and Systems) and it is only available in the Winter quarter all year long. Not even summer. It is too late to change that F grade now. I am a fourth year electrical engineer and my academic plan was to finish in 5 years, but now I am potentially looking at a full 6 years if I don‚Äôt fix this problem. The problem? One major requirement, EECS 160A, has this class as a prerequisite and it is only available in Fall. Two of my specialization requirements, EECS 141A and 141B also have EECS 150 as a prerequisite, and they are only available in Winter and Spring respectively. None of these 4 courses are taught in summer. One idea I have is to take an EECS 150 equivalent at another college or university this spring or summer, but I am not sure I will be able to get in since it is a specific electrical engineering course. I have only found one semi-equivalent course at UC Berkeley available this Spring, but I don‚Äôt know if I will still be able to enroll in it or if it will even be accepted as an equivalent. It is also not a cross-campus course unfortunately. Another idea is that I can ask to skip this course as a prerequisite completely since I have taken EECS 50 DISCRETE-TIME SIGNALS AND SYSTEMS and it is similar. I don‚Äôt know if that is possible though. I will schedule an appointment with my academic counselor to discuss this, but in the meantime, do you guys have any tips or other ideas? Something I may have missed? Thank you, and good luck this Spring!

Veteran Community?,"I know this doesn‚Äôt apply to most of the UCI student body but I feel extremely let down with our veteran ‚Äúservices‚Äù when I was at community college, we had our own counselor that understood our needs along with the connections to help us out. Starting college when you‚Äôre older often means you‚Äôre starting entirely on your own with no idea what to do. Along with that to use the benefits you have you have to jump through tons of flaming hoops. I personally wouldn‚Äôt be at UCI if my counselor hadn‚Äôt shown me all the wonderful opportunities that were here pre-covid.

I hated that during my first ‚Äúveteran resources‚Äù meeting I attended we were given a silly game kahoot. I‚Äôm almost 30, I don‚Äôt want to play kahoot, I want information.  Yes, I stayed through the whole meeting but it was incredibly juvenile and seems very poorly mismanaged. Even worse is I feel more out of place than ever and I can‚Äôt wait to just get out of here. I‚Äôm now encountering my personal burn out and to top it off, I have yet to receive my housing offer even though I‚Äôm supposed to be receiving priority housing. 

If you‚Äôre a veteran that got into UCI and scoping out our Reddit. Go to a different school and just write off UCI. The VRC will take forever to respond to emails. The housing ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù that‚Äôs advertised doesn‚Äôt exist for us because of ‚Äúunprecedented times‚Äù pardon my language but UCI is a FUCKING GHOST TOWN. How can you not ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù housing when there‚Äôs less demand than ever.

As a vet at UCI the only thing you‚Äôre currently ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù is isolating yourself all day in your apartment and you can‚Äôt even have one guest over to spend time with you while you live in solitary confinement.

I thought I was coming to a highly admirable university. I didn‚Äôt realize I signed up for  solitary confinement with some time on the yard. 

I‚Äôm honestly astounded at how fucked up our veterans program is compared to a community colleges. I can say this from the bottom of my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è

UCI v.s UCSD,"Do you feel regret after you go to UCI as a business administration major in Paul Merage?

I just got accepted into UCI business administration major and UCSD economic major.

I feel like I am more interested in business than economic. 
I do not know which kind of job I will do in the future, so it is really hard for me to choose the school.

I am a transfer student, and I can switch my major after I transfer.
I just now UCSD have a business economic major start in this fall 2021. 
However, UCI is known for the business.

I also really want to know which one is easier to find a job, because I am an international student.

Most of the people said if you are interested in Business, you should go to UCI.
If I have a chance I want to stay in the United States after I graduate.
But if I go back to my home country, most of people in my country will really care about rankings. Even their rankings are really close, some people think they are different levels. 
Many people see UCI as a backup in the UC system.

I think UCI is good enough for me, because it might be easier to graduate than UCSD.
Due to covid, I left the United States and do not have chance to visit campus.
Even I watch a lot of transfer videos, it‚Äôs still really hard for me to make a choice.",1620208221,1,0

22F- School cum dump wants to take your load on campus.,"I‚Äôve done it before. Pre-covid and while the school was empty. Sneaky and quiet, loud and open. Riding with a skirt, jeans around my ankles, torn leggings, even naked. Upstairs, downstairs, bathrooms the libraries. Everything, all over. I know you‚Äôve seen a girl with a skirt that‚Äôs a little too short walking around and fantasized about it. Aren‚Äôt you at least curious?

Short, chubby Mexican girl with medium length dark hair, C cup tits, thick thighs and a fat ass. Shaved all over, fat innie cunt that swallows up dresses and panties, and big brown nipples. I may not be the hottest girl you‚Äôll ever fuck but I guarantee there won‚Äôt be any nastier. I live and breathe for cock. 

I don‚Äôt use condoms. If that‚Äôs something that bothers you I get it, but I would rather not have sex than hey fucked with a rubber. My coworkers complain I always smell like cum because of how much gets on/ inside of me. If I wear black you‚Äôll often see cum stains all over. 

I don‚Äôt do slow or sensual. I fuck like an actual animal. From the moment I see your cock I will be deep throating it as fast and hard as I can. I ride like a seasoned porn star. I will back my ass up into you. Of you slow down for a second I‚Äôll take over or turn around and immediately start tonguing your cock. You‚Äôre not going to get a second of rest, and I will leave both of us a sweaty mess covered in spit and my cum if I squirt all over the floor. 

I have been creampied every single day for years now. It might be complete strangers, friends, coworkers, my college professors or peers, married or taken men, family friends, or even just guys standing outside of the corner store. I‚Äôve been in hundreds of gangbangs, bukakkes, and blowbangs. I‚Äôve been naked and fucked in extremely public places around others, or in front of family and friends. I‚Äôve been used as a party favor for bachelor, frat, after prom,  and birthday parties. I‚Äôve been passed around entire sports teams and other groups. I take every chance I get to walk around with my bare ass bouncing around like at sketchy dive bars or music festivals. I wear a butt plug to work every day. I use my holes to my advantage and to get what I want. If you‚Äôve seen it in porn, I‚Äôve done it. If you‚Äôve fantasized about it, I‚Äôve done it. No limits. Even if I don‚Äôt like it, I‚Äôll do it for cum.

"Plz, give me some comments. I am a waitlisted man who is waiting for the decision.","Let me know if I have something mistakes or break any rules. I am on the waitlist at UC  Irvine, but I got accepted from UC Davis. 

I have really deep consideration to decide on which to go between UC Davis and UC Irvine. I want to make sure that I don't want to take either one college down.

I already deposited at UC Davis, but I have been still waiting for the result of UCI. If I would get accepted on UCI later, what are good things for me and my future if I would keep going to UC Irvine? 

Here is my info.

My major is Biology, but for my dream, I have been interested in Biomimicris for making inventions, medical devices, and meds for humans. Despite my major is Biology, I am into the Biomedical stuff, so I also have considered being pre-med.

Changing major from Mathematics to Data Science,"Hello, I'm a junior level transfer that will be attending UCI during the Fall 2021 quarter and I got admitted through TAG as a mathematics major. I've only recently discovered that I wanted to do Data Science and I've looked the the requirements for changing into Data Science requires a Cumulative UC GPA of 2.7 or higher and a Quarter GPA of 2.0 or higher. The Course grades require a 3.0 or higher average GPA and no grades lower than a C for ICS 31 and 32 as well one of the follow: Math 2A, Math 2B, Math 2D, ICS 6B, or ICS 6D. I'm currently attending a Peralta Community College and my GPA is 3.59 and will probably be bumped up to a 3.6+ after this semester is over. However the only classes that I've taken from the requirements are Math 2A, Math 2B, and Math 2D all with an ""A."" But I have taken Programming in both Java and C++ (Passed with a B and an A respectively) at my community college and I was wondering if these classes could be used in place of ICS 31 and 32 as well as the chances of me being able to switch into the major in general since it will be from the school of physical sciences to ICS. Some other information that I can include is that I have 76 semester units after this semester ends for me which translates to about 114 quarter units and I will have completed my full IGETC by the end of this semester and will have the certificate of completion. Something else I have looked into was a Statistics minor since the classes for a Data Science major and a Statistics minor overlap, would it be a good idea to pursue a Statistics minor with a Data Science major?

Is a car really necessary in Irvine?,"Hi! Incoming grad student here. Since I'm not a Ph.D. student, I'm not guaranteed on-campus housing. So while looking and speaking to existing grad students for off-campus housing two names were mentioned by most of them - UTC and Park West. While doing my own research I found out that it's about 20 minutes walk from UTC to the ICS department which is not too bad. But from Park West to the same, it takes around 35 minutes (essentially the nearest stop is near UTC so it's basically a 15 minutes bus ride + 20 minutes walk whereas the bus frequency is awful). In that case, my logical choice would be UTC. But apart from the commuting distance, is a car really required to probably go to the beach, do stuff around Orange County, maybe trips to LA, grocery store, etc (like how reliable is the bus service.) 

Also, If I do get a car I can probably live 15-20 minutes drive away from campus hoping to save rent (It will be around $1200 + utilities at UTC for my own room in a 3Bed room apartment for example). Will I be substantially saving money? Is it worth the extra parking charges at UCI and the traffic at Orange County?",1620062911,1,0

Apostille for HS Transcript?,"Hi anteaters! I have a question that makes me seriously worry.

I have graduated from an out-of-country high school which was located in the smallest town of the country, and I am pretty sure there is no way I can make their admission send my official HS transcript to the UCI. But I have obtained an apostille to my official HS transcript 4 years ago. Would that be enough for UCI? Or not providing this from the school directly from HS may hurt me?

(Even though on my applicant portal there is no need for an HS transcript, I completed IGETC and the Area:6 requirement comes from my HS so I believe I‚Äôll be asked to verify that.)

Housing for Exchange Students (Fall Quarter),"Hi guys!

Unless my home university or UCI decides to cancel their exchange/reciprocity program, I‚Äôll be coming in this fall. Like other exchangers, I‚Äôm obviously very excited and have started planning the logistical stuff - though I have an issue with housing. According to the housing website, exchange students have to take up off-campus housing since leases for on-campus housing last one year :(

Does this mean there‚Äôs really no chance of getting on-campus housing as an exchange student? For example could I take over a current student‚Äôs fall quarter lease or something?

If I can‚Äôt stay on-campus, where are the best (safest, higher chances of getting a place to stay etc) websites/groups/forums to check out to find a decent off-campus bedroom/apartment?

I tried searching for answers in previous posts on the sub but couldn‚Äôt really get substantial answers :/ Also, I understand that the program might get cancelled because of COVID, but I‚Äôd just like to know more info in case it goes through!

Being billed for the covid vaccine because I didn't get a referral from SHC,"I got my first dose of the Moderna vaccine about a month ago during the phase 1b rollout since I was still on payroll as a TA for UCI. However, I didn't learn that I had to get a referral from SHC until well after getting my first dose and by then it was too late. A month later I got a $51 statement in the mail from Anthem Blue Cross. It hasn't appeared on my zotaccount yet, though.

After being urged many times to get the covid vaccine by any means necessary and not to wait for it to be available at SHC, it's pretty disappointing that Anthem Blue Cross will not cover it because I didn't play ""Mother may I"" with SHC first. I even waited to get my vaccine through UCI Health (the main provider for UCI SHC) at the Bren Event Center on campus because I was expecting bureaucratic hell from UCI in proving that I've been vaccinated.

Anyway, thanks for listening to my rant. Has anyone had a similar experience? Did you have any luck getting UCI to cover it? I can afford it, just disappointed that I have to pay out of pocket for something that UCI encourages us all to get and should be covered.",1619049679,1,0

Do you have a disability? Tell me about how accessible your class materials are!,"**Approved by the CSULB IRB**

Introduction to my accessibility study

Hello!    My name is Nicholas Matthews. I am disabled (deaf), and I am also a   doctoral  student in Educational Leadership at California State   University, Long  Beach. I am looking for college students with   disabilities to be in a  research study I am doing.

The    title of my study is ‚ÄúAccessible Instructional Materials and Disabled    Student Success.‚Äù Instructional materials are things like videos,    webpages, and files that students use in a college course. Instructional    materials are accessible if they can easily be used and understood by    students with disabilities. For example, videos with closed captions   are  accessible to deaf students like me.

If    you are a college student, I would like to ask you about the    accessibility of your instructional materials. With my study, I hope to    show that accessible instructional materials are important for  students   like you. My study will show if students with disabilities  learn more  in  their classes when their materials are accessible.

How to participate

To    be in my study, you must be at least 18 years old and have a    disability. You should also have taken one or more classes at a college    or university in the Fall 2020 term. Finally, you should understand  the   informed consent notice on the first page of the survey. If you do  not   understand the informed consent notice, you should not  participate in   this study.

Being  in my study is   voluntary. This means you can choose whether to be in  my study or not.   You should participate in my study only if you really  want to.

If   you choose to be in  my study, you will take an online survey through a   website called  Qualtrics. I will not ask you for any personal   information, like your  name or student ID number. However, I will ask   you for the name of  your college and the name of a class you took at   your college. Your  answers will be kept private, so that only the   researcher and his  supervisors will see them. The survey should take   between 15 and 45  minutes of your time.

Take the survey

[To take part in the study, please visit this Qualtrics survey](https://csulb.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2sjYtIYo0GLAwNo).

You    can take the survey any time before March 26. The survey should be    accessible for users with disabilities. If you have difficulty taking    the survey or have any questions or concerns about my study, please feel    free to contact me. Thank you for your time!

What the hell is yield protection,"Hello everyone I am a out-of-state admitted student.

So I kind of went on TikTok to see the general reaction since I kind of used to everyone posting their acceptances. But there's been a large amount of people who have been denied and each time they get denied I see people talk about yield protection. Basically saying they're actually just too good for the school and the school denied them realizing they'll get into one of the better UC's. Should I be ashamed of even getting into Irvine, and take it as a warning that I'm probably going to get denied into UCLA which was the hail Mary shot for me. I really want to be proud but everyone's kind of just talking down the school. Now I just have to deal with out of state tuition",1615987670,1,0

Commencement 2021 is virtual,"ZotMail just went out about Commencement from Vice Chancellor Banks

---

I write to provide an update on our plans for Commencement this June. Unfortunately, we will not be able to offer a traditional Commencement ceremony due to the health and safety concerns still presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated State and County restrictions. However, we are finalizing plans to provide our graduating students with a Commencement stage experience and photo opportunity, to be paired with a virtual ceremony and receptions.

Like many of you, I am disappointed that we are again unable to celebrate our graduating students‚Äô accomplishments in person, but public health and safety must continue to take precedence. Though circumstances may improve by June, it takes months of planning to prepare for our usual festivities, which draw over 70,000 visitors from around the world. While vaccines are becoming more available, we are unable to predict the state of our public health and immunity in June.

The following plan reflects careful consideration that allows us to celebrate our graduating students in a way that is meaningful, but reflects the uncertainty that the pandemic continues to present us.

* Virtual campuswide Commencement ‚Äî June 12, 2021 at 9 a.m. PDT.  
All graduating students will be invited to join a campuswide virtual ceremony that will include speeches and the conferring of degrees. Graduates will also be able to share this occasion with family and friends.
 
* Virtual school/college receptions* ‚Äî Each school and college will have individual virtual receptions on June 12, 2021 immediately following the virtual campuswide Commencement. These receptions will offer the personalized recognition our graduates deserve and the ability to remotely share this moment with their family and friends.
 
* In-person, student-only Stage Moment (pending local health guidelines and conditions) ‚Äî We know that crossing the stage is an important part of graduation and we plan to hold an in-person, student-only Stage Moment opportunity after the virtual ceremony and receptions. The dates are yet to be determined, and no family members or other guests will be allowed to accompany graduates. However, the Stage Moment will be live-streamed and recorded for guests to safely view at home. We will know more as we approach June whether the Stage Moment opportunity can occur and will communicate at the earliest opportunity.

More detailed planning is still underway, and we will share more information directly with our graduates as they are confirmed. For general Commencement questions, please contact the Commencement Office.",1615945170,1,0

Michael Dennin's reason was that Said wasn't doing a sufficient job, despite praising Said for his great work when questioned about it after. Said started UROP and championed for student research.

UCI TAG,"Hi guys!

I am currently in my second semester of my freshman year at community college. UCI is my dream school and my goal is to transfer using TAG. I am a biology major and I'm pretty sure I'll end this semester with a B in chemistry. This has been stressing me out a lot, as the GPA to TAG into UCI is one of the highest among the other transfer schools. Will I still be able to TAG into UCI if I have one B per semester, especially if I am a bio major getting a B in chem?

Graduation Anxiety as a Transfer,"As June comes rolling around, I've been getting more and more anxious to graduate. I am planning on taking a couple gap years to get experience, but not having school is something I have not experienced since I was probably a toddler. I think having school gave me some structure, but now going out in the real world is super scary to me, especially with my anxiety of new situations and change. I don't know how to stop thinking about it.

Also, as a Fall 2019 transfer, I've been feeling super down about literally only experiencing college for 6 months (barely). I've been super down as I basically didn't make any friends and now am leaving college with not knowing anyone. I've already been super introverted but tried a lot to make friends in my online classes throughout this past year. My roommates stay in their rooms all day so I can't even talk to them and idk I just feel like I didn't gain anything from college besides a degree which I know is what I came here for but I've been waiting to go to college for as long as I can remember. I only got through community college knowing that I can at least enjoy 2 years of real college and have a great time. Now, I am being forced to move back home in June and have no independence once again for god knows how long. I just feel like I haven't grown and will now go back to being treated like I'm a child at home.

To all my fellow Fall 2019 Transfers, how are yall going through it? I really can't help but pity myself which I hate doing bc I know people have real problems in life, but college really is once in a lifetime kind of thing and knowing I missed out on all the fun times sucks especially since I literally have no new friends made. I don't have the option of staying another year and just knowing that I won't have time to enjoy my life since its work, grad school, then more work just really sucks.

Sorry for the long post, but idk if yall have any advice or just wanna rant too for all my graduating seniors.

I really don't want to start in-person classes again.,"I know a lot of people are doing terribly under the pandemic and online classes. And I haven't exactly thrived in this type of environment either, but I absolutely ***dread*** the idea of going back to in-person classes. 

There's a lot of pros and cons with online learning, but the deciding factor has always been my commute-- my pain in the ass, 3 to 4 hour round trip commute, back and forth from North OC to Irvine every single day.

I just can't do it y'all. After driving only very short distances with moderate conditions for an entire year, I have no damn clue how I'm going to spend keep myself sane making the 1h45m trip down to Irvine every morning again. So much time wasted, so much money spent on gas, so much stress because of traffic. I enjoy my current 3 min commute to UCI, which mostly consists of powering up my computer and opening Zoom on Canvas. I enjoy the extra time I have to do other shit-- I read more books, I exercise regularly now, I even picked up several hobbies. I fucking crochet and play badminton for god fucking sake's like a high class, country-club type British woman whose only job is looking pretty and throwing charity parties, it's not something I ever imagined doing 1 year ago.

Manifest: Local Networking Web Application For UC System,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRW-w\_UIjYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRW-w_UIjYk)

The best way I can explain this app is with a Spongebob metaphor. In this episode, the krusty krab is the university/college system of clubs, resource centers, etc. and the bulletin board is the Manifest app. Manifest brings a bulletin board abstraction of messaging to the abstraction of the Krusty Krab, which is actually the entire university system of clubs, resource centers, and institutional orgs (thus currently working with UCSC Resource Centers and the rest of the UC system for this pitch).

Manifest could be a community bulletin board machine of great good, so long as it is free from unlawful censorship and has community standards that facilitate amazing and inspiring interactions.

Here is a more formal pitch for a web app I'm working on called Manifest to connect clubs on campus within UCSC (my school) and the rest of the UC system (including UCI):

* What is the Manifest app? Messaging for local communities.
* What is the problem it solves? Sharing information between locals quickly and efficiently.
* So what, who cares? It may help to streamline events, activities, and more in real-time within the local area. There are so many steps to joining a club, promoting events, and emailing groups‚ÄîManifest was created to unify these activities in a local platform.
* Demo link: [https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)

Here are the instructions to install the app on any smartphone home screen by going to the demo URL ([https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)):

1. Have location services enabled via Privacy &gt; Location Services (on) &gt; Safari Websites (Ask or Allow)
2. Have location services enabled via General Settings &gt; Safari &gt; Location &gt; Ask/Allow, you can add the app to your home screen via the Safari app on iPhone.
3. Once added to the home screen, it should work as a native iPhone app.
4. After location is enabled, here are similar Android instructions to add on home screen: [https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en)
5. Note: to enable location on Android, it is required that Google Chrome settings allow for the location to load, and this must be adjusted via Chrome or the default browser.

The url to access the site and add to home screen is: [https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)

The main bet behind Manifest is the idea that locals can share contextual information more quickly and efficiently than anywhere else on the web.

Looking for a place for Fall 2021-Spring 2022 Year Off or On-Campus,"Hello,

I am an incoming transfer student who is fully Vaccinated with the Pfizer Vaccine who is looking for either an on-campus ACC sublease for a private 1 bedroom, private 1 bathroom floor plan, or a private 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom in a 2b-2b floor plan in any of these communities: Plazaverde/Camino Del Sol/VDC &amp; VDC Norte OR an off-campus housing with a private 1 bedroom and private 1 bathroom as close to the campus as possible.

I am currently waiting for an offer for the ACC housing I applied for which supposedly gets announced for transfers in June, but since it is so competitive I will shoot my shot here as a backup in case someone has a place for me.

Looking for some advice,"The club I'm currently in is opening up board positions but they didn't open up any big positions like president, vice president, treasurer, or secretary. Some examples of positions they did open was the social chair, marketing &amp; outreach chair, and community service position (all which I'm not interested in). Instead, they are letting the bigger positions (president, vice president, etc.) from this year continue their term for another year... They were not even transparent enough to explain why this is the case. Is this corrupt or am I overthinking things? 

Some background on me, I have been a very dedicated member in this organization for my entire time at UCI and I even got the chance to work with them as an intern. I have not missed a single meeting for this org since everything has gone virtual and I even volunteer with this club when half of their board members don't show up. Since I heard that board apps would open up for the 2021-2022 term, I wanted to go for the president or treasurer position because I was trained for that role as an intern. However, since the president is deciding to stay, I would have to choose a different position like a community service chair, even though I would be put at a disadvantage (since the community service chair has their own interns) and I have had no training in that position. 

Hearing this news has made me lose tremendous respect for this org but I already put so much time and effort into this org already. As someone who already has a senior standing and plans to graduate next year, I wouldn't have another chance to apply for board positions next year or the year after. I feel so conflicted because I wanted to be on board for an org that I am passionate about. I really like the goals and message of this org but I don't like how board has handled this situation. I believe that I am a strong candidate for any position offered because of how much I've done but the question is should I apply to be on board anyway despite the way this org has handled this situation?

Anyone else have experience with laundry items going missing at UTC?,"I‚Äôm living in UTC Dartmouth and a couple weeks ago I did my laundry. A hand towel I had washed was missing.

Puerta del Sol Missing package on Wed 1/20,"So I sent a package to my girlfriend this week because she was having a really bad week and the package was either stolen or sent to the wrong address. I called UPS numerous amounts of times and all I keep getting is ""We'll look into"".

If anyone has any information or may have taken the package by mistake please contact me. The contents don't have much value to someone that may have taken it but they have TONS of sentimental value.

"Lifedeather's official statement in regards to ""Scamming"" accusations levied against me on this sub.","Hey everyone! It's Lifedeather, here to issue an official statement in regards to the accusations of being a ""Scammer"", levied against me by a couple Redditors here.  It‚Äôs been real tough the last couple of days writing this official statement, and I been having thoughts of dropping it midway and just ignoring the accusations altogether but I thought everyone should know the general premise of this story so as to not be misinformed and to finally silence the amount of hate/death threats that I have been receiving in the DMS and other places. **THIS STORY CONTINUES INTO THE COMMENTS!!!!**

Before I start, I would like to say a couple things. NEVER assume anything about anyone or anything(situation) especially if you have no knowledge about it other than a couple of Reddit posts that say ‚ÄúX person did this, this guy was bad‚Äù and then just bandwagon onto this. You have no idea how this situation played out, the context, what happened that day, or anything else surrounding that person. Most of you don‚Äôt know me, Most of you dont know what I have been going through my whole life. I sincerely hope everyone reconsiders the timing of bring up someone‚Äôs past, especially on a post that in no way has anything to do with my past. I simply poured my heart out into a writing piece here for Professor Pattis that I found to be an enjoyable use of my free time, there was no reason to suddenly bring my past into this. I hope everyone will learn to be more considerate of others. I have known people who passed away due to the hate they got, their death notes, their suicides. If this hadn't been me receiving all these hate messages, someone more fragile than me could have easily been driven into self-harm/suicide/depression‚Ä¶ and suffer far heavier reprucssions. Learn how your actions affect someone before sprouting out some immediate accusation and learn that not everyone will be comfortable remembering or answering questions about a touchy subject/event. This was a very touchy subject for me, and one I never expected to make a formal ‚Äústatement‚Äù. This event contributed to a mental disorder and symptom of PTSD for me, and with Redditors digging out an old relic of my past has surfaced some very nasty and unhealthy memories for me, leading me to sink deeper into depression, suicidal thoughts and panic attacks the past few days. I was not able to sleep well with the constant resurgence of nightmares, and have since contacted a therapist to restart a couple of my previous therapy sessions in regards to this traumatic event. 

What you are about to read following this message is a semi-detailed recount on the events taking place and leading up to these accusations. I will not deny the ‚ÄúScammer‚Äù status associated with my name currently on Reddit, but I thought I should give everyone who cares to read a bit more insight into what happened. Many names will be replaced throughout for the sake of anonymity, and this message will be presented(modified if needed) should further instances of this incident be brought up in the future. While I dont expect everyone to read this whole thing(ill try to include a TLDR) or believe this fully and continue making jokes/threats over this(thinking i'm over exaggerating), this should help inform a few people who do care. I will address questions as needed, however I will not be responding further to hateful comments against me after this official statement has been posted. This official statement should include all you need to know about the events that transpired. I probably missed something in the disclaimers but without further ado, let‚Äôs get into it. 

WARNING: The below story **IN THE COMMENTS** includes some Violent/Graphic content/context that can make some people very uncomfortable. If you experience any of these thoughts or are fairly touchy about subjects such as death, suicide, guns, blood...etc then please do not read forward and instead just take away that the accusations thrown out against me are not what you think they are, and that the world isnt perfect, not everyone is going to be a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, and that you should always be very wary of yourself and others. Thank you.

It was 2019, two years ago back when I was still in High School. I had just gotten into Humble Bundle(a site where you used to get a selected few games each month). I usually picked out one game I liked a month and considered it a ‚Äúgood purchase‚Äù, however I never really realized what I could do with the other games that didnt really fit with my tastes. I discovered a Reddit known as SteamGameSwap back then where you could trade games for other games! This peaked my interest immediately as I saw Humble Games were pretty common to be traded back there, and I could quickly snag a few games I actually want in exchange for some ones I didnt really need. Needless to say, I skimmed over the rules fairly quickly, linked my steam account and joined. The first few trades went off great without a hitch, I was receiving positive feedback and everything went well and both sides were happy(if you search for positive feedback from me, im sure you can find it somewhere). However one day I started escalating the value of my trades. I really was into getting League of Legend(LOL the MOBA) Skins back in the day, and I had $300+ in my Steam(Platform for Gaming) currency that I saved up through hard work at my old job. I posted a post on SGS(Steam Game Swap) that asked for $100 dollars in Riot Points(currency for League Skins) in exchange for $100 Steam Currency(I was willing to go a bit more). No one really replied until a few days later when a man ‚ÄúH‚Äù contacted me on Steam. H stated that he could get me the $100 Riot Points and anything else I needed, that should have been a red mark from the beginning as he didnt comment on my post, and added me on steam instead. I did not check his steam level or profile at the time, otherwise I would have noticed that ‚ÄúH‚Äù was impersonating a high level reputable trader also named ‚ÄúH‚Äù. The conversation went back and forth and we decided that he would trade a $100 RP card for around $150 Steam Currency, I really wanted RP so I didnt care if he made off with a bit more than I was getting, it was common practice in SGS back then for currency values to be taken into account. The conversation turned even more sketchy when ‚ÄúH‚Äù sprouted his amazing feedback(which he took from the real ‚ÄúH‚Äù) and asked for the person with lower rep to go first which was me. He was being a bit detached from the questions I asked him, and refused to go first. I asked how we would do things, and he decided I would buy a CSGO(Steam Shooter, counter strike) cheap gun skin to transfer the money from the Steam Workshop then he would get me my code. I found his gun and bought it(not realizing at the time workshop purchases were permanent and nonrefundable), he said that he received the money and would be getting my RP code now, so I waited happily for 5 minutes before I asked him if he was done. My message was not delivered as I had been blocked. I had just been Scammed. I dont know what happened the rest of that day except constant sadness, tears, and trying to get my money back. I did research and found the real ‚ÄúH‚Äù and added him on Steam. I told him about what happened, he said that it was a ‚ÄúCommon Scam‚Äù and that he would add something in his profile to tell others to watch out for impersonators then quickly removed me. (He never added a warning and didnt seem to care much). I wasnt able to get a refund from steam or anything(reported him and got him trade banned though), I tried really stupid ideas like a Gofundme which raised a whopping $5 which I never claimed. I tried a lot of sites that claimed to help but none really worked out. I gave up for the night and passed out. A few days later, strange things were happening. My Minecraft Skin was changed, my email asked me if it was me logging in, I couldnt log into many of my games, and I couldnt access accounts such as Reddit or Paypal. It didnt really hit me until a few days later that I had probably been hacked(I think maybe one of the sites I signed up for/gave info to that promised to help). I was eventually able to recover only SOME of the accounts(mostly important ones let me back in phew), only to discover that massive damage have been done. Multiple threats and harassment has been levied against my ‚Äúname‚Äù of Lifedeather. Going into Reddit specifically, those threads of ‚ÄúLifedeather‚Äù scamming them caught my eye, and I saw I was banned on SGS. During those days I was recovering my account, whoever was in my account did a lot of bad stuff. Responding to comments, conversation with mods, scamming others and so much more. At that time I was super busy and in a bad place IRL and couldnt keep up with the responses/accusations back then, so I tried to keep them low as I tried to fix stuff IRL. Some time passes, and one of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù links me to a post that I had seen where it says I was a Scammer on SGS(yall posted it probably), I ignored them for a while, and said I was sorting it out. He continued to bombard me with more and more links of my so called ‚Äúwrongdoings‚Äù whilst I kept denying it and said I would talk about it later. He offered to meet up IRL and talk about it with me, so I agreed thinking it would be good to explain my side of the story. 

We meet up in a secluded area of my town(note that my town was notorious for fights, gangs, drugs and more) as he planned. This friend ill call ‚ÄúG‚Äù, asked me about my side of the story, and I explained it to him. As I was explaining I noticed he would roll his eyes, nod a little, and not really pay attention. Everytime I explained something, he would bombard me with more accusations and questions to probably see if I would trip up somewhere. It was getting more and more clear he didnt believe me, and eventually he started being quiet altogether. Eventually, I had to head back home for dinner so I told him that if he wanted anything else. He didnt reply, he had his eyes closed, I thought he might even have fallen asleep or semi-dozed off. I told him paraphrasing ‚Äúwell I have to go, if you have any more questions on this just let me know man‚Äù, and he continued to not answer so I stood up and assumed he was sleeping and turned around and started to walk off the cliff/hill which we were seated at. I walk a few steps and hear an odd sound. I didnt actually feel any different at the time so I tried to locate the source of the noise, and turned around only to see ‚ÄúG‚Äù standing up fully awake with a gun/pistol aimed at me. I was still confused and was about to ask him about the gun, when I felt a sharp, burning sensation near my stomach. I put my hand near my stomach and saw it had blood when I raised it back up. Only then, did I have a nagging feeling of what was going on. I was shot, immediately I felt the pain reared itself and I fell to the ground, coughing up blood. Without even a moment to talk, ‚ÄúG‚Äù was on me, punching, kicking, and a lot of gory details that I dont want to really say. The only thing I remember for certain was ‚ÄúG‚Äù at one point saying ‚ÄúScammers dont deserve to leave‚Äù which stuck with me even to this day, very very chilling. Some time passes, and I was slowly bleeding out, now suffering a fractured nose. I was in immense pain and tears, and eventually sirens sound from somewhere and ‚ÄúG‚Äù gets scared and runs off. I was shaking this whole time and barely pulled out my phone to dial my mom first, to let her know that I was ok, and I would be coming back soon for dinner, apologizing that I was late(tried not to worry her), then I tried to dial 911, and got a hold of the operator and explained my situation. I remember only talking halfway before passing out. When I awoke I was in the ER, and people explained to me that I had lost a lot of blood, glad that the bullet didnt hit vital organs, broken nose(I already had a feeling on this), and that I was in a coma/passed out for a few hours. I dont want to talk to much on the touchy stuff but my mom was a mom crying and stuff, and the medical people went on a speel on how lucky I was to be alive‚Ä¶ and that I was to rest and all that. Cops came, and I was asked to give a name in which I said I dont remember, it happened so fast(I didnt think Snitching was a good idea at the time, especially with my neighboorhood). They filled out a quick report and left. This was a moment that really changed me and both how I viewed the world and the people of it, even today I am way more suspicious and distrustful of a lot of people in this world. Since then, I made sure nothing like this would happen again, I learned how to defend myself and so much more, I also dropped this situation and didnt pursue any sort of mention/charges against him in fear of future harm. Continuing the story, none of my other friends really know what happened between ‚ÄúG‚Äù and me, but eventually another one of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù brought up another article of ‚ÄúScamming‚Äù they found while browsing Reddit. I told him my story(nothing about G), and he believed me just through online! He said that I should still be the morally responsible person and get in touch with everyone that was ‚ÄúScammed‚Äù and pay them back. I located as much people as I could and did indeed buy them the games they were owned, in cases of where the result was a Paypal loss, I believed that I just left that as it was as they got their money back anyways. My friend(‚ÄúK‚Äù lets call this one) said they would pay me back all the money I lost by Christmas if I gave the ‚ÄúScammed‚Äù games now. It was so funny and stupid of me to think that was true. Everytime I asked, I would be met by an excuse until eventually they stopped responding even though I provided them proof that I refunded those that were wronged. Eventually, I moved away from that place into a better area where I am today and now go to college. I lost all contact with ‚ÄúG‚Äù and ‚ÄúK‚Äù and maybe its for the best. They still come to haunt me in my dreams and thoughts time to time, but they were mostly forgotten. A few other details/specifics are excluded here but that brings me back to the present day where I am now a student at UCI. 

Now hopefully a few of you understand why this experience was so traumatizing for me, I nearly lost my life and I will definitely not deny that this incident shaped me to how I am today, more cold, less trusting and suspicious of everyone and everything. I went for therapy and a few treatment sessions and was able to push down these negative thoughts and the event until it recently resurfaced. I have also been in contact with the Mods of SGS in the past and currently in an attempt to get my name cleared, but the communication is inconsistent. Some of the times I am completely ignored, sometimes tehy asked me for proof of compensating everyone that ‚ÄúI‚Äù had wronged, which I showed the best I could through a few instances and cases and afterwards become ignored. This time, I am currently waiting back on a response from SGS mods, but I will likely not touch trading for a long time even if SGS clears me. Im not expecting much since SGS mods are technically ignoring me again, but I guess ill ping them a few more times with some DM replies and let it go again for a while. This post has already been long as it is, so I think ill end it here now. Let me know if anyone has any questions, and again I will not be responding to negative comments/accusations after this post is issued. This has been a hard post to post, but im glad I got it out of the way finally. It feels a bit better to let loose all these thoughts, and I hope some of you will understand part of the reason for why I am the way I am these days.

TLDR: Got games I didnt want, found Steam Game Swap to trade on Reddit, Scammed by Impersonator on Steam claiming to be someone else losing money in the process, Accounts Hacked, Friend brings up articles of me ‚ÄúScamming‚Äù,  Met up with a Friend to discuss who decided to backstab me and Shoot me/Beat me up, Went to ER/Traumaitized/Therapy/PTSD, Other Friend brings up another few articles on me ‚ÄúScamming‚Äù and promises to pay me back after I compensate those who lost things due to ‚ÄúMe‚Äù, I fufill my end and Other Friends ignores me until eventually no response ever again. SGS mods keep ignoring me, demand evidence, I provide as much as I can, and they do nothing against harassment I receive or even consider my ban appeal even up to now, Will try a few more times but dont expect much. Let me know if anyone has questions.",1612061126,1,0
LSAC GPA bad grade,"So I got an F two years ago, retook the class and replaced it with an A. I want to apply to law school, but LSAC is going to count the F in my GPA because it's technically visible on my transcript. Is there any way I can go to the registrar to petition to have it removed. 

I realize that it's probably not possible, but you never really know. Has anyone had experience with this?",1612057023,1,0
