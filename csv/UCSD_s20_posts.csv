The specific event is the Target back to school event. It's the second featured on the site. I've also copy pasted the details below. I think this is a cool event to help students save on grocery costs.

On Saturday, January 25th, Target will be hosting a special back to school event for UCSD students from 12 PM - 6 PM. Hop on our Grocery Shuttle so you don't miss this event!

Students will have the option to receive a 10% off coupon for Good and Gather products, or a 5% off coupon for total store purchase. In addition, there will be free giveaways from the Target Team between 12 PM - 2 PM of hand sanitizer, pencils/pens, granola bars, chapstick, etc.

What does this mean?,"Hi,

So I received an email about this and I'm not sure what the meaning of this is. Does this mean I won't be receiving cal grant anymore? I am currently enrolled in 12 units and I am worried I will not be receiving cal grant anymore. Below is the email they sent me: 

Based on current records, it appears you are enrolled in less than 15 units for the Spring 2020 quarter. Waitlisted courses do not count as enrolled units.

Cal Grant funding is limited to four academic years. In order to graduate in four years, you must complete 15 units or more per quarter. Please view the academic plan for your major and, after you have completed your first quarter of classes at UC San Diego, contact your college and major academic advising offices for additional guidance.

Please note: Enrollment of 12 units or more per quarter does not impact the amount of your financial aid. Enrollment of less than 12 units may impact the amount you receive. Visit Enrollment Requirements for additional information.

NEWS: All those who can are encouraged to move off-campus. Those who decide to move away from campus housing will receive a full refund of housing fees. All instruction (including labs and small discussions) will now be remote.,"From coronavirus.ucsd.edu

As health and safety are our first priority, we are taking actions to significantly increase social distance on our campus:

**HOUSING**

* To lower the density on campus, we are strongly urging students who can safely leave to do so as soon as feasible, but no later than March 29. This will allow the remaining students who are not able to leave campus the recommended space for effective social distancing.
* Students should consider living on campus during the Spring Quarter only if they satisfy at least one of the following conditions: those who are without access to stable housing; who come from housing/food insecure households; who are unable to travel home; who are from areas highly impacted by COVID-19 or regions at risk for a COVID-19 outbreak; who are unable to relocate without high risk to their safety; and those who would be relocating to homes that lack infrastructure to accommodate virtual instruction.
* Students who notify Housing, Dining &amp; Hospitality of their intention to move out and turn in their keys before March 29 will receive a full refund for Spring Quarter housing costs. Information can be found on the [Housing, Dining &amp; Hospitality website](http://hdh.ucsd.edu/).¬†

**SPRING QUARTER INSTRUCTION UPDATE**

* Spring Quarter instruction will commence on March 30, as originally scheduled. To reduce anxiety and demonstrate compassion for our students, we strongly recommend that faculty consider the following for the first week of instruction: (a) taking measures to help students familiarize themselves with the remote instruction tools for the course, (b) making review and introductory material available via other methods, such as email or Google docs, so students joining the course late can catch up, and (c) refraining from having assignments or assessments due that week.
* To further enhance opportunities for social distancing, ALL UC San Diego courses will be offered remotely for the entire Spring Quarter, including laboratories, studio classes, small group discussions and seminars. There will be no exceptions. Students will participate in all courses remotely, regardless of where they reside.",1584402132,7,0

Recent San Diego County Update," https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/coronavirus-update-san-diego-county-board-of-supervisors/2286803/ 

 

San Diego County's public health order, which included nine mandates and three strong recommendations, was meant to slow the spread. The following orders were issued:

1. All public gatherings of 50 or more are prohibited. The county had originally prohibited gatherings of 250 or more but changed the policy following new recommendations from the Centers for Disease and Prevention
2. All non-essential gatherings of any size are strongly discouraged
3. Establishments that serve alcohol but no food are ordered to close. Restaurants must close all on-site dining, though odering for pick up or drive-thru will still be allowed
4. All businesses should enact social distancing and should use telecommuting when possible. Businesses that use policies requiring doctor‚Äôs notes for sick days should terminate the practice immediately
5. Parents should ensure that their children are following \[what I am not sure - this is cut and pasted from the article which hopefully will get updated\]
6. The County urges anyone age 65 years or older and those with underlying health issues to self-isolate
7. Non-essential personnel are prohibited from entering hospitals or long-term care facilities
8. Hospitals and healthcare should take measures to preserve resources including delaying nonemergency procedures where feasible
9. Hospitals must report all positive COVID-19 tests to the county immediately
10. All people arriving in the county from locations as found on the CDC warning level 3 travel advisory list shall be subject to 14-day home quarantine and self-monitoring
11. A strong recommendation for people exhibiting mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 to self-isolate in their place of residence until seeking medical care/treatment",1584399787,2,0

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Chancellor Khosla,

I hope you and your family are healthy during these stressful times. As I‚Äôm sure you are aware, UCSD closed their libraries this morning. This potentially prevents students of lower income houses to take their exams as they may not have access to a computer, reliable internet, or a quiet study room. Moreover, UCSD health just announced that it has two confirmed cases of COVID-19. Every UCSD student I have talked to in the past week has told me the same thing about not being able to focus on studying. Social media echoes the same message. Almost no one is in the correct mindset to take these exams. 

Also, many students such as myself do not have their families in San Diego. I want to be with them and take care of my parents so that nothing can harm them, but instead, I‚Äôm at UCSD waiting for finals to be over so that I can try to focus here rather than in a full household. With this, I hope you will seriously consider the following proposition of forcing all UCSD professors to make their exams optional. That way, students who are depending on the final for a good grade can still take it, while those who are too stressed, worried, or just want to be home can opt out. I seriously hope you‚Äôll consider this and I‚Äôm sure you will do what is best for UCSD and it‚Äôs students as you always do.

Triton Alert Confirmed case of COVID-19 at UCSD,"March 16, 2020

To: ALL ACADEMICS, STAFF AND STUDENTS AT UC SAN DIEGO

Subject:  Triton Alert: Confirmed cases of COVID-19 at UC San Diego      

As of March 14, 2020, UC San Diego confirmed that two health workers at UC San Diego Health have tested positive for novel coronavirus, COVID-19, because of exposure and infection in the community. UC San Diego Health has launched an extensive effort to identify any patients or health system colleagues who may have been in recent contact with either of the affiliates.


UC San Diego continues to follow all public health directives and protocols and is working closely with the San Diego County Public Health Department, San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health.


A key component of reducing the spread of the virus is the isolation of individuals known to be infected with the virus as well as those who are awaiting test results.


Anyone who is experiencing the symptoms associated with the virus, chiefly a cough, fever and shortness of breath, should contact their healthcare provider. If you choose to go to an urgent care center or emergency department, call ahead and let them know you are coming.


Please stay abreast of the latest communications from UC San Diego at the COVID-19 webpage at http://coronavirus.ucsd.edu.  See also http://ucsd.edu, and https://ucsd.edu/about/emergency.html.

We will continue make regular updates and provide details about modified campus operations as new information is available.

I reckon we ought to start a drinking game,"In these desperate and confusing times, we‚Äôve gotta go ahead and make our own fun, especially since everything around us is closing down. So I decided, why not do it with a pastime many Tritons enjoy, drinking yourself silly. 

Every time the university walks back on a previous commitment with respect to the way campus will operate during this crisis, take a shot. For instance,

Last Tuesday, the administration said there‚Äôll be remote learning until 5/10. They later extended it quarter-long. Take a shot. 

Until last Thursday or so, the administration insisted gyms and recreation would remain operational. Yesterday, they closed them down. Take a shot. 

Until yesterday, they insisted the libraries would remain open. Now they‚Äôre closed. Take a shot. 

Future occasions you‚Äôll be able to take a shot include (but isn‚Äôt limited to) when the dining halls close down and when Price Center closes down. 

Have fun!

P.S. I know why they‚Äôre walking back, I just think it‚Äôs interesting how whilst most authorities go 100% with their containment efforts and then gradually turn it down as the situation improves, this university decides to start at 10% and rapidly turns it up as they realize the gravity of the situation.",1584382212,2,0

PSA: Coronavirus responsible for more fatalities than Influenza in Italy (by month),"I‚Äôve seen a number of people on Instagram / Facebook spreading bullshit about how you‚Äôre more likely to perish from the flu compared to coronavirus and downplaying the severity. There‚Äôs also lots of people posting stories of themselves out drinking or at parties. 

**3.5 weeks ago:** 3 cases of coronavirus in Italy. 
**Today:** 25,000+ cases of coronavirus, 1,800+ deaths in Italy. 

The influenza claims an [average of roughly 17,000](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(19)30328-5/fulltext) Italians each year, or 1,400 per month (this varies by year and season).

Professor Godula has an optional final for people to take this Wednesday. I calculated my grade and I currently have an 86% in his class.

I'm also scared for the final, since I'm not too ready because of all the coronavirus situation. If the final is open note/book/everything, people will technically do better, which means the curve will be higher. The final also harms me if I do bad.

Join graduate students today for an AMA about the ongoing strike at UCSC for a Cost of Living Adjustment!,"Today from 1:00-3:00p Pacific, several graduate students and one of our undergraduate allies from UC Santa Cruz will be hosting an AMA to answer questions about the ongoing teaching strike currently taking place. Students at UCSC have been engaging in a wildcat strike since December of last year to fight for a cost of living adjustment as a result of wage stagnation amidst unchecked housing cost inflation and one of the highest costs of living in the United States.

Our strike has been growing, and solidarity movements have popped up at several other UC campuses, as well as a number of campuses nationwide. We were even endorsed last night by Senator Bernie Sanders.

You can find out more about the strike at [https://payusmoreucsc.com/](https://payusmoreucsc.com/), and of course, please join us below and ask us anything!

CSE 101 with Ragesh Jaiswal,"I just felt that this needed to be posted so that future people who take this class can know what they are up against. 

I just got done writing a CAPES review about how he can improve this course, ultimately not recommending him as a professor. Please delay taking this class until you find a different professor.

Here's an imgur I have uploaded about Piazza screenshots from the class.

Advice for grad classes in CSE.,I'm struggling in CSE 250B in particular. All the quizzes are a lot harder and different from the practice homeworks.

Let's talk about COLA at UCSD," 

COLA seems to have some pretty blind and uninformed support at UCSD. If you want to show solidarity, make sure it's something that a) you agree with and b) makes sense. Lots of ""activism"" at UCSD is mostly pithy lines about admin not caring about students, but let's take a look at the facts.

If you don't know COLA=Cost Of Living Adjustment, meant to account for the disparate cost of living in various places (e.g. SF v. Fresno).

TAs currently get paid \~$44,000 a year (1/2 of which is tuition reimbursement) for a 0.5 FTE appointment (\~$88,000 a year if they were FTEs). Another thing that COLA protesters seem to ignore is that TAs are NOT a $25k financial liability for the system - they are almost double that because they pay ZERO tuition.

So, you receive $44k in financial benefit, but you still only have \~$22k liquid to pay for COL, right? That must be really hard, especially when rent is the biggest line item in COL?

Wrong, grad housing is extremely heavily subsidized by HDH (incidentally funded by undergrads) to such an extent that it is \~$600-$800 per person per month. This is the weirdest point of all from COLA perspective - why do you need COLA if you are living in subsidized housing (or it is available in &lt;1 year)?

I can't speak for other campuses (i.e. SC), but at UCSD, COLA really doesn't make much sense at all, not even touching the insane expense of a 25%+ raise to grad students currently being paid on a $88k a year scale.

tl;dr Grad students at UCSD make \~$44k a year working half-time, don't pay any tuition (i.e. are not expected like most professional students to take out loans), and don't pay San Diego housing costs - COLA doesn't make any sense at UCSD.",1583214092,1,0

I once heard that they went by units but I actually have *more units than average* for a junior. I took a lot of lower div. community college classes for fun before transferring. So what's the deal?

Restroom tap water,"My suite does not have a kitchen, how safe is it to drink restroom faucet water?

Yes,   I understand that kitchen faucet water and restroom faucet water (and   toilet water) likely come from the same source, but how is the general   quality of UCSD tap water overall, for example can we be confident that   there are no metals, chemicals, or bacteria in it that would not be   recommended to drink everyday? Can I safely use this water to cook   grains?

My second and biggest   concern is that the faucet is located in the restroom which is in close   proximity to urine and fecal matter. If I wash to was bowls, dishes,  and  vegetables in there everyday what are the chances that eventually I   will ingest germs,etc. that make me sick?

TL;DR:  I want to wash dishes and cook grains, but the only water source in my suite is the faucet in the restroom where dirty hands that touch urine  and feces also touch the faucet. Will I get sick?",1581057786,1,0
UC Irvine Post-Bacc Program in Psychological Science,"This may be of interest to some UCSD students and/or alum:

The Department of Psychological Science at the University of California, Irvine is currently accepting applications to our post-baccalaureate program in psychological science (the deadline to apply for Fall 2020 is May 22nd).¬†

**Program** **Overview:**¬†¬†UCI‚Äôs Post-Baccalaureate Program in Psychological Science is a certificate program that combines psychology coursework with research and/or internship experience. It is designed for people who have a bachelor‚Äôs degree (in any discipline); who are interested in a psychology-related graduate program, career development, or career change; and who could benefit from additional coursework, research and/or real-life work experience in psychology. Those interested in doctoral-level or master‚Äôs degree programs in a range of areas of psychology (including clinical/counseling psychology, social/personality psychology, developmental psychology, health psychology, psychology &amp; the law, and school psychology) or health (e.g., public health, medical school) can strengthen their graduate school applications by completing our program, which offers an individualized course of study based on each person‚Äôs qualifications and goals.¬†¬†Students who have completed our program have been accepted to a wide variety of graduate programs, including Ph.D. programs at UC Berkeley, Cornell University, and UC Irvine; Psy.D. programs at Cal Lutheran, University of Indianapolis, and Yeshiva University, and Master's programs at NYU, Columbia, and UCLA.

**Program** **Description:**¬†¬†The program consists of eight courses, which may include lower- and upper-division lectures, small seminars (including advanced statistics and research methods), hands-on research lab courses, and/or hands-on internship courses.¬† The program can be completed at the student‚Äôs own pace, in as little as 9 months or in as many as 24 months, depending upon one‚Äôs schedule and preferences.¬† A faculty advisor will work closely with students to help plan courses and provide guidance on obtaining letters of recommendation, choosing graduate programs, writing personal statements, and applying for jobs.¬† In addition, students will have the opportunity to attend our weekly departmental colloquia and other special events and to interact with our community of faculty, researchers, and graduate students.¬† For more¬†information, please visit:¬†[https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/post-bacc-page/post-baccalaureate-program-psychological-science](https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/post-bacc-page/post-baccalaureate-program-psychological-science)

Rude Library Walk Vendor,"sorry this is kinda long, I'm still pissed off :(

So basically yesterday the jewelry vendor near the Stussy tent offered to bring another set of the earrings I was going to buy but in a different color and gems with the promise that I would buy both from her at the special price of $20 (originally $15 each). I agreed and came back today but she lied about the ""custom"" earrings and gave me a totally different set so I pointed out that the ones she was showing me were the same ones she had the other day and were not to my liking so I was willing to buy the original pair for $15. From this point she started murmuring things and I felt bad so I picked a smaller pair similar to the ones I was going to buy and asked her if they were cheaper (surprise, they were not). I asked if it was okay to haggle and she agreed to this and also offered to remove the tax but got annoyed when I asked to lower the price from $28 to $25 since her original ""promised"" total price was $20. She mentioned that her earrings were made from fine gold and gems so I asked for a certificate to prove this and she started raising her voice to say that there was no need for that because she would know since she made them. She also said that there were no others like hers in the market and no one could reproduce them, as well as that if I didn't believe her or bought anything from her then I should try to make them myself.

To be honest, I was getting annoyed and asked her if she thought I could get a similar shape if I twisted wire into a hoop and intertwined another wire with gems attached to it. As soon as I said this she yanked the one pair of earrings I was originally going to buy (and still was interested in buying regardless of her comments) from my hands. She basically grabbed my fingers with a ridiculous amount of pressure and pushed my hands just so that she could grab it. Like wth lady, you could've asked me to put it down or maybe even shown me cheaper things to change my mind or try to justify your lack of certificates. She didn't stop there, she started removing all the earrings she had on her table as if I was going to steal them or copy her idea (but I mean she did suggest it?). When I asked her why she was doing all of this when I was still interested in buying the pair of earrings she yanked from my hand, she started cussing at me as if I wasn't there, so I just told her to have a nice day and left.

While I understand that hand-crafted jewelry takes time and effort, I personally think that raising your voice at customers and breaking physical boundaries is not the most effective way to increase sells. It's also kinda sad to have seen her act so nonchalant about her actions because there is other people that could go after her business or react either verbally or physically to her antics. I hope she's not like this with every student that tries to make a deal with her and that maybe she was just projecting having a bad day or something. But yikes lady wth.

Incoming freshman... with so many questions,"I got accepted to UCSD this year, Undeclared major in Warren college. First, what exactly does it mean for me to attend UCSD as ‚ÄúUndeclared‚Äù? Also, UCSD is my #1 choice and I am so excited to attend, but the only thing holding me back is tuition. I have out of state tuition with the sholes scholarship. I sent my FAFSA with an EFC of 34k yet I have an estimated tuition of 47k a year. My question is, once I attend UCSD, will this tuition go down because I will reside in California? Also, are there merit scholarships I can apply or be considered for as time goes on to further reduce the cost? Could I email the financial aid office and ask for a reevaluation? I have the CSS Profile and I think it would be a more realistic indicator of my financial aid status. 

I‚Äôm grateful for any input you may have!",1585469979,1,0

One last post about the Chegg situation and please help me get a better American perspective,"The last thread I made about this shows I've been very wrong about how cheating is viewed, handled, and the general attitude towards it. I am making this post to learn so please don't burn me on the stake.

I am an international student (not China or other common countries that are here at UCSD) who grew up in a foreign country where cheating is way more common, or at least I'm confident it is. What we are taught is that the US has a 0 tolerance policy starting high school / college. Many that aspire to be students here are constantly reminded that plagiarism, or blatant cheating, is handled very seriously.

Even back home, a situation like Chegg, is propostrous. But the comments and in my thread seems to disagree with my thoughts of what I thought to be true. It shows by the down votes on my comments, which shows that I am probably wrong about my previous beliefs, but no one cares to explain or respond directly. Rather just press the disagree button without giving me feedback or inisght into why they disagree or why I am wrong. Most actually don't address my point or brush it off like ""it's common"". 

I know cheating is common everywhere. But I am surprised that most here don't think this situation is unique or different from other form of cheating. I can only assume this is a cultural difference, but if that's the case, why aren't these forms of cheating more common?  


I am simply trying to understand what I have been told and what the reality is here so if someone can explain why this case is not unique and is not such a big deal. Because no matter how much I try to understand, I think bringing a cheat sheet that is now allowed is not nearly as bad as colluding with other classmates, posting (paying?) for Chegg tutors to do their exams for them. It's what China did with UCLA entrance exams, but just virtually, no?

I just want a better perspective and understand where the flaw in my logic is, or difference in cultural perspective. I am just trying to learn.  


I added some screen shots so it is easier to explain rather than going through the whole thread.  


[Completely being honest here, I thought caught meant something different.](https://preview.redd.it/od0sofaavip41.png?width=548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50b1c0d93a59fc30ddbdc34d215dbce972715158)

&amp;#x200B;

[Again, because I thought caught meant identified, getting away with it means something else, does this sound right?](https://preview.redd.it/7n21bdvdvip41.png?width=572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c48ea600470d3e7b40e8eefa9fa371752b19377)

&amp;#x200B;

[I think I did misinterpret it and people did not use the Chegg tutors? My fault for believing in Reddit exaggerations or misinformation if that's the case. Lesson learned.](https://preview.redd.it/me7h1w6vvip41.png?width=545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=679805cebfd28edcae54ffcd10df78ec94ee6fa5)

If someone can answer the questions to the comments that have disliked and not replied to, I'd really appreciate it. I can't believe this whole time I really thought someone used Chegg paid tutors to do their exam, and am also quite embarasseed I didn't know what caught actually meant.

"Wallet got stolen in Costa Verde Residential Parking, need advices","Seeing if I can get any help or advice here. 

I live in Costa Verde apt. I drove my car out for an errand yesterday morning and came back around noonish. I parked where I always parked in the residential parking structure and went back to my room. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt realize that I left my wallet in the car seat. I also don‚Äôt remember if I locked my car or not (I usually do)

About 12 hours later I went down to fetch my wallet, and I realized that someone had rummaged through my car and left a mess! 

Obviously missing was my wallet. Inside the wallet was my student ID, driver‚Äôs license, credit/debit cards, and a memento picture from my dad. So almost everything that was important to me.

I was in disbelief, shock, and furious. 

Now I‚Äôm trying to salvage what I can, though the timing cannot be worse, being weekend and with the quarantine situation. 

I filed a police report, and blocked all credit cards (my card seemed to have been used once afterward at a Chevron by the perpetrator, so I will be investigating tomorrow) 

Credit cards aren‚Äôt that big of deal, the more pressing concern is my driver‚Äôs license.

Any advice on how I can get a new driver‚Äôs license asap at this time?

Math 109 vs CSE 20,"So I am thinking of applying to try and switch into cse next year and then if I don't get the major I was thinking of switching into math-cs since I really just don't like EE. I was planning on adding a 5th class this spring quarter since things are online and I can focus more on studying and what not. So I was thinking of adding in Math 109 since it counts for cse 20 in the screening classes and would be useful if I do become math-cs. However I was wondering which one is ""better"" for future classes as I could take cse 20 in summer session. I am confused if by taking math 109 it will not cover concepts that I see in later cs classes like 100, 101, or 105 since I never took cse 20. So basically I am asking if I should take math 109 in spring quarter or should I wait till summer session and just try to take cse 20. 

Also if you suggest Math 109 any tips on doing well in the class I haven't had much exposure to proofs outside of math 18 which I didn't really like.",1585295624,1,0

COVID-19 fearmongering from The Guardian,"The Guardian keeps posting these fearmongering articles about housing COVID patients on campus and I actually find them very concerning. Not only that, but seeing some people's replies is rather quite appalling. [This](https://ucsdguardian.org/2020/04/06/breaking-nuevo-west-resident-alleges-university-housed-covid-19-patients-alongside-residents-weeks-ahead-of-official-announcement/) is the latest one.   


I find the tone of these articles a bit disturbing because they assume/imply:

1. that people in quarantine, minding their own business, are somehow a special threat to the community. (they are not)
2. that university purposely put them there to endanger the community. (they did not)
3. there's nothing the student can do to protect themselves from this ""special threat"" besides ""getting rid"" of them. (actually, people can just follow common sense precautions)

the whole point of quarantining means people are minimal threat to others. on campus housing isn't anything special, seriously us people who live off campus just deal with our neighbors, deal with the situation like everyone else. we just stay indoors, stay 6ft away from others, wash hands after touching the elevator buttons, etc. and we certainly don't sue our landlords or move halfway across the country just because our neighbors are sick, thats the most fooking absurd thing i have heard. 

i know this probably isn't the author's intent, but the message suggests that students should become angry at the university and ppl in quarantine, rather than to understand and take appropriate measures to protect themselves. people need to know that they can/how to take precautions to keep themselves and loved ones safe, not whatever shenanigans HDH is up to. 

I feel like these articles are really dangerous because they are backed by irrational covid-19 fear and lack scientific foundation. there's already enough misinformation and conspiracy theories out there, we dont need any more, much less from ucsd's official news paper. i get that people deserve to know the facts and hold the university responsible when the time comes. but this shit everywhere is just contributing to the paranoia and stigma against people with the virus who have to quarantine themselves. its not very scientific, and its not helping fight the virus.

ADVICE: Undergraduate transfer students applying to Grad School,"Hi friends! Sorry this is sort of long but I don‚Äôt really have anyone to go to about this. I am seeking advice regarding applying to grad school as a transfer student in undergrad. I transferred to UCSD Fall 2019 and will be graduating Spring 2021. Originally came in as a Marine Bio major but transferred to Bio Anthro in Winter 2020 for a few reasons. I am looking to apply to the MAS Marine Biodiversity and Conservation program at Scripps. I am confident in everything with the application except for letters of rec. I would need 3 for this program. Because I came in as a transfer who had a rough first quarter getting comfortable with the UC system and changing majors, I‚Äôve not had the best luck with trying to make relationships with professors. The program begins Summer 2021 so I don‚Äôt have a ton of time to create these relationships as the application process will start this fall. I am also someone who hasn‚Äôt been able to readily take unpaid internships and volunteer opportunities due to financial reasons. I‚Äôve volunteered a bit but nothing that a good letter of rec would come from. I have vast work experience in customer service and teaching (what my jobs have consisted of) and have done extremely well with promotions and employee recognition. However it seems like grad schools don‚Äôt want letters of rec from jobs that aren‚Äôt related to the field you‚Äôre going into. I was just wondering if any transfers have run into similar issues. Also if anyone has advice about what is acceptable for letters of rec that would be great! As someone who is extremely passionate and hard working with great ideas for my Capstone project I really feel I‚Äôd thrive in the program. As I haven‚Äôt had the opportunities grad schools look for due to financial and personal reasons to pursue internships/volunteer work, I am sort of stuck. I also do not mind taking time off to get a full time job and then reapply in two or so years but I‚Äôd really like to at least try to apply this Fall and see what comes of it.

Question about Financial Aid and Full-Time Enrollment.,"Hello everybody. Hope everybody is doing ok, staying healthy, and studying hard.  


Ok, so I am currently taking 3 classes, 12 units.  


I'm have a CalVet Fee Waiver so my tuition is waived.  


But I have this one class where, rn, I just do not have any hope of passing.  It feels a little above my level and its getting to the point where I can't catch up.  


I wanna drop the class and just take it another future term, but I'm scared about what may happen.  
If I drop the class  will my Calvet finanacial aid go away (Idk if Calvet cover full-time only or not)?  


If I drop the class I'll only be 8 units, or part-time status.

At the same time, doesn't the Univ. have a rule about all the students having to be full time?  
Will I be ""expelled"" or something?  


If I drop now, what happens?  

&amp;#x200B;

Will I lose too much if I just drop?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just ignore it, fail the class, and try later?

should i cancel my ap gov test??,"I'm in a senior in high school and was accepted into Revelle. I'm wondering if the ap gov test will help me at all. I'm majoring in bio btw if that will add more context to my situation LOLz idk 

I've taken the APUSH test and did well which satisfies 2 courses: 8 units, and exempts 2 courses from HILD 2A, 2B, 2C++.  This already satisfies the 2 social science requirements for my college. 

The reason I'm considering not canceling the ap gov test is because the ap gov test satisfies a different course:  4POLI 10+ 4 units 

Truthfully I'm a little confused with the whole ""units"" situation... will taking this test give me more units that will count towards/benefit my graduation/or any other positives it could contribute to?  Is there a number of units I must complete before graduation? If so will taking this test help me in the process of graduating on Time LOL. sorry if these seem like simple qs, I'm unfamiliar with a lot of this stuff so please help me out :)",1588662911,1,0

Professors should stop all group projects while we‚Äôre in remote learning mode.,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not completely against group projects. I think most of the time they allow you to meet more people and lessen the burden of the assignment. But I just don‚Äôt think they work in the current learning environment we‚Äôre in. It was easy to meet up and get work done when everyone was forced to be in the same room 2-3 times a week, but now with people at home (especially if home is somewhere overseas), the only way to get any work done is on zoom or canvas discussion boards. For me personally, it‚Äôs been nearly impossible to get my group all together on zoom at the same time (One member is in China, another in Florida). I think we‚Äôd all just be better off either making group projects suited for individuals working alone, or just do away with the projects altogether.

Am I too late?,"I am graduating soon and I want to continue living in SD. 

Like many others, I lost the job I had lined up after graduation which means I don't have any income or ways to pay for rent here. I have since applied to dozens of positions (mainly handshake and linkedin) and have heard nothing back yet.
 
Without an income source I don't feel brave or confident enough to even begin searching for housing after graduation. I'm starting to realize this might've been a dumb mistake. The housing application process looks expensive and time consuming.

My therapist and I agree that the best thing for my health and wellbeing was to not return home so I'm trying when i can to put effort in finding a job here. I'm trying to be optimistic, I don't think its impossible to get a job and housing within a month, but it sounds hard as hell with school work (6 classes) and covid around.

So, I have no job, and have no housing after I move out of the dorms. Do you guys think I'm too late to get those two things done? Any advice anyone can offer, especially those who went through a similar situation?

I've been spending countless hours only to come out with a horrendous score on each exam I take. I feel like I'm getting no where with all the time being put into trying to make this quarter work. I've even considered dropping a course, but decided it would be better to take P/NP for some of my classes in hopes that I can still be on track for the courses I plan to take next year. Although I've been so overwhelmed and in fear of failure, I understand that professors are doing their best to still provide education during these uncertain and dangerous times.

Fall quarter should be online,"University should just announce that fall quarter is going to be online. Change my mind if you think otherwise. 

All epidemiologists and virologist I‚Äôve listened to saying that it is very likely that the summer heat will reduce the rate of new cases but that during the fall there will be a second wave. In fact, even now, when it‚Äôs fall, cases are climbing with ever increasing speed in California. Vaccine is not going to be prepared before the winter and I don‚Äôt think we can socially isolate with 400-student courses. I have an asthma and a chronic bronchitis so that for me every minor cold results in me coughing up phlegm for the next two week. I don‚Äôt want to risk it and I don‚Äôt want to return to campus but I want to finish my education (fall would be my last quarter). 

However, not announcing that the fall quarter classes are going to be online only multiplied the uncertainty.

Remote Classes + Finding Housing next year i feel dumb,"Hi!

I know there are a lot of questions about this, but I am kinda stressing out about the classes I need to take next fall. I'm kinda stupid and never looked for housing for the fall because i thought that since at the earliest we would go back was in January I had time. So I begged my rom mates for us to not look for housing until like November so we did not need to pay extra. Then this in-person class thing happened and i found out that my discussions for the classes I waned to take (ETHN1 and ECON1) are both in-person. So I thought I could just take these classes another time. But I am a second year and ETHN1 is only offered once a year, so the only possible option is to take it FA 2021. Which I am fine with but ECON 1 is a pre req for a class I want to take and if I delay that class further I won't be on track to take other classes in the future. But even if I didn't want to take those classes I would only be a part time student next quarter because all other classes I could take need the classes I am taking fall as pre reqs. So I feel like my only other option is to take elective classes but I low key took too many elective classes and my advisor told me I shouldn't take anymore cuz I took too much but I just wanted my GPA to be higher :( . So if you were in my situation what would you do?",1589680365,1,0

We're Forward! AMA on Monday 5/18 @ 8 PM,"Hello, [r/UCSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/)! It‚Äôs me again, Patrick Miencharoen, on behalf of Forward!

*Allow me to get right to the point.* Every one of us attending UCSD now pays over $200 each and every year to Associated Students, our student government. We believe that that money shouldn‚Äôt be [wasted](https://as.ucsd.edu/DownloadDocument?id=174&amp;view=True) on propping up a bloated bureaucracy that spends tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of dollars on meaningless things that don‚Äôt benefit you in any way, like ‚ÄòLeadership Development‚Äô or ‚ÄòRetreats‚Äô, and then holds the occasional gimmicky event to give off the impression of progress and development.

Instead, it should be spent on lasting improvements to mental health provision and easing the burden off CAPS, fighting food insecurity by streamlining the food pantry and making it more efficient, creating an artistic and creative culture that is so desperately lacking here, promoting creative expression, among other things.

Campaigns and candidates who spend *their own* money in [this](https://ucsdguardian.org/2020/05/16/letter-to-the-editor-take-bold-action-to-support-students-instead-of-celebritys-bank-accounts/) [way](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pRGJyTvBL7WBu3VYW04uBPATRGF4PvNEjtad-daHosc/edit#gid=0) **cannot be trusted** to spend *your* money wisely. Top level candidates who *allegedly* formed their slates in this way and have plans such as [these](https://ucsdguardian.org/2020/02/17/as-senators-allege-attempted-abuse-of-power-ahead-of-election/) have **absolutely** no place in our student government.

Instead, we ought to elect people who abide by democratic norms, who have done everything in the public eye, who have fresh perspectives and real ideas on what ought to be done, and who believe that good governance can only come from a strong transparent democracy where the people are supreme and well-informed and the leaders respect the people and their representatives.

As it is now, **AS is completely and utterly broken and those who have played a role in creating that waste and those who continue supporting this system.** If it is to ever become a force for real progress, **we must change its course** ***now***.

And we are the team to do just that. We are a group of four Tritons with fresh perspectives and real pragmatic [policies](https://www.forwardtritons.com/our-platform) that will truly make life better for all Tritons. We are the change AS and this campus in general so desperately needs. We are beyond ready to serve you and lead all of us to prosperity and happiness. **We are the only way Forward!**

And **we will be hosting an AMA this Monday night at 8 PM**, immediately following the AS Election Committee‚Äôs presidential and vice presidential debates on that will be live-streamed [here](https://www.facebook.com/ASUCSD). Myself, my co-founder and VP of Campus Affairs candidate **Sam Fleet** and campus-wide senatorial candidates **James Callahan** and **Phoenix Stout** will all be answering questions from all of you here on [r/UCSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/) as well as from folks on Facebook and over Zoom (Room ID 918 1985 1530). Come through, we'd love to answer your questions

In the meantime, feel free to go over our policies and find out how you can help us on our website, [www.forwardtritons.com](http://www.forwardtritons.com/). Follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/forwardtritons) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/forwardtritons/) for the latest updates. 

**And don‚Äôt forget to vote on Tritonlink from the 18th to 22nd. Our success** ***(all of ours)*** **depends on your vote.**

We‚Äôll see you on Monday.

Is the school considering the mental health of students?,"I was feeling lack of motivation and struggling with productivity even at the start of remote learning. I worry now about falling into depression because the thought that all my classes may be online again in fall is leaving me feeling a bit hopeless. It has been rough this quarter and I really don't want this again. And I imagine I'm not the only one who is feeling this way. I imagine the mental health of students hasn't even been in consideration in their discussion of what to do because mental health is always just pushed to the side and deemed less important. With such a low rate of mortality in this age range, the true coronavirus hit to this group will be mental health.

I originally had some hope with the return to learn program but now I don't even understand the point if we aren't returning. I'm not even afraid of the virus...I'd sooner take that and just get over it than continue living like this. I can't get away from this bleak outlook of the future. 

I'm aware that there is the CAPS program I can reach out to if I want. I just wanted some discussion here about the mental health of students rather than having a discussion about what I need to do about myself.",1589640382,3,0
How does summer financial aid work?,"1) Is there anyway to predict what the total cost for enrolling during a session will be? Currently I am enrolled in 6 units in SS2. Does this normally come out to a total around $2k?

2) Is what is listed supposed to last me through the entire summer so that I have to divide it between the two summer sessions? I know I want the 6 units in SS2 but may consider another class in SS1...

3) Do we see one bill that applies to the entire summer or do we see two separate ones, one before each session? I ask because generally the aid is applied to the bill before being refunded to me but I wonder if I'll have to go back to pay when SS2 rolls around.

4) With the 6 unit requirement, is it ok to divide this between SS1 and SS2 or do they require 6 units per session?

I feel like I have endless questions around Summer sessions.",1589638030,1,0

General consensus regarding P/NP?,"Now that the quarter is nearing the end and we're all delirious from midterms/essays/projects I wanted to ask around for the general opinion regarding P/NP, specifically for those who are planning to apply to grad school. After reading a plethora of threads, I've sorted the general mindset into 3 categories:

&amp;#x200B;

i) P/NP everything- all grad schools are well aware of the impact of COVID 19 and have implemented some sort of pass/fail grading option for the undergrads at their institution as well. Also, blanket P/NP doesn't suggest you're trying to boost your GPA by taking some courses for a letter and some for the P. Also, if a school lacks common human decency and decides to hold a ""P"" vs a letter against you during a pandemic, you probably don't want to go there anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

ii) Take everything for a letter. Better safe than sorry- a ""B"" is definitive whereas opting for a ""P"" instead of a letter gives room for adcoms to wonder if you got a C- or above. (obviously if you're gettin straight A's then you're probably not getting much from this thread, bc there's literally no reason you'd choose a ""P"" over an ""A"").

&amp;#x200B;

iii) Taking any course which would lower my current GPA for a ""P"", and keeping the rest for a letter. Again, grad schools will most likely overlook grades from this quarter and won't look too deeply into ""P."" Why bring GPA down unnecessarily? 

&amp;#x200B;

What are your general thoughts? I'm still thinking about what I'm going to do myself, since anything lower than an A- will hurt my GPA significantly, specifically I'm thinking of taking 1 major class for a ""P"" and the rest for a letter- but I don't want to be shooting myself in the foot. I've talked to some friends since I'm not super familiar with how P/NP grades are viewed, and their opinions are widely varying as well.",1589569570,4,0
