Is it worth it to bike to campus?,"Hey guys, 

I live off of Mcculloch and was wondering if it would make a huge difference in my life to bike to campus as opposed to taking the shuttle. 

The reason I‚Äôm considering a bike is because the last few days I have been late to my classes and penalized for the bus being extremely late. Today tops it, I left for my 9am class and waited for the shuttle from 8am until about 8:56 when it showed up. I was extremely late to class and my grade went from a 100% to a 40%. Yesterday I was late for an event and lost a spot that was pretty important to me for me, even though I left early.

I don't want to have to do that ever again. I read somewhere on here that someone mentioned a ""commuter lot"".. first time I've ever heard of such after being here for nearly 4 years.

I am a UCF student, in the Texts &amp; Technology PhD program, performing a study regarding the usability of telemedicine communications. 

I am looking for UCF undergraduates to participate in an one-time, one-hour study where you will interact with a website on a computer and your smartphone and talk out loud your thoughts during this interaction. The purpose of the study is to find out how easy it is for people to find information on a website. 

In order to participate, you must be 18 years of age or older and required to bring a smartphone and be willing to use it to access the internet for one activity. You will also need to agree to be video recorded. All data transport, analysis, and storage, will be done by the PI and using a password-protected USB, computer, and data analysis software. All data will remain confidential, and all video recordings with identifiable data will be destroyed after data analysis is complete. The results of the data, which are de-identified, may be published in future publications or presented at conferences. The study will take place at UCF, in a classroom or computer lab. You will get a $15 Amazon gift card for participating. 

To schedule your one-time usability session, contact Jessica Lynn Campbell. My contact information is below.

I am now in a more comfortable place that makes it seem like I will be able to attend classes again in 2020, which I'm incredibly hopeful for.

&amp;#x200B;

I took the semester off without talking to an advisor or anything (a mistake on my part, I know) and had to drop a class I was about to fail in Fall 2018, so my first plan is to talk to an advisor and see what my future class road map can look like. I will also be talking to financial aid, as dropping that class put me below the required hours mark for Bright Futures, and I certainly need that financial assistance if I'm going to attend classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a few semesters into a Journalism degree that I really don't want to complete (something that I've realized contributed to my anxiety and depression) so I will also be talking to my advisor about switching majors to something that will actually make me feel excited for college again.

"Ladies, have you been approached by a Johnathan?","While we were studying, a female friend casually mentioned that some guy approached her randomly and said ""Hey, I think you're cute, can I have your number?"" and I was like ""Was his name Jonathan?"". Turns out, it was the same guy. 

A couple months ago, he approached me and we started texting. He asked when I was free and after I replied, he took 4 days to respond. He then told me when and where to meet him (he didn't ask if that time worked for me or if I was okay with meeting there, he just sent me the address). At this point red flags are going off, but I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and meet him anyways (it was a public place and I took other safety precautions like telling friends and family where I'd be). Half an hour before we were supposed to meet, he texted saying ""lets meet 90 minutes later than we agreed"". Again, not apologizing or asking if I was okay, just telling me. I nope'd out of the situation and haven't seen or heard from him since.

Any other ladies have a similar experience with Johnathan?",1575653114,1,0

Reply from the Property Manager of Tivoli regarding Internet/package lockers,"&gt;I meet with Summit on a monthly basis to discuss resident issues.  We are keeping a log here in the office and only can make them aware when I am aware there are outages on the property. We are under a contract with them in which we have for two more years.  I am working closely with my supervisors to note all issues to ensure Summit is meeting their obligations of the contract.   Unfortunately, I cannot account for outages that are beyond our property limits.  I forwarded Summit‚Äôs notice of planned maintenance as it was provided to me from Summit.  You are correct as it only stated ‚ÄúVideo Services‚Äù and not internet.  I also voiced my concern with the company that the majority of my residents are students and they are in finals.  As of this morning, you have been the only person to report an outage with the internet.  This could be due to us just opening and residents haven‚Äôt made their way into the office yet.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our package lockers are a new system that we just incorporated this past August.  We purchased the amount of lockers that the company stated we needed for the size of the community and number of residents we have. We are closely monitoring the system to determine if in the future, we do need to purchase more.  The emails that we send out is to promote quick turnaround of package pickup to help make room for others to be delivered in a timely manner.  The leasing office staff has been accepting packages for overages and we put them in the lockers as soon as there is availability.  This is also the most busiest time of the year for package delivery. Unfortunately, the system does run off of the internet, so if there are any outages, the lockers cannot be loaded; you are only able to pick- up packages.  This is another reason why we are keeping track of the Summit outages.

So there I was, ordering my not-so-nutrtional chicken wraps and a Mcdonald‚Äôs Sprite (We all know it isn‚Äôt just regular sprite). I waited for my food and laughed with my indentured friends over something politically incorrect. I hear my name: Order ###. I shot up and walked over to the counter to see a fair skinned, redheaded, glasses wearing goddess hand me my food. I said my signature ‚Äúthank you thank you.‚Äù She then looked at me from the shoes up saying ‚Äúyou are welcome.‚Äù and turned around sassy and stylish. I knew right then and there that I wanted to get to know the woman I dubbed as ‚ÄúThe Mickey D‚Äôs E-Girl.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know if she was flirting with or not until my two female friends, Female Companion and *sscheek mcgee started to go ‚ÄúOOOOOOOH.‚Äù

We spent minutes conversing over the matter. I knew that one day I would have to see the Mickey D‚Äôs E-girl again.

HOWEVER, SHE DOESN‚ÄôT WORK THERE ANYMORE AND I NEED HELP FINDING HER FOR HER NUMBER!

What should I include in my Graphic Design Portfolio?,"Hello all!   
I'm currently attending my first semester at UCF and an advisor told me that portfolio reviews for Graphic Design BFA is next semester around February. I'm currently taking Drawing Fundamentals 1, Intro to Computer Art, and Design Fundamentals 3D. She said I could participate in portfolio review next semester, but I want to know what are some things I should include in my portfolio review.

I'm a transfer student, but the projects i have made in the past are of really poor quality and I need to make new pieces this semester if i'm going to be accepted. I'm not the best at drawing but I want to do my best and get accepted so I won't have to wait a whole new year to attempt it again if i end up not getting accepted.

Also, I want to practice drawing the human figure since alot of posts i've read so far really push that but since i won't be taking Drawing 2 until next semester i want to practice it before, any advice? Should i practice drawing figures from photos?

Also should i incorporate 3D models in my portfolio?",1569388191,2,0

"Fuck the UCFPD, they ruined me and I committed no crime.","I posted on reddit that I was depressed and felt like dying because I had no friends. I was desperate for some companionship, even if it was virtual. I really, sincerely, was desperate. What happened? Why the UCFPD came looking for me in class! Thankfully, I was late that day, so what did they do? Why they called me and demanded I present myself immediately. I asked if I could just meet them after class, thinking that A) talking to the police in view of the class wouldn't exactly do wonders for my social life, and B) I was rather nervous about why the fuck they were looking for me. They told me to go to the station as soon as I was free. I, again, being scared, went. They took my ID and locked me in an interrogation room. They had my reddit post. They demanded to know if I was depressed. I said yes. They asked if I felt bad often. I said yes. Then, the detective or whatever the bitch's rank was left the room. She came back with two officers and announced I would be Baker Acted. I am not from Florida (or even from America), and I had never heard the term before. They said ""we are gonna take you to somewhere that will help you"". Still not seeing what was happening, I said that I had class in two hours (which I did), and asked if I would make it. They said sure. I was taken to the University Behavioral Center, in handcuffs.

&amp;#x200B;

""But what's so wrong with that?"" I hear you ask. ""You said you were depressed!"". Well, to begin with I was already heavily medicated AND I had my own doctor AND my own therapist that I saw every week. And if you think the UBC is good for anyone, I invite you to commit yourself there. They drugged me by force. They did so many medical tests. They told me I'd be gone in under an hour until they locked me up and said ""Oh, doctor is gone, you will see him tomorrow."" and then they dropped the act and said ""Actually, by law we keep you here for 3 days."" Great time. They didn't even let me eat with the rest of the prisoners there for a day, and yes, I will call them prisoners because we weren't allowed to be free. What else? Oh they therapy of course. They told me UCF had been alerted of my being committed and that I would have to speak to them or I wouldn't graduate. Did I mention I asked for support online because I didn't want what I felt to be commonly known? When I started crying out of despair for the situation, they had security drag me away. Great place. I hope it burns down. After 2 days, the doctor finally ""arrived"", and, after talking to me for 5 min and hearing my situation, he let me go. Wow, its almost as if, if you aren't a lying piece of shit, you might be more efficient than doing something akin to a kidnapping!

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, fuck UCFPD. They started this hell. Fuck UBC. They continued the hell. This was a little over a year ago. To this day, I can't see a police officer without fearing for my safety, UCFPD or otherwise. To this day, I cannot see a therapist without being afraid to my very core, and feeling the same dread I felt while locked up. I am in constant fear that one day, they might decide to take me away again. And hey, it did something! Now I feel even more alone and unable to trust anyone! Thanks, UCFPD! Oh, and if anyone reading this IS from UCFPD, fuck you. Fuck you. I hope you live the worst life possible. FUCK YOU.",1569362676,3,0

Thank you for those that made this happen. People have said we have nothing to gain from this because we are not yet orgo 2 experts but that itself is not fair and we have the right to voice our concerns and feelings. Kollbe is an intelligent, enthusiastic, passionate teacher that has no fear of admitting he doesn‚Äôt know something. UCF needs humble teachers like him. That part of him stuck with me because so many of us pretend we know what we are doing in class but are afraid to speak up and get left behind. Kollbe was able to connect with us and changed our lives by thinking of his class as an image of our passions and future ambitions. UCF removed him very quickly and deserves a thorough investigation. From this I learned more about other teachers in the chemistry department that would lift eyes, but nothing is done. We need more voices.

Is there any way to do this or does he have to get accepted and then do the reactivate thing?

‚Ä¢ The case number is 9773204 and the firm handling it is Morgan &amp; Morgan
‚Ä¢ The local news station has been notified
‚Ä¢ Currently in the process of hiring a PI
‚Ä¢ The developers of UW offered $150 in compensation in response to a petition that made rounds about 2 months ago, presumed to actually be in response to the suit since the compensation was dispersed shortly after the GroupMe chats for most floors were notified
‚Ä¢ UCF/Valencia and the developers of UW have otherwise not commented on the case
‚Ä¢ A list of grievances is in the process of being created
‚Ä¢ Representatives from floors 8 and 15 are confirmed for collecting specific grievances, possible reps from floors 7, 9, 11, 14
‚Ä¢ No representatives as of yet from floors 6, 10, 12, 13

I get that he may not be able to intervene legally, or leave his post (10 feet away) or something, but come on. He's a position of authority, he could've called the cops or yelled or something beyond just being flippant

"Second Bachelor's Degree, First Time UCF --- Registration Time &amp; Excess Hours?","Hello Knights!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm entering this Spring semester for a second bachelor's in computer science, my first being in mechanical engineering. My first degree was in UF (Gainesville) and after a few years in industry, I decided to make a career switch to computer science.

A master's degree seems to require a 4-semester chain of courses to even apply, and I didn't much like the idea of CS boot camp, thus my choice to go for a second bachelor's (for now atleast).

&amp;#x200B;

I know 2nd bachelor's like me are rare, but I have two questions if anyone out there is like me:

1) How are 2nd bachelor's students treated in terms of class registration date &amp; time priority? Are we like ""normal"" undergraduate seniors, or are we like low-priority non-degree-seeking students?

2) Does anyone know if I will be treated with excess hours surcharges due to my large amount of credit hours from my 1st degree, or does a 2nd bachelor's have a ""clean slate"" in terms of credit hours.

Struggling with superior intellect,"Hello everyone. I have an issue and would like some advice. As the title suggests, I am extremely intelligent. I have struggled all my life with being significantly more intelligent than my peers. At first, you might assume that this is a blessing rather than a curse. However, some issues that my superior intellect have caused include the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1. It is difficult for me to work in groups. I often get stuck working with simpletons. Their inferior minds are to mine like a mouse is to a lion.
2. I cannot relate to most people because I'm significantly more intelligent and they don't understand me when I speak of quantum physics and why E=mc^(2) is wrong.
3. Everyone else wishes to get intoxicated and engage in coitus. Meanwhile, I'd rather watch Rick and Morty and read studies in the field of quantum physics.
4. I often feel the need to speak less intelligently to appeal to the less intelligent peers of mine. Otherwise, they don't understand me.

"5000 classes, enrollment minimums","So I feel like I've seen multiple answers to this but it might be different for 5000 and 6000 level, you need a minimum of 5 or 8 people enrolled.

There's 3 people enrolled in the section that has a room number, 2 people enrolled in the section that seems to be video only, and none in the 3rd section. 
 
So my questions are... does anyone know if there is a hard limit of 5 or 8 enrolled or up to the professor(like maybe one of their own PHD students needs the class)? 
 
should I be adding up the students enrolled in all the sections? 
 
when is the latest they would cancel or confirm the class?

From what I am reading on UCF's website, Florida Statute 1009.21 permits me to immediately reclaim instate residency upon my return.

Per UCF's website:

""In certain circumstances,¬†Florida Statute 1009.21¬†permits certain students to be classified as Florida residency for tuition purposes. Verification through supporting documentation is required that a student meets by qualification or exception.

A student should only request residency classification using one of these categories if they do not qualify as either an independent or a dependent student.

...

‚Ä¢Persons previously enrolled at a Florida state postsecondary institution and classified as a Florida residents for tuition purposes at a Florida public institution of higher education, but who abandoned Florida domicile and has re-established Florida legal residence.""

IT'S SO HUMID... How do I stop from smelling,"First i'd like to say i'm a florida native, but this heat is unreal.

Do any of you have hygiene tips? I shower before I go to class every day and I put on deodorant and cologne but towards the end of the day I can smell myself getting a stench (swamp ass and pubic area sweat like hell). I'm a male btw.",1569611535,15,0

Unlabeled Male support group,"Hey, I know this is a sensitive topic; there's currently no proper phrasing for this concept.

There are masculine guys I know at UCF who don't have the desire for a girlfriend or wife, guys who actually don't have crushes on women.
And no, this doesn't always mean they are homosexual either.

Instead of wanting a wife, these guys have a natural desire to focus more on strengthening other men long term.

I wanted to create a safe space of intellectual discussion and emotional support, specifically for guys at our college who go through this, so they don't have to be alone.

Men like this often feel isolated cause they typically don't have a healthy outlet of other male friends to talk to who understand what they go through (since most men have only experienced strong feelings of longing &amp; care toward women)

---

I didn't put a label on this because
sometimes I feel it's better to speak for yourself instead of having a label speak for you.

We want to let you guys know you are not alone.

---

You deserve better than a church that shuns instead of understands.

You deserve a healthier outlet than apps &amp; hookups that can leave you emotionally empty.

Both the secular world and modern church have over-sexualized this issue, with one side falsely claiming free sex will make them happy, and the other side often judgmentally shunning them without understanding.


We want to let you know that you men are deserving of love and friendship, long term.

What I‚Äôve found out about Jobs4knights aka Vector Marketing,"So I‚Äôm sure many of you have seen the jobs4knights.com written on whiteboards across campus. The gist of it is that they tell you they have this great opportunity to work at $15/hr and have an opportunity for $140‚Äô000 in scholarships or something like that if you work for them. Needless to say it‚Äôs too good to be true. 

The first time I came into contact with jobs4knights was actually through the messaging portion of Webcourses (canvas) where a student from UCF messaged me about this great job opportunity. 

I filled out the application which is actually just a google form to get your personal information and then decided that was kinda sus maybe I should do some research. Turns out it‚Äôs for this company called Vector which has a shady list of not paying employees and doing other illegal things, just check out the wiki and you‚Äôll see what I mean. 

I got a phone call from Vector and decided to pick it up to see what other information I could find about the job because they didn‚Äôt really give any info about it anywhere really. 

Initially everything sounded very professional like you would expect from a real job offer and they very quickly asked if I could come in for an interview. Again not describing what the job was. Also they said that they work with the UCF career center which I don‚Äôt think is true at all. 

So I pressed the person on the phone about the details of employment there, knowing full well that this company works in loopholes so they don‚Äôt have to pay their employees and sure enough the more questions I asked the worse it got. 

As an entry level employee, you do get paid $15 an hour, but you can only work so many hours based on how many ‚Äúappointments‚Äù are made available to you. These appointments are for a set amount of time, for example one hour and the way it works is that you set up a meeting with a family member or friend and at the end of the hour they sign your appointment form so you can get your money.

First of all this means that you could speak to someone for more than an hour but only get paid for one hour because of the fixed length of the ‚Äúappointment.‚Äù

Second of all, they determine how many appointments you can get and they will give you more only if you meet commission quotas. 

Third of all, you can imagine that they don‚Äôt want you to sit down and talk to the same person again and again without them buying anything, so it‚Äôs on you to find more people in order to get more appointments. 

On paper they pay their employees $15/hr and they don‚Äôt have a door to door employee selling stuff. In reality you don‚Äôt get paid for any of the time it takes to find a customer and at the end of the day there are only so many uncles and aunts you have. So a lot of the customers fall into the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù category and friends of friends and friends of friends of friends etc. 

When you get to talking to people you don‚Äôt know very well, it‚Äôs hard to get them to sign your appointment paper and a lot of people probably don‚Äôt want to buy the product so what might happen is you talk to someone for 20 mins but they say no and don‚Äôt sign your paper and you try this for 3 people and now you‚Äôve worked an hour for free. 

They did say that they have done away with the deposit required for the product before you can sell it but I have a feeling there‚Äôs still some sort of training book you have to pay for. 

I ended my conversation with saying that I know that this company has made its money from robbing young high school and college students of their money and I want nothing to do with a company like that even at 15/hr plus commission and scholarships and the person on the phone simply said okay have a nice day and hung up. 

The employees are very obviously given commission for recruiting new employees because I must‚Äôve gotten 100 phone calls before and after I had my conversation which shows that they really don‚Äôt care and just want to add a number to their spreadsheet. 



TL;DR

Don‚Äôt go anywhere near jobs4knights/vector marketing. They don‚Äôt pay you properly through a loophole and you have to make sales in order to get hours. You‚Äôll end up working for free a lot. The people who actually make money get it from recruiting new employees.",1569558833,118,0
