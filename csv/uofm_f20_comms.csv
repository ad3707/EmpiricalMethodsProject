"For those of you who think this is a position that should mostly be filled by middle class families, you should also realize how much this screws over the lower class incoming freshman. They won't have anyone who identifies with their particular struggles, and will probably feel misunderstood. 
It's easy to assume that this is just a special form of financial aid for middle class students (Which it's not, it's a job. Especially rn, ask any RA who's had to check people for masks and coordinate a billion different questions about when things will open and where we're allowed to go while simultaneously fielding complains about the situation being poorly handled and trying to play ping-pong between higher staff and the students.) but that thinking disregards the needs of some of the people RAs are supposed to be working with. That is why a diverse set of workers is so necessary. 
It isn't 'stealing' an opportunity from someone if you were better suited for the position. That logic assumes that the other person was somehow more entitled to a chance at that position than you would be. Sure, a person with higher FA could get a job off campus to make money, but so could that middle class student.",1602057541,1,0

i dont really buy the ‚Äúliquid assets‚Äù thing. i think a lot of people conflate the concept of financial convenience of a sale with technical possibility. liquidity is a measure of the former. if a family has assets they could sell for $x today and $x+y down the road, by refusing to liquidate the assets they are saying that $y is worth more than their dependent‚Äôs education. edit: i also think this is very fair to consider assets which families claim are not liquid as part of the EFC. i don‚Äôt think the government should have to pay out to enhance a wealthy families return on investment (most securities and properties are owned by the upper class, so this is rarely a problem for working class families).",1602048757,1,0

"This won't really answer your question, but one thing that I have noticed (living in the dorms for 3 years now) is that those of us who stay in the dorms for sophomore year and beyond start to lose friends at an alarming rate.

I will also add that all the sophomores I see who are back in the dorms due to a smaller friend circle/being unable to find people to live with become extremely lonely and even further isolated from their peers. Again, this is my opinion regarding my experience and the experiences of those around me. You might have a different experience. But if you get the chance to live off campus, go for it.

To better answer your question: the people I know who are living off campus spend about this much per person:

$650-750: for really crappy location, crappy size, crappy quality. All around crappy also probably doesn't include washing and drying.

$750-850: definitelt nicer than above. But you'll probably have to compromise on a few things. This is what most of my friends pay

$850-950: this is where most of the nicer places start to show up. But you'll have to compromise on 1 thing or another

"&gt; ...As several people have mentioned, and have been downvoted while you refuse to listen, the University refuses to bargain on policing issues, claiming it is not a permissible subject covered under graduate employment.

&gt;The primary goal of GEOs strike re: policing is to basically try and get the University to provide literally any crumb of recognition that establishes precedent to bargain over policing. Even if it is just an oversight board that meets for more than just complaints, or has student representation, or a committee of regents who review, or something along those lines. **Keeping the demands topical lets the University make the first move rather than the union, which means all options are on the proverbial table rather than being precluded by a set of restrictive demands or asks.**

Basically that by listing specific demands the GEO might inadvertently close off bargaining avenues or topics. If they asked for ICE to stop coming to career fairs, the U could do that, and then throw up their hands and say they made so many concessions and refuse to move on anything else. So GEO leaves them general demands and wait for the U to set the parameters of discussion, giving GEO the upper hand in negotiation. My own personal theory is also that GEO never cared *exactly* how to sever ICE or AAPD ties, because what they really want is for policing to be recognized as a permissible topic for bargaining for worker safety, and a legitimate section of future bargaining platforms and negotiations. Doing so would be an **enormous** win that gets their foot in the door and establishes precedent.

In this sense, GEO has the University backed into a corner. A few hypotheticals for how things play out:

* If the U bargains on policing, GEO wins a permissible subject, and a very strong precedent for future platforms.

* If the U refuses to bargain on policing, they look bad nationally if GEO can draw sufficient attention to the AAPD murder of Aura Rosser, and add her name to the dozens of others who were killed by police. This taps into hot national debates currently. GEO can beat the war drum that the U doesn't care about member demands anyway, and come out with some type of win for their membership.

* The U refuses to bargain on policing, but capitulates elsewhere in the strike demands and gives the GEO strong protections and remote teaching options, child care improvements, and international center coverage. GEO leaves with a win for their membership.

* Both sides drag it out, and we will (likely) see a case increase in Ann Arbor that results in a shift to remote semester anyway and validates the public health demands, and policing is dropped mutually. There is no real winner here because this is dangerous, but GEO is vindicated in their concern for public health.

* Schlissel gets a vote of no confidence from faculty this coming week.

Of course there are some bad things that could also end the strike for the Union without any movement on anything. But. I think they're longer shots that *seem* less likely. Although all things in this pandemic have been wild, so, who knows.",1599969228,1,0

Semester | Course(s)

F20 | EECS 183, EECS 203

Sp21 | EECS 281, EECS 370
F21 | EECS 376, ULCS1
W22 | ULCS2, ULCS3
F23 | ULCS4, MDE

So best case, you'll be a student this upcoming summer and the one after. This summer if you take 281, I don't know how easily you'd find an internship. You generally need 281 for an internship. However, if you got an internship before the summer starts, you could effectively push back each of these semesters listed above and graduate in 10 semesters total.

I would highly discourage you from voluntarily skipping internships. It's nearly unheard of for a CS student to graduate without any internships, and especially in the upcoming recession you're going to need more than your transcript or some side projects to demonstrate that you're worth hiring. That's not to say you won't get any job, as CS is so in-demand you'll probably be able to land some full-time position, but if you care about your pay, field, location, or anything you're gonna want internship experience under your belt. So you're gonna have to recruit hardcore next year for that one crucial summer, regardless of whether or not you do end up finding something this semester. I also don't know what your financial situation is like, so I'm not sure how easily you could push back your schoolwork to work at an internship. Best of luck",1599968794,10,0

"&gt; It's not unreasonable to need more money during an emergency.

Of course it's not unreasonable to need money, but it is unreasonable to expect that money from your employer. It is unreasonable to expect the university to give everyone a 25% bonus on top of their normal pay for the semester to cover costs that weren't the university's fault. Should the university send money to every student from the west coast to cover costs from the fires? Should they send money to every student affected by the hurricanes? The university isn't a charity, and they shouldn't be expected to send everyone money whenever a disaster happens. It would be awesome if they could do that, but they can't.

&gt; They are not asking for a lot.

It's $40 million. Sure, the university can afford it, but it's still quite a bit of money that they don't owe you. If they should give every grad student $2500, why shouldn't they also give every undergrad, faculty member, staff member, etc. $2500 as well? Didn't some of their costs go up, too?",1599967350,2,0

"So I‚Äôve seen similar issues on other Covid dashboards (including the one for the state of Michigan) and I *think* I know what‚Äôs going on here (bear with me).

First, new tests being added for last week is normal behavior, because they‚Äôre reporting by the day the person was exposed or had symptoms, or (if that‚Äôs not available) the day the test was conducted. I personally don‚Äôt like dashboards that report this way (as opposed to just clearly reporting a new batch of results each day) but it‚Äôs not an incorrect way to show the data.

Second, the cutoff for each week‚Äôs value is probably being tied to the time of day the graph is updated. In other words, say they update at 4AM on any given day: any tests before that time on the first day of each week are pushed to the previous week. Then when they update again at, say, 8PM, it will look like tests that occurred in between are also pushed ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù in time by a week. You can see this starting the week of 6/7 where the difference week-by-week appears to be +10, -8, +1, etc, but it mostly averages out over time. The dramatic and weird one is the week of 8/2, because 100 tests moved back and then it looks like they added a few (maybe some got reported late?) But with a time difference of 16 hours and a week where nearly 1000 tests were done, 100 in the space of 16 hours seems quite possible.

Anyway, it is annoying and should probably be fixed, but it doesn‚Äôt *appear* to be a malicious ‚Äúsomeone is manipulating the data‚Äù situation. In plain English, someone wrote a query as ‚Äúright now minus 24-hour increments back to last Sunday‚Äù instead of ‚Äúlast Sunday at midnight‚Äù. Again this is all guesswork on my part, but I‚Äôve noticed the Michigan dashboard has the same problem where all the prior data has some ‚Äújitter‚Äù depending on exactly what time of day it‚Äôs updated.

"I'm aware that hospital and museum/library security have their own non-LEO personnel, but I have not worked with them much in their regular setting, so I can't comment on them.

As for my recommendations, here are my thoughts:

1.  Ensure their non-security partners  are well aware of  separation between security and police, and aretrained to handle things accordingly.  Ex: Avoid involving police in the vast majority of alcohol and marijuana associated incidents (this is already done to extent with housing, but it could be done to a greater extent and that approach should be followed anywhere on campus).

2.  UMPD should not be participating in or aiding with ""party patrols"" with plainclothes officers.

3.  UMPD should have very limited patrol duties in non-vehicular and dense campus areas or within campus most campus buildings (libraries, Unions, Diag).  This should be handled by light-handed security. Of course, they should be able to respond when there is actually a life-threatening threat that security needs assistance with. Busting students walking back to their dorms after partying on South U, or harassing PoC minding their own business because some Karen called them in as ""suspicious"" should not be things they are doing at all.

* My ""Why Transfer"" circulated around a desire for further education that the university could provide to me. Sounds dumb, I know, but I highlighted some of their programs and how I wanted to get involved in those opportunities.

* Personal Statement is basically committing your intent to go should you be accepted. Since you got more words to work from here, you could also use this as an opportunity to discuss ""overcoming adversity"" in your life (they eat that shit up, lol), if you haven't already talked about it.

* Side note: I was also required to provide a short essay explaining a couple of W's I had picked up from the community college.

take a step back and evaluate potential reasons why you are taking the class / at the school:

1) learn the material

2) fulfill a requirement to graduate

3) get a good grade for later credentials

"Find ways to make your room more conducive to focusing. 

Here are some things that help me:

- Turn off the TV and distracting music
- Make sure lighting is conducive (not too dim, consider a desk lamp or string lights at your desk; consider only using this lighting when it‚Äôs focus time)
- Sit at a place where you only sit to concentrate, not to goof off or sleep (so don‚Äôt study in bed, and don‚Äôt watch Netflix at your desk)
- Add study sounds (for me this is white noise from a white noise app or a fan, but for others it‚Äôs lyrical music - again, only listen to these when it‚Äôs time to study)

"Michigan was going through a period of great unrest at the time. In March 1970, the Black Action Movement, an umbrella name for a coalition of student groups, sponsored a campus-wide strike to protest low minority enrollment and to build support for an African American Studies department. The strike included picket lines that prevented entrance to university buildings and was widely observed by students and faculty. Eight days after the strike began, the university granted many of BAM's demands.

Meanwhile, the Hash Bash event was taking off, with students lighting up on the quad at the end of every semester to protest in support of marijuana legalization.

"I don't want to seem like a doomsayer for pre-med classes here at umich, but Orgro 1 was more at the tip of the iceberg in my experience. The most common classes that people take at CC are Calc 1 and 2, and Pchem (Chem 230 or 260). As someone who is in the midst of the med school admissions process, you really only want one or two classes for your reqs to be from outside universities, so be careful not to waste your choice.  
If you're scared of Orgo 1 here is my advice:  
\- Find a study group. The group of people I studied Orgo with have been some of my best friends and have taken similar classes going forward. For example, 3 years later I'm in chem 455 with two people that I studied Orgo 1 with.

And every NGO wants the group to do a certain thing, whether that be more technical stuff like redesigning part of their website or doing some curriculum work, and their needs will be listed out so you can choose according to where your strengths are.

My NGO project was with Amnesty International and we focused a lot on advocacy work around campus and participating in Amnesty's global campaigns. Every project looks different, so I can only really speak to that experience, but I had a friend paired with a smaller NGO and they created some curriculum for the NGO, and another friend worked on redesigning a website for another NGO because she was CS and had some experience in it.

We also severely limited the number of guests any House can host to follow the State of Michigan regulations, with some Houses going further and outright banning guests.  We also require that Members wear masks in common spaces inside the House, and help sanitize surfaces in common areas.  We have also given Members more options if they feel sick, such as quarantining in a different part of the House or moving to Northwood if they do test positive.

"It's definitely a difficult subject to bring up, but ask them.  If they're someone you just met or don't know well, you can ask for ""alone time"", and make arrangements to jerk around each others' schedules.  I've been (and am) in the Co-Ops for many years, so I know how it works.

In Co-Ops, this is \*usually not the case.  Central Campus Co-Ops have room pick meetings, where the Co-Op Members pick their rooms and roommates.  This year's room pick meetings were over Zoom, so I'm not sure how they worked, but you still have a chance to meet your roommate before moving in (unlike my earlier dorm experience).

There are also Co-Ops which have single rooms.  Almost all Co-Ops have single rooms, but many of the Central Campus Houses do room picks based on seniority, so the in-demand single rooms can get taken by returning Members.  As mentioned previously, Escher House (located on North Campus) has mostly single rooms, so your in-room privacy will be ensured.  At Escher, you pick your room from a list of open rooms, and from prior experience, it is actually harder to get a double room than a single room.

"A Plus driving school seems to get good reviews online. Based on the reviews, they also seem to cater more towards students from the university than highschoolers.

On a related note, when you go to take your drivers test itself (separate from driving school), I recommend *not* taking it in Ann Arbor. In fact, get out of the Ann Arbor area entirely for your test. Ann Arbor (and all larger cities for that matter) are terrible for driving tests, as there'll be a lot of problems like pedestrians jaywalking, traffic congestion, people not obeying right of way, and so forth. These hazards can be tough for a new/inexperienced driver to handle, which can result in less optimal decisions and losing points on the test. 

It's better to take the driving test in a bunch of cornfields south of Saline than to take it on State St.",1609387272,3,0

"I took lessons at Ann Arbor Driving School several years back. They were decent, although I don't know if anyone really enjoys driver's ed. 

I did learn how to drive at 14-15, so I had to take the teen class (which is more rigorous than the adult requirements for the state of Michigan.) That included 6 hours of on-road lessons and a ridiculous amount of 1990-made videos about teens who drunk drove. After that, I drove with my dad and felt entirely confident behind the wheel after about 15 hours. 

So while it varies person to person, I'd say 3-5 hour-long lessons + some practice with a friend in the passenger seat helping you out would be sufficient to take the test. 

Side Note: It's a family-run business and they have three instructors: an older woman (Naheel?), a younger man (Suhail), and an older man. You want to learn with the older woman, who I liked best, or possibly the younger man, but NOT the older man (I think his name is Dean?). He's nightmarish.",1609385587,3,0

"I took 215 at the same time as 203 this past semester. With 215, the content was fairly easy to understand (or at the very least get to a degree of competence that you can repeat the exercises on the exam). The big difference between 203 and 215 is that 215 has a lot of busy work that makes up a good portion of your grade. The daily quizzes, lab, web work, and written homework are all graded very leniently and allow one to get a decent buffer in their grade. 203 on the other hand is very rigorous in the grading of homeworks. You have to put in the due diligence to get all of the necessary components to get full points. But I think this is a double edged sword because if you redo the homeworks in 203, that will serve you tremendously on the exams whereas the practice tests are better prep for 215 exams.

"Ya, I feel like they figure since it's open everything it's fine to just ask questions out of left field. Which would be fine with a more generous time limit. When the practice exams are all similar in their questions it really instills a false sense of importance on things to study. I just generally hate questions that expect you to remember that one thing that was said one time in the middle of a lecture from a month ago that we only made use of in a small part of one lab.

Digesting the design problems (in all EECS) is always the stressful/annoying/time consuming part. I can't imagine taking these exams on a laptop. I have my 24 inch screen plus my 40 inch 4k tv so I could have all the documentation open and visible simultaneously. I wish classes would embrace giving out the spec/supporting documentation ahead of the exam so you could wrap your head around them. Then it's just a matter of understanding the functions they want you to implement at exam time. With that said, I didn't find the design problem too bad. The worse part was the length of the datasheet for the one board.",1608330036,2,0

"From CSE's email a few weeks back:

&gt;At the end of the term, you may change any final semester course grade to the P/NRC grading scheme, which will mean that these grades will not be calculated into your overall GPA. If you make this change:  
&gt;  
&gt;P will be listed on your record if your letter grade was a C or higher.  
&gt;  
&gt;PS will be listed on your record if your letter grade was a C-.  
&gt;  
&gt;NRC will be listed on your record if your letter grade was D+ or lower.  
&gt;  
&gt;Opting into the P/PS designation has no effect on whether a course satisfies a prerequisite or a degree requirement. This means that for major requirements and prerequisites where the minimum is a C grade, a covered C- (a ""PS"" grade) will not be accepted. As usual, NRC will also not be accepted for requirements or prerequisites. *Make sure you know what grade is required for each of your requirements.

"The content in EECS 203 can be partitioned into 3 subsets. The first third covers logic, set theory, functions, proofs and sequences/series, and sets you up for the rest of the class. The next third covers some basic combinatorics, discrete probability and a little bit of relations. The last third does more relations, orderings of a set, graphs, algorithms, complexity, number theory and some cryptography. The class covers a lot, and by the EECS department‚Äôs own admission, is about 1.5 semesters worth of content ‚Äî content that doesn‚Äôt always feel as if it cohesively builds up on material from earlier parts of the class.

It gets wild really fast, and often the material, though very interesting, is covered so quickly that it can get hard to keep up with. To keep up, don‚Äôt fall behind on lectures, as playing catch-up can be very painful. Go to Graetz‚Äôs lectures, they‚Äôre really, really good. Like another poster here has said, the lecture slides are a good resource (especially to review things you don‚Äôt understand), but you may not get away with skipping lectures and solely relying on reading the slides, so it‚Äôs safest not to do that. 

Go to discussion and ask questions, and shop around till you find an IA you like (my favorite one graduated, so I can‚Äôt really give you a recommendation). Get started on your homework early, as it can take some time to finish. Go to office hours, not Chegg ‚Äî aside from being not very good for your learning, people have been honor-coded for blindly copying blatantly wrong answers.

The exams are unfortunately very competitive, and aren‚Äôt very easy. You don‚Äôt really get many practice exams either. Do all of them, and if it helps you, do them again. I think 203 staff likes it when you make review materials (they gave out extra credit for it once), and strongly believes that it helps you do better, so please do that. 


As for resources, here are some:

I never used this, but one of my friends in another school was saved by youtuber TheTrevTutor‚Äôs discrete math content. It might be useful.

During break, read this (https://www.math.drexel.edu/~jblasiak/JoyofSets.pdf), and this (https://www.math.drexel.edu/~jblasiak/MathematicalHygiene.pdf). These handouts were created by Michigan professors, and give you a very gentle introduction to set theory and mathematical logic. It‚Äôll make your life easier for the first 3 weeks, and you won‚Äôt feel as lost as many of your classmates if you do that. 


Another thing that could be helpful is taking MATH 201. It‚Äôs a 1-credit class (credit/no credit grading) that the math department recommends everyone doing MATH 217 to enroll in. But you don‚Äôt need to be in MATH 217 to do it. As it‚Äôs an introduction to mathematical writing/proofs, it‚Äôs going to be very, very helpful for EECS 203, 376, and so on and so forth.

The handout posted by u/Logan_Z_Z (http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~smdbackr/MATH/Mathematical_Writing_A_Primer.pdf) in another comment in this thread is what you‚Äôll cover in the class. (also, scroll to the back of it, to the ‚ÄúResources‚Äù section, and read More Joy of Sets). You meet in the math lab once or twice a week (depending on how fast you complete the worksheets) for two hours at a time. You write proofs for at least 90% of the questions in the handout, with IAs walking around to help you if you get stuck and to check your work when you‚Äôre done. There is no homework ‚Äî it‚Äôs just practice at proofs, and you‚Äôll find the content in EECS 203 much easier as a result, especially the first third.",1608278295,4,0
"TLDR: One great day to start break, then end up in hospital with appendicitis.

All excited to be able to stream for a month as well as have as  consistent gym schedule. Got into EFT just before the semester started, my most intense semester I've had, and friends wanted me to get back into WoW. Funny enough I think this might be my best semester GPA wise with only 473 dragging it below 4.0.

Stream some casual leveling in WoW most of Wednesday and loving it. Wake up sometime in the night with abdominal pain. Something is off, didn't feel like a ""normal"" stomach cramp. Let it ride for a bit and see how things go. Eventually pain spreads to the right side. UH-OH. Go to hospital and learn the pleasure that is morphine. First ever surgery. All went well but happened late enough I had to spend the night. So that's my start to my break.

People here are being safe, and as a community we're doing what we can to care for each other and keep everyone as safe as we can.

"Hi! So great that you‚Äôre interested in architecture. Taubman is a great place; I recently graduated. 

The school is rooted in a lot of different areas and is very well rounded. Design theory, urban issues, history, and research are all well represented. Being near Detroit fuels a lot of the schools interest in urban/social issues. There‚Äôs also an abundance of opportunities for undergrads to get into research and fabrication if interested. Because the school is a research institution with a massive library and alumni base, the resources are vast.

The undergraduate program has a great amount of freedom in how students go about design and in shaping their own work, while having faculty to advise them every step of the way. The program culminates in the Wallenberg Studio which is a great design studio involving travel that is typically on par with graduate level work, and has the possibility of awards/publication. No other architecture school has anything quite like it. That‚Äôs a huge incentive for people to apply there. 

I‚Äôm not sure what gives you the impression of Taubman as a small school. They pull in quite a few impression lectures and faculty every year. The lecture series they put on is quite amazing and professors come from all over the globe.

"Currently a freshman considering my options for winter semester and wanted some advice. I'm not sure if it's online learning that's a challenge for me mentally/emotionally, adjusting to college, or a combination of both, but I had to drop a class (s/o to math 215 post to further explain why) and am at 12 credits since it's much more manageable. However, since online learning began in March, I just feel like I'm not learning as much and not reaching my full potential, and this is very stressful for me. So I'm considering finding an internship for next semester since it would give me relevant work experience and things will probably be online. However, it's obviously very challenging for a freshman to find an internship, even through the co-op program/engr 400  which I've already completed most things for. Would you suggest taking 12 credits again next semester, getting involved in research and extra-currics, and taking one or two classes over the summer instead? I would take Spanish 287 (3 creds), Engr 101(4 creds),  Math 216(4 creds), and UROP for 1 credit.

"I take it that you are in high school and are applying to U of M. You cannot directly apply to the school of information when you apply to U of M; The application to the School of Information is separate. Note though, that the SI program is a 2-year program that you do during your last 2 years here. The vast majority of students initially apply to U of M to whatever college, e.g. LSA, and they do their first 2 years doing SI pre-reqs and whatever other classes to get 60 lower level credits. Then, they apply to SI during their 2nd year, and, if accepted, start the SI curriculum their 3rd year. If you have 60 college credits already, you could potentially apply to the school of information and start the program as soon as you get in, though this is an extremely rare circumstance.

The School of Information Undergraduate program offers two main pathways: User Experience Research/Design and Informational Analysis. There is no computer science option. If you want to do computer science, then you will want to get your degree through LSA or Engineering school.

It can be a bit confusing, but basically, in your position, what you need to know is that you will either want to apply to LSA or Engineering school. If you plan on doing computer science, then you will stay in either of those schools for all four years until you get your degree. If however, you wish to transfer to SI, during your second year of college, you will apply to SI, and if accepted, you will transfer over from the school you were in to the School of Information. At that point, you leave the other school behind and you are fully enrolled in SI. (If you are really ambitious, it is possible to do a dual degree between SI and another school; for instance, some people do a dual degree of comp. sci. through LSA and User experience through SI)

When you apply, I would recommend applying to LSA or engineering, and just check the ""School of Information preferred admissions"" box or whatever it is in case you do indeed want to transfer to SI later on. It's not necessary, but it allows you to apply earlier and get a slightly better chance of getting in since you get considered  There are some pre-req courses for SI that you will have to take during your first two years; you can learn about those here: [https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/bachelor-science-information/how-do-i-apply/cross-campus-transfer](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/bachelor-science-information/how-do-i-apply/cross-campus-transfer)[https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/bachelor-science-information/how-do-i-apply/preferred-admissions](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/bachelor-science-information/how-do-i-apply/preferred-admissions)",1604096357,1,0

&gt; Is this the weakest point at which to attack one‚Äôs own Judaism? Read a bit further on in the Torah, and you can find God killing the first-born male children of Egypt to convince an unelected Pharaoh to release slaves who logically could have been teleported out of the country. An Orthodox Jew is most certainly familiar with this episode, because they are supposed to read through the entire Torah in synagogue once per year, and this event has an associated major holiday. The name ‚ÄúPassover‚Äù (‚ÄúPesach‚Äù) comes from God passing over the Jewish households while killing every male firstborn in Egypt.

&gt; It probably feels really good, for example, to rehearse one‚Äôs prescripted defense for ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt Science say that the universe is just meaningless atoms bopping around?‚Äù because it confirms the meaning of the universe and how it flows from God, etc. Much more comfortable to think about than an illiterate Egyptian mother wailing over the crib of her slaughtered son. Anyone who spontaneously thinks about the latter, when questioning their faith in Judaism, is really questioning it, and is probably not going to stay Jewish much longer.
