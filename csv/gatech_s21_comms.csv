"With this semester almost at its end, I would suggest you to just hang on tight and focus on the finals and any upcoming assignments.

You getting into Tech means that you have the capabilities to succeed here. However, Tech is a much harder school than most schools out there. Therefore, you should learn to adapt to it.

These are some of my recommendations for future semesters: 

Learn what your comfortable course load is (4 classes, 5 classes etc.)

Try not to take all the major classes all together. (try 3 major classes + 2 extra classes)

Try to get into classes which has a more lenient grade distribution. Ask your peers or use course critique to find this.

Try to get into classes together with your friends. You could form study groups which is a huge help.

You still have time to pull up your GPA. Good luck :)",1617059425,1,0

"Yeah, I remember the ones like that. My dynamics class had a professor where the policy was to curve the tests up so that the highest scoring person in the class got a 100. 

For one of his tests, I made something like a 65, and the highest scoring guy/girl pulled in a 98 or something like that. 

This was also the professor who (for a different class - vehicle performance) had allowed people to question their grades with him on tests in office hours, so while I was waiting in line for my turn the kid in front of me was saying ""it was just one mistake in the beginning that carried through and made everything in the problem off - why can't I get partial credit?""

The professor replied ""if you made this same mistake on a plane design, it would have crashed. Would you care about partial credit then?""

Professor Willard E. Wight taught Civil War History at GT my first quarter in the Fall of 1978. After he closed the doors to the lecture hall in the DM Smith building that was filled to capacity he started with this or WTTE:

""My name is Professor Willard E. Wight. Some of you may have heard me being referred to as Bastard Wight. I am not just a shaft, but a shaft with purple rotating barbs."" There were other words that followed those, but those are the ones still stuck in my head.

I watched as something like half the lecture hall left, presumably to drop the class. Like an idiot, I sat there. Tests were all essay-style in those stupid little blue notebooks using the tiny pencils he handed out at each test. Essay questions were on the most arcane civil war history points, a lot of them involving the theological conviction of the southern soldiers, and I am an atheist, so: fish in a desert sand dune at noon.

"I noticed you have a kid about to start middle school. What are you expecting your schooling situation to be? City schools are extremely hot or miss, but we do have some decent ones like Inman and Sutton middle schools and North Atlanta and Grady high schools. However, none of the high schools compare to the East Cobb, Alpharetta, etc., high schools. Depending on your lifestyle and how you value those tradeoffs you might consider at least taking a drive around some of those areas or evaluating the drive. 

FWIW, we have a 3-year-old and currently live close to campus. I'm on staff as well, my wife works in Buckhead. We have no intentions on living anywhere far from our jobs. Our daughter would go into E Rivers elementary, Sutton middle, and North Atlanta high schools. We'd have absolutely no qualms sending her along this path, and we're also looking at houses in Brandon elementary area (same middle and high).

I'd also recommend checking out the area where your wife expects to work and how to get in/out of campus as well as what's around it. Tech Square is a great part of campus that is also part of Midtown proper. I'm over on West campus with quick access to Marietta, Northside, and Howell Mill. She might, say, be located on the Hill near North Avenue and may want to check out that area.

Beyond that you've gotten some good advice in this thread already. Music, sadly, is still tough to find (stupid pandemic), but we have some awesome venues. You could check Creative Loafing for concerts closer to when you visit and at least gauge where those venues are.

Atlanta is also an excellent food city (and beer city if that's up your alley). Buford Highway has most of our ethnic cuisines. Ponce City Market is pretty close to campus and worth checking out. You can also spend some time on the Beltline while you're there (could be crowded depending on the weather). Some other specific food recommendations close to campus are Cypress Street Pint &amp; Plate, The Optimist, Fontaine's, Der Biergarden, and Six Feet Under.

For a quick jaunt in Atlanta I highly recommend the Botanical Gardens and Fernbank Museum. If you do the Gardens check out Piedmont Park while you're at it. Fernbank is kind of out of the way, but you can head over to Decatur after. Both are kicking off new exhibits, too!

I feel like that's a decent starting point, though I've certainly missed some stuff. Happy to answer other questions, too!",1613816251,1,0

If you want a little climbing fun, you can go to Kennesaw mountain (1.44 miles at 7.2%) only on weekdays for bikes, it‚Äôs about 30 minutes driving from midtown and is the only cat3 mountain I know of near Atlanta. Also, there are hiking and running trails at the mountain so good for the whole family. It‚Äôs a national park as well so I‚Äôd recommend the trip regardless if you want to bike it or not.

As for group rides, there are a ton in and around the Atlanta area, here‚Äôs a link to a list of them (make sure to reach out on Facebook or email to make sure they are still running, many rides are currently cancelled or restricted due to COVID and cold weather).

"Practice, practice, and more practice! CS 3510 is a tough class because in order to do well on the homeworks and exams you need to develop an intuition on how to design an algorithm (which is hard!).

What I would recommend is grabbing a copy of the [DPV Algorithms Textbook](http://algorithmics.lsi.upc.edu/docs/Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani.pdf) and 1. Read the chapters (they‚Äôre dense but explain things well) and 2. Solve the exercises at the end of each chapter.

There were some kinks to work out with distribution within the club, you probably just caught that, but there were some internal rules about attendance and arrival times to ensure that as many seats as possible could be filled with other students. Football is the only sport that guarantees tickets to Reck Club, and Reck Club isn‚Äôt the only student org that gets tickets (some of the seats in the front row you saw might have been the ones reserved for Goldfellas).

https://www.news.gatech.edu/features/broad-based-asymptomatic-testing-program-helps-control-covid-19?utm_medium=email

Your individual sample is tested in two batches. There are multiple batches in the total pool.

"In general, companies recruit in the fall for the next year (i.e. if you‚Äôre applying in the fall of 2021, you‚Äôd have a start date in 2022).

Spring semester recruiting is a bit different as some teams are looking for Spring/ Summer grads to fill out their 2021 targets and some may be already starting to look for 2022 start-dates, though in my experience it‚Äôs unusual and definitely not unheard of.

To directly answer your question OP. Sorry but you did not get in. What they are offering you is a guaranteed chance to transfer after a year at another college if you meet the performance requirements. I believe Georgia Tech does this for every person that has a family member that attended Tech. You should think long and hard about if you want to do that though as starting at a new school outside of the first year for the majority of students is hard and GT does not provide the same kind of support system and programs for transfers as they do for freshman.,1611450739,10,0

The advantage of being conditional over going to another school and then transferring, this ‚Äúpathway‚Äù is less competitive. If you did to transfer like you would after your sophomore year, then your chances of getting to GT is much lower because it‚Äôs more competitive and you‚Äôll be ‚Äúcompeting‚Äù against other strong students.

"It's not something to worry about, it's just the transfer experience, but even then, it's not that drastic. For me, it was def tough to find many new friends, but that was basically all because of COVID.

It's likely that most of your classes in your first year will be huge, with lots of people. The only friends I ever made in a class were with smaller class sizes, which start at the more advanced levels, in the later years.

My point is, the first year is not a big loss. You have 3 whole years to make it up anyway, and 3&gt;1 :p

One major downside: Your GPA resets when you get to GT. This means you won't have as much of a safety buffer with your GPA, and your first semester as a transfer would have to be rock solid.

"From searching my Outlook inbox for Clery alerts from the last four years, here's what I've found for on-campus robberies:

Fall 2017:

* 1 armed robbery (Tech Square)

2018: no on-campus Clery alerts for robberies

2019:

* 3 phone snatch and grabs *(Ferst @ Atlantic, Atlantic @ Tenth, State St b/t Ferst and Tenth)*

* 1 street robbery *(armed with pellet gun claimed to be real, NAve @ Techwood)*

2020:

* 3 armed robberies *(suspect then gave victim phone back and told them it was a prank, Williams near Fifth; Fourth b/t Williams and Spring; Paper Tricentennial parking)*

* 1 armed carjacking *(victim shot at suspects then fled/never reported incident so maybe not random robbery, WaHo)*

Now, Clery alerts don't cover all incidents (mainly just ones with the potential to represent additional threats to campus), but they *mostly* give us a good idea of how frequent it is. That said, that's not exactly a lot of robberies, especially compared to the off-campus stuff. Obviously, zero every year would be ideal, but the reality of any city is that robberies do sometimes occur, even infrequently in very safe places like campus. Still, it's true that robberies do occur on-campus, although it seems to be *relatively* infrequent.

Now, like you said there are other incidents of theft that don't involve confrontation (e.g. theft of bikes, backpacks, etc.). While those are obviously less than ideal, they're easier to mitigate and don't represent as significant a threat compared to robberies (with confrontations).",1615993608,1,0

I see a *lot* of people on reddit asking if they should go to Tech vs a similarly ranked school when the other school is much cheaper.

If you're going into serious debt ($60k+) for a Tech degree and you have a much cheaper offer in hand from another decent school, I would recommend going to the other school unless there's something *very specific* and worthwhile that you want here and can't get there (a lot of things can fall under this). The schools I've seen mentioned (UMD/UW-Seattle/Penn State/UNC/UMich) are all decent schools as far as opportunities go. In some cases Tech might be \*better\* but those places are still \*great\*.

People will probably mention Tech's ROI. My response is that a top student from (see list above) can match Tech students as far as opportunities go. The main difference is you *don't* have a student loan account the size of a mortgage hanging over your head. That can cause some major financial stress *even if* you walk out of commencement with your dream offer from FAANG making $170k.

I know GA Tech has a 5-year master's program (UMD does too), but I'm not sure if I would want to do that at GA Tech (or even UMD for that matter). I also have some interests in cybersecurity and I got into a smaller living-learning community at UMD that specializes in it, so I should be able to make friends easily. Will GA Tech offer more opportunities in terms of internships and job opportunities than UMD, or will I get the same if I work hard and be proactive at UMD?",1617974795,1,0

"Absolutely. Not blind defense at all, and so you know, there are people all over campus pushing for better (these are often folks in NTT roles, though, as often TT faculty as discouraged from real investment in their teaching, due to the false perception that one must choose). From what I have seen over the years, the longer we keep to CIOS the further we are from efficacy. Part of what is keeping us with that as the measure is student confusion that comfort in a class equals learning; since this CIOS system is gameable by faculty who wish to invest less in teaching, rarely will you see this challenged for this reason (known bias has recently been gaining traction to help move the needle, though). There is a movement by faculty to have better measures, but this has also been stalled by student insistence that their perceptions of learning are equivalent to evidence of it.

What ultimately matters is making the best out of your time at Tech to grow academically obviously but also as a person! I will say though that personal projects can help a lot in the CS field.

"The best place I have found is the cubicles in Price Gilbert, if you are really tall it might not be the best place for you. I have to sit with my legs stretched out do I don't hit the beam that is conveniently placed at the front of desk instead of the back. The chairs are alright, they do seem to be made for shorter than average people though. 

The Culc has some really good chairs, most of the tables are short though so you'll just be in the floor. It is hard to get one of these though since its the end of the semester. 

Crosland is the worst of the 3, I will never understand how someone can look at the population of Tech and think that its appropiate to have the majority of seating be stools or benches with no back support. For a lot of people it gets uncomfortable fairly quickly, and for some people with spinal issues (Yours truly), it is unusable. 

I am going to rant now.

Price Gilbert did one thing right, and that was having a quiet area with cubicles. The giant tables are good for group projects but outside of that they are super distracting.

Crosland is horrible. The problems from the old library and the Culc was that you could never really get a spot at somewhere that would be comfortable to work at for an extended amount of time. There is also so much wasted space right in the middle of the building on every single floor. There are some places that aren't terrible, but not a lot. 

All this considered, Crosland is a beautiful building. I don't hate it, I just think that there was, and still is, lack of semi-private study spaces that are comfortable for more than an hour. There was an opportunity to address those needs. We all knew what was needed, more space and more comfort for long days doing work. Sadly, someone somewhere thought it was best to ignore the legitimate reasons for a new library and instead put picnic tables, dangley lights, and somehow reduced the square footage to less than half of what it could be. I would honestly rather have had a 7 story McDonalds that only has ice cream machines that never work put there instead, because at least I expect something so wasteful and disappointing from McDonalds icecream machines.",1619134069,1,0

"Thank you for providing me your feelings on Teams. Teams does have issues, I am not arguing that. However some of the items you listed sound like support cases to address the issues. Some, to my prior point, are familiarity with the tool. I find Teams very organized. I can actually find files I have shared with someone in one location. I do not have to scroll up or pin something like I do in Slack. 

I call with video and browse files, and edit them all at the same time quite regularly. I use Teams for calls the majority of the day and I am rarely dropped. 

If this is an issue you are experiencing, I would recommend submitting an incident ([services.gatech.edu](https://services.gatech.edu)). I cannot quantify issues to Microsoft based off a Reddit conversation. I can, however, show the number of submitted cases and the work we've done to trouble shoot. Having issues and just stating you don't like it because of issues on Reddit doesn't help me resolve the problem.

Again, stating these are ""far superior"" is subjective.  For my business use, Teams is great.  For my personal use, I much prefer Discord and Google.  Have you ever used the full Google suite in a business environment? It's lacking features I rely on to get my job done. Again.. this is my personal opinion and experiences. Yours may differ. 

I can show you data that audio and video do not always drop.  As a mater of fact, in our tenant, BlueJeans has more dropped calls and audio issues then Teams. 

Yes, I have used Slack, Google, Discord, and so many other tools for years. I've also managed them at an enterprise level.   

Teams is not Slack is not BlueJeans is not Discord.  They offer similar features, yes, but they are different tools intended to be different.",1619129958,1,0

If you are concerned that your individual situation will cut too close to getting results via Tech's free Vault Kit travel testing option, there are a number of potential travel test options available throughout the Atlanta area.

The best resource for international travel is the [State Department‚Äôs website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/COVID-19-Country-Specific-Information.html).

The best resource for domestic travel is the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-planner/index.html).

Your best source to identify the appropriate type of test and available options off-campus should start with your travel/airfare provider. Check their requirements first, along with State Dept or CDC where appropriate.

"Midtown in general during the late 70's was very sketchy. IIRC, one of the guys on the lacrosse team was shot and killed outside of Howell House. Crossing the connector was like going into a different world (we used to go to Spring Street Liquors, the Agora Ballroom, etc.), hookers were plying their trade up and down Peachtree Street, and you definitely didn't want to go through the 3rd street tunnel alone late at night.

We used to walk down to the Omni for concerts back then, and once heard what we assumed was a mother and her kid sitting on their front doorstoop talking to each other on our way down Techwood. He asked what the white people were doing walking through their neighborhood, and she said WTTE of ""oh, those are Tech students, they're poorer than we are, so people mostly leave them alone"". We just kind of nodded to each other, thinking ""yeah, he's right"".

(which rubbed me the wrong way to begin with, but when we walked through it for the first time I was like, this literally looks like my home?)

I rarely went outside Midtown b/c I was working full time at GT with no car so I can't speak on all neighborhoods. Just something I noticed that I still relay to my Houston friends.

Make sure you start applying early, like around July tbh, and go to all the career fairs/info sessions/meet and greets that you can. Apply for job postings on boards like LinkedIn, handshake. Don't just feel constrained to stuff you see on careerbuzz, handshake, or the companies at career fair. You can set up notifications for new postings that fit your criteria and applying to those listings within 24 hrs of them being posted is going to significantly increase your chances of your resume being seen. And honestly maybe lower your standards. I know it's hard not to just aim for those Fortune 100 companies but for most people, those are the jobs you spend a few years working towards. Just because you don't recognize a company's name doesn't make their job any less legit and they could give you more specific experience and skills that will help you work your way up to those bigger companies.

"XPS and MacBooks are alright but not great bang for buck IMO. I'd say check out r/thinkpadsforsale. Thinkpads have a lot of corporate overstock and you can get a ton of power for extremely cheap if you buy used.

Look for one of these in decreasing order of computational power needed:

1. P1 Gen 2/3 - monster with a dedicated GPU 
2. X1 Extreme - premium mini-monster with good screens and build quality. I think slightly weaker than P1
3. T14/T14s AMD - Monster CPU, no dedicated graphics, perfect for code heavy workflows. Look for one with 400nit screen and upgraded RAM/storage
This is what I have and it slays for what I do but I don't do graphics heavy work.
4. X1 Carbon Gen something idk - really popular MacBook/XPS competitor. Great build, battery, and screen. IMO beats both. 
5. T495 - Previous edition of #3, almost as good for way cheaper. 
6. T480 - previous edition of #5, can be had for absurdly cheap. Value king. Get this if you feel like you don't need THAT much power. This will probably be more than enough for your needs.

"Alarm bells all over this post.    The first suggestion I will make is this:

Make a clear distinction between what you want to do with your working life (i.e. what you want to do for a living) and the separate (albeit somewhat related) desire to make a lot of money.   Medicine would be a shitty profession to go into just because you want to make money.  There is no shortage of business owners (food, contractor services, etc) that earn a doctor's salary without the decade+ of schooling and training it takes to make it in medicine.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are going to chase money, then starting your own business is typically the way to do it where your own smarts, accumen, timing and effort have a more direct effect on your success.  There's nothing wrong with going to work for a big company and playing the game to move up and get promoted, etc. but its not typically the path to wealth.

&amp;#x200B;

When people tell you to find your passion... what they mean is find \*a\* passion that you will be able to stick with and see through to its logical/practical end.   If you're a CS guy then this could mean starting any number of types of businesses.  Learning a field/industry and then starting a company to consult or work in that field once you have some contacts is one way to go.",1621275439,3,0

If you look at the money between CS and being a doctor, I'd say a doctor would finally break even with a CS career around age 40-45 after paying off debts and making less money during residency. But after that point, a doctor's net worth would be more on average. So if you're looking at just money, that could be something to consider.

Last of my random points, there's actually a lot more face to face interaction in CS than people think. I was also afraid to get into a CS job because I thought I would be alone in a cubicle working on my computer all day. Not completely like that though. I have meetings with others every day to discuss what we've done and plan what we'll do next. And then sometimes I'll do some coding with a partner.

"A lot of CS is being very adaptable and dynamic. You need social skills and the ability to adapt to new environments and tools. It‚Äôs not the most stable job depending on what you‚Äôre doing and usually you don‚Äôt stay in one place for very long unless you really love the company and what they‚Äôre doing. Maybe consider medicine if this doesn‚Äôt seem up your alley. Also 80k is not that hard to hit, even for internships (I mean by hourly compensation). Good luck.",1621264091,1,0

"&gt; I am a very hard worker and do my best in every task, but I don't know if I have that networking or street-smart sort of thing. I just like to do my work, and go home...I'm not good at doing extra projects and extra things to market myself or impress people. How likely is it that I will be stuck at a max of 100k for my whole life?

No one can tell you the answer to that question, not from a Reddit thread anyway. If you‚Äôre good you‚Äôll make more, else less.

&gt; I am debating between this and medicine, and sometimes I think I should just do medicine since I am good at just putting my head down and working hard, and I wouldn't have to constantly work to impress bosses once I'm done, but I don't know if that's a good reason. 

Have no experience or knowledge about medicine, but I highly doubt there is any job where you don‚Äôt have to try to impress your management.

&gt; Moving on from money, how many of you find your job meaningful or fun? Are there enough options out there that I can find something meant for me?

I find my job meaningful and fun because I like the work that I do. Whether or not a field is what you like to do is only something you can answer.

&gt; Also, how much stability is really there? Like some people I know in CS are constantly moving around with new jobs, and I would personally just like to stay put in one city that I like and keep working there happily. How realistic is that in this field?

You are allowed and even encouraged to stay in one company, but there are expectations that you will try to advance throughout the levels and not get stuck at some junior level.

&gt; Also, I wouldn't want to be forced to work from home ALL the time, because I'd prefer some face to face social interaction. But of course with a lot of remote jobs that's how it is.

Many jobs will not force you to wfh.",1621264009,2,0
I will agree the basketball games seem to have a lot better ratio of students. The football games were rather disappointing to see especially when the non student section parts of the stadium usually looked like they had a lot of unused seats. It was rather off putting to see that when it was so hard to get tickets as a student. That the athletic department also gave such a large section of the seats to things like Reck Club which is just a student club annoyed me. Especially since the games I was at they didn‚Äôt even use all the seats they had reserved.,1613783791,1,0
