"Chance me for ED (u can butcher me I'm not expecting the best)

* Vietnamese born from 2 immigrants parents(both went to some high school but no college). (I consider myself more American)
* First Child in family going to college (did not emphasize in my essays but probably should have)
* Income is about middle class? idk my parents work factory jobs but work hella overtime
* Going in to be a Math major, might change to Chem major.
* GPA UW: 3.9. W:4.33 (this is kinda BS cuz my school no longer counts my dual-enrolled classes on a 5.0 scale. So, RIP GPA and RIP school rank)
* 1470 SAT SS (680 English, 790 Math) RIP English
* 800 Math 2
* Top 10% in my school

Courses (the rest are normal stuff + 4 years of spanish)

* Freshman: AP Gov (3)
* Sophomore AP Calc (5), AP Stats (5)
* Junior: AP Chem (5), AP World History (4), Dual-enrolled Calc II and Dual-enrolled Multi variable Math I (both got A's)
* Senior AP Psych, AP Bio, Dual-enrolled Multi variable Math II and Bridge to Higher Mathematics (Intro to Proofs) (probably will get A's on both), Next semester I'm thinking of taking Dual-enrolled Numerical Analysis

Activities

* Piano (been doing it since I was 5 years old)
* Orchestra at Church (grades 9-12)
* Altar Serving (been doing it since I was 8 years old)
* Tutoring (NHS tutoring/ tutoring classmates and friends)

Letter of Recommendations

* Professor for Calc II- She was super nice I think she wrote a good LOR. I always would ask her questions and she told me that I deserve to go to Columbia.
* Professor for Multi I and Bridge to Higher Mathematics- I think he wrote a good LOR. But kinda nervous cause I'm on my phone a lot. ( I really like checking emails and College Reddit threads).

Essays (This is where I screwed up big time)

* Common App Essay: I chose the background prompt and gave some history of how my family got to America. Talked about sacrifices my parents made so I could live normally. Talked about how their sacrifices have impacted my life and influenced me to want to learn more. (I think this one is OK, my tutor said its very strong but I think I could have made it more personal)
* The lists: I think these are not weighted heavily. I chose interesting stuff that has shaped me ( a bunch of religious books and Vietnamese books)
* Why Columbia?: I talked about the environment of New York and I how really enjoyed the diversity and opportunities available. I also talked about the programs that Columbia offers to make the school affordable. Then I talked the student faculty ratio and the education their. (I screwed up on this one because I accidentally said the University of Columbia instead of Columbia University. RIP Me. I also could have talked more about their math classes and the type of curriculum they offered. I talked about it in my interview, but I think the essay is weighted heavier) (tutor said this was the best I could do given the fact that I was never able to visit Columbia)
* Why you are interested in a certain field: I talked about my grandma and how she provided me an education in math at a very early age. I talked a little about my dual-enrolled classes. Then connecting with those classes, I talked about the type of environment math has provided me. Finally, I talked about how math has benefited me in the real world. (problem solving , persistence , etc.) (tutor said this was good, I should have connected it more about Columbia though)

Interview:

* Luckily I got the option for the interview. It was over the phone and pretty informal. I think the interview went alright. The interviewer was really nice and she shared a lot about her experience there. I basically elaborated on some of the stuff I said in my application. 

Personally, I think my application is very weak, and I think I have no chance to go to Columbia College. My SAT is below average , EC are very few, and my essays suck. If you can't tell I really suck at English. Vietnamese was my first language then I learned English. Household doesn't speak English. Parents didn't go to college so they couldn't help me out (they needed to work immediately to get money for the family when they moved here escaping the War). Luckily, they saved enough money for me to go to a math program during elementary school and so that I can dual-enroll as a junior and senior(the college is private and its 6 miles away so it cost a lot of $$$ for classes and gas.)  Only strengths in the app are my dual-enrolled classes and hopefully my LOR.",1574616169,1,0

"It is not fucking easy to get into GS. Yes, it's true that for most of us in the program (including myself), there have been gaps in our education. Some of us made bad choices or fell ill when we were younger (by which I mean normal college freshman age), or couldn't afford to attend our dream schools after graduating high school, or decided to serve in the military, or were busy pursuing a time-sensitive opportunity (professional acting/music, a professional or competitive sport where your career peak is during ages 17-21, etc), or took a break for any number of other compelling reasons. 

In what world is it ""easier"" to be a student from, say, a working-class background who eventually establishes enough academic and professional clout to be accepted into an Ivy League university (and does so after years of work and struggle) than it is to be a sheltered, wealthy 18-year-old who gets accepted as a legacy, and/or gets accepted thanks to years of help from various highly-paid tutors, college application consultants/essay editors, expensive prep schools, and the like? 

When I first learned about the General Studies program, I knew that this was what I wanted for myself. I had dropped out of a state university after nearly flunking out my first year, and spent the next four working full-time to support myself, *and* volunteering, *and* consulting on political campaigns, *and*, in the last two of those years*,* attending community college courses and busting my ass to get straight A's. I poured 100% effort into my application, essay, and grades leading up to submitting my application. This was my dream - and while I feel lucky and grateful that that dream came true, for people like you to say that I came by it ""easily"" is a damn farce. I worked my ass off. 

If you truly can't understand why people who get accepted into this program would feel excited and proud of themselves, then that's a shame. By the way, GS students have the highest GPAs of the 4 undergrad colleges on campus, so... I don't know what about that says ""unqualified applicants"" to you.

Oh, and one last note about ""selectivity"" - the GS application is long, incredibly arduous, and has strict rules about who's eligible. The CC application, on the other hand, can be accessed through the Common App and is often tacked on (along with tons of other ""reach"" schools) by high schoolers who apply regardless of whether they have an actual shot or not... simply so they can say they applied to Columbia. The way the GS application is written, in addition to the fact that the program is less well-known (i.e. mostly sought out by those who are already both really interested and more likely to be qualified) means that while there are far fewer applications than CC, the overall pool of applications that GS *does* receive are generally of a higher caliber. The combination of those two factors is a big part of why the percentage of accepted applicants is higher than CC or SEAS.",1574560363,1,0

You'll likely have significant debt at the end, so the question is will you use your Columbia pedigree to attain the high paying job that it will help you get? If your ultimate goal is to become a teacher or something like that where the pay is (sadly) lower, you might not find the cost/benefit worth it.

Before all scholarships and financial aid, you would owe at minimum about $62,000 per year.

I love Columbia because the university took a chance on a girl from a suburban public school in California and transformed her into a true New Yorker. Columbia constantly inspires me to work towards achieving my full potential and has led me to develop the self confidence I was always lacking in high school. Moreover, the university’s resources are unparalleled. I come from a small ethnic group and the university has an entire center dedicated to our culture, which has helped me feel comfortable here and meet other individuals with similar backgrounds. Columbia is also so open to providing undergraduates with access to its alumni. I’ve attended events like the Alexander Hamilton Dinner, the Core Centennial, and lunch with Deantini. These types of experiences would never be open to students at a larger university. 

I feel like some students come to Columbia with the mindset of “I just need to get through this and leave with my degree.” No matter how many tests or exams I take/the amount of stress culture I hear about, I fully plan on making the most of my four years here. Morningside Heights has truly become my home, and Columbia will forever hold a place in my heart. (roar, lion, roar!)",1571473434,1,0

"An important lesson about life is that sometimes you put in the work and you‘re not rewarded. At Columbia, putting in the work does not guarantee you an A. Remember that this is not high school, the material is supposed to be more challenging, and while you might be used to getting only A‘s in HS, that‘s simply different in college (especially at Columbia and especially in STEM). That being said, a B+ is absolutely not bad? It’s pretty good! I agree with the others. Just think about the fact that you got B‘s in your first year at a renown research institution. Students here are supposed to push the field further, and that’s exactly what an A means. I’ve been told by many professors that if you‘re doing everything right, you’ll get a B. An A is anything beyond that. I‘m sure you‘ll do fine — as you can see you‘re capable of A‘s. Just talk to your professors to see what you can do to get to that higher range and most importantly: try to stop stressing out about the effort/reward thing and acknowledge that it‘s totally ok to get a B+, especially here.",1571402119,1,0

"Hey. I was in that situation second semester freshman year. I had a bunch of Bs in LitHum, Bs in chem lab, Bs in UW, and I felt like I was in a hole. But honestly, it’s not as bad as it seems and you can totally turn it around. I ended up turning all those Bs into As by the end of the semester. 

What you need to do first is talk to your LitHum professor about your papers and books. Seriously, the professors want to help you, and he’s probably quite bored during his office hours, I’m sure he’d be happy to give you tips. Some LitHum professors are harsh graders, you just have to figure out what they want and nail the upcoming assessments. 

As far as calculus, that is just an issue of learning how to study for that class. A B+ is not terrible, by the way. Think of it as your baseline. As a first semester freshmen at fricking Columbia, your worst, baseline score in math is a B+. Think about how awesome you will do with some optimized study schedule. My personal advice is to get your hands on as many practice problems as you can and just drill them over and over before the exam. All calculus is is practice. 

The best advice I think I have is not to beat yourself up. I know it’s easier said than done, but everything will be just fine. Unless you’re premed, your GPA is not the end-all-be-all. Grad schools look more for lab experience and papers. Just make sure you have above a 3 by the end of your four years.

"I'm a vet in GS. Pro-tips:

1. The Post-9/11 GI Bill doesn't cover everything. The Yellow Ribbon Program doesn't even match the remainder, even at the $20,000 for the YRP and GI Bill combined.
2. You can still apply for grants and flippin' do it. The Pell Grant, VFW, etc. 
3. Do your disability claim ASAP. The extra income is good, don't shy away from it. At a 50% rating you also get free VA health insurance and as such, aren't required to buy health insurance from the school. And then you can apply for Chapter 31, or Vocational Rehabilitation. It covers ALL the costs (side from the medical insurance), buys your books for you at the Columbia book store AND the nearby indie store Book Culture. It can buy you a new laptop and other gear. If you don't have a DD-214 and you're still in the reserves, I'm actually unsure of what you can apply for in terms of the insurance.
4. The BAH is prorated. Meaning months like December and January, when you're not in class for a full month, you get a partial payment based on how many days are active in the university's semester. I want to clarify weekends, autumn/fall break, and days you don't have scheduled classes will NOT count against you. Also, the VA pays you the E-5 with dependents rate for the zip code of your learning institute, and NYC has been lowered, LOWERED by about $800 a month by the DoD. That was a punch to my gut and wallet!
5. You know how crazy renting is here, as a native. My wife and I are considering moving up the Hudson and BUYING a house to commute in to save money. If you're a disabled veteran, there is a ""Fair Fare"" program that halves to costs of the MTA for you. Also, look into the Columbia Housing and where you can take a Columbia shuttle bus and commute in.

"Hey! Am an Army Vet at GS. 

If you are using post 9/11 GI, the GI Bill will cover most, if not all, of your first semester of the academic year. ~24000. GS is a yellow ribbon school and will match the VA’s 10000 the following semester (so around 20000). That leaves a couple thousand on the table. Do you FAFSA, and do it early,  and see if you are eligible for Pell Grants. FAFSA takes you W2 from two years ago, but if you write a letter for change in circumstance (like you will be unemployed), you should qualify, which will more than likely cover the rest. Finally there are federal loans that you can receive as well. 

When using your post 9/11, you will receive a housing stipend, depending on how many credits you are taking. It’s around 3600 per month (don’t quote me, it’s in that ball park tho). I have found that this is suitable for me to live comfortably, but my husband is also a veteran attending school in NJ. In NY, this money will not go too far, but I’m telling you now, living in NJ and going to NYC SUCKS. It’s seriously miserable, but cost of living is cheaper. Do a lot of research and figure out what the best housing arrangement would be for you.

2.) If you are eligible, look into VocRehab, it pays for 100% of your tuition. This is important since Columbia's tuition is very expensive and Post 9/11 plus Yellow Ribbon typically won't be enough to graduate on time.

Contact the office of the physician who originally suggested that you take medical leave, they may also be able to suggest a course of action or provide you with an evaluation for readmission.

Absolutely DO NOT do the most as far as course overload. Chill out. I did 9 credits my first semester then moved up to 12 and it is kicking my ass especially since they are no longer intro classes.

The culture here is so over the top sometimes especially when you’re in class with CC that you have to remember to center yourself.

A lot of GS students work at least part time and I have to say to myself “ well if I didn’t work and only had school/ chosen extra curricular activities I’d have all A’s too!” Also everyone DOES NOT HAVE ALL A’s. People here have really good poker faces.

The MacBook Pro is already relatively light and the new quad core i5 in the base Pro is pretty fucking fast. So personally I’d go for the MBP—but you can’t go wrong either way. Definitely opt for the 256gb model over the 128gb, and if your wallet allows for it, opt to upgrade the RAM to 16gb. DEFINITELY GET APPLECARE+ FOR YOUR MAC! DO NOT SKIMP. I CAN’T STRESS THIS ENOUGH.

"Former intramural ref. Intramurals at Columbia are a blast, but soccer is usually the most intense one. If you're going in with a group you already know (e.g. you're the John Jay 7 team) you'd probably have a lot more latitude to suck than if you joined someone else's team as a rando. Also, I don't think intramurals have a full participation requirement, meaning you could be on a team but never see the light of day. Co-ed is normally a bit less intense, but the same general factors apply.

I would suggest you slowly over the semester try to find if any of your friends, floormates, classmates, etc.  are into soccer, and then create an Indoor Soccer team for the winter! Indoor Soccer is way fun and way sillier than outdoor soccer.

No data has been published in regards to averages or acceptance rates in years, which makes me worry about the longevity/prestige of the degree I'm paying $300k to acquire",1568071544,1,0

"At a uni gym it’s probably not very common, but at my hometown gym plenty of people walk the track, that’s why there’s a walking and running lane. It’s more that the people who willingly subject themselves to the horror that is Dodge probably don’t have better alternatives while walking/jogging can be done in the parks. 

End of the day, if anybody spends the time to judge you they’re doing something wrong. Do what makes you happy and dw abt everyone else.",1568071401,1,0

"I am going through the job finding process now, As a Marine vet and Columbia grad, and let me tell you some pragmatism. No one gives a fuck that you are a vet. Despite all the bs you've been fed, no one is going to hire you just because you are a vet. You cannot rest on your accomplishments. What your vet status gets you is a bonus point, if they already like you for your skills. 

All that hiring vet initiatives stuff isn't for the good jobs, it's for things like security guards.

My GPA was kind of shit, I got a 3.0, but that was in an engineering dept full of foreign grad student and crazy smart kids who absolutely killed themselves to get A's, with the side effect of keeping the curve high. I did all the work, high he grades, but low test scores, because I didn't want to study all night. My first job offer was rescinded when they discovered my GPA was not so great. Sucked, but oh well.

My advice is to address your attitude of entitlement. You are the one who signed up for infantry, that was your choice to do the hardest job, and you are definitely a badass American patriot for making that choice. I personally think that speaks volumes about your character and your potential.

But again, not many put character first, and no one cares about what you might be able to accomplish in the right environment. It's your skills, what you can do and know right now.

You want to improve your situation, you want a better job, okay. Can you focus that down more? What field do you want to work in, what kind of companies interest you the most? This may give you a better idea on where to put your efforts.",1569372886,1,0

"CS grad here. It really depends on your major. If it is STEM, it is going to be competitive and stressful. Unless you are a legitimate genius, in which case, you will still need to put in some effort, but not as much as others.

As far as CS goes, I stressed out about deadlines, tests, and grades. I was one of the more chill students but didn't realize this until I did a team project and we stayed up until 3am at the first meeting. I went home to sleep but two of my team actually switched to working on hw.

Everyone is gung-ho. This means competitive and collaborative. If you must have A's, you will be stressed as well.

I was in the whitewater kayaking club for one semester and it was lots of fun, definitely had that chill vibe that was missing from being an engineering student. I highly recommend finding a club or two to round out your experience.",1569371097,1,0

"Trilogy Ed Services packages other people's information. For example, in their ""pre-work"" it is the websites of OTHER programs and courses where they tell you to go learn it from them.

It is amazing that they get away with this and Columbia University should intervene in some way. Students are dedicating a lot of time, money, and effort to walk away with essentially nothing. Nearly an entire month is dedicated to projects that don't benefit anyone. You sit around in class and do research and mention repetitive information that all the other groups mention, without ever having to utilize technical skills to benefit yourself. AT LEAST one month is dedicated to this.

"as websites tend to do.

the dining hall is fine but no matter how good it might be, you’re not going to want to eat every meal there.  get the minimum number of meals and maximum number of points or dining dollars or flex bux or whatever the fuck they call it now.",1573790579,1,0
"Here's the honest to god evaluation of a first year student on a meal plan: 

It's not bad. It's not great.

Rated as the top dining hall in the nation, I was expecting better. 

As a dining hall in general, especially as university dining halls go, it's decent. 

As people have already said repeatedly, the dining halls have their on days and off days. I would like to point out that anything chicken except for their chicken parm is extraordinarily dry. 

You'll come to find out that Ferris doesn't understand the concept of lunch - they only serve brunch, weekends or weekdays be damned. 

Also, Google Reviews claim(s) (I'm not entirely sure if Google Reviews is to be approached as a singularity or a plurality...) that both Ferris and John Jay are ""Fine Dining"". That's a hilarious joke. Once again, they're not bad for dining halls, but fine dining? Please. Chipotle has finer fries, and Chipotle doesn't even serve fries.

Personally, I wouldn't say that the dining halls are worth paying for if you're paying without a meal plan, as one entry costs somewhere in the ballpark of $15. Depending on the meal plan you get, I believe it gets reduced to somewhere around $11 a swipe? Not bad. 

Now here's the real life hack: go to the Barnard Dining Hall. It's underground and fantastic. By far better than John Jay, Ferris, or anything. And you really don't even need a meal plan, as one entry costs $8 for lunch, and $11 for dinner. I will admit that sometimes the lines are rather long, and the hours aren't as flexible as your ""Columbia"" options, but they're great quality for a cheaper price. However, you can still use Columbia dining hall swipes there, so should you choose to purchase a meal plan, you can still access the Barnard dining halls.

I took honors intro and honors data structures. It doesn't make a difference.  Intro (1007) consists of several large programming projects where you learn to use design patterns. It is pretty cool if you are already proficient in Java. Honors data structures (3137) consists of everything you'd learn in 3134 but you also learn functional programming which is usually taught in Scala.,1577751327,1,0
"I just finished the honors intro class. You learn some pretty useful skills (how to write clean code, design patterns, etc.) but the work load is quite high and can be a big pain in the ass. Some of the stuff we cover is also kinda useless and the midterm/final is all lecture based so if ur not a great note taker you’ll lose out on that. The other 50% of ur final grade is based on coding assignments, and although those take up the majority of the time and work u put into that class (and probably also the majority of the work you put into your freshman year), your programming skills will improve A LOT by the end of the semester — I can barely look at my old code without cringing a little. 

To answer your other questions, you don’t need to take honours intro to go into honours DS. Definitely self study AP CS  before u get here, but if you haven’t programmed before, I wouldn’t recommended u take honors intro or DS ur first semester. Going into the regular intro class is perfectly fine (many people do it) even if you did well on the AP, and breezing through ur first semester isn’t a bad thing at all. If you do feel confident in ur programming skills and are deciding between honors intro and DS, I would say take honors only if u really enjoy coding (like doing ur own projects and stuff). I have a couple friends in that class who regret taking honors and wish they just went straight to DS, but to each their own and there’s no rush to finish all of ur requirements.",1577749366,1,0

"It does not matter at all which class you take. There will never be a case in your career where taking honors intro comp sci will make or break you.  I think they just offer honors to pacify those Freshmen who try to skip out of the intro classes. 

I took the non-honors and I have a lot of friends who took honors.  I can assure you that it makes no difference down the road. Honors is harder than the non-honors. For me, I saw the added difficulty as unnecessary to becoming a good programmer/CS student. Plus, having a less difficult first semester of college is (in my opinion)  a good decision.",1577746538,1,0

If you do end up going to class, give students who at taking it for a grade priority seating and generally just don't be a dick, the professor is doing you a favor letting you sit in.

With this being said, if you generate a rapport with a given prof, they won't mind you participating in class. Big asterisk here : participated only once in one of the classes because the professor was also my advisor.

It is not the same as actually attending Columbia, though you will get many perks as a Barnard student, including campus access, ability to cross-register, and eligibility for athletics, clubs, etc. Barnard students also participate in university commencement. 

The difference lies primarily in prestige and academic rigor. The prestige lies in Columbia's status as a member of the Ivy League. While this status was originally owned by Columbia College (the oldest division of the uni), it has since grown to include every formal undergraduate and graduate school that comprises Columbia University as an ivy and includes SEAS, GS, the Medical and Law schools, SIPA, GSAS, Journalism, etc. Outside of that umbrella is where you'll find affiliate schools like Barnard, Teacher's College, and JTS. This is not hard to understand. The tangible ""advantage"" is that as a graduate of Columbia proper you will receive better name recognition and brand advantage as opposed to being a Barnard graduate.",1577587100,1,0
Why are you generalizing? No need to be so toxic,1577584495,1,0
"Well, you're successfully arguing that a SEAS student is not in Columbia College. But that really has nothing to do with them being in the Ivy League. Nothing about the Ivy League necessitates finishing the Core. I actually have never seen anyone try to argue that SEAS isn't in the Ivy League before, so points for creativity I guess. 

Anyways, as a CC student, I can safely say you're wrong and it isn't a matter of opinion. Athletic eligibility is probably the most obvious way (any SEAS student is on equal footing when it comes to participating in literally Ivy League conference sporting events), but even with the connotational definition of ivy league academics, SEAS and CC are grouped for the purpose of all reputable ranking systems, so that the prestige bestowed on Columbia University by the US News &amp; World Report, for example, is shared equally by those two schools. The endowment of Columbia university is shared between these schools (and it is not shared with GS or Barnard). The selective admission statistics published by Columbia and third parties are again representative of both CC and SEAS, and there is no appreciable difference in admissions standards, and so on and so forth.",1577576846,1,0
"The ivy league athletically allows students from multiple colleges within the university, as it does from every conference member. To say Barnard is part of the Ivy League academically is simply not true.",1577575435,1,0
Does your degree diploma say Columbia College or something else? Does a SEAS student complete The Core in entirety? Does a BC degree program require the Core and all of its requirements?,1577575349,1,0
"If that’s the case, then definitely slide in and finish your undergrad at SEAS. If you’re still interested in doing a masters after finishing your BS at CU, you’ve got a better chance of going to schools like Stanford or MIT (and Columbia will have a near automatic MS acceptance if you do well enough in undergrad there, so don’t worry about losing the MS CU opportunity).",1577574898,1,0

"&gt;I think you're really underrating how much it matters - and Barnard students subconsciously understand this as well bcs half of their resumes list Columbia and not their college.

Part of the reason why I'm less sensitive to this is because I took CS with a ton of Barnard students who flourished alongside me and other CU kids. They took the same courses as I did (IIRC, Barnard might be developing its own CS department, but for now I don't believe it has a separate department). So I'm probably biased as tech is (marginally) more meritocratic than other industries. A lot of the Barnard students I studied with are doing very well post-grad. 

You do make a fair point, though I really do think it's very contextual and industry/major dependent.",1577564430,1,0
"Frankly, it’s a huge disservice to Columbia girls to equate the degree to Barnards when they had to work harder to get admitted as well as deal with increased rigor in coursework, which is why I am always confused when a Columbia girl says that a Barnard degree is equivalent.

"My point is that feeling superior to another student on the basis of school affiliation is pretty silly, especially as many Barnard classes take CU classes and are competitive with their CU peers. I will concede that some employers will privilege a CU degree over a Barnard Degree, and that might be relevant to OP depending on what she wants to do. Even if that's the case, I don't think an employer is necessarily justified in regarding the Barnard student as a less competitive candidate (though it may be justified if you regard the core highly or think the CU version of a department is more demanding). 

That being said, just because I don't like something doesn't mean it isn't a real force that has ramifications for one's job prospects.",1577563407,1,0

I was still able to take any classes I wanted at CU and didn't have to deal with the core or anything like that. The housing was great as well, and I graduated with the exact same degree as my friends from Columbia. Now, being a grad student back at Columbia (at TC), I'm really glad I went to Barnard and not Columbia, because I feel like I was under less pressure at Barnard to reach the same high goals and expectations. 

Also I agree with the above person: anyone who thinks of Barnard students as inferior frankly needs to check themselves.

"for a school like columbia, make sure you have these MINIMUM requirements before applying. 

3.7+ GPA

At the very least 1400+ SAT or 33+ ACT. You need to show academic prowess outside of just community college. 

Strong Extracurriculars - not just volunteer clubs, club sports, church band kind of stuff. Something that makes you competitive and SPECIAL. 

Your high school classes have to have been difficult for that 3.2. Make sure you let Columbia know why your gpa was so low. In the off chance that your gpa was low and you were taking regular classes, I would honestly have to recommend that you consider other schools.

Do research on the resources Columbia has for your specific major/career (e.g. access to NYC hospital systems for premed)- no one will be able to give an answer that works in the context of your background/application as well as you can, and a well-thought out answer will ultimately show that you put in the effort to learn about Columbia as well as actually plan for your time here.

"John Jay. John Jay. John Jay. I am SO glad I picked this dorm!

- John Jay has doubles (although they're admittedly rare) if you're into that

- Singles are GREAT. It's so nice to have your own place to go to at the end of the day (in NYC you're constantly surrounded by people)

- JJ's Place (22/7 food) and John Jay dining hall are literally right here. So nice in the winter that you don't have to go outside to get food. 

- Health services are right here, need a flu shot? Just go to floor 3.

- The housing services are also in the same building. If you lock yourself out, you can get a new key on the first floor. If you need a new ID card, ect. it's right around the corner (you don't need to go outside).

- The floors are SUPER social; it's all freshman and not hard to make friends at all. Plus, we have a beautiful lounge on the first floor where everyone hangs out.

- Looking for a quiet place to study? The lounges on some of the upper floors (13, 14) are usually empty -- great place to get work done.

- Events almost every week like dinner with faculty, hot chocolate, holiday parties ect being hosted on the first floor. 

- Clean -- it doesn't reek of alcohol, drugs, or what have you. If you want those things, you can find them on campus, but who wants that in their own home 24/7?

If ALL you care about is a nice living environment, amenities, the ability to cook, ect -- pick Furnald. But know that you will have to make a concerted effort to make friends (the dorm is extremely anti-social).

If ALL you want are parties, alcohol, being surrounded by other people 24/7, and nonstop social activity, pick Carman. 

In MY opinion, John Jay is the perfect balance, but it's up to you. Whatever you do, DON'T pick a dorm I haven't listed like Wallach, Hartley, ect. These are old, disgusting, and have literally no advantages over the other ones.
