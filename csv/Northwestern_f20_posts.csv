Remote Learning Coaching for Students,"Hello, my name is Hayden and I am a sophomore at the University of Washington in Seattle. I struggle with what are called executive function skills, which are the skills you use to manage your day and make decisions. These skills include planning and prioritization, time management, organization, task initiation, and sustained attention. Over a period of three years, I was able to develop and implement a system to overcome these challenges, and I wrote about it in my book, *Freshman 101: The Guidebook to Planning, Prioritization, and Time Management*.

I noticed that a lot of students had similar challenges with these skills with the transition to remote learning in the spring. Seeing this need, I have[ created a set of remote learning coaching sessions](http://remotelearningcoaching.com/) to help students improve on these skills, which are critical for success. If any of the following describe your experience - or if you are concerned about them for fall term - then this program is right for you.

* Struggled to stay organized and keep your assignments straight
* Consistently ran up against deadlines
* Struggled to manage your workload and balance lectures with work
* Were unable to break assignments or projects into smaller, more manageable and actionable pieces

Over three, one hour sessions, you will learn strategies to address all of these, how to think about remote learning, and, for freshmen, how to read a syllabus.

You can learn more about my website [remotelearningcoaching.com](https://remotelearningcoaching.com) or email me at remotelearningcoaching@gmail.com.",1599681483,1,0

Any other options to learn data science if you're not allowed to take the sequence?,"I *really* want to take the Data Science 1/2/3 sequence and it is important for my career. In fact, NU's great stats/data classes are one reason why I came here in the first place. However, in my first year here I was informed the minor and waitlists were all full and they could not accept anyone else or put anyone else on the waitlist. And you can't take the classes without being in the minor. Since I transferred and only had two years at NU (one year left now), I'm simply not here long enough to get a spot on the waitlist or in the minor.

So in short, Northwestern / the data science program is telling me that because I'm a transfer student, I don't get to learn data science.

I'm aware there are other options to learn online, but as a full-time college student with multiple jobs  I don't have the time to take classes outside of my classes-for-credit, unless I delay my graduation and future job (which isn't an option for me). I'm in college expecting I can learn from my college. 

I especially don't understand this logic when classes are online anyway, and there is no such thing as a ""classroom cap"". It would not harm anyone or break any fire codes to add a few additional students to the class.

Are there any other ways to get into these classes, or other options I'm missing? I don't understand why this is a thing.

And yes, I already took other available courses in similar areas. I just want to take these courses.",1599328552,1,0

Did #nucommunitynotcops forget about the 2018 security incident?,"And no, I'm not referring to the multiple incidents where students were accosted during the fall of 2018 (though some other people have discussed this as well). 

If you were in Evanston on Pi Day 2018, you'd remember an afternoon of either chilling in your dorm or barricading your classroom door with chairs and desks after receiving (false reports) of   
a gunman approaching your area. Fortunately, that event turned out to be a hoax - but for me it was a reminder that on a campus such as NU's we can often take public safety &amp; security for granted. As far as I know - no one had complaints of NUPD/EPD's actions and response that day.  

Why do I bring this up? With all the recent calls for abolition/defunding of NUPD, I think it's crucial that we reflect on the reasons why we need an armed security force. (Let me be clear - I'm not here to criticize the activist movements, nor do I agree with all the actions of NUPD. On the protests I will just say this: I don't agree with vandalism but property can be replaced - lives cannot). 

The last time I made a post like this some people commented that the defund movement isn't about getting rid of police but re-directing police funding to social services and other community initiatives that can address the roots of crime/policing issues. I would guess that most people support this or aren't opposed to this idea. But what about the people calling for the complete disarmament/removal of NUPD? From what I saw, those supporting the defund movement saw these anti-police proponents as more of a minor fringe group within the larger defund movement. However with recent events, it's clear that police abolition advocates aren't a minority. 

Jumping back to my main argument - do I think getting rid of NUPD is a stupid idea? No I do not. But removing NUPD without an answer for who/what is going to fill the crucial responsibilities and gaps that NUPD currently handles would be foolish and short-sighted. We could argue all day about all the  shortcomings &amp; things NUPD has failed to do, but I don't think you can argue that NU would have been better off w/o NUPD on a day like March 14, 2018.

I stand with NUPD,"I’m just going to say it — I support NUPD and all that they do. Despite brutality complaints against EPD and CPD, NUPD has policed our campus safely for years, without a single brutal incident on record. They have [apprehended ](https://patch.com/illinois/evanston/suspect-charged-northwestern-sexual-assault) violent criminals, responded to numerous health &amp; safety risks, and dealt with [, most commonly, harassment and theft ](https://dailynorthwestern.com/2020/06/24/campus/analysis-northwesterns-relationship-with-nupd-epd/). 

Sure, there should be reforms. I won’t argue that there is no racial bias. NUPD *must* be held accountable for this — *any* double-standard, racism, sexism, or homophobia is wholly unacceptable. Nevertheless, they have done an overwhelmingly good job, despite how some students seem to be reacting. 

I would rather be overseen by NUPD than by a band of teenage vandals who take pleasure in setting banners aflame and writing “more *dead* pigs” on the arch. A death threat?? Are you out of your minds?? If community policing means being overseen by communities like this...no thanks.

If you want to chant “abolish the police,” do it in Chicago, or New York, or Los Angeles.

If you’re just doing it here because you know that your vandalism will go unpunished (unlike in major cities) due to the ironic lenience of NUPD, you are a coward. 

I know I’ll get downvoted, possibly even banned. I don’t care. Someone needs to speak up for those who are scared into silence by a cult of vindictive radicalism.",1603059038,1,0

Recruiting advice,Ok i’m using a throwaway account but I’m a sophomore interested in a quantitative career like maybe finance (..?) and I think I fucked up. I have a trash GPA (let’s just say &lt;3.0) which means clubs and internships won’t even look at my application. I got rejected from 5 business clubs/frats without even a first round interview. Same with internships because there’s always a 3.5 gpa requirement. I had a really bad fall quarter freshman year and I’m now getting better grades but COVID happened and the p/f thing for spring (which was my best/easiest quarter) so I couldn’t raise my gpa. I’m not sure what to do and I really need some advice because I’m trying my hardest but nothings working. I really need an internship this summer because i want to learn more so does anyone have some advice? I’m a firm believer in “everything happens for a reason” but these rejections kinda hurt.

Dirty little secrets?,"Dirty Little Secrets?

As a senior in high school, suddenly waves upon waves of college-related issues are being thrown at me.

NU has recently peaked my interest as the perfect college.  Literally.  I’ve visited so many times and had an internship there last summer. Everything was sparkling when I toured the campus.  Everyone was nice and polite, the campus is gorgeous, and everyone seemed glad to be there.  Evanston and *the lake* is right there, the dorms were solid, and sports are pretty present on campus.  It was awesome!

However, that got me thinking.  Nothing is perfect.  Nothing.  Everyone and everything has dirty little secrets.  So what is NU’s?  If I'm going to spend at least 4 years at Washington University, at a rate of roughly $75,000 a year, I should probably know ahead of time what terrors I will experience here.

Should I drop French?,"Freshman here wondering whether I should drop French :(

I already meet the language requirement for WCAS and took French this quarter just for fun (because I thought it would be an easy A), but given the past several quizzes, I haven't been doing too well.

I feel like I'm getting a C at best since the grading isn't curved either.

Especially since I'm a pre-med, I don't want to decrease my GPA unnecessarily, and right now, French is just extra stress on top of time-intensive math and chem courses.

If I do drop French, is it bad if I only take 3 classes this quarter? I'm pretty sure I'm not able to add any more classes on unfortunately. Or should I try to push through it?",1602533249,1,0

Creating an Alumni / Grad Student Community - Any Interest?,"NU alum here! I'm on the alumni board of a major city (that is not Chicago lol) and wanted to get some feedback on an idea that our young alums have been entertaining for a while.

Social:  
\- Coordinate virtual hangouts like happy hours, wine/beer/whiskey tastings, etc.  
\- Attend virtual events from alumni clubs across the U.S. and internationally (pretty cool since we're all kinda forced to be virtual right now... plus most clubs are talking about continuing virtual stuff even after we're all back to ""normal"" life)  
\- Voice chat during NU/college/pro sports events

I've seen some professors try to incentivize participation by instituting \*daily\*, qualitatively-scaled participation grades.

"What is the well-lived life? NU Prof. Richard Kraut helps us explore Aristotle, virtue, and meaning Sept. 23rd 3pm via Zoom","Today at 3pm we continue the [Passion Project](passionprojectlsc.com) programming with a discussion with Richard Kraut about the well-lived life. Specifically we'll be hearing from Professor Kraut about Aristotlean ethics, seeking the good, virtue, and what counts for a well-lived life. If you want a preview, please see a lecture he gave here in which he defends the usefulness of Aristotlean ethics while also critiquing it. I'll also include a sample to whet your appetite:

What then does Aristotle have in mind?  One possibility is this: what he thinks all our endeavors aim at is not goodness as Moore understood it, but rather what is good for someone.  In other words, our rational desires and aims always represent their objects as in some way beneficial or advantageous – not just good period.  It is undeniable that Aristotle has a theory of prudential good – of what human well-being is. In his opening line, he starts to set his sights on this goal. We aim at what is good. And then that opening move is made more specific: what is good for someone.  It is the human good that Aristotle takes to be ultimate object of practical reason – not, as Plato thought, good period. For each species of living thing, there is a standard of living well that is appropriate to its natural powers. These ultimate goals are not entirely disparate – even the goals of plants and animals have some affinity to the good of divine life – but there is no single property that makes all good things and all good lives good.

Professor Kraut literally wrote the book on Plato and Aristotle. He's a brilliant mind, but also his prose is shockingly approachable. His book, Against Absolute Goodness is really quite good, but not absolutely good - you are allowed to groan at my joke. 

Anyway - join us for a discussion not just of Aristotle, Plato, and other thinkers, but of what constitutes virtue and the well-lived life. The login info is at passionprojectlsc.com. NU folks welcome.",1600834747,1,0

Is there any way to avoid taking the final 3 classes of the language requirement?,"I'm in Weinberg and there's a requirement to take 6 language classes (through 102-3) or test out. 

I don't know any foreign languages so I started one here. I got through the first 3 classes, but I honestly don't know if I *can* get through the next 3, and I definitely don't want to. 

I find the classes extremely disorienting and I hate the fluency-based approach where teachers refuse to talk to you in English. It leads to me repeating things back to them but having no idea what it means. It's also extremely stressful. The workload is high to the point that (combined with the frequent classes) I have to drop my actual minor (which was relevant to my career) to keep up with the language sequence. It's bad for my career, it's bad for my GPA, and it's very bad for my mental health. 

My advisor suggested I could transfer into SESP, but I am already a senior so I can't do that without significantly extending my graduation timeline (which I definitely can't do) and also dropping my thesis (which would make me cry). 

I thought about trying to self-study/use a tutor and test out, but that seems probably even harder than the class, I was advised students are almost never approved to test out, and also it would require a huge time commitment outside of class which I just don't have time for along with school and work.

Am I missing something? Is there some other way to graduate without taking another 3 language classes?",1600703834,1,0

CMV: Monitored Tests are Abusive,"Giving NU access to your personal devices so that they can listen to and watch everything that goes on in your personal living space is an invasion of privacy. To take such radical measures with the sole objective of ensuring that your test *must* be closed-book rewards those who find a way to cheat (and punishes those who do not), and adds an extra level of stress to test-takers, and opens up opportunities for “he looked that way, she touched her mouse”-esque AI accusations. If a class cannot function with open-book, timed tests, the professor should seriously consider revamping the course to rely less on rote memorization. 

I understand the need to curb grade inflation and remove P/F for rigor-related reasons even during a pandemic, but I think that professors should be more innovative with their evaluations before resorting to such extreme lengths.",1600665901,1,0

1. How is the workload in the quarter system with so much testing? I'm looking at MMSS/Applied math/Econ/CS/IE majors- will probably take 2 of these (and maybe a music production minor). I'll be coming in with IB credits for Econ, Math, Physics already. What is the average number of hours I can expect to spend in classes each week? average hours self-studying each week? Average hours daily? ....just looking to have a more concrete idea about this :)
2. How competitive is recruiting for consulting at NU? I've heard it gets really cutthroat since everyone flocks to that field (low-key like IB at Wharton). How are placement opportunities and competition for them in Boston and NY offices? The post-undergraduate survey data indicates a much larger no. of grads staying in Chicago, so I was wondering if recruiting (OCR or otherwise) for other cities was as good. How would Brown compare to NU in these regards?
3. How is the IB/finance placement for NY offices? Would Brown be a better school for this? (Again, I know NU is supposedly a more consulting-focussed school, but the post-undergrad survey data indicates more students going into finance, huh?)
4. How is placement in FAANG+M and other tech recruitment for McCormick students? I have heard \*really\* mixed views about this :/... it seems Brown CS is great with placements despite their low CS program ranking...but pls tell me about pros at NU I am not aware of!

Any current international students who received aid?," Hey guys, I'm a high school graduate who will be applying Early Decision to Northwestern this application season. As I'm aware that Northwestern is need-aware for international students, I was looking to hear from current international students on what it took to get accepted with aid and how much they asked for. My parents are able to afford the education with savings, but even then it does take a toll on their finances so I was hoping to apply seeking financial aid. I would say out of approximately $80000 a year for NU, my parents can pay $40000. 

This is the second time I'll be applying as last year I applied RD and got waitlisted. Since then, I decided to take a gap year due to the pandemic and have accomplished more than I could ever anticipate. I did not ask for aid during the previous admission cycle, but my parents' business has been hit due to covid and so we aren't as well-off as we once were. Do you believe the admissions office would suspect me asking for aid this time around as a result?",1601955948,1,0

Spring club recruitment,"Hello Im a noob freshie

Today I found out that I got rejected from one of the clubs I applied to; it was a pretty popular and big (and business, surprising) club so I didn't expect much, but I'd be lying if I said I felt completely ok about not even making it to the interview step

For me, fall quarter being virtual meant that I was gonna only apply to the clubs that I reaaaaalllllyyyyy wanted to do because I didn't see the point of going through the interview processes like 15 times when I wasn't even gonna end up sticking to the club after all. (felt like going virtual would really drop my level of enthusiasm about clubs)

And now I'm scared that I won't get into any clubs.

Q's:

If I apply to the same club for spring quarter, do the chances of getting a little bit further into the app process increase or are they basically the same? (here's me hoping that trying out again for the club would come off as showing more passion)

In spring, should I apply to a bunch of (I mean like 20) clubs even if I'm not super duper into them or just continue applying to only a handful of clubs that I'm really interested in but risk not getting into any?

Sorry if this comes off as a whiny post, three weeks into NU and it hurls great balls of depression",1601907500,1,0
What’s the Physics major like at Northwestern?,"Prospective applicant here, interested in physics and mathematics at Northwestern. I also looked at the MENU program and it seemed really interesting. My main considerations are:
1) what’s the quality of teaching like for undergraduate math(esp. MENU)/physics students? Are the profs more focussed on their research than teaching?
2) How easy is to participate in and understand what it’s like to do research? What kind of research can undergrads in these subjects participate in? Like math is pretty theoretical right so you probably can’t do real research...unless?
3) Will I burnout if I continue the MENU courses beyond first year, sort of like a math physics double major? 
4) I’m an international student so if I don’t get aid, I might not be able to pay the full tuition...so I was wondering what kinda stats that internationals who do get need-aware aid have? Is it super rare?
5) I’m into football (soccer) and wanna play it pretty seriously in college. Is the team spirit high or boring/dead? Also do students get free access to things like weightlifting gyms and football grounds?
6) Do you guys know any AS and A Level students? They don’t post typical grades of people who did British patterned curricula at HS so I don’t know what they expect.

I am an international student in my senior year and want to apply to Econ undergrad in the ED.

Northwestern or Cornell? - CS Major,"So I'm planning to apply ED for Computer Science / Mechanical Engineering and I've narrowed down my options to either Northwestern or Cornell.

So far, I've looked at a whole bunch of rankings (they're similar overall and for Mech Engg, but Cornell has a higher ranking for CS). I've considered location as well (- here Northwestern wins). Something I really liked about Northwestern was the ""Whole Brain program"", so if someone can shed light on that, and whether or not interdisciplinary research is a big thing at Northwestern, it would be great. With Cornell, however, I feel like I might fit in better, especially because I have heard that activism / social service based things take more importance. In general, I have a lot of questions. Are internship opportunities be more at Northwestern?  How much value does the ""Ivy League"" status add?

Has there actually been an instance where the absence or abolition of Greek life has had negative outcomes?,"I'm asking this question in good faith. I keep seeing comments and arguments from the pro-Greek side painting doomsday scenarios for NU if it were to abolish Greek life. However, I can only think of positive examples of peer institutions abolishing Greek life. Notably, Williams and Bowdoin come to mind; conventional wisdom is that abolishing Greek life has been a net positive for those institutions.

So, is there actual precedent for a college abolishing Greek life, and it going completely south? Its fortunes squandered, reputation damaged, social lives irredeemably ruined? Is Greek life *that much* of an incentive for prospective students? Genuinely curious, as someone who had zero interest in Greek life, didn't rush, and had a great time at NU!",1601569540,1,0

(Unpopular?) Opinion: Northwestern should rename itself.,"I know there are so many more important things going on in the world right now (and so many other things we should be worrying about even here at NU), but something I've been thinking about is how the actual name of our institution is potentially a weakness.

""Northwestern"" simply is not reflective of the stature of the university, and if anything, has been an inaccurate moniker since even before the university was founded (considering that its namesake, the Northwest Territory of the United States, was dissolved in 1803, a full 50 years before NU's incorporation). I've heard numerous people, both seriously and flippantly, say that ""Northwestern"" is an un-prestigious name for such a prestigious institution. I also remember reading somewhere that Morty and some other members of university leadership consider it to be woefully unrepresentative of the school's stature. I wish I could find the source for that, but I can't!

I'm aware that changing the name of an almost 170 year old institution is no simple task, and that there are a huge number of considerations that would go into a change. Although there would be short-term challenges with recouping the brand equity that NU has built over 170 years, I think the long-term benefits would be substantial. I also believe that if there's enough support from current students, alumni, and faculty, there's a real possibility that university administration would hear us out.

Furthermore, we are not without precedent. Princeton University changed its name a full 150 years after it was founded, from the College of New Jersey. Duke University also changed its name from Trinity University as recently as 1924.

So what are some alternatives?

**Evanston University:** This would probably be the most obvious and likely rename, since it's already a name that's widely familiar with both the university community at large, as well as within academia and to a small extent, the general public. Place names are also not uncommon at all among universities (think Berkeley, Princeton, Oxford, Amherst, they all started out as place names). Obviously there would be some... branding concerns since like every organization and club under the sun here at NU tries to use some sort of ""NU"" pun. Also, the namesake of Evanston, John Evans, is not without controversy.

**Pritzker University:** It's no secret that the Pritzker family (one of the wealthiest families in America) already has some deep ties with the school. Our law school is already named after them. The tradition of naming prominent universities after significant benefactors is already well-trod, as well. Perhaps the university would be open to talks with the Pritzker family to forge an even more substantive partnership?

**Northaven University:** I'm literally just making this up as I go. This name combines the present name of Northwestern with the name of one of the school's most respected presidents, Erastus Haven, who helped ensure that the university would be integrated and co-educational. Haven's name is still peppered throughout Evanston in the form of street signs, middle school names, et cetera.

Am I in love for the right reasons?,"Applying ED as I find NU awesome, but I have heard lotsa negatives too. So here is why I love NU. Let me know if my reasoning is flawed.

1. I'll fit in somewhere: POC, gay, international, lower-middle class (by NU standards), looking at applied math, IE, MMSS, CS, Environ Sci, Econ (1-2 of these as majors), music production minor, love to sing (wanna join .wav co &amp; an a capella grp), dance (not v good but wanna learn in a club- is that too hard given how hard they all are to get in?), outgoing n extroverted, not interested in greek life (why institutionalise social circles?- though have a limited understanding of it), sometimes a workaholic (time management on fleek sorta lol) but know how to have a blast, wanna try new things (eg. play a role in a musical). Ready to work hard, but want some fun too :) My idea of fun at college: watching a movie or going out w friends, performing gigs at Chicago, partying sometimes (no substances tho), mind-stimulating classes n discussions, cool projects w teams, taking a lil' me time, etc.
2. The academics (especially the programs mentioned above)
3. Collaborative student body (at least relatively?)
4. Career opportunities- no idea wot I wanna do but- maybe one of: PE/IB, Consulting, FAANG+, working at a start-up. Definitely: freelance singing (if primary job allows). Hopefully at: NYC or Boston. Also NU places well into top MBA programs (?)
5. Music resources at Bienen 
6. Professional opportunities since close to Chicago (?) 
7. Prestige (minor factor lol)

That's it. That's why I'm like NU. Anything wrong? Though I am aware no school is perfect (some less-known imperfections at NU? I've heard of having bad food, being way too preppy so far:/ )

Optional mini-query: I heard NU is a lot more consulting heavy than banking, but why does career data say almost the opposite? (it shows both neck-to-neck, sometimes showing a greater percentage going for financial services than consulting, in fact)

I hope both of them will agree to this, I know they are 2 very busy young virgin men.

I've been reading comments on this sub, and seen the published letters by various Jewish organizations and individuals.

I've gotten a bit confused about the line between anti-semitism and anti-zionism. I believe that Israel 100% has the right to exist. It's no different than the splitting I've seen and read about in Europe based on ethnic groups wanting their own nation.
 I also think Palestine has the right to exist. I'm just not entirely sure the both of them have the right to exactly all the land they want.
 I'm not explaining this well but somewhere in between Israel's right to exist and the land issue is where I think/thought anti-semitism and anti-zionism switch over.

 Could some Jewish ppl give their perspectives on what they believe about this?

• We oppose anti-Semitic harassment. This includes swarming a religious Jew’s house at 1am and chanting “Free Palestine” for no other reason besides the fact that he’s Jewish. 

• We oppose anti-Semitic vandalism and calls for violence, such as the “more dead pigs” thing, and the subsequent refusal to apologize to the Jewish community for this offense. 

• We question the Northwestern Department of African-American studies’ decision to omit “Jews” from their quite extensive list of marginalized groups. 

• We reaffirm commitment to fair policing, anti-racism, and opposition to homophobia, islamophobia, xenophobia, and other issues that affect non-Jewish communities.

• We *demand* that NUCNC apologize genuinely for their antisemitism, promise not to physically harm an individual  *no matter what*, and agree to support them in their anti-racist mission if they comply.

I have been a data analyst for a few years   now, worked at two different companies, and have excelled so far. I   enjoy the field and want to further my career. I  applied to various   Master Degree Programs in Data Science in order to expand my skill set   and improve my resume. In part due to the fact that most job postings   require a Master's or better for any positions above the level I am   currently at.

I have been accepted   into a few programs already and am still waiting to hear back from   others. One of the programs I was accepted to is Northwestern University's MS in Data Science. I tried to find   out more about the program but haven't had much luck in terms of solid rankings or reviews. As of right now my top choices are between NU and Syracuse University's program.

I am debating whether or not it would be worth it to apply to Northwestern’s Clinical Psych PhD program this year or if I should wait until I have more research and/or clinical experience. I only have about a year of research experience which ended in neither presentation nor publication because we were wrapping up whenever everyone went into lockdown. I am only now gaining relevant clinical experience. I am confident in my writing abilities as well as my GPA and GRE scores (though these aren’t being accepted this year). Should I wait and gain more experience before applying? I know what acceptance rates look like and I just want to be realistic. If I were to contact a research professor or faculty member and reach out with some questions about the program/current research, who would you recommend? Honestly any advice would be helpful! Thanks!!",1605033775,1,0

Math,"Has anyone noticed how our math department is kind of bs? For the major you don’t even need to take an entire sequence of analysis or algebra and we can slip by with pretty minimal and easy classes. Additionally, there is a pretty limited selection of electives aside from the regular pure math classes. There is only 1 financial math elective, no modeling or computational maths courses, no math heavy course on game theory (I know there’s an Econ one), no interesting course like cryptography or something, and really just a general lack of any special or unique courses. I feel like compared to other departments math is less robust and well built out. Also with all the talk about and dna there is a surprising lack of support for interdisciplinary studies in the department. Am I missing something or is this a common sentiment?

Why you should vote me for NU Virgin Club (NUVC),"Hello my Dear (Virgin) Citizens, 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to waste the time of you V- words with a very long write up. I just wanted to send my condolences to my opponent and fellow V-word brother u/jacksonfire123. I believe that when I win he will have a huge spot in the club. There's no doubt he's a man of great virginity. 

Jackson talks about his policy debate team or whatever, which I'm glad he was a part of, but I don't believe that even COMPARES to what I spent my high school years doing, Robotics. If you have seen ANYONE that did Robotics in highschool, you know exactly what I am talking about. It's the least sexless activity in the entire world and I don't believe my opponent can argue against that. Not only did I do Robotics, I wasn't the ""cool builder dude"" no I was the guy in the back of the team writing code. There was 1 girl in my team, she left the next year. Other teams weren't much better.

 I just have a quick question to my buddy u/jacksonfire123 where's the receipt of the clock? How do we know the virginity funds were spent on it, release your tax returns. How are we gonna trust this man to handle the Virginity Club funds for our annual (sex-free) pizza party?

&amp;#x200B;

I went to an all boys high school in my freshmen year but then I had to switch over to a coed one, it didn't even matter for me though as I was still talking to 0 girls a day (well I was talking to them they just never snapped back). 

Jack talks about NEVER being friendzoned, how can this man understand our hurting, I have more friendzones than I have friends on Facebook. I am a man of the people, I've been through it all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading that part now I'd love to talk about some of my policies:

**Free condoms in Norris will be removed immediately and the funds will be given to (Virgin) students in a virtual form of your choice such as : VBucks, Riot Points, Bitcoin (for the Virgin Econ bros)**

**All gyms in the school will be shutdown, the looks gap is higher than ever with the good looking people being better looking than ever and Us being who we are.**

**Sex week will immediately be banned and instead replaced with virginity week, where ALL students (chad/chadette and virgins alike) cannot be involved in any form of sexual intercourse, people who break this will immediately be expelled (we will use our club funds and donations from rich Alum (past CS majors) to lobby the school about this issue)**

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I am not just a virgin I AM THE VIRGIN that will take action and Make Virginity Great Again.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to end this speech with a quick quote from one of my favorite virgins:

I endorse u/jacksonfire123 for PREZ,"I endorse this man for two reasons:

1. He knows nothing about the female crotch. This is a plus. Truck Hot has proclaimed himself as a “virgin” but I ask all of you, look at his post history. He has met up with girls before I just know it, the liar.

2. His presidency will bring massive opportunities to poor virgins of NU, like continuing being virgin. He will ban all co-sex parties, now we will segregate by gender so no procreation can occur. This is the president we need. 

3. He isn’t afraid to back away from girls. He will back away HARD, that’s why he (and I for that matter) is virgin. This is excellent news, because u/Truck_Hot is not a virgin unfortunately, this should be a disqualification. 

4. Northwestern was founded upon no sex, no fun, no anything. With the times of COVID this is more important than ever before.

Why You Should Vote for Me as President of Northwestern Virgin Club (NUVC),"Greetings to my fellow virgins and, as Pett Butts says, greetings as well to my ""future former \[non-virgins\].""

I apologize for releasing this statement so late after having promised to release it this evening, but like any self-respecting virgin, I spent my Halloween Saturday night finishing up an assignment that was due at midnight.

As Morty has probably said on numerous occasions, ""these are unprecedented times or something like that."" It can feel so overwhelming trying to figure out who to trust or believe, and putting your faith in either candidate can feel like nothing more than a subjective crapshoot.

Well, here's what you need to know: I am the only candidate in this race whose virginity levels have been verified and rated by an outside, objective authority. I quite literally am an ***award winning*** rejectee.

Long story short, during winter quarter, I asked out a girl for the first time ever, she told me she was busy that weekend but said we'd go out next weekend and gave me her number. Uh yeah we did not ever go out and she barely ever responded to my texts trying to coordinate. Not only that, but this girl and I were in a class together and at the start of the quarter we used to walk together everyday after class (we had class together 4 days a week), but from then on, she would always say she wanted to go to Norris or had some errand to do as an excuse to get away from me. After about a week of that, I just tried to stay out of her way, so I would just walk straight past her after class let out. Not only that, but later in the quarter we were assigned to be partners on multiple different projects.

*But,* then spring quarter came around, and toward the end of it I was nominated for the MENA department award for outstanding second-year Hebrew student. We were required to submit an essay as part of our submission to be considered for the award, and [I actually wrote about getting rejected and how I associated it with a song we had learned about in Hebrew class during winter quarter.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C2fYD34YNXPuaM2OUHcZ414bQffOH4A5zvRtpMk1YzU/edit?usp=sharing) (This is the most compelling re-telling of that harrowing tale also excuse my tiny ass Medill first-yr paragraphs.)

I ***won*** the award thanks to my essay about getting rejecting. Not only that, but the award came with a $50 prize, and you know what I used the money on?

[Purchased using virginity funding](https://preview.redd.it/of6o7wvjnkw51.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8121046f9c5990f01a783f396be60045ad6f60dd)

***Motherfucking a clock themed around the video game Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3.***

But you have to understand that this whole episode is merely the latest entry in my saga of lacking romanticism. There is only one girl who (I can say with certainty) has ever had a crush on me. It was back when I was just starting out high school, and I only found out because the girl who was crushing on me (who was still a middle schooler at the time) had confessed it to my older sister who happened to be her day camp counselor. Plus, both of us were Jewish, rendering the odds of a non-Jewish person ever finding me attractive as miniscule.

I don't even find that many people to be attractive. All my friends ever do is speak in awe about how I'm not attracted to big breasted white, blonde girls like they are. There was even a time when I was questioning if I'm asexual, and like I'm not asexual, but still.

Speaking of friends, all of my friends are virgins save one, and he's extremely muscular and substantially more attractive than me or any of my male friends so it's no wonder he isn't a virgin. Plus, he's not even an NU student, so it doesn't harm my virginity in the context of NU and thus doesn't hinder my ability to administer NUVC. One of my acquaintances is literally a music producer who goes by DJ Celibacy.

[\(Proof\)](https://preview.redd.it/ji8rvd5nnkw51.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93f3b673bd7b90e0eb5059fec858c6e0abe68acb)

I also have probably close to a dozen female friends and friend-acquaintances, and I have never even come close to being romantically involved with any of them. Nor have I ever wanted to be - it's not even that I got friendzoned, I *wanted* to just be friends.

And see that's the thing - I just really am not even interested in sex. In high school, I participated in policy debate team, yet I managed to go all four years without having *or even witnessing sexual congress*. And if you know policy debate, you know that's like trying to get through college without ever changing up your hair like it's technically possible but it just begs the question of why you're even there in the first place. I mean for fuck's sake one of the most popular debate tournaments of the year is ***literally held in a hotel*** like wtf were you hoping for?

Now, as far as tech and media preferences go, I've already made my stance pretty clear in the AMA. However, there are two notes I'll add. First of all, I would just like to mention that my music taste consists almost entirely of electronic artists on Bandcamp. Secondly, while many virgins are interested in video games and whatnot, I have received explicit scorn for my hobby from mainstream society.

During Wildcat Hellcome when we were playing Where the Wind Blows, I said ""I prefer video games over TV any day."" Instead of anybody who shared that trait running up and trying to steal my spot in the middle of the circle, my whole PA group stood still around me and just gave me the weirdest, most awful look of all time and I had to come up with another trait about myself to say.

Similarly, while both my opponent and I are CS majors, my major grants me in particular much more virginity when you take into account the context of how I arrived at that major. I didn't start out a CS major, I started out in a non-virgin major: journalism. It was only after I ate shit trying to fit in to non-virgin society that I had to retreat back to the safe haven of our people.

Last but not least, just look at their name: truck\_**HOT.** They're clearly an attractive person. Yes, my username has ""fire"" in it, but despite being literally warm, ""fire"" is taken to mean like excellent or spicy or intelligent or unique, not attractive.

Look, at the end of the day, you won't find another candidate whose virginity is officially backed by an academic department of Northwestern, and I'm pretty sure a bunch of academics have a pretty decent idea of what makes a good virgin.",1604211787,1,0

I am looking into applying for transfer from another midwest school. I am currently planning on applying to McCormick but I am not entirely sure yet what I want to major in.

I know it is pretty easy for those who started their freshman year at NU, but how seamless or otherwise would the process be for an external transfer?",1609246939,1,0

1. On the NU Common App, there isn’t a “Why Transfer” essay, but a personal statement requirement with the freshman prompts. Would it be wise to submit a “Why Transfer” for the personal statement?

2. Are transfers offered interviews (if available)?

3. I’m currently scheduled to take three classes known as the most difficult in their respective departments this spring. I also want to spend a significant amount of time on my transfer application. How important is rigor in transfer admissions/would it have a meaningful negative effect if I pushed one or two of them back and took an easier class in those areas this semester?

I already know I am 100%  not the asshole but just wanted to ask other people.

Later I emailed the professor and asked him if he can bump me upto an A- and he basically said 'I already bumped you up by giving you an opportunity to fix ur grade' and stopped responding to my emails.  So ever since then I found his address and I've been camping in front of his house waking them up late at night and screaming and stuff.

He opened the door and called me the 'most selfish and childish person he's ever met', but I just wanted  him to understand that my grade matters more than his sleep.

Idk what to do anymore to bring some sense into him, maybe ill kidnap their dog or something

prospective physics major with questions,"Hi. I'm planning on applying to northwestern and I had a few questions. 

1) Are there any unique classes offered in (advanced) physics, astrophysics or math?

From the classes I browsed on the website, most of them seemed pretty standard, but then again, northwestern is known for its ""fun"" and unique classes

2) Could anyone hook me up with the syllabus of a course in physics or astro?

Graduate Student Question,"Hi everyone. I am a current masters student at Purdue.

I would love to hear about Grad student experiences, especially if you’re in this program as well as undergrad experiences about just moving to Chicago in general and what the school is like! My SO will be working in Chicago near Greektown and the Art Institute of Chicago so living somewhere in between there and Evanston will be a must.

Prospective Student with Questions!,"Hey all, 

I have couple of questions as I was writing my application to Northwestern. 

1. School Choice: My academic interests as of now are CS, Economics, and perhaps German. I'm applying as a CS major, so I've assumed that Weinberg would be a better choice to pursue these humanities/soc-sci ish disciplines instead of McCornick. Have I assumed right?
2. Undergrad research: I have done things related ML/AI during my high school career, and I would definitely like to do undergrad research in regards of Computer Vision/NLP/TinyML/etc. Are there ample opportuities for undergrad research? Is there a lab that specializes on my fields of interests, or least AI in general?

CS - Confused about which courses count for each category?,"Since my adviser is, once again, not replying to my email after several weeks... I'll ask here for the time being before following up.

I'm a junior studying CS in McCormick and I'm just trying to plan out my courses ahead of time. The thing that's confusing me is that the listed courses for the breadth and project categories differ between the degree audit on MAS, the [academic catalog](https://catalogs.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/engineering-applied-science/computer-science/computer-science-degree/), and the [curriculum form](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/documents/students/undergraduate/computer-science-curriculum-form-20171.pdf).

e.g. CS 321 is listed as a software dev breadth course on the catalog but not on MAS or the form (there's a dropdown on the form PDF listing the choices). CS 377 isn't listed as a project course on the form but is listed as such on MAS and the catalog.

Idk which source to rely on when determining which classes to take to satisfy each requirement. Though, I'm assuming the form is outdated because the URL includes ""2017"" but then do I use MAS or the catalog?

Also - the form would be where we list our AP CS credit to count for CS 101, right?

Did I hurt my chances?,"I have made the definitive choice to transfer to SoC; however, I'm finding that to transfer to the major  I'm interested in is a lot harder than most people made it out to be.  Today, one of the SoC advisors informed me there is a waitlist for my desired major, and that it's unlikely that I would come off the waitlist any time soon. They let me know that I could minor in my desired major; however, I know I can not stay in my current major. It would eat me alive. I wrote back about my position and why I can't see myself in the current major that I'm in; my response was on the passionate side. I asked would there be any way for me to increase my chances of getting off of the waitlist. I basically asked a bunch of questions about what my options are in the response email. My parents are just telling me to stick it out with my current schedule, but  I just feel like that is time wasted if I stick with something that I have no interest in.

My experience at Northwestern has made me hate the wealthy and here's why,"I would like to start out by saying that I am very aggressively middle class (and by that I mean middle class, not Northwestern middle class). I am by no means the poorest of the poor, but knowing how frustrated I have become with this institution, I can not even imagine how it would feel to be one of those students here.

So let's get something out of the way to start. Holy shit Northwestern is wealthy. This probably comes as a surprise to no one, but it needs to be reiterated again and again because I feel like we accept this so nonchalantly. It is incredibly weird the amount of wealth you are surrounded by when you are here. The amount of ignorance at a ""world class institution"" is astounding because half of the student body is so disconnected from reality due to that wealth, and as much as many of them would like to believe that they aren't because maybe they spent a couple of hours in high school getting volunteer hours at the local homeless shelter (to put on their application to get in no less), they know nothing about the other side of America.

Beyond the students, it exists within the core foundation of the University. Just look at our president, Morty. It's clear from everything that's happened this year with Abolish NUPD that he is so disconnected from reality. He wants to pretend that he cares about the students, but as soon as the students call for real change that will help us, but it disadvantages him, he will go hide in his ivory tower and complain about how we the students hurt his feelings. BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO FIX A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS US!

We're finally moving to get rid of greek life (thank god) but let's not forget how classist this aspect of campus is. Frats and srats control so much of the social scene and it's all based on...you guessed it. Money. If you can afford to be in the chapter with the high dues, you throw the better parties, more people wanna go to them, and boom, you have power. So why do some students still defend it? Because they want to defend their power. And if we were on campus, Abolish NU Greek Life would not have as much traction. Why is that? Because when you are on campus, why bite the hand that feeds? If they control the social scene, why would you want to ever speak up against them at risk of losing access to that aspect of social culture. Because you can't afford to be one of the people in these frats or srats, why risk losing access to these parties when you already are so tenuously connected.

This quarter has been my worst quarter ever. My mental health has gone to shit, but I can't see CAPS cause of their waitlist and I can't afford to see a therapist because my parents have lost both their jobs. My grades have declined significantly, but I can't take time off. Why is that? Because of financial aid. I'm not guaranteed to have the same aid every year, it changes. So if I take a year off and my parents get their jobs back, boom, I pay significantly more. It frustrated me to no end the amount of resources that the wealthy students at this school have access to and how they can so nonchalantly choose to take a year off when I do not have that option. And I'm suffering for it. And I know everyone keeps telling me ""employers will understand, it was a difficult time, you don't have to be so hard on yourself for your grades,"" but they're gonna put me against other people who didn't suffer so much because of this pandemic and when they look at those two different numbers, why would they ever pick the person who wasn't able to handle school during an emergency over the one who could?

And admissions...oh my god admissions. You know what it feels like to be a scholarship kid at NU? It doesn't feel like I'm someone who overcame a challenge and now I'm reaping the benefits. I know so many people that are incredibly more intelligent and hard working than me that will never get an opportunity like this because of the family they were born into. It feels like I was someone chosen to be fed bread crumbs to keep the middle and lower class at bay. ""Look how these students overcame their social class and got in, that can be you!"" I know the odds I faced getting in. At first I was excited, even proud of myself, but how can I feel accomplished when I see so many students who got in purely because of wealth, because this path was determined for them by their parents when they were born, and meanwhile thousands upon thousands of students a year will be rejected because even though they have worked their asses off, they didn't go to some wealthy private school or they don't have the extracurriculars because they had to work to support their family, or take care of their family at home, or don't have the transportation to get back and forth from sports or club events. And that number of students doesn't even compare to the number of students who never even consider college an option because leaving their families means risking their lives. Meanwhile all these rich kids have had their paths chosen from an early age when they couldn't even think for themselves. And they wanna act like this is what they deserve? Spoiler alert. You don't deserve it. In fact, I don't think anyone really deserves it. This is an institution designed to keep social class in order.

Feel free to disagree and comment about how you're one of those good rich people who want to use your education to help the needy. We all know in the end you're gonna take that consulting job because you're afraid of making 5 figures instead of 6.

Feel free to disagree and say I'm a pessimist. But deep down you know all this is true. This institution is messed up and there's nothing you can say to convince me otherwise.",1607966859,1,0
Northwestern x UChicago fanfic (NSFW),"Northwestern laughed as the basketball went into the hoop again, right over UChicago’s head. “Were you even trying?” sneered Northwestern at the nerdy boy whose normally pale face was flushed red with exhaustion. UChicago could beat Northwestern in any mental challenge, but he couldn’t keep up with her when it came to sports.

Northwestern smirked. “No wonder people think you’re an unknown state school.” UChicago began protesting about “life of the mind” and “tied with Stanford” but before he could finish his defense, Northwestern put her hand over his mouth and pressed him against the wall. “Shhh... enough.” UChicago’s eyes widened. 

“You know, some people say you kill fun - today, we’re gonna have so much fun that you won’t ever forget it. Maybe you’ll even take your mind off those stupid Milton Friedman books for a few minutes.”

“E-excuse me? Northwestern...?” UChicago watched as Northwestern pulled her straight black hair into a ponytail, and he felt a warm feeling in between his legs that he never had before. As his heart began to beat faster, Northwestern pinned his shoulders against the wall and pressed her lips to his in a passionate kiss. Her hands began to lower, first drifting down his chest, then pulling his hips towards her in a tight embrace. Then, she tore his maroon blazer and yellow sweater off. To her surprise, he was incredibly toned. She smirked again as she saw a bulge in his slacks, secretly impressed.

“You may beat me for Nobel Prizes, UChicago, but I’ll be coming out on top in the bedroom tonight. Let’s take this back inside.” UChicago didn’t often follow others, but he obeyed Northwestern as she dragged him inside, still shirtless. He wanted Northwestern, and he wanted to please her. He always had appreciated validation, but this time it was different.

UChicago glanced around Northwestern’s bedroom. It was too modern, too garishly purple for his tastes. He didn’t have the opportunity to look around long, however, before Northwestern threw him onto the bed and tied his wrists to the wall and his ankles to the foot of the bed. 

“W- Northwestern? What the hell?” UChicago breathed heavily. 

His face stung as her palm struck it.",1607965180,1,0

Having to apply to take courses is ridiculous,"At least 1/2 of the EECS classes I've tried to sign up for or looked into this quarter require you to take a survey or small quiz to make sure you're ""right"" for the course before the prof will send you a permission number. This has been happening more and more in my time here and it feels very gatekeepy, plus profs get to arbitrarily decide who is in their classes or not, and registration (such as seniors getting to register first so they can graduate) is completely overwritten by waiting on the professors who decide to get in.

While I understand that just having prereqs can't always verify that you have the prereq knowledge for a course exactly, that's what add/drop is for, so the student can see if they're in over their head or not. We are literally paying to take classes at this school and we have to apply for every course we want to take and hope the professor likes what we write in the ""what do you hope to gain from this class"" response to be allowed to take their course?

Why don't NU girls like my vegetable garden?

I introduced myself to a girl in Norbucks the other day. I saw her sitting alone and I walked up to her. It felt like love at first sight.

I said my name and we started talking about our majors and that typical stuff. 
but I couldn't think of how to keep the conversation going at one point. I pulled out my phone and asked if she wanted to see my vegetable garden from my hometown. She nodded and I started going through pics.
I started it a few years ago and was really proud of my basil and tomatoes especially.
I think she was really interested and I thought she really liked me 
and she was pretty too so i asked her ""Do you want to date?"" and she said ""ummm no im sorry."" I felt
really awkward so I just apologized and said bye.

The NUPD Budget report just came out.,"https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2020/11/university-police-report-budget for those who want to see for themselves.

Overview of University Police budget

UP is expected to account for 0.42% of the University’s $2.5 billion expense budget in fiscal year (FY) 2021. 

UP spending correlates to campus safety needs, for example when significant security incidents call for additional vigilance or in tandem with the opening of new buildings. 

Since FY 2011, UP expenditures have grown annually on average by 2.6% compared to 4.2% by Northwestern overall. However, since FY 2018, there has been a 7.6% decrease in UP spending as part of University-wide cost containment priorities. 

In FY 2020, expenses were $11.2 million, about 90% of which was for compensation and external contract staffing. Current fiscal year expenses are projected to be down by 5.2% to $10.6 million. 

The report further details 11 years of actual and projected expenditures by staffing category and type of spending, including costs specifically for police officers.

I have to admit I'm surprised that NUPD accounts for only 0.42% of the universities budget.  And I'm also very curious what they mean by ""external contract staffing"" accounting for part of that 90% of expenses.",1605589598,26,0

I'm a prospective undergrad student interested in Economics as a Major.

I wanted to ask how the internship opportunities are at NU, I know you guys have career fairs and even clubs for networking, and Chicago is very close by too, with a bunch of firms and corporations having headquarters or locations there.  Are internships very competitive? I'm assuming they would be, after all, I heard a large population of students major in econ every year. UChicago being right around the corner competing for the same internships would no doubt make them harder to obtain too. In terms of internships, I'm asking about the big Firms like Goldman Sachs or Morningstar, but if y'all have insights on the smaller or medium sized firms around I would appreciate that too as well.

Also, I'm looking to apply to the Kellogg Cert (FE probably, maybe MA) program in my Sophomore year. Will my freshie year be like hell, as some people would suggest? Apparently some of the course requirements are kinda cap, like notoriously difficult or something (I keep hearing about a certain econ course Econ 311 or something, econometrics?), and each quarter will be filled up with like 5 classes.

Stress as an econ major?,"Hello, I am a prospective student (applied ED, no guarantees lol) and am currently a senior in high school. I want to go into business, so I plan on majoring in econ. When I was doing research on colleges, I know that Northwestern stood out to me. I got to visit the campus and I loved it. I know I didn't just apply ED on the fly. However, with ED decisions coming out in two-three weeks, I think I am getting normal cold feet. 

So, I wanted to ask about the difficulty and stress levels of an econ major? I know it obviously wouldn't be easy, but I keep reading that for some people it's completely miserable, so I wanted to hear from current NU econ majors. 

For some context, (I will be vague for anonymity's sake), I was actually able to take an introductory econ course at Northwestern with undergraduates last summer over zoom bc of COVID. I won't specify my grade, but I will say that it was good (the course was on a curve) and I didn't find the course very difficult at all. It definitely took some effort, but it wasn't miserable at all. However, I was only taking one course at that time. Given that information, can anyone give a little feedback about how they think Econ at NU is? I think I am just getting nervous given how close decisions are. I'm not looking for an easy college experience, but I don't want it to be miserable.",1606642590,1,0

1. Are they asking for us to just literally answer the four things in 4 paragraphs or does it need to flow like any other SOP? Currently I have one that is narrative style but I don't know if I should make it sound more technical.
2. I don't see anything that mentions I should write about the labs I am interested in. Should I include the professors I would like to work with there?

prospective transfer student!,"Hi! I'm currently a freshman at a northeastern state school in an honors program, but I was starting to feel that the classes just aren't as rigorous as I was expecting. Not to put down my school or anything like that, I'm not sure if things are just easier because of the whole online classes situation, but I don't really feel like I'm learning. 

I started looking into transferring and I found NU through my newly declared plan to be a Materials Science and Engineering major and it really just seems like a wonderful community and a vigorous academic experience. I'm also planning to pursue a secondary major in biology on a pre med track. I haven't applied to NU in the past and I'm on track to have a high GPA, although I don't have the number yet. In high school, my ACT was a 35 and my weighted GPA was about a 4.3. 

I'm a little scared to apply to be quite honest, I had a lot of rejections last year and that was a big blow to my self confidence. I'm also terrified that if by some miracle I do get in, I would instantly drown in the course load. 

I feel like I might not giving my school a fair chance given I haven't lived on campus or taken any in-person classes. Since I haven't really been able to engage with professors with all of my asynchronous classes, I don't know that I'll be able to secure a decent letter of recommendation.

 I was wondering if anyone has any advice as far as transferring goes or if you've had any experiences that you think would be applicable to my situation!

here's a fun list of my doubts:

1. credits: I have 30+ AP credits and I'm planning to take 37 credits this year and I'm sure a lot of them wouldn't transfer
2. cost: I currently have a merit scholarship and in-state tuition so costs are almost negligible in comparison to how much any other options might cost
3. preexisting plans: I have a plan for which courses I'd take to pursue a dual degree in 4 years
4. ""lower"" expectations: a 93 and above is an A at my school and being in the honors program provides some ""special"" treatment

Has anyone transferred in with a lower gpa? Computer Science from Georgia Tech looking to transfer into Northwestern as political science or biology major,"Hey guys, for the past few months I have been contemplating transferring to Northwestern due to a wide variety of reasons. When I first came to Georgia Tech, I was not sure with exactly I wanted to do with my life. As a result, I originally came there to study Computer Science due to the relatively high financial stability it offered.  However, after taking courses here for about two years, I have discovered I have a great interest in humanities and biology. 

As a result, I felt that transferring Northwestern would provide me more opportunities to explore these areas due to the great emphasis the school places on multi-disciplinary education and the greater availability of resources on campus in these respective areas. Northwestern has been a dream school of mine since high school and I feel like by attending Northwestern I would get more opportunities to explore humanities and biology when compared to a traditional engineering school. Additionally Northwestern would be cheaper for me than Georgia Tech so it makes a more appealing choice to transfer.

However, I guess my biggest concern is my current cumulative Gpa. I currently think I will end this semester with a 3.7+ overall gpa which is not bad but I'm very worried that my gpa will be lackluster due to the fact I ended first semester of Freshman year with a 2.7 gpa. Ever since then I took 21 credit hours and gotten a 4.0 my second semester and likely a 4.0 again this semester. As a result, I was wondering how big of a factor will my first semester gpa factor into admissions?

tl;dr  
I want to transfer to Northwestern because it has been a big dream school of mine and offers more opportunities to explore humanities when compared to a traditional engineering school such as Georgia Tech. I currently think I will have a 3.7 gpa by the time i apply but very worried about how my gpa will look due to the fact that I got a 2.7 my first semester of college.",1605478665,11,0

Classes introducing R or SPSS,"Hi does anyone know a class (quarter offered doesn’t matter) introducing R or SPSS to beginners? I’ve taken PSYCH 201. I don’t have quite enough math credits to take the traditional STAT sequences. And I would just take the math I need to get into the stat courses, but I have limited flexibility in my schedule for the remainder of my time at NU and ideally would like to learn it by Winter 2022 for a project I’m doing. 

Should I just learn it myself? I’m all good with that, but just figured it might be easier on me if I learned it in a class setting. Thanks for any ideas or feedback.",1605460177,6,0

How Stressed Are You?,"I’m applying RD to Northwestern and for the past year it’s been my absolute dream school: rigorous academics, good athletics, close to the city, i love the size, etc. However, with how crazy stressed i’ve been with my senior year (i’m in 4 APs this semester, including AP chem which is an absolute nightmare), i’m beginning to question whether i’d enjoy my time at northwestern, or if i’d just be stressed 24/7. I’m a straight-A student, so i will definitely put in 100% of my work to getting good grades, but i also don’t want it to get to the point where i miss out on having fun and enjoying my time at college bc im so overwhelmed with school. 


That being said, to all current and past students: do/did you find yourself very overwhelmed most of the time, especially with the quarter system? or does it feel similar in stress to a rigorous high school year? (of course coursework will be more difficult in college so it’s not entirely comparable, but just for a frame of reference). 


also, i want to go into oncology, so i’ll need to go to med school.  part of the reason i love northwestern is bc they have amazing research programs and are connected to the Northwestern hospitals, but i don’t know if it’s worth it to go through all the stress just for my bachelors.",1605330033,1,0

Facebook vs reddit,"My god, Facebook is such trash with the memes about morty. I know it’s probably just a vocal minority who are pro NUCNC, but it’s hard not to get discouraged with the ultra liberal state of Northwestern. Reddit is so much more balanced. I’m guessing it’s because Reddit is where all the logical and sane STEM majors are while those who actually comment/post on Facebook are theater, journalism, and gender studies majors who constantly battle each other for who can be the most woke. If I were morty I would just cut the gender studies, African American studies, Latino studies, sociology, and journalism departments all together (see the work of peter boghossian, james Lindsay, and Helen pluckrose for reference). They’re all anti science and anti progress. All the NUCNCers should have to sit down and listen to Jonathan haidt for 10 hours before they can procede with their existence. Sorry for the rant I’m just pretty fed up with how crazy liberal NU has gotten.",1603309603,1,0
