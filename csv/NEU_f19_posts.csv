Worried &amp; Stressed - Was I a Jerk to my roommate??,"I want to know if I messed up or if I am an asshole. I’m a freshman and this all happened two nights ago.


Thursday night my roommate had some people over to drink in our dorm room. I’m not much of a drinker, and I didn’t want to get in any trouble, so I left our room and went to the common room to FaceTime my girlfriend from home. Around an hour later I hear my roommate and his friends leave, so I go back into the room. He left a mess, beer bottles and half drank liquor bottles scattered around (including on my desk). I took the stuff he left on my desk and put them on top of his bed.


Around 1:15AM he comes back into the room, turns on the lights, and I wake up. I can tell he is realllllly drunk. He tries to have a conversation with me and he is slurring his words. He must have noticed I put the stuff atop his bed because he grabbed his pillow and a blanket and feel asleep on the floor. 


I was really worried, and after texting a few friends from home I decided that I was going to get the RA to tell them that my roommate was super drunk. I didn’t want him to die or anything. The RA comes to the room and asks me what I know. I explain everything I’ve explained above. The RA says the right thing to do is call NUPD. I ask if this would be covered by medical amnesty and she said “it should, but I don’t know.” 


NUPD shows up and wakes him up. The ask him a bunch of questions and he doesn’t really answer any of them. Just says he wants to go to sleep. NUPD sees all the liquor bottles around the room and took photos. They also look at his wallet and see that he has a fake ID inside (I did not know he had this). Ultimately NUPD ends the whole convo with my roommate signing a medical waiver. He goes to sleep. I can barely sleep because I’m so shaken up. 


The next morning my roommate wakes up and says “bro did you fucking call the cops on me?” I said I didn’t (which is technically true because it was the RA who called). He seems upset, moves the stuff I put on his bed, and falls back asleep as I go to my class.


When I get back to my dorm around 4:00 my roommate asks why I made such a big deal, says he was completely fine, and he seems really angry. I didn’t know what to say, and I casually mentioned he shouldn’t be in trouble because of medical amnesty. He didn’t like this answer.


What I think happened yesterday during the day is he got called to the NUPD HQ and maybe had a chat with the RA? I only think this because I kinda overheard him talking to one of his friends in the bathroom.


I’m worried my roommate is going to hate me for the entire year. My intention wasn’t to get him in a bunch of trouble. Sure I was mad about the trash and being woke up, but I hope he doesn’t get sent to OSCCR.


Sorry for the long post. I’m stressed. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice?",1567876064,0,0

Lost in the admission procedure,"Hi everyone,
I'm an international student applying for the align MS in CS. 

According to the fall 2020 timeline, I was supposed to get a decision on December 20. But on the application portal I'm seeing that my application is under final review. So there is no decision letter yet.

It doesn't bother me to wait a little longer, I was still having hope till today when I received an email from Northeastern Admissions (College of Engineering).

The mail stated that according to university records, I was denied entry to the Khoury College of Computer Sciences... 
After what, they said that my profile was reviewed by the College of Engineering and that I may have a background appropriate (accounting major, self-taught basics cs concepts, that's me talking 😅) for COE programs. 

They are inviting me to apply to COE as an alternative... They also gave me instructions on how to submit a simplified application to the Graduate School of Engineering within the COE.

So that's it, now I don't really know what to do. I was hoping you guys could shed some light on all this for me cause I'm lost. Is it common for such thing to happen? What should I do? Any advice on how to proceed? 

tl;dr: application under final review on ApplyYoursel portal (align MSCS), although decision date was on December 20. Received by email an invitation to apply to COE programs as I was denied entry to Khoury CCS

"Has anyone taken Group Theory (MATH 3175), and I guess kind of deeper how do people like math at NEU","So I’m a 2nd year CS and Math Major, I have genuinely enjoyed the classes I have taken thus far, but now I’m starting to take some upper level courses for Math (ie Group Theory). I only know the slightest bit about the subject, in that it’s about abstract algebra (I think), and there are some big words associated with it like “homeomorphisms”. 

My first question is if anyone has taken group theory, how is it? Is it interesting to you, and if so why?

I know it is important to become familiarized with the sort of pure math lingo that the pros use, but when I look at classes like Group theory and number theory, I basically have a Marie Kondo-esque reflection and genuinely ask myself, “Does math spark joy?” Most of the maths classes I have taken so far have been more applied maths, so I am going off the knowledge I have accrued thusfar that I like applied maths. I don’t know if I have that same warm and fuzzy feeling about Pure Math. I don’t want to throw that half of the major away just because of two classes, because I’ve spent time and money taking some of these math classes that would not count towards a minor (2000s level classes). I want to use those two math classes as electives to take more probability classes and even something like Dynamical Systems. 

Is it wild to believe that NEU should like divide the mathematics major into an applied math/stats major and a pure maths major? How have people generally liked Math at NEU? 

I’m probably definitely overreacting for a single class. I don’t know if I will come to enjoy Group theory but heading in I definitely feel a little “queasy” heading in, if that word even makes sense (Applied English perhaps isn’t my strong suit lol).",1577032817,1,0

When did our campus become a full on construction site,"Tonight I tried walking from my dorm to the library. Once I got past the men on ladders attaching something to my dorm, out past the Speare scaffolding, I had to cross the road to get past the whole damn building near Speare that they seem to be jackhammering away at every morning at 8am. I then went to cross the green line tracks to find the MBTA had decided to r*straight up remove* that crossing last night so I had to walk to Marino to cross. I walked back down to krentzman and was heading past dunks as I realized the entire damn path in front of Hayden had been closed last night while a crane was in so I had to go back up and around ell. Eventually I finally made it to the fourth floor of Snell to start studying. Approximately 8 minutes later a crew of 12 workmen come storming in, whip out their drills and start taking apart some more of the library. I think I spend most of my life listening to backup alarms, jackhammers and Diesel engines since I've moved here.",1572434626,21,0

Duo more like DuoNO,"Is anyone else really frustrated by the 2FA implementation Northeastern has chosen? Usually apps/websites that require 2FA let you use any Authenticator of your choice - LastPass authenticator, Google authenticator, etc. However, Northeastern has decided that it knows best, and that the only app that we should be allowed to use is DUO.

For me, this is a pretty frustrating problem, as I am a paying customer of LastPass, and one of the main reasons I pay is so that in case my phone gets lost or stolen, I can recover all of the authenticators stored in the LastPass authenticator app. I have it linked to my LastPass account, and I have a yubikey linked to it as well. 

I'm just struggling to understand why northeastern is insisting we have to use Duo, and trying to figure out the best way for me to tie into the existing ecosystem of password and identity management that I have configured. Has anyone figured out a way to use a different authenticator app for MFA? 

I really don't want to have \*multiple\* authenticator apps installed on my phone, and I don't want to have to worry about how I regain access to DUO if my phone gets lost, damaged, or stolen.",1572378809,11,0

Why I'm Not Releasing for LightView,"I was going to make this a longer post, but I don't have enough time for that. Instead, I'm going to quickly go over the most important points.

* The replacement fee for a room key is $75 (as much as a week and a half of food), and they'll charge you $25 to let you into your room if you somehow get locked out after dark. Considering that I am paying \~$1600 per month to live here, this is ridiculous.
* There is effectively no soundproofing between apartments and between rooms.
   * Also, don't walk around barefoot, otherwise your feet will probably pull the plastic flooring up.
* You have to pay for laundry and printing, which is explicitly something that Lightview explicitly said that they would not do, but here we are. In fact, the laundry there is a fifty cents more expensive per load than in NEU student housing.
* If you're someone who is concerned about security, the security at Lightview is effectively ""do you look like a college student?"" The keys work using an RFID, the same way that Husky Cards work, so they'll make a ""beep"" sound at Lightview's scanners, even though they won't work. Many people have made it a game to get into the building without using your key at all, by waiting for someone to let you through the door, beeping your husky card at the proctor scanner (which is, strangely enough, on the other side of the desk from the proctor and therefore out of view), and waiting for someone else with a valid key to activate the elevator then pressing your floor. Then, the doors don't lock automatically like they do in student housing. Basically, if you have a stalker, and your roommate didn't lock the door, that stalker could get into your apartment in about sixty seconds without ever having to show ID. I sure know I could.

American Campus Communities, the company that made and manages Lightview, spent 50% on their budget on marketing and appearance and the other 50% on actually making things work. Right now, they're freaking out and are pushing us residents to renew our leases, offering huge prizes for our participation in surveys that ask why we aren't. Here is the most concise reason why I'm not: I'm not paying money for good marketing; I'm paying it so that I don't have to think about things that might distract me from schoolwork. Lightview has succeeded at this in two areas: they let you leave for co-op, and rent covers utilities. These are not small things, and I'm happy they exist, but given the cost, I expect more.",1571325978,114,0

The APPEAR Lab at Northeastern University (https://web.northeastern.edu/appear/) is asking Northeastern undergraduate woman (ages 18-25) to track their eating and exercise for 8 weeks using the MyFitnessPal smartphone app and respond to a series of online and smartphone surveys. Our goals are to better understand how and why young women use fitness tracking apps like this one and the effects of tracking over time.

It is important to know how individuals react to fitness tracking so that we can gain a better understanding of who might find fitness tracking helpful vs. who might find it less useful or unhelpful. By participating in this study, you will help us gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of fitness tracking related to health and mood. You will also help us understand whether certain people are more likely to have positive or negative outcomes when they track their eating and exercise. This is an important area of research because most of these technologies are currently backed by very little data.

To participate in the fitness tracking study, please email Professor Rachel Rodgers at appear.neu@gmail.com with subject line ""Fitness Tracking"". If you have question about this program, feel free to contact Vicky Zhao at zhao.bini@husky.neu.edu.",1576513183,1,0

cs vs data science major?,"Just got accepted into NEU a couple days ago!

And if not, which would be the better choice?

I'm very interested in the cs major with AI concentration, but data science is a growing field nowadays, and I can't shake the feeling that I'd be missing something if I didn't major in ds instead. I know I could always just get my degree in cs with ds classes as electives, but I'm worried how my job prospects would look if my degree was cs instead of data science.  (ie, in a competitive scene, would someone with a data science degree have an edge over me if I had a cs degree?)

My fears are compounded because I want to do written journalism, and that specific concentration seems to be declining in opportunity as newer forms of media become more popular.

PSA: Re-leasing through Lightview is a scam,"My roommates and I have been dealing with the headache that is the Lightview management over the course of the last two months, trying to transfer our leases to other Northeastern students since several of us will be in the area during the next co-op cycle (and we can't afford the rent). 

After going to management at least six or seven times, each time asking the status of our lease transfers, we were met with the typical response of ""oh, you'll get an email later today"". We started the process in the first week of October and just this last week on our eighth visit, the management finally decided to process our applications and transfer our leases. We thought we were done; turns out, this wasn't the case.

Two things have to happen to transfer your lease: you have to pay a $250 transfer fee (which you can conveniently pull from your security deposit) and you must pay all rent in full until the individual you are transferring to moves in. So, despite the fact that we are moving out tomorrow, we still must pay through December into January until the 3rd/4th/5th when the new leasers take over. 

This part is standard; paying the remainder of the month. What isn't standard is Lightview's scam. Lightview considers installment payments and rent as two separate things, so you must continue to pay installments despite not living in the facility. Your **rent is not considered on a monthly amount**, despite what they want you to believe.

Here's the clause that states this specifically:
&gt; Rates/installments and amenities subject to change. Rates/installments do not represent a monthly rental amount (&amp; are not prorated), but rather the total base rent due for the lease term divided by the number of installments.

And this is where the issue kicks in. The installments are paid a month before the ""rented month"", so September's ""rent"" is due August 1st, and so on. This means January's installment amount is paid December 1st, and February's installment paid on January 1st.

What Lightview's management told us was that the prorating does not occur until after the new leasees move in and the February installment is paid, meaning that the January installment (paid on December 1st) is simply theirs and you will not get it paid back. **You are paying for your leasees entire month of January, and the first X days of their February lease.**

We have reached out to Northeastern's off-campus team to resolve this issue and to bring clarity but the Lightview management has basically told us to pound sand in the interim. If you are transferring your lease as well, I advise you to speak with management about this issue.

TL;DR Lightview is making you pay six installments for living under their roof for four months.",1576280820,1,0

Lots of people wonder how hard it is to get into different majors/programs at NU. The data linked above breaks down admission rates by college, and they're super uneven.

For applications for the fall 2019 freshman class in each college, the rates were:

1. College of Social Science and Humanities: **11.3%**
2. College of Arts, Media and Design:  **12.6%**
3. Bouvé College of Health Sciences: **13.1%**
4. College of Science: **16.9%**
5. D'Amore McKim School of Business: **19.5%**
6. Khoury College of Computer Science: **25.4%**
7. College of Engineering: **28.3%**

For some perspective, Engineering and Social Science received roughly the same number of applications (\~9600 each), but more than twice as many people were accepted to Engineering.  

Why this matters: it's relatively easy to switch majors after you get accepted to NU (compared to other universities), so if you're on the fence about majors in two different colleges, consider applying with the one in the less selective college.",1576172005,1,0

Are there any tips to help me secure a decent room (a single and a kitchen is all I ask for) for on-campus housing? Is this a crazy request at this point - should I start looking off-campus? I don't want to cancel my on-campus housing...it just all seems so risky.

I feel like everyone has their housing set since they stayed in Boston for co-op so it's making me anxious. Any help is appreciated.",1569376978,2,0

I know this is probably hilarious to whoever stole it, but it makes our entire school look awful. The team at Spotify has given the school radio silence on all follow up emails from advisors and the like, and it's probable that we just got blacklisted for possible hiring.

New Laptop for COE,"Hi. I'm a new student at neu doing civil engineering. Currently, I'm using my 5-year old 13"" macbook pro, but it's really run its course tbh and I need a new laptop. Except, ITS exclusively recommends a Dell XPS 13/15"" for the College of Engineering when literally every other college/major suggests a MBP as a potential option.

Since I love my mac and really don't want to switch to windows, I was just going to get a 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM 13"" MBP (for price &amp; portability) and dual boot it with Windows for the programs that require it. However, the 13"" version doesn't have a discrete graphics card which I understand is an issue (especially with resource heavy 3-D modeling programs).

The [new 13"" MBPs](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/448) also only have 8th gen intel processors, while the [new 13"" XPS](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/183095) has 10th gen which is an ok boost over the MBP (but I wasn't maxing out anyway bc that's expensive af) – links are to geekbench results. Plus neither laptop has a discrete graphics card unless you go 15"" which isn't really in my favor either.

I already ordered that macbook pro but can easily just bring it back to the store and return it. It's worth noting too that a 15"" mbp at least would definitely not fit in my kånken and I don't want to get a new backpack too. Is there also a possibility I could just stick with this laptop (that I know I'll like) for most things and as needed I could go to some computer lab and use something more powerful?

I'm not too sure what else I can do here as I would prefer not to do a global co-op, but there also (surprisingly) aren't any public health co-ops in the States, if they'd even satisfy the requirement and aren't considered to focus too heavily on social work.

Concerned and Distressed- AITA?,"A week or so ago my roommate was gonna go to the career fair. I’m a first year, and I didn’t want to go on coop, so I left our room and went to the common room to watch anime. Around an hour later I hear my roommate and his friends leave, so I go back into the room. He left a mess, shitty Spotify swag scattered all across the room.

Around 1:15AM he comes back into the room, turns on the lights, and I wake up. I can tell he is acting strange about something. He tries to have a conversation with me and he just keeps busting out laughing. He must not have noticed I put his shitty swag  in the trash.

But then I see it.

The reason he's been acting so strangely.

*He's holding a brand new iPad*

I was really worried, and after texting a few friends from home I decided that I was going to get the RA to tell them that my roommate was a war criminal. Honestly, he deserves the death penalty imo. The RA comes to the room and asks me what I know. I explain everything I’ve explained above. The RA says the right thing to do is call Aoun. I ask if this would be covered by medical amnesty and she said “lmfao yeah sure whatever get fucking lost”

Aoun and his elite death-squad show up and wake us both up by kicking in our door. They put bags over our heads and took us to an undisclosed location (it looked like the basement of Richards, but I can't be sure).

Aoun asked us both a bunch of questions and he doesn’t really answer any of them. He just says he wants to go play Angry Birds. Aoun saw all the Spotify pens and stickers around the room and took photos. They also look at his wallet and see that he has a fake HuskyCard inside (I did not know he had this). Ultimately Aoun ends the whole convo with my roommate signing a waiver thing, condemning his soul to eternal damnation for his crimes, and taking him away in handcuffs. The only thing I'm told by Aoun's goons is: ""He'll be on trial at the Hague.""

That night, I can barely sleep because I’m so shaken up.

I’m worried my roommate is going to hate me for the entire year. My intention wasn’t to get him in a bunch of trouble. Sure I was mad about the trash and being woke up, but I hope he doesn’t get sent to the Hague.

Sorry for the long post. I’m stressed. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice?",1569681771,200,0
Roommate and pledge bros hate me a lot,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/NEU/comments/d0ympp/worried_stressed_was_i_a_jerk_to_my_roommate/

So around three weeks ago I called my RA after my roommate returned from his night out super drunk (or what I believed to be super drunk). He ultimately got in trouble with OSCCR, and told me it was a big fine, deferred suspension, and a letter to his parents. He was not very happy with me. I really appreciate all the comments and thoughts on my first post, and took them all into account. I did ask my roommate if he wanted to schedule time with the RA to discuss the incident and better lay out a roommate contract of sorts. His exact words when I asked this were “Fuck no I’m not meeting with that Narc.” So we didn’t meet. 

I did meet personally 1 on 1 with my RA, and they reiterated that I had done nothing wrong. They asked if I wanted to go through the room switch process, but after talking to my parents and my girlfriend from home I decided that I would not. I feel my roommate kind of needs me. Or so I thought.

He recently joined a fraternity and he and his “pledge bro’s” have been absolutely awful to me. I get emotional even writing this. His pledge bro’s will be in our room and refer to me as “RA-boy” and say annoying stuff like “what’s up Mr.Tattle.” They always seem to be drunk or high and are just nasty to me. I absolutely HATE IT.

So Thursday afternoon my roommate and his pledge bro’s were in my room and were talking about their fraternity. They were worried about that night because they were going to be hazed and made to drink (at least that is what I gathered). This made me genuinely concerned for them. They leave our room around 8:00pm to get dinner and then go to Mission Hill (which is where their frat house is).

I mull this over for a while and am just sick. I don’t like that they’re a-holes to me, but I also don’t like that they’re being hazed. At orientation I sat through a presentation on hazing prevention, and it kind of resonated with me.

I end up knocking at my RA’s door around 9:30pm and tell them that I believe my roommate and his pledge bro’s are being hazed and forced to drink. I have to give the RA credit, they asked follow up questions and let me know I may have just saved a life. Hazing is illegal per Massachusetts law. The RA writes down the information, and says they will try their best to keep my anonymity. I go back to my room and fall asleep. Nothing else happens.

My roommate returns the next morning and I ask “how was your night” he responds “fucking stupid” and falls asleep. I go to class and am back in my room in the afternoon. Yet again my roommate and his pledge bros come in to hang out but then leave kind of suddenly around 6:00pm. I get a text from him around forty five minutes later that says “hey you didn’t tell anyone about my pledging, right?” 

I think he and his pledge bro’s left to go to a meeting and I’m really worried that at the meeting they said someone alerted the RA about possible hazing. If they find out it’s me I’m legitimately worried they are going to kick my ass, tell everyone I told the RA, and be even ruder?

I didn’t respond to the text and it seems he slept at a girl’s place last night.

The interviewer usually just stops me and tells me the thing I was supposed to say, which is often way off the mark from where I was going. It's kind of frustrating because it ruins an otherwise good interview, and obviously it makes sense to ask these questions since they want someone who is good at answering them, but it just confuses me why they're expecting me to have a thorough knowledge of the business when they can clearly tell from my resume that this is my first real job.",1574382015,1,0

Help a frustrated freshman? Really thinking of transferring,"Since coming here in August my mental health has really tanked (and the underfunded UHCS hasn't really helped as much as I wanted either) and I'm trying to turn things around next semester before I really reconsider my choice to come here. And really, the reason I haven't dropped out yet is because of the people I've been meeting here, otherwise I would've just left.

I guess one thing that's been frustrating me is the lack of clubs that I feel comfortable in? I really want to be involved with business/start-up projects and sports (maybe outside of clubs, tried out and didn't make the cut) and I'm looking for smaller organizations to be in to meet people with similar interests easier. I've realized most clubs don't really have ice breakers and if you aren't an eboard member you don't really have a role in the club, leading me to quitting lots of what I've joined.

It really feels like this school just markets its co-op and just lets everything kind of just sit? The academics are also frustrating and I'm questioning if it is really worth waiting another year to maybe go on co-op. 

I thought how finding an organization on campus could help me feel more fit in so I'm here for any advice for a business major really into sports? Or any other people go through this feeling and what they did to cope with it.

It is with utter sadness and the deepest regret that I must tell you that even my great tolerance has its limits.

Please. PLEASE. #PLEASE.

The NEW NU NEU Pledge

I, (insert name) pledge under my will, to resist the Nut during No Nut November, and to withhold my pleasures until the month of December.

This sacred pledge shall not be infringed upon, unless you are willing to give up your rank in society. 

A “Nut” as it is labeled in this document, is defined as the Release of Sperm from a Male in a Sexual Act, or the Release of Squirting fluid/Ejaculate fluid from a Female in a Sexual Act. This applies only to the Sex Organ of a human, as a Transgender Person may also Participate in NNN.

This pledge applies to everyone willing to volunteer, regardless of sex, gender orientation, or kink.

Involuntary nutting, such as a Wet Dream or being forced to fail, is exempt from the chastisements of the 5 Levels Rule. 

Periods do not count as Sexual Activity or a ""Nut"".

The 5 Levels Rule goes as follows:
There are 5 levels of different offenses that can occur during NNN, the correct abbreviation for No Nut November. These offenses will have different consequences, depending on the severity of the offense.

These are the new Levels:

Level 1 Offenses:
Naturally occurring Sexual activity (Unprovoked Boners)
This will be met with mild brush to the back of the Neck, followed by the remark, “You fool. You monumental Bruh”.

Level 2 offenses:
Casual masturbation but with no sex appeal
Lust and partially get hard/wet at someone else
Distribution of Anti-NNN propaganda, in the form of tweets and memes. Other types of propaganda not listed will be judged later on by the Court of Nut Regulators
These actions will be reprimanded with a Day of Digital Blockade, where they are not to be contacted at using technology. This also means that people cannot view nor dislike or like a Failure’s Digital content, as well as all previous punishments listed. 

Level 3 offenses: 
Intent to nut by masturbation, but fail to do so due to a sudden change of heart, attempting to loophole the Rules, or due to health issues
Intentionally try to get someone ELSE to fail NNN
Enjoyment of unprovoked Sexual activity
Purposely try to affect someone’s decision on whether or not to join the movement. 
These actions will be punished by a Day of Shunning, where the Failure is not to be talked to for the rest of the  Day, and will suffer an uncomfortable Lunch period, as well as all previous punishments listed.

Level 4 offenses:
Masturbation to the point of climax, but no actual release of fluids
Exerting unwanted sexual attention to someone else (aka Sexual Harassment)
Apart from any legal issues, this is a Great dishonor and will be punished with a swift kick to the genitals if the Failure is Male, or a swift punch to the Right Arm if the Failure is Female, as well as all previous punishments listed.

Level 5 offenses:
Masturbation and successfully nutting
Forcefully make someone else fail NNN (aka Rape)
Refusing to admit you disregard the Rules and the Pledge. 
This is the ultimate dishonor, and will be punished with the bearing of the Title of “Failure of Holding in the Nut”, as well as all previous punishments listed.

If I, (insert name) succeed in this Trial of self-control and patience, I will be congratulated by the NNN Movement community, in addition to the New ability to bust the Phat One on the 1st Day of December, and to joyously enjoy the Christmas era. The Phat One is a Gift that many do not receive, but it is a gift of High enjoyment, and will only come once in a Year if you do not fail.

One may not be able to join the NNN Movement if they have Nutted in that November of that year previous to the Signing, or if they subscribe past the 5th of November. If you fail, you may not be able to rejoin the movement, and the Title will be on your Record for all eternity. 

Are you willing to do all of this, and to stand with your fellow man and woman to resist the Nut during November? If not, there’s nothing wrong, but if you do, and will do it, read the full Pledge, Speak the Oath in the 1st Paragraph, and sign here. Your Trial begins as of this moment.

Totally mortified. Possibility of getting sent to OSCCR?,"Today has been a wild ride for me. It started out with an innocuous attempt at getting homework done to possibly soiling my disciplinary record. 

&amp;nbsp;
I had an AutoCAD assignment for my cornerstone class due at the end of the day. Because my laptop wasn't powerful enough to run AutoCAD natively, I had to use the COE remote desktop. It took a while, but I get the drawings done and I submit them. I reward myself with a small break, but I forget to log off of vlab. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was only gone for 15 minutes but I completely blanked out. All I remembered was that I completed all my homework and the rest of the day was free. So I come back to my laptop, and the vlab is still up and running, with a chrome tab open. Because I forgot about the vlab, I still think I'm using my laptop privately. Needless to say, I visited several dirty websites and had them open for at least 20 minutes. 

&amp;nbsp;

While bouncing from site to site, the chrome tab closes out and there's a popup on the desktop. It read something like, ""Northeastern ITS Violation"". That's when I freaked out and realized that I had used school property to watch porn. For the next 3 hours, I spam-refreshed my email to see if I got any notifications from OSCCR. 

&amp;nbsp;

I know what I did is definitely against the school rules, but will I ever be called to OSCCR? If so, how soon? Has anybody ever been in this situation? I heard that you have to take a sexual assault course or something. I'm really worried, I'm only a first year and I don't want a bad disciplinary record already.",1571714310,2,0

Best ways/places to meet people who aren’t into drinking and partying?,"Hey guys,

I’m a freshman and still having a super hard time meeting people that I actually connect with. I’m not into drinking, partying, hookup culture, etc. but I’m also not at all “nerdy” (certainly not implying that it’s a bad thing to be nerdy), so I’m kind of in a weird social position. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how or where I could meet other similar people? I have been going to club meetings and have met some nice people who I talk to but nobody I really connect with. I tend to relate more with people older than me but that can be difficult because older people often aren’t interested in people much younger than them (even though I’d consider myself quite different from most people my age). 

For some background, I’m an 18 year old girl and am super into health and wellness (the gym is my passion, really into nutrition, etc.). 

Any help is appreciated. Thank you!",1571700814,16,0
