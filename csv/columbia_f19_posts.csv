Has anyone transferred to Columbia that could answer some questions?,"Hello, I applied to Columbia before and was waitlisted. I decided to go to a school that’s around the same caliber as Columbia but I really really really REALLY hate it and there are so many reasons for me transferring that I feel like would be understandable for the admissions counselors (I.e. the school Im at does not have a specific major and I’ve been trying to design my own major, finances and health reasons).

Freshman having terrible day. Any advice?,"So I quickly just went from finishing the semester with a 3.7 GPA or higher to probably finishing it with a 2.8-3.0 because of one short paper. Obviously it's my fault, but all I did was forget to cite a source I took 2-3 sentences from for plot summary of something. I genuinely thought I had included the citation, but it turns out I didn't. Now I'm being punished for plagiarism and for sure gonna get a D in the class even if I ace the final. Pretty sucky :) Being that it's my first semester, it's just so embarrassing if I have to tell my friends that or if I have to apply for anything with my GPA now. I know it's not the complete end of the world, but I feel like I have no future at all now. Especially regarding internships and sought-after entry jobs because I plan on pursuing CS.

I know this is something that comes up occasionally in this sub but I’ve really been struggling to meet people who I can mingle well with. It seems that everyone already has their friend group except me and so I’m worried I’ll never be able to get into a friend group. I’ve always been a pretty social person but have felt so isolated since coming here. First semester is over already and though I have many acquaintances, I have no one I feel close enough to just sit and chill and talk to without feeling like a burden to them. It’s very very depressing and something I’m really not used to.  From what I’ve been seeing, this is definitely not the case for other students. They all seem to have lots of friends and enjoy going out together and having fun.

Having Second Thoughts About Committing to GS.... Am I Wrong?,"As the title says, I've had second thoughts on committing to GS since I received my acceptance. 

If the ""School of General Studies"" really is just an (awkward) administrative title, why does Columbia's website promote the fact that ""GS Students take the same classes and have the same professors as CC and SEAS students"". If that's the case, why even separate a body of students administratively, if they are taking the same classes and have the same professors?

I understand CC vs SEAS. Different core requirements. But the GS core is practically the same as the CC Core, save for 2 or 3 classes (I think?).

Then theres the whole issue with lack of proper financial aid, diploma typed in English (instead of Latin), etc. Little things here and there that make GS less ""desirable"" than CC.

On a more personal note, I'm transferring in with an Associate's Degree, with around 75 credits. I've received offers from other schools who accepted anywhere from 60-70 of those credits, but Columbia only accepted 31 according to the transfer credit report I received.

I learned about GS 2 years ago and I was ecstatic to have the opportunity to attend a school like Columbia. I worked super hard to maintain a really high GPA, taking 4 classes in the evening while working full time during the day etc. I was so happy when I got accepted. But reading forums, it seems a lot of people are dissatisfied with GS and feel like ""second class citizens"", and that combined with less than half of my credits being transferred makes me hesitant to accept Columbia's offer. It would probably take me 3 years to finish my Bachelor's now. 

**TL/DR: Got accepted to Columbia GS, hesitant to commit because of the ""General Studies"" stigma and less than half of my credits being transferred/accepted. Is it worth the ""Ivy League Education""? Can anyone in GS tell me what your experience has been so far, honestly?**",1575683528,1,0

Spanish Placement Test,"Hello, I have some questions about the Spanish placement test I was hoping some people could answer.

I transferred to Columbia after 2 years at another college, having took Elementary 1 &amp; 2 at my previous school. I did well and received A's in both. I recently took the online placement test. I felt fairly confident through the whole thing, having spent a few weeks refamiliarizing myself with the first two levels. There were only a few questions(out of around 40) that I felt unsure about.

My result placed me in Elementary Spanish 1, which was a pretty big shock. I understand that this means I missed a significant portion of the test, but I'm still fairly confused.

Slight Bashing Post: Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health,"Disclaimer: Bashing is just an overstatement, but I just want to know what other people liked/disliked about the Columbia Mailman SPH program, so I'll start. I recently graduated and have my degree in Epi. 

Pros: 

\-In NYC

\-#4 ranked PH program in the nation

\-Alumni network/career services/connections

\-Is a quality program (in my opinion), which gave me the skills that I needed for my job today

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\-Too friggin EXPENSIVE

\-Not as diverse as they make it out to be (at least in Epi and Biostats, there were virtually no Black people. I have nothing against people of other races/ethnicities, but being the only Black person in a lot of the classes for your department/certificate was isolating. People constantly talk about health disparities and issues that affect people of color, yet they talk about it from an abstract sense, have no friends of color, refuse to walk past 169th street in Washington Heights, act as if Africa and South Asia are the only places with people suffering from health issues, etc. It was very irritating.

\-Restrictions for certain certificates

\-More condescending/arrogant people compared to my state school (which I KINDA feel like I should've gone to)

\-We were charged all of this tuition, but received a ridiculously small summer stipend ($250), little to no scholarships, barely any free food at seminars lol, etc.

Rude lady in John Jay dining hall,"Do y'all know that one African American woman that swipes people into John Jay? She has short hair and glasses. Well I think she is excessively rude. I understand that she deals with hundreds (if not thousands) of people a day, but there's no need to make me feel like an idiot or a child everytime I entire the dining hall. If she was just DMV level rude I would be fine, but this is next level. Here are some examples:

- Very recently I asked about the meal options for restrictive diets and she quickly said ""I'm not telling you, it's none of your business. It doesn't apply to you"". Immediately she assumed my religion and dietary restrictions based on my appearance. The options very well could have applied to me as I have both Jewish and Muslim family members. 

- Another day she handed me back the wrong ID and actually tried to argue with me that it was mine. I don't know what was implied by her assumption of my appearance again, but I don't think I looked anything like the person on the wrong ID she handed me. Needless to say I was offended and embarrassed by the scene she caused.

- Just today she tried to tell me that I was returning my EcoReps box incorrectly, when just days prior SHE is the one who rudely told me to do it that way. 

There are so many more rude things she has said and done to me in that short window of time from swiping in to exiting. 

And I'm not normally a complainer or one to get offended, but this is just irritating. I'm definitely not spoiled either. She just makes me feel stupid and uncomfortable while I'm just trying to eat.

Everyone else in John Jay is so nice. Particular the woman that works behind the grain bowl station and the woman at the action station. They really make up for the swiping lady's bullshit.

TL; DR is there any way to file a complaint against rude workers like her. Really it's just her. And maybe a way to submit compliments for good staff members. Also, has anyone had a similar experience with her or someone else?",1568922422,60,0

Black Ivy League professor: ‘I would much rather my children interact with drugs than with police’," “I would much rather my own children interact with drugs than with the police.”

That statement comes from Columbia University Professor Carl Hart in a recent *Washington Post* [**op-ed**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/10/05/ivy-league-professor-i-would-much-rather-my-own-children-interact-with-drugs-than-with-the-police/) that he penned arguing “the killing of black people by the police has been on a regular schedule.”

Psychology Professor Hart writes that drug effects are “predictable,” but encounters with police “often” end with dead black people.

Dr. Hart, the first black professor tenured in the natural sciences at Columbia University, teaches a psychology course titled “Drugs and Behavior,” and is known for [**his research**](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/fac-bios/HartC/faculty.html) in narcotics and drug addiction – both from a scholarly angle as well as personal experience.

“I speak candidly about my past and who I am,” Hart writes in the op-ed. “In fact, ‘High Price,’ my science memoir, is one of the required readings for \[my\] course. In it, I detail my imperfections and past drug use and sales. I also lay out a blueprint for how one can succeed as a scientist and academic in a world that despises one’s people.”

Question on Grades for Applying to General Studies,"I am thinking of applying to GS in about a year and had a question on my course history/grades at my current community college.

Do you think those 3 grades may hurt my chances of being accepted?

When to take physics?,"Hey all,

I'm a first-year with class registration tomorrow and still have no idea what to do. Right now I'm following the pre-med track (not sure about major, maybe psych) but considering switching to either architecture or some sort of engineering. I have most of my classes laid out so far, but I'm not sure for my last class whether to take a psych, architecture, or physics class (physics now would allow me to switch to engineering more easily), or something else entirely.

My main question about physics is, for pre-med I would only need to do two semesters, but for engineering most majors require at least three. My advisor said I should wait to start physics in the fall so that I could go through the first (or only) two semesters right next to each other, but I'm not sure if I should.

[Serious] Why are people so happy when they get accepted to GS?,"Isn’t getting into GS easy? Apparently all you need is to have taken a break in education after high school and write out an amazing life essay for admissions. Not trying to bash on GS peeps. I’ve met a ton of cool and amazing people from GS who definitely deserve the Columbia degree, especially since we all pretty much go to the same university, take the same classes etc. I just find it funny since we all know GS isn’t really that selective and isn’t accounted for the actual acceptance rate and other things like dorms and funding.",1573603728,1,0
History of Philosophy I,"I'm considering majoring in philosophy, so I signed up for History of Philosophy I knowing that it's a requirement and thinking it would be interesting.

Even in section it feels like we move a million miles an hour covering new stuff.

Is everyone at Columbia just a pretentious asshole?,"This is a rant/cry for help

I went on a second date with a guy last night and it was okay, but we were smoking a blunt in the park after and he suggested that we go back to his room, and when I said no he goes quiet for a minute and says, “I had a 4.0 GPA last year.” He later called me basic for liking Harry Potter (yeah, it might be basic, but I like what I like). 

The whole experience made me kind of hate the entire Columbia population because it feels like everyone here is just obsessed with being better than everyone else. I know not everyone is like that, but it feels like most people are. I haven’t found any genuine people that I feel like I can really connect with. I feel like I can’t show my real humor or interests to anyone. This poor guy I went out with had to listen to me passionately talk about classic Tetris for far too long. Does anyone have suggestions for ways to meet people that are just normal human beings not suffering from imposter syndrome?

Intensive chem for pre-med,"Hey, quick-ish question about chem for a pre-med first year.

Honestly I'm fine with that on its own, but I also have Wei Min, who I've heard is the absolute worst, and honestly feel a little over my head in that class.

I could also take gen chem, which would definitely be a weight off my back, so my question is, do you think med-schools would care if I took intensive chem? Would that show more rigor or something, or would they not distinguish between that and gen chem?",1568170728,0,0

Can anyone help me with student loans?,"COA for the academic year is $67,468 and I was given $31,545 in scholarships and grants (including Federal Loans), which means I need to cover the remainder through other means. I have applied to a bunch of private student loan lenders but none of them would approve me unless I have a cosigner. I've applied to Sallie Mae, Citizens Bank, College Ave, Discover, Credible, and Ascent. Only Ascent approved however they only gave me $9,500 and that is obviously not enough. I'm still waiting for Discover and I hope I get the amount I need.

I thought I'd be able to get approved since I have good credit history (790) and I have my own income through my part-time job. I didn't want my parents to cosign since I don't want to burden them but it's not like they can cosign for me either way since they have very terrible credit history and they have their own money problems. I'm also worried about paying the bill that is due this September 13, which amounts to a hefty $13,000.

It's hard to schedule an appointment with the Office of Educational Financing, yet I was able to get one for tomorrow although it conflicts with the last 30 mins of my last class so I hope my professor can give me an excuse to leave early.

SEAS majors - Thoughts on Stress/Core?,"Hey all,

I'm a senior who thought that Columbia SEAS would be my first choice. I was planning on EDing as a CS/Applied Math major, but I've been reading this subreddit and the Spec lately and the whole ""stress culture"" at Columbia has left me with some doubts.

1. A reason why I'm thinking of applying to Columbia is because of the Core, since I've always wanted to become exposed to the works that have changed society and also widen my perspectives intellectually. However, further research makes it seem like the Core holds a lot of students back from taking other electives related to their area of interest. Since CS majors would also have to declare a track along with their major, the heavy courseload seems to make balancing life and school extremely difficult for engineering students. Is this true? How are engineering students able to balance clubs, double majoring/minoring, the Core, and just plain having fun all at once?
2. What is your honest review of the Core coming from a STEM background? Reading Plato, Adam Smith, Descartes, etc. seems like an incredibly enriching experience, but how much does the Core detract from your major? On paper, the Core sounds great to me, but are the classes really that intellectually stimulating and easy to balance with your major? How has the Core affected your mindset on the world as an engineer, and do you believe I could have an experience like that anywhere else? Is the Core really much more different than say, taking some philosophy/classics/econ electives at Stanford? 
3. Are grades inflated or deflated in the engineering school? I've heard mixed opinions on this, but it seems like grades overall still stress students out. In terms of employability, would the existence of grade deflation hurt?
4. Many articles/reviews have also pointed out the fact that Columbia's administration is terrible and their failure to encourage community and school spirit, throwing kids into loneliness and stress. Is it really that hard to find sociable groups around campus? I'm not that interested in partying/tailgating at football games like at a flagship state school, but I still want the chances to meet new people and belong part of a tightknit, small group of friends that I'm able to rely on throughout college. I understand that Columbia does attract an individualistic student body who don't mind veering off campus into NYC, which is fine since I do see myself as an independent person. But, still would rather explore the city with a small circle of friends rather than by myself. How much is Columbia's sense of individualism really ""freedom"" rather than isolation or loneliness? 
5. There are many negatives that I've pointed out about the school, but are these just troubles of college or are they actually exclusive to Columbia? Are the negative reviews on the Spec, Niche, Unigo, etc. a result of the activist/vocal minority at Columbia, or do these opinions actually reflect the Columbian experience?",1567355341,2,0

What to do with my Columbia degree? Anyone else having the same problem?,"I still cannot find any other jobs that pay more than 15 dollars an hour off indeed or usajobs.gov.   The only positions I barely qualify for are things like admin assistant, security guard, server, personal trainer, and paralegal at best. 

It's been two years and I still feel like I'm unemployed and essentially going nowhere with my life, especially my professional development. As a veteran, I'm fortunate in that I don't owe any money to the school, because I would be absolutely devastated at this point if I did. 

I didn't do any clubs or internships. I also didn't network while I was in. I have been job searching for three years now and still feel like I'm worth little more than a high school graduate. 

Any advice is appreciated.",1573302378,1,0

Feeling alone and without real friends,"I know this isn't a unique feeling, especially not at Columbia, but what I need is advice and perhaps some assurance from people who have been in a similar boat.

At the moment I have a group of people whom I call friends, but my relationship to them feels empty and one-sided. I feel like none of them care about me, or about whether I even exist. If I were to magically disappear none of them would  notice, and even if they did they wouldn't care. Any contact with them has to be initiated by me; I'm not liked enough by any of them to be the one who's messaged first. Sometimes, even when I am the one who speaks first, I'm just ignored and forgotten about. It's the kind of thing where, if I stop contacting any of them, the relationship would probably end because none of them would ever initiate contact. They don't treat each other this way, but it is the way I'm treated. They would never exclude each other from a group event, but my exclusion means nothing to them really. I love them, but they don't seem to love me back.

I haven't felt this way before. In the past I've been lucky to have had friends who valued me, but at this school I've struggled. And right now it feels like I'm at a stage where everyone has already formed their own cliques--like there's no hope of meeting different people who're willing to make room for someone like me.

The typical suggestion is to ""join clubs,"" but it often feels as though people you meet in clubs want the scope of their and your relationship to be limited to interactions within the organization. ""Club friends"" are your ""club friends."" Are there groups on campus where people aren't like this?

I'm sorry if I come off as needy or desperate, but all I want is the feeling of belonging. All I want are friends who value my presence, friends who actually care and who want to be around me. I don't know what to do. All I know is that I feel lost and alone. How do I change this?",1573103191,35,0

Columbia’s community,"Hey, I’m a junior in high school. At the moment, Columbia is my top choice for ED. I’m on a full academic scholarship at my school, and one of the constraints on it is that I’m technically not allowed to apply early decision anywhere (but I can petition the founders of the school to let me do so). 

I toured Columbia this past summer and really fell in love with it, and even though I’m considering two other ED options (Brown and UPenn), this will likely be the one I choose. Since I’m not 100% certain yet (and since it’s really important that I know I want to go to a school before I petition my school’s founders to let me ED), I’d love to hear commentary from Columbia students regarding anything such as:

1. What the general atmosphere is like
2. How the professors are (if they’re accessible, overload you with work, etc.)
3. How competitive it is in CC
4. If you think going to Columbia is worth the work you put in, money you pay, other schools you turned down, etc.
5. What the student community is like
6. How connected Columbia is to the city
7. Anything else you feel is relevant to know before applying

Financial Aid Prédicament,"I just got accepted to Columbia as an early decision applicant, but the financial aid package that I’ve received severely threatens my ability to attend. 

Context: My parents are divorced, and I live with my mother more than 50% of the time. In cooperation with Columbia’s financial aid procedure, my mother filled out the FAFSA and my father filled out the CSS Non-Custodial Parent Profile. My mother made it clear from the beginning that she isn’t able to pay anything for my college education. She completed the FAFSA in hopes that we would qualify for grants. 

Due to my father’s income, Columbia did not give us any sort of aid, meaning that my dad and I would have to pay the full $80,000 per year. The problem is that, despite his income on paper, my father isn’t by any means capable of paying that kind of money. He financially supports his unemployed wife, my brother who is also in college, his mother, my mother, and his extended family. My father may be the most affluent person in my family, but we do not have generational wealth. He has people to take care of and bills to pay, not to mention that he is old and thinking about retirement. 

My question to y’all is, is there any possibility of me qualifying for aid? I haven’t formally appealed my financial aid package, and to be completely transparent, I’m ignorant to the logistics of the process. Is my situation even legitimate in the eyes of Columbia? 

ANY ideas, suggestions, or explanations would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to ask clarification questions as well. Columbia is my dream school and somehow I got accepted. The possibility that my ideal college experience may be inaccessible due to an inaccurate assessment of my financial circumstances is troubling. I sincerely thank y’all for reading this terribly long post. At this point, my back is against the wall.",1577515745,1,0

I also understand that Barnard has a different atmosphere, etc. from Columbia and all that. However, because Columbia College is so similar to Barnard (with students from one taking classes at the other), what even is the point of applying to Columbia instead of Barnard? I get that they have different atmospheres or whatever, but is there any tangible advantage to going to Columbia instead of Barnard? Especially so if I have a statistically better chance of getting into Barnard. 

Also, please don’t tell me that Barnard and Columbia are one and the same. I get that Barnard is OF Columbia University, but I can apply to them separately on the Common App and that is how I’m referring to them.

Federal Work Study Advice!,"Hey fellow lions! (roar, lions, roar!!)

I was recently accepted to Columbia College in the class of 2024, and I'm so excited!

As a part of the financial aid package, I'll be doing Federal Work-Study. I don't know if I'm putting too much info out in the open, but I'm expected to make at least $3,090 dollars + min. Student Contribution of $2,400 to pay my Student Responsibility.

I have questions!

What type of jobs are available? 

Are there jobs that could cater to your major? (I listed Sociology, Comparative Lit &amp; Society, &amp; English as potential majors.) Or even interests (for me, that would be things like writing, history, and music)?

Are the off-campus jobs like the stores near off-campus or is it that you would be going off-campus to do these jobs? (hope that made sense...)

How many hours would you recommend working as a freshman (sophomore, junior, senior...)?

Are there jobs you would recommend more? Or jobs that you wouldn't recommend at all? Are there good beginner worker jobs?

How is the general community within these jobs? I'm an introvert, but I'm curious as to if the work environment is more solo or united... (I'm sure it probably depends.)

Did you have wiggle room in your finances for personal expenses, shopping, or going out?

Were you able to maintain a balance between work-school-social lives?

How do/did keep track of your finances overall?

Any reflections or tips in retrospect? I know that a lot of students do work-study or something along those lines, so I'd love to hear different perspectives!

Sorry if I sound kind of ignorant, just trying to learn as much as I can to make this experience affordable and smooth sailing! I'm coming from a background virtually no work experience other than tutoring on and off at my school during the school year. 

I'll also be working on scholarships &amp; getting a job in my town toward the summer to pay the minimum contribution of $2,400 before school starts, so maybe I'll have more experience by then.

Competitive Admission for 3-2 Program Columbia,"Hey guys, I'm currently at a partnered institution for Columbia's 3-2 program.  I'm planning on submitting on sending in an application this December when the applications open. GPA wise, I'm above the requirements for my year. My GPA also shows a growth curve each semester. However during my very first semester at my college, some conflicts with my physics (major course) caused me to get a B- in the course, dropping me out of the guaranteed admission for the program. After this happened, I simply have been trying to push through and try my best, but now that Columbia has gotten rid of guaranteed admission for 3-2 new comers, I'm getting quite restless. For anyone that knows or has experienced the 3-2 admission process, do you think I have a chance?",1572504001,2,0

Lab director made weird comment about my height,"Recently, my class and I went on a trip to one of the science labs at Columbia to see how they work. The lab director greeted and presented her work to us. At one point, she began talking about correlation vs. causation and that’s where she made a comment about my body that made me really uncomfortable. She said something like, “On average, men are taller than women, but [gesturing toward me] I bet some of these girls are taller than you. So the correlation isn’t true all the time.” For the record, they’re not, which somehow makes the comment even more insulting. Everyone in the room laughed, and I was so taken aback that I didn’t say anything.

I found the whole experience very disturbing, and I lost interest in the rest of the presentation. Should I tell someone at Columbia or my school?

(high school senior) Information on University Writing/Music Humanities,"Hello Columbia students (or grads)!

I'm currently writing my Early Applications for Columbia and I wanted to get some clarification from you guys before sending my essays in. I attended a Columbia Info Session and they provided a rundown of the Core Courses and what they're about. So for my Why Columbia? Essay, I'm essentially writing about the Core and the specific programs I'm interested in. However, I can't quite remember what the representative exactly said in the info session, as the rundown was pretty fast. For example, in Music Humanities, do you learn about the history of music composers? In University Writing, do you get to explore philosophical questions like ""What is reality?"" If not, what Core Courses do you do that? I already checked the website but only found short summaries of the course descriptions that didn't really answer my question. If I could get some facts and information from people who actually took these courses, it would mean a lot! Thanks :)",1572045149,2,0

I am studying astronomy and physics at a school that isn’t prestigious at all, but it does have pretty decent rankings for those programs. Columbia has been my dream school, and unfortunately I got rejected applying last year as an incoming freshman. I was wondering some things: 

a. What are people’s thoughts on the physics/astronomy program at columbia?
b. I know columbia has the core. I was wondering if I transferred in after two years, I could still graduate in the next two years? 
c. Would it be better to stay at my current school and graduate without loans, or to transfer to columbia and accrue some student debt?
d. If I got rejected applying as a first year last year, would I even have a chance at getting in as a transfer? 

Thank you!",1571978063,8,0

Hi I am a prospective student who is having trouble figuring out if I should apply to CC or SEAS.,"In short, I really love Columbia and it’s one of my top schools; however, I’m seriously debating on applying to CC or SEAS. I plan to major in biochemistry or biomedical engineering but I also want to apply to med school after graduation. I know that CC has more humanities core classes while SEAS is more “pick and choose” the English requirements with more emphasis on physics, CS, chem, etc. The thing I’m afraid about for SEAS is grade deflation bc I’ve heard the engineering school tend to have a lower GPA than CC. The only reason why I’m cautious about that is because med school weigh GPA pretty heavily (or so I’ve heard). Could I do engineering related/lab research at CC? Is it hard to do internal transfers? Does Fu really have a bad deflation? I’m not afraid of work, but I don’t want to relive my high school experience (aka sleeping at 3-4 am because of homework or some other meeting/projects).

"If you are considering buying Leetcode Premuim, now is the time (Because Student Discount is here!)","Hey guys, I have to say first that I am not any sales people from Leetcode, I am just a miserable SDE job seeker.  

If you are okay with the non-premium version, it's totally fine. However, if you have considered about premium but wasn't sure then, now is the best time.  Here is a short version of why and a longer one. 

In short, it's not only $99 for a year for students, and it used to be $159.

&amp;#x200B;

The longer one is:

I am poor and going to Columbia only makes me even poorer (and that's why I want to be an SDE). I have been waiting for this discount for months (I only do monthly subscription over these months, which cost me a lot again). And now, the deal is in front of me, but they need 50 ppl from the same .edu email to subscribe in order to activate the deal. We already have 37 ppl now, so just about a dozen to go. I don't want to miss it, that's why I am desperately posting here. Plus, I also don't want anyone (poor SDE job seeker) like me to miss this deal. 

Premium gives you access to all questions and frequency (for me that's the most important one, because it super helpful in this interview season to go through all frequent questions under a company's tag before tech interviewing with that company). 

Anyway, thanks for your time, and good luck everyone with job hunting.",1570151674,2,0

Hello! I am a psychology student from LIU-Brooklyn and I would like to ask you to be a participant in my research. This study is designed to help us better understand the personality characteristics of people who participate in Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG) and how this relates to their interpersonal behaviors in their daily lives.

You will fill out a series of questionnaires and will be asked to create and audio record narratives after observing several picture cards. This study will require about 50 minutes of your time. As the study focuses on MMORPG players, you are eligible to participate if you are an active player in one or more MMORPGs. You will also have to reside in the United States and speak English as your primary language due to the narrative component of this study.

Upon completion of the study, you will be offered a **$10 online Amazon gift card**. Additionally, you may find the study interesting!

You will also provide information that may help clinical psychologists understand the relationship between personality characteristics and face-to-face interpersonal behaviors in individuals who play MMORPGs.

Is it possible to manage all of this plus the core classes but still have time for internships/clubs/social life?

Potential Columbia GS student concerned,"Let me preface this all with the short version. I got two emails from Columbia GS, one saying to register for an online information session and the other telling me to make sure to apply before October 1st for an early action deadline. Basically the question is does this mean anything or am I just on a mailing list? Are they actually interested in getting me into their university?


Now with that out of the way, I am an older student who didn't jump into college right out of the gate. I'm 24 now and enrolled in a community college. Despite my laughably low highschool grades, my community college grades are near a perfect 4.0. As a result of that I was invited to the honor society Phi Theta Kappa. I was wondering if something like that put me on the radar for Columbia GS? 

After the trials and tribulations I grew up with, I can't imagine so, positive like that happening to me. I'm pretty much drained of hope so I'm so unsure about all of this. Flabbergasted really. I haven't sent in my application, it's just the emails make it seem like they actually want me and that's such a strange and foreign notion for me.

Feeling sad vibes due to low GPA and mild imposter syndrome,"Hey guys,

I’ve been feeling a little worse for wear this midterm season for a couple of reasons and I wanted to know your thoughts / advice on my current situation. 


Basically what’s been fucking me up most is that I received a bad grade in one class my freshman fall semester and it absolutely destroyed my cumulative GPA. The class was in a subject (stem) not at all related to my major (humanities-oriented) if that’s important . I’m a sophomore in CC currently and I’m trying really hard in my classes this semester so I can nudge that number a little higher, but it seems hopeless at times because after two semesters I’m sitting at just below a 3.0. Honestly this has been killing my confidence and I haven’t told a single person except my mom about it (love you mom) because I’m just super embarrassed about it. Sometimes, albeit rarely, people will joke with condescension about how they know someone with a 2 point something GPA and I’ll just be chilling there like *yeah haha that’s rough hahaha* but on the inside I definitely shrivel a little. 

I’ve been trying to hype myself up through the reassurance that if I get stellar grades for the rest of college I’ll show an “upward trend” which will indicate growth and ability to learn from mistakes. This is actually pretty much what happened in HS for me (got meh grades freshman year and straight A’s junior year), but from a career / grad school standpoint I can’t help but stress. I know for certain fields like finance they won’t even look at your GPA if it’s below a certain cutoff, but to what extent are there exceptions to this via networking, professional/research experience and the like? And how does this vary among competitive fields? I’m feeling the same semi-desperation when it comes to grad school, specifically law. 

Coupled with this is the fact that I feel like an absolute retard in 1004 Java compared to the others in the class. I generally haven’t experienced imposter syndrome since I’ve been here but it seems like the class is easy for most people while I’m having a hard time understanding what are pretty abstract concepts defined using a ton of terminology I’ve never heard before, especially since I came into the knowing literally nothing about computers except how to use Windows XP and Office 2010 (deadass. on my Mac I can use the internet and that’s about it) It gets hard not to psych yourself out and have spiraling thoughts along the lines of *dang seas and stem kids are way smarter than me and a stem degree probably seems way more impressive than a humanities one so I should switch my major to stem to be more eye-catching to employers even if its at the expense of enjoying school* ... especially since I was pretty good at math and whatnot in HS but I just do not shape up to the level of talent in STEM here.

All in all I definitely just needed to throw a pity party for myself and I don’t think like this always, but these thoughts are still frequent enough to give me a hard time.  

TL;DR: Have just below a 3.0 GPA after two semesters in CC. Feeling dejected and nervous about my future. How important / unimportant is one’s GPA in the grand scheme of things? And do people really find Java easy on the first go?",1571118029,27,0

Columbia ED Midyear/First Quarter Grades Report Question,"Since I couldn't get a response from A2C.

Does Columbia ED require first quarter grades to be sent? My school operates on a semester system so quarter grades don't show up on our transcripts.

We will accept the documents either electronically or in paper form via postal mail or fax.""

If first quarter grades do need to be sent, then based on Columbia's FAQ should they be sent via the midyear report or in another way? I thought the midyear report is only sent after being deferred or accepted and would only show semester grades?
