"Congrats and welcome!

2 - The rule is that you must declare a major before registration opens for the second semester of your second year. I would say there is basically zero pressure to do it before that because no one really cares, you just register for the classes you want and show up. You can view the requirements for each major at catalog.unc.edu, there is a Programs A-Z under the Undergraduate tab, click on each major and then go to the requirements tab to see the required courses. The PDF guide that goes along with orientation has an appendix with lists of good starter/exploratory classes in each major. Taking an FYS or other small-sized class in a field and going to professor's office hours are good ways to get a closer idea of what study and research are like in a given major. 

Also, it's not impossible to change your major after that necessarily although it obviously can become an issue if wait much longer than that and don't already have any relevant courses for the new major. Note that the few by-application majors (bus, pub health, clinical lab, etc) may have specific guidelines as to when you can/should apply and what you need to do beforehand. You are not required to have a minor although if you don't there is a ""supplemental general education requirement"" instead which is just taking some higher-level classes outside your major field . The valid possibilities are one major and 0-2 minors, or two majors and 0-1 minors.

3 - Normally 4 or 5. The official rule is that you take between 12-18 classes per semester, and each regular class 3 credits, 4 credits, or 3cr + 1cr lab. If you try to take less than 12, you can't unless you convert to part-time status which lasts for a full year and affects finacial aid and all sorts of stuff. You can't take more than 18 without overload permission. Most classes are 3 credits, so that could range from 3 * 4 = 12 to 3 * 6 = 18. You will also encounter some classes that are 4 credits, such as foreign languages and calculus, and a lot of STEM classes will have a 1 credit lab for a total of 4 (usually labs can actually be taken after as well as at the same time as the class, and they each have their own grade entry on your transcript). The grades are weighted by credit hours in GPA, so a 4 hour course counts 33% more than a 3 credit and a 1 credit lab counts a third as much as the 3 credit class. Labs have a course number with L on the end (ex. CHEM101 class and CHEM101L lab), and show up separately. Recitations (smaller breakout sessions that meet with a TA) are have the same course number with a different section number (ex. LING101-001 might have recitations numbered 101-601 thru 101-609) and you register for them together in CC (when you add the class to your shopping card it will prompt you to choose a recitation); however, recitations do not have their own grades, do not appear on your transcript, they are just part of the class. Most classes meet for 50m MWF or 1:15hr TuTh. Sometimes a class will have all recitations on one day in place of a day of class (ex. 50m MW + 50m rec F) and sometimes it will be on random times and days.",1617054456,1,0

"Speaking as someone who has already gone through the undergrad experience, I only started to understand how great and meaningful the friendships I made  and the experiences I had were at the end of my undergrad years. In the beginning, I joined a bunch of clubs and organizations and as time went on, I spent less time at the ones that mattered least to me and started spending more time/getting leadership positions at the clubs where I cultivated long-lasting friendships. It took me a while to feel connected and involved, though. Most of the time, joining in on those experiences initially felt awkward.

Of course, it's different and  worse now due to covid but hopefully things will be swinging back to a semblance of normal soon. One thing that has helped me to feel less lonely during covid (although it's true during normal times as well) is to imagine people are starting at the same place you are. They're also pretty new, somewhat lonely, and looking to make connections, but at the same time it's scary to put themselves out there and be the first one to ask if you want to hang out. There are a bunch of people out there just waiting for someone else to make a first move.

As other commenters mentioned, it's better to think of life and college experiences as something you actively have to seek out as opposed to something that will fall in your lap if you just sit in your room and wait for them long enough.",1617032229,1,0

"Oh man, this might not be all that helpful to you if you're just looking for textbooks and whatnot, but if you're looking into seriously starting a business, I would take a whole different route. Knowledge of business concepts and tools can help, but it definitely is far from necessary, since entrepreneurship itself is so fluid.

Depending on the type of business you're looking to start, you need to look to ask and answer yourself a lot of different questions, including:

* What is your business idea/product?
* What kinds of similar ideas/products are in the market currently? How small are you looking to start, and how will you break into the market?
* How will your business make profit? What do your revenue and cost drivers look like?
* Do you need funding to start off? 
   * If so, how much? Are you able to self-start, or do you need external financial backing?
* Do you need any partners/employees? If so, what will your organizational structure look like (it's better to establish this early than not)?
   * On similar lines, what will your ownership look like? If you're looking to start by yourself, a sole proprietorship should be fine for now, but if you're looking at having partners in starting, you're eventually going to look at partnerships and limited liability companies (LLCs) to mitigate personal liability as well as other things.
* Are there any legal obstacles to overcome (including things like business ownership/naming/taxes, insurance, licensing for certain products/services if you need it, patents if you're creating an entirely new product)?

There are a couple more questions out there, but typically, these just some the kinds of things you would need to consider before looking into things like branding/marketing or more specific operational logistics. There are also a lot of resources out there to help you answer these questions if you just search for them -- especially with something like marketing, because it's an ever-changing marketing, you want to keep up to date with the kinds of trends you would like to hop on. It doesn't hurt to know some of the fundamentals, but those are things that you can usually get through a little online research, or pick up as you go.

Also, full disclosure: no, I've never taken a class in entrepreneurship, but I have had my share in starting a couple companies over the years, and these are the kinds of obstacles that I've usually had to look into before starting. Hope this helps",1617026690,1,0

"I'm sorry you're going through this, but I can relate. I'm a junior transfer, so I feel more anxious about this since I'm spending less time at Carolina than you are. If it's any consolation, my first couple of years at college were rough because I went to a community college which had WAY less to do than UNC. It wasn't until the end of my second year that I was able to connect with a group of people in an intro creative writing class; we're still friends to this day. Don't feel bad that you haven't met people yet. COVID is making everything hard, but the first year of college is such a huge adjustment that it's pretty normal to not connect with people. 

I'd recommend joining clubs you're interested in over the summer or in the fall. Sign up for classes that sound fun and interesting to you. If you can, taking an art class (either visual, performing, or written). I've found that people in artistic classes tend to be chattier, especially since you have to workshop each other's work and get to know each other through that process. If you're in a major, see if your department has meetings or events. These are great for connecting with people in your major. Also, go to office hours!! Students aren't the only people you can befriend! I've become close with some of my professors by going to office hours and getting to know them. One of my professors helped me get an internship and is helping me publish, so these kinds of relationships can have professional benefits too.

"Sending you good vibes! I felt like this a lot when I was at UNC for not fitting the mold around me. I graduated several years ago and have since been a grad student at a couple different universities. There are parts of my Carolina experience that were not great - some of which were my fault and some of which I felt were university/department issues (especially since I've seen other universities handle this better). That being said, I don't regret going to UNC. 

My recommendation:
- Take some classes for fun. I remember more from those than I do from a lot of my major required courses. 
- I took an APPLES class on a whim bc a friend was going to do it and it ended up changing my career path. Try volunteering / stepping out of your comfort zone next year. 
- Find a balance with your social life. Just because other people are doing one thing, doesn't mean you have to too.
- Set some goals. Find people to help you meet those goals. One of my roommates and I started going down the Carolina checklist our junior years for all the essential Carolina experiences. We thought of it like a quest and it was a lot of fun (I still laugh at the pictures of us in a fountain).",1616960176,1,0

It’s especially hard to find a niche because of covid. Plus, it’s almost towards the end of the semester. However, some clubs still recruit people even though the semester is wrapping up.

"There are a number of CS clubs available at UNC, and you can check them out on [this website](https://cs.unc.edu/academics/undergraduate/clubs/#ctf).  There are a some other CS clubs not listed on this website (some of which you can find on heel life), such as Carolina Web Dev at Carolina, Google Developers Group (GDG) Chapel Hill, Product Management Club, Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC), Kappa Theta Pi (a tech co-ed frat), and I think a few others.  Personally my favorite and probably the most practical CS club that I'm involved in now is CS+SG and I'd highly recommend joining.  I'm currently on the education team, and we're learning how to create web apps with JavaScript/React, but next semester I can join one of the project teams to develop a software project for a particular client.  If you want to join CS+SG you can fill out [this application](https://forms.gle/vRpTASY2WaM8f6VR9), and then when you've finished it email [cssgunc@gmail.com](mailto:cssgunc@gmail.com) so that they can process your info and then add you to the Slack.

I'm also in [GDSC](https://dsc.community.dev/the-university-of-north-carolina-at-chapel-hill/), which would be good to join if you're interested in learning how to use different Google developer technologies.

If you are looking for something more volunteer-based, I am a member of a new organization called [STEM Academy of NC](https://www.stemacademyofnc.com/), and we mentor elementary and middle school students in various STEM-related topics.  

I'm also starting a new club with a few other people from one of my psych classes last semester (PSYC 180) called [Students for More Humane Technology](https://www.instagram.com/humanetech_unc/), and while it's not really CS-focused, it's really more about trying to spread awareness and learn more about how tech/social media can affect our daily lives.

"I loved my MATH 233 class. Though it's only my second semester here, Dr. Burkhead has been far and away by best professor. I can't necessarily speak for the other professors, but from what I discerned during her class, the other professors are fine as well. The difficulty and workload were pretty much what you would expect from a college level calculus class. It wasn't overbearing by any means and I will say that I very rarely felt like the work I had to do for that class didn't pertain to the content/wasn't on the test. If you did fine in AP Calculus, I don't see any reason why you wouldn't be able to do fine in 233 as well.

&amp;#x200B;

With regard to 347, I'm taking it right now. I doesn't seem too terrible. My prof doesn't seem as detailed/organized as Burkhead was, but the content doesn't seem that hard, at least so far. My prof does seem understanding and definitely cares about her students though which is always nice. Can't really provide much more insight than that.",1613749385,1,0

I was also hesitant about doing so because I had heard bad reviews about it, but hopefully I'll be able to get something good out of my sessions, and it'll be nice to be able to actually talk to somebody about what I'm dealing with rather than try and figure it all out by myself.

Carolina Families,

This morning Vice Chancellor Amy Johnson shared a message to students, encouraging safe watching (and celebrating) for the UNC vs Duke rivalry game this Saturday. Please help us by encouraging your student to stay safe.

______________________________________________

Dear Tar Heels,

Check out the video that Student Body President Reeves Moseley and I created, encouraging safe watching — and hopefully celebrating — our UNC-Duke men’s basketball game this Saturday.

Visit our Student Affairs website for fun ideas on how to watch safely and remember to follow the three Ws — WEAR a mask, WAIT six feet apart and WASH your hands. 

Don’t forget that participating in large gatherings and rushing Franklin Street not only exposes you and others to the virus, but also violates the University’s COVID-19 Community Standards, and state and local gathering rules.  

Especially this weekend, we want to #BeatDuke and #BeatCOVID. Stay safe, take care of each other ... and Go Heels!

Amy Johnson 
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs",1614891109,2,0

"I did not assert that everyone will be fully vaccinated by the end of May. I said that “The current target is vaccines for all U.S. adults (18+) by the end of May”. Maybe I should’ve spelled it out a bit clearer for you but I thought my first sentence made it pretty clear of when I thought any UNC student would be vaccinated by.  I did assert in the first sentence that I think “ It is very possible that anyone who wants to be vaccinated will be fully vaccinated by FDOC (August 18th)”. The State of North Carolina is doing a pretty good job with vaccines and Group 3 has already started, with the plan that Group 4 will start March 24th. The final group (that includes college students) is Group 5, and it is reasonable to think that vaccinations for Group 5 could start sometime this semester. It is also reasonable to think that when we get closer to August 2021 there will be a focus on making sure that college students are vaccinated so that we can return to a mostly in-person semester in Fall 2021.",1614880613,1,0

I don't know how much research there is into the sequential infections--there aren't that many documented ones that I know of, and I think most of them don't even have sequencing on the first infection so they can't know if it's a variant (which might affect the immune response).",1614876042,3,0
"You seem to be describing T-cell and B-cell responses. It does appear that even some who have not been infected show T-cell reactivity to COVID-19, which would also quicken immune system response and mean any window of contagiousness on infections is harder to catch in some cases, and more so the further we go into this pandemic and vaccination. 

The whole goal of vaccination is to motivate T-Cell response so that as you say, signs of infection aren’t detectable upon testing. Do you know offhand any difference in how long a person is contagious in first v. second infections?

I splurged on myself when I got a new iPad and got the Apple Pencil and keyboard to go with it and it is the best thing I’ve ever done for my schoolwork. I honestly used it much more for notes and stuff before covid but I still use it to type notes now while I have the zoom up on my laptop. Handwriting my notes is awesome.

"my understanding is that there are two kinds of immune cells, one short-lasting (and easy to test for) and the other long-lasting (and difficult to identify after a period of time, but still there ready to identify the trigger virus and get the immediate immunity cells going again).

most people who've already had covid are having worse reactions to the vaccine (it feels like they are sick again for a short time), which seems to indicate that the immune system does still recognize and respond to the virus trigger?

anyway, tl;dr: I don't think people are all losing immunity entirely, I think it gets harder to test for and may wane over time",1614873658,10,0

"Some fun information: the studies I've read suggest that antibodies for COVID begin to diminish after the 2-3 month mark, though there may be antibodies present for up to 8 months. Those with mild cases tend to lose antibodies the fastest, and those with more severe cases have a larger antibody build up and longer-lasting protection. Assuming most UNC students have mild cases, I don't think the population rushing Franklin had what could be described as ""immunity"" in February, more a greater sense of security.",1614872612,14,0

"I didn’t know many people who used an iPad in class but one of my close friends did and she loved it. Just make sure you’re actually using it for notes and not browsing the internet because it’s much easier to get caught slipping when using an iPad.

Haven't tried it yet but it seems helpful because in the past I always ended up with notes and wondering what was being said when I made that note.

Take time off if you’re truly unsure of what to do. College is too short a time and too expensive a setting to “figure it out” for most people. Because each semester you stay at school is nearly the cost of a car when you calculate interest.

They are leading with good intent though. People have already commented on the issues with some of the decisions made here. Aside from those, the majority of the racial/ racist issues you will face at UNC are issues you will face no matter where you go. There are a lot of initiatives to make UNC welcoming for minorities (ie: MAPS). There is also just a TON of opportunity here for black students.

Sounds like there's about 2 weeks until the decisions come out. Worrying *feels* productive but isn't going to accomplish anything or change what happens with the admissions decision.

Remind yourself that if you don't get in, you are not a failure and you can definitely still have a good experience at other schools!

Just my opinion though... don't beat yourself too much over it if you don't get in; and, if you do get in, you too will realize it's nothing too special once you spend a few months here.

I also worried like crazy while waiting for the decision day to come. Looking back, it's pretty funny, because there really was nothing to worry about. If I hadn't gotten in I wouldn't have been missing out on too much. 

Maybe I just feel this way because of COVID, but who knows. Just my opinion.",1615953576,2,0
"Both of my parents, and numerous members of my family are UNC grads. Safe to say, lot of life long pressures for me to go here. My junior and senior years of high school were rough. I lagged behind on grades a bit and didn’t do as well as I could have on the SAT. The day I got my acceptance letter I cried and cried from relief. I totally understand your situation. I was a bit of a chaotic high school student and turned to weed, alcohol, and nicotine as anxiety solutions. Obviously not very healthy and I feel like I shouldn’t recommend them. Anyway, just remember that the arbitrary decision by random people sitting around a desk does not define who you are. The schools you have been accepted to are great schools. You can do just as well there as at UNC. Either way, you’ll get in, I got a feeling. Good luck friend. :)",1615951605,1,0

I took it with Dr Mario a few summers ago and it was an absolute breeze. Lectures are pretty draining since it’s 1.5 hours a day but it’s a pretty basic class so it’s nice to be able to power through it rather than taking a whole semester for it.

"I'm a current freshman, so my experience here is pretty limited, especially since basically everything has been virtual, but I personally haven't had any negative experiences so far.  As someone else mentioned, I don't really know what it's been like for you living in the north since I've lived in the south all my life, so I have sadly pretty much gotten used to the racism that exists in our culture.  I will say that I grew up around a variety of different people (I went to a mostly black elementary school, and then a majority white elementary school for two years, and then my middle and high schools were pretty diverse), so I came into UNC with a few different perspectives, although I know that not all black students here were able to experience that.  And I personally didn't apply to any HBCUs because I wanted to be in a more diverse student body like I had in middle and high school (not that UNC is super diverse or anything). 

And UNC definitely isn't perfect either (if you check out the Instagram account for UNC black congress, or even BSM, you can see some of the issues we've been dealing with), so UNC still has a lot of work to do in terms of supporting the black community.  But don't let any of that stop you from applying because UNC is a great school that can provide you with some great opportunities, and there are some wonderful people here, both within and outside of the black community.  The majority of the friends I have made so far are not black, but being involved in organizations like BSM, Blacks in Technology, and NSBE has showed me that UNC has a strong black community, so I've haven't felt like I'm completely alienated or lost as a student here.",1615915897,2,0

"I'm a freshmen and I can't really say much since my experiences have mainly been over zoom. However, my background I believe is a factor that has made me not able to connect with my own community. I was born in the North(New Jersey) and then moved to the South. Since my mother is white in my opinion i haven't had the chance to connect with the Black Community. My highschool was a predominately black school and I was often referred to as ""white"" because of the way I act with mannerisms since that's how I was raised. 

Being at Chapel Hill for my experience it still remains an issue it seems that some people like to look down on you but not all but it's evident that there is favoritism and like they stated unless you're taking like a AAAD class or other classes about African Americans you won't see many people alike.

Since I'm only a freshmen I haven't regretted anything yet but I have noticed that it's not going to be a walk in the park basically anywhere you go.",1615914836,2,0
"Coming from a white town + being the only Black kid in my class, Chapel Hill isn't that bad. My freshman year was the first time I didn't experience micro-aggressions regarding my name. Every professor I've had (I'm a junior) has pronounced my name correctly. This doesn't seem like a big deal to some, but during K-12, I've had people deliberately mispronounce it and even one teacher *refuse* to call me by my first name. This was the first time I genuinely felt included and welcomed in an academic setting. Everyone around here is more liberal in general, which is a breath of fresh air (my home town threw Trump parades...so yeah). 

That being said, it isn't perfect. When I first came here, I could tell some of the students didn't grow up around a lot of black people. My freshman year, I'd always arrive to the lecture halls pretty early. Maybe it was all in my head, but it felt like some people didn't want to sit near me. And when they did, I could tell they felt uncomfortable. 

In some of your classes (at least from STEM), you might one of two or three (if not the only) Black kid in your class. That is my situation in two nsci classes right now. In one of them, I've gotten this vibe that my group members think I'm kinda stupid. I could be overthinking it, but it got to the point where I was sobbing after zoom once bc I was so uncomfortable. 

This is super random, but I'll never forget that feeling when I scrolled through nearly every psych and neuro lab and counted maybe 10 Black people. It was a nice little reminder that I indeed attend a PWI. 

Also, like u/TheBoracicNards mentioned, there are some people want a token POC friend and the unc/unc system administration is low-key racist. South campus/Rams Village (high amount of POC students) is generally more policed than North Campus (more white students, Granville, Frats). 

Overall, my experience has been good. Everywhere you go, there will always be some racist people-- whether its explicit or more like micro-aggressions. The problematic people I've encountered are in the minority at UNC. Pick your non-black friends carefully. Join BSM, a D9 frat/sorority, or anything that will allow you to connect with fellow Black kids. 

I don't regret attending UNC, but stay open to universities like Spelman, Morehouse, and Howard.",1615911130,4,0

"Latino here, hope my input can still be helpful. Idk if you’ve seen those tiktoks where it’s like “when you realize your PWI is primarily white” but that’s pretty much a good summation. Ngl I feel left out a lot, kind of like looked down upon, and get a lot of “looks” (you’ll know what i mean) when I go on campus. Unless you’re taking a specific class like on Latinx/Black history, you and maybe one other person wil be the only minorities in the class. There are a lot of Asians though, there’s usually like 2-3 in your class but other than that, yeah super white lol. There’s definitely some culture shock with some people and it can be kind of hard to determine if like someone genuinely sees you as an equal or is trying to coddle you because youre a POC, or just hanging out with you because they need a token POC friend/think POC are cool (like a fetishization but like not that deep). UNC and UNC system board of governors like leadership sucks dick and is pretty racist/really clinging to white supremacy so you will 100% be disappointed by them anytime any sort of racial/social justice issue is brought to the forefront. Overall though I don’t regret my choice to come here (not like there are historically latino universities really lol) but there’s certainly a lot of stuff that kind of upsets me/i didn’t expect.

Edit (almost immediately) to add: damn i didn’t see the northeast part. Yeah I’ve lived in the South all my life so I’m just kind of used to racism and shit. I don’t think i’ve really experienced anything out of the usual (UNC is way better than the town i’m from) but no idea how it compares to north. If anything I’d say it’s pretty “Northern” (the people and town, but the system and leadership sucks dick like i said) in the sense that the racism is a lot more of the subtle liberal gentrifying racism than the like explicit slurs and redlining racism.",1615906830,3,0

"Hi! I got into UNC and UW and visited both as well, so hopefully I can help (I’m also a bio major). UW was my top choice during my sophomore year, and then when I visited I decided it really just wasn’t for me (the opposite happened with UNC, hence me being here now). 

I think community is very important. For me, the community energy and vibe of the town/school (along with the great resources, reputation,etc., but especially the vibe I got) sold me on UNC. UW did not fit me well; it felt too big, impersonal, and I didn’t enjoy the city and surrounding area’s vibe. Overall it just felt off. But, you said you felt at home there, so I would definitely take that into account. Obviously different people have different preferences and if you had a gut feeling about what felt like a community/atmosphere fit for you I would go with it. It’s very important. 

Onto the academic part, when I was digging into UW during my own app process something that turned me off was people saying “good luck graduating in 4 years”. It seems UW has a bit of a problem with getting people the classes they need, and I believe bio is a capacity constrained major for them? I’m sure part of that is the size of the school. Don’t get me wrong, Carolina has its hunger games moments of fighting for spots, but thus far I’ve been able to get into classes I need and dont foresee having a problem over the 4 years total. As far as grading, I will say that in my experience thus far, chem classes here at least (I think it’s a general STEM problem tbh but my experience is limited to chem 101/102 and a bio class thus far) don’t seem to like to curve? The chem department low key crushes dreams here, but the bio department seems more approachable. 

They’re both really good schools academically, but I would suggest also taking account how easy those academic resources are to take advantage of (e.g. can you get the classes you need? What are your class sizes? Can you easily go to office hours? How easy is it to get research, volunteering, general involvement?). Speaking to UNC, the hospital is literally down the street from the south campus dorms. The research and the volunteering is everywhere, and I personally found it more approachable than a city locale; it’s not really an intimidating physical environment if that makes sense (but again, I’m preferential to being more comfortable in places that aren’t big cities). Also look into the honors programs as they will give you smaller class sizes and the details of those at each school would be something to account for! At UNC (not sure how it goes at UW), anyone can enroll in an honors course, honors program kids just get first pick for them, and these usually have 20ish people. So you could have something like a molecular bio class that you might take your freshman or sophomore year with only 24 people, which would give you some good traction. 

Good luck, hopefully that helped!",1615877147,1,0

Try to just make sure you're understanding the key concepts: IMFs, equilibrium, what happens when something is added or removed, ICE tables, &amp; entropy. I've found it way too overwhelming to try to understand everything but find that once I'm confident with the basics, I feel a lot better approaching problems with layered concepts. Also, review the homeworks. You can practice them all again and really focus on what you may have missed or misunderstood initially. 

Lastly, don't beat yourself up because you're feeling confused. If you're in the class, you deserve to be in the class. Someone else's success does not mean it's your failure.

I went random for my suite too, which looking back I really regret doing. We never interacted with each other and it made me feel really isolated. I ended up spending a lot of time avoiding my dorm because I hated how quiet it was. But I do know people who went random and they had a great experience and ended up being friends with their entire suite/hall.

"Strongly disagree. ""Business"" as an undergraduate major simply denotes general study of business, nothing more. It doesn't make you much less of a candidate for any position in the broad field of business, including more elitist fields like investment banking.  It doesn't make you much less of a candidate for an MBA, either, which is where having business in your degree arguably actually starts to mean something. Plus, you can still always take classes and join clubs in the b-school even if you're not a b-student. 

As a non-traditional student with career experience, I personally don't even think that an undergraduate education in KFBS is as valuable as other majors, which is one of the biggest reasons I even *dropped* business for statistics. Granted, KFBS does provide you opportunities to network and make connections, but that's all that is -- opportunities. You can make those opportunities and connections on your own, especially if you know exactly where you're going into career-wise.

I see that you also want to go into entertainment management. Can you explain how a business education at UNC would contribute directly to that? Other than a bit of marketing, which you can classes and join clubs for, I don't think KFBS is a place really suited for preparing you for a career in entertainment in general, and I say this as someone who's worked tangentially to that industry. 

The point is, even if you think you may ""need"" a certain title or name to have certain futures, there are *always* alternatives. I would start by rethinking what you need to achieve your career goals -- including the kind of education you're looking for, as well as what skills you need and what people you want to connect with to get to where you want to be.",1621306741,1,0

The science classes have been terrible for me and have ruined my love of science altogether. The only reason I wanted UNC was because of their science classes and strength at preparation for medical school. The science classes are not preparation they are simply there to scare students and make them lose all self confidence.

"My freshman year I attended the last orientation session and therefore was in the last batch to register. I’m not gonna lie to you, you’ll possibly be stuck with an 8 am, but like people have already commented, typically seats are reserved for freshman in most intro classes, so I wouldn’t  stress too much. I would recommend having multiple schedules planned out with back ups in case classes you want are full by the time you register, or else it will be a lot more stressful when your first classes all come back with red Xes and you don’t have any other plans (speaking from experience lmao). You can also keep a watch on connect Carolina before registration to see when classes fill up, which you’ll learn about at orientation. Good luck!!",1621303387,4,0

"I would say that the top ""backup major"" is economics. Most business school rejects do not drop out. The business school pre-reqs can be applied to many other ""non-admissions"" majors. Several ""non-admissions"" majors at UNC would allow you to work in ""business"". Post-graduation you could pursue an MBA, however you would need to weigh the pros and cons of doing that. Some companies will fund your MBA after you have worked for them for a bit so thats something to consider. If you are worried about getting into the business school perhaps consider a backup major and take electives that would fit with that major (ex. PLCY classes for a public policy major). Also remember that you get two shots at the business school, but imo if you are applying as a junior you should have a solid backup plan in place. If you are really stuck on having the word ""Business"" on your degree I suppose that you could transfer to a less competitive school after a theoretical sophomore year rejection, but I'm not sure how the other school's business school would view that (unless you went somewhere without an application-based business program so I guess it wouldn't matter then).",1621301936,5,0

I hadn’t considered the possibility that you can’t contact your professor but if you find out that you can I think you should.

"I just want to first say that you are not alone. There are a lot of students struggling now and also before Covid. If you are needing to appeal for probation I would make sure you talk to an advisor from the Student Success Center if you haven't had one assigned to you from there.   


My second thing is I have been there too. I failed out of here about 6 years ago. For me I left and worked as a truck driver. During that time I started learning programming and found I really enjoyed it. When Covid hit it shut down the industry I hauled for (horses) so I decided to call it quits and return to UNC. I took one class first at Faytech CC. Got an A then reapplied for probation and now I have completed 2 semesters and 2 summer sessions at UNC with a B+ as my worst grades so it is possible to turn it around. If you do have to leave it will not be the end of your college career.   


Third, I would recommend looking harder at what caused you to possibly get into this position. I know the advisor who was assigned to me for my appeal for probation recommended because they want to see that you understand what lead to the situation and have a plan to deal with it. I think your chances of getting probation would be very high, especially for the summer session. Only take one class each session, try not to work if its possible, join and attend one of the weekly support groups for students on probations (satisfies one of the requirements of probation), and put everything into those two summer classes.",1621282680,15,0

"Hey. You’re doing the best that you can. Things are so hard right now. UNC has a pretty darn high graduation rate, a little over 91%. I don’t really know what submitting an appeal for probation means, and I by no means want to pressure to clarify if you want to do so, but from the website, it looks like the process of appealing is made for students like you. Everyone, at one point or another in their lives, needs a second chance. And a third. And a fourth. The graduation rate tells me that UNC admins really want to work with people who want to stay, and it sounds like you really want to stay. I also guarantee you that not everyone else is excelling. We formerly gifted students are experts at putting up a front. This year has *sucked*. I encourage you to give yourself some grace; I’ve had to learn to do that this year. You are alive, you are breathing, and that is something, okay? In the midst of a global pandemic, hundreds of thousands of deaths, a damn toilet paper shortage, and a racial justice reckoning, you chose to stay. I don’t care what your GPA is, you’re a strong human for making that choice. There is also so much more to life than your GPA, than your degree, than your title. Yes, those things are very important, but you know what has made life worth living for me after being dangerously depressed at 18? It wasn’t getting into UNC and it wasn’t the numbers on a screen before or after I got here. It was the sunrises with my best friends, or alone, dead quiet and serene. It was the laughter at one in the morning over something that absolutely had no comedic value. It was the little girl holding a sign on Franklin after they called the election. It was the people, the experiences, the joy in mundane things. You are not a failure because there is no way to fail at being alive, or a way to ruin it (barring, like, horrible crimes, lol). I don’t think you’ve ruined your college career, but even if you had (again, it’s your first year and you have not), you haven’t ruined your life.

Beating yourself up excessively won't help - take a step back, make a few lists of what are your goals, your strategies to get there, who/what can help you succeed (tutors?

He also writes his own reviews for rate my professor and wrote a ton on 4/29 if you wanna take a look! In general, MOST students just aren’t happy with him.

I would mix it up with Med Deli, Bandidos, and Spicy Nine lunches sometimes (they had lunch portions that were only like $8 for curry and I loved it). Lots of other restaurants of course but those were my cheaper favorites on franklin. Sometimes I’d also go to Carrboro on the bus to Harris Teeter for more special snacks or Armadillo Grill. 

As for things to do that depends on your public/covid precaution level. I’d recommend the varsity theater on franklin street, cheap movies and play new and classics. Visit the 8th floor in davis with the study room with the pretty view, normally super crowded but less so during summer (if its open for covid? :( ). Go to the planetarium or art museum.

* Many people are quick to answer because they have slides from previous years and the questions are similar. Don't think badly of yourself if you can't answer them quickly.

* In our class, he eventually implemented a rule that you can only get a max of 3% from bonus questions. I'd discuss with him if he hasn't brought that up.

"I'm also taking STOR 556 this semester, and I feel the same way as you. Last class, it was absolutely crazy how quickly some people answered those bonus questions (especially that last one about the probability of pulling balls from an urn without replacement). At first, I was happy to hear about how much extra credit he'll be giving out this semester with the bonus questions, but after last class, I honestly feel like I'll have no chance of getting any of the extra credit this semester just because of how fast others are. I also looked at the grade distribution on GradeToday before signing up for the class and it didn't look that bad, but now that I think about it, the large number of As might just be from some students who had their grades inflated by all of the extra credit, not because the class wasn't too difficult. I am a little concerned about how the grade inflation may affect things going forward.

I really want to stick with the class because I really want to learn about how time series work (especially with how useful time series are and all of their different applications), but right now, the thing I've been most concerned about is just how difficult the course will be. I'm kind of just waiting for the professor to assign homework so I can get a sense of what to expect in the class. I also really want to know more about the group project because I don't really know what to expect from it, and I don't know anybody in the class that I could work with (I'm guessing maybe it's about using ITSM to analyze time series data in a group?

"Personal anecdote: I was waitlisted in 2017 when I applied and I just graduated from UNC a semester early in December 2020. I sent a LOCI when I was waitlisted but only because I had substantial additional things to report. I don’t remember if they had a “no additional materials” rule then but I did send a LOCI anyway. I ended up getting accepted in June. 

This is not professional advice and I don’t think anyone can give you that, so I just wanted to share my experience. 

If I were in your position, I would sit on that waitlist for a week or a few weeks and then re-evaluate if you still want to send a LOCI. The waitlist is fresh and I know how frustrating/devastating it is, which is likely influencing you wanting to send that LOCI ASAP and will likely affect what you write in it. Sit on it for a bit and then decide.

Redemption stories happen, even if you have shitty circumstances or things of your own fault that happen initially. Use the initial rejection to fire you up, do super well elsewhere, and when you apply to transfer, use it to craft a damn good redemption story. You can do it. :)",1616882141,1,0

"I took 435 with Sturton last semester. It was a very straightforward cs class in general. The beauty of 435 is that she assumes that you have no background in computer security, and she teaches all the concepts step by step. Since the class heavily focused on security conceptions, the assignments were not complex at all and did not involve much coding (a couple of assignments did have coding but were easy python stuff). The midterm and final were relatively easy too if you pay attention in class and do the worksheet after each class. In terms of grading, Sturton grades very fairly and gives partial credits. She is a great prof and enjoyed the concepts I learned in that class.

535, on the other hand, expects that you already have some background in computer security. Also, the assignments are more programming-heavy. 

As a senior cs major, I feel like Comp 572(with Montek) and 435 were the easiest cs elective classes I have taken at UNC. I would highly recommend you to start with 435, and if you really enjoy 435, take 535 the following semester. I hope this helps!",1619158394,1,0

"So now that the application was cancelled, it should be back to the normal rules which is you can just declare though advising at any time. For incoming freshman there is a survey they send out after orientation that gives you an automatic change of major so I would encourage you to use that. After that point you’d just make an appointment with advising at any time. 

There’s a BA and a BS option for CS but it wouldn’t really matter too much what you pick now because they should both count for the major only class priority and the difference is just you have more elective freedom with the BA and the math requirements are much lower.

"2-before-3 has not been very successful last semester. I think the truth is that certain computer science classes are much more attractive than others and are only offered once a year.

This behavior is exactly what Prof. KMP said the department tried to avoid: ""this process also aims to avoid the time-consuming behavior that the UNC registration priority tends to encourage: register for any class that is open and switch.""  

As a rising senior who unfortunately has finished all upper-level requirements, I and many others are in a very disadvantaged situation. I try not to complain but seems like the rule is a bit unfair. The BS/MS program alone requires more than 5 upper-level courses yet the department somehow discourages seniors to take more than  5 upper-level courses.

"Would be happy to answer questions, feel free to send specific Q's either to my messages or as a comment here. 

Off the bat– it's very hard to turn down a full-ride and I wouldn't take that lightly. Medical school is pretty expensive and the total debt (and interest) burden from getting both degrees shouldn't be taken too lightly. 

I can speak to the fact that UNC has a large medical center on campus and enterprising students can build a formidable application with a little bit of networking and exploration of research/volunteer opportunities/etc.; she won't go wrong by coming here. 

However, I would imagine similar opportunities exist at UF, which is another major research university which has a medical center and medical school on campus. 

The discrepancy between a graduate from these two institutions isn't nearly as wide as the difference between UNC and UNC Charlotte. 

...but that's also speaking logically– from a personal standpoint, I love it here in Chapel Hill. I transferred here from another university wherein I was not a cultural fit. My experience was night and day and I became a much happier, much more effective person once operating within a community that was more academic and ""a good fit."" If money isn't a barrier and your daughter feels that UNC is a great fit, then she can certainly find success and happiness here.",1619129540,1,0

Among other things, there is still a ton of uncertainty about visas for international students. I am not too up to date on this myself, but I think the main problem is that some consulates are still not doing interviews, particular in those countries that have the 14-day COVID travel bans. So it would mostly be an issue for incoming/second year students as the upperclassmen would already have valid visas and would at most need to go to another country for 14 days if they are in one of the restricted countries.

I was going to say it there was also some uncertainty about the state of public health orders then, but the governor has now said that social distancing restrictions will end on June 1st so all should be clear on that front.

Additionally, because we are operating in a mixed vaccinated/unvaccinated environment, there will be some people who still have to quarantine after a possible exposure, so there will also have to be some way to accommodate 14-day absences.",1619119741,5,0

"Here is the announcement from last month: https://www.unc.edu/posts/2021/03/05/fall-2021-update/

&gt; Based on the guidance of our experts, we are planning for a fall 2021 semester that will be a more typical residential academic experience at Carolina, with the goal of a full return to in-person instruction. We will likely need to keep many of our current safety precautions in place. Details will be finalized in the coming weeks and months as we monitor the trajectory of the pandemic, but today we are sharing these important steps:

&gt; Courses:Fall registration for continuing students will begin on June 1. This timing will allow deans, department chairs and instructors the maximum amount of time to plan for the fall. With safety measures in place and far-reaching access to vaccines, we expect a return to in-person instruction and a more typical academic experience on campus this fall.

"As far as I can tell, we're not trying to end the transmission of Covid-19, we're trying to end a pandemic. If the spread of those variations becomes concerning, that's one thing, but speculation here isn't necessarily conducive to getting back to a safe, relative normalcy. If those variants begin running amok, and we see widespread infection in the US, that's a huge problem. But if it's more a matter of some people who have been vaccinated that get exposed to these variants may develop symptoms and in very rare cases die, and the instances of those events happening are very rare (being that what made Covid-19 so devastating was that it could be spread by asymptomatic carriers,) that's another thing.

Insofar as I can tell, the model of getting the majority of the population vaccinated puts us on a path to seeing what comes next. In the meantime, if the risk is low, I think it's okay that we live life after a year of neglecting it. If that causes problems, I'm confident our state is better equipped than ever to deal with them, especially with a population primed for mask mandates and conscientious distancing.

But these are just my thoughts, and I'm speaking as a person rather than a scientist, doctor, or public health expert. I plan on listening to what the state orders are and acting as accordingly as possible.",1619066426,2,0

Last year I was considering doing a masters in public history to work in museums and curatorial work or a PhD to teach, and I went and asked my favorite professor for advice, and he deadass told me to not do it, and that he recommends to any student interested that they don’t pursue that path bc theres just not many opportunities. 

I ended up deciding to pursue a masters in social work instead to become a social worker, and was gonna start school last August but decided to postpone bc of covid, so now I’m doing AmeriCorps for a year or two in the meantime. 

And if you have any questions about econ or the Fed, lmk and I can ask him for you or put you in touch with him!! He was very involved in the econ dept, he was a tutor, did an honors thesis and the Fed challenge club, so he could definitely answer your questions if you had any :)

Also sorry for my long responses and more info than you asked for- my major choices are my single biggest regret of college :/ and I really don’t want anyone else to have the same regrets, so I try telling people to hopefully make them think twice or consider their other options! 

Feel free to message me if you have any questions I’d be happy to answer  them talk more :)",1613238659,1,0

"One major for interest, one for monetizable skills. UNC makes it pretty easy to double major and two different fields means you complete most gen-ed requirements along the way. 

Like others have said, Econ is a good one-not too tough, fairly interesting at higher levels. Good job prospects.",1613236418,1,0

"Duke Forest Korstian Division at the Piney Mountain train is excellent. It doesn't have ""views"" in terms of elevation, but New Hope Creek there is lovely and you almost feel like you're in the mountains when you're next to it.

Cox Mountain Trail at Eno River State Park is also a nice hike. There's some elevation change/gain, considering it's the Piedmont. There's also the Laurel Bluff Trail at the Eno, which you can take to the old quarry.",1613231731,1,0

"i have no advice for you other than i’ve taken some classes in the folklore department (which has a lot of crossover with anthropology and american studies) and you need need need to take a class with bernard herman if you can. one of the best profs i’ve ever had, and he seems to grade on honest effort according to ability. tons of opportunity to learn and think deeply",1613203044,1,0

"Most of the transfers I met at UNC transferred after their sophomore year. It’s really up to you. I also knew great people who took years off after high school who came here when they were older (some as old as our parents). No sweat, you’ll be welcomed regardless of when you get here",1613192748,1,0

"Hey I am an applicant this year applying as a sophomore so I am not a current student, but I don’t think transferring in as a junior is as rare as you think. I forget the website I saw it on but there is a breakdown of how many transfers are soph and how many are juniors somewhere. Also, I already submitted my application so if you have any questions about the process you’ll need to go through let me know. Best of luck and my prayers go out to you and your application!",1613190414,1,0

"Kudos to you for this post!!! I am coming back to school after many years. The reason I didn't finish before was Math, Science and Foreign Language. It was ridiculously hard then and even harder now - my continuous though each day I have class is "" It doesn't have to be this hard""!!",1613185552,1,0

"Number one tip is probably that I noticed that mastering homework problems (especially the optional extra ones), are really hard, and probably harder than some of the questions you would get on an exam, but they do a good job of teaching you extended uses of the formulas that you learn for every unit, which is super important. Knowing how to quickly identify what formulas are helpful to answer a question will save you a LOT of time on exams, and once you know what formula to use, its usually just a matter of plugging and chugging!",1613184347,3,0
