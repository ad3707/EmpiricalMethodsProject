"Tips on balance, time-management","Hey guys, I want to ask some upperclassmen for some tips. I‚Äôm already struggling with time-management this semester. I feel I have so much going on (I‚Äôm second-yr).

This includes 4 courses, co-op class+prep+apps, networking, 2 e-board positions, rushing a professional frat. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any tips on how to manage my time better and make sure I can get everything done in the best way possible.

For reference, last year I thought I really did well this. I was able to maintain a 4.0 the whole year, make really great friends, go to the gym 4-5 times a week, attend club meetings, and overall I didn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed.

I think I might have bit off a little more than I can chew this semester, but I think I just need to keep powering through. So that‚Äôs why I wondering if anyone has any resourceful tips or advice on how to really just do better with time and make sure I am on track and proficient with everything.",1632551198,1,0

But it‚Äôs taking a long time (as in 3+ hours with 0 files transferred over wifi) and I just want to know if they can help me with that, either by knowledge or by having chords/connections that might speed up the process.",1632546497,1,0

How on earth do people meet people here?,"At least based on the people on my floor, it seems like people are always going out and hanging out with friends, while I barely have anyone to even just chat with. Like sure, I've met a lot of people and made tons of temporary friends, but no one I actually hang out with again/semi-frequently.

It's almost been a month so I feel like my window for making friends this semester (I'm a freshman if that wasn't obvious) is nearly closing?

I joined several clubs based on stuff I like but even with that I can't really seem to connect with people for some reason. I feel like the way I talk to people might just be entirely incorrect but I don't know how. 

Only thing I'd say I'm proud of is the fact that I've even been trying to talk to people whenever I can - I  never did this in the past because of how incredibly introverted I am.

But yeah, any tips/advice would be nice",1632539413,1,0

Why are the dining hall staff so dumb and rude and not good at anything,Especially at IV they literally suck like when I ask can I have some rice please the lady pours it all over my plate making it impossible to fit other food on my plate when i literally just want a small side of rice and everytime one of the ladies puts something on my plate they always do it with a nasty look on their face and they put the food on so violently.

Co-op / NUWorks Question,"
Hey so I‚Äôm on my first Co-op search and I‚Äôm seeing a lot of co-ops just having a one-click apply situation, where you hit apply, make sure your resume is there, and then hit submit.

I‚Äôm wondering is this the case for most of the co-ops? For reference I‚Äôm applying to a lot of marketing, finance, and operations roles. 

It‚Äôs convenient I guess, but I like personalizing the cover letters and saying why I‚Äôll be a good fit for the role, which I have been doing for co-ops that have an external application and allow more information.

Like I have solid experience and work and GPA, but obviously as a second year it‚Äôs not filled up with the most amazing leadership and work roles. 

I am basically wondering is the case for most roles where it‚Äôs just submitting the resume and then bam, you‚Äôre done and if they like your resume, they‚Äôll get back to you, if not, move on?",1632460990,1,0

I found a cute freshman girl and asked her if she wanted to join my crew. 

‚ÄúYou son of a bitch, I‚Äôm in‚Äù she replied. 

Perfect. I assembled my crew, crafted my heist plan and all I needed to do was find my toilet under the cloak of night. We meet up in the little boy‚Äôs room (hehe spicy) at 9PM and you best believe I found the crustiest, most skid mark-covered porcelain god. I bend over to rummage for my wrench and she asks me if she can do the devious lick right now.

‚ÄúWhat does that even mean? Of course we‚Äôre doing the lick right now,‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúOk great, come here,‚Äù she responds. 

Good thing I packed the extra ~~small~~large magnums üòâ. She pulls me in and leans in for a kiss. I close my eyes. She tells me to keep them open. I‚Äôm into it. She clutches my face and yoinks me in.

Before I can react she licks me in the fucking eye. I‚Äôm not talking about a tiny cute tongue poke. She did not French kiss my eye. She licked that motherfucker like it was the juiciest lollipop of her life. Oh god I could not express how gross it felt to have her try and dig her tongue under my bottom eyelid. I ran out crying.

I submitted applications to become ""exclusive members"" and hope to make friends from smaller groups and connect with others. But I got rejected on both groups lol.

Making friends as an introvert is already challenging but being a transfer and international student take the struggle to another level. I feel like I don't fit in anywhere here.

Getting Accommodation at NEU,"Where can I get help on how to form good answers for questions about my disability in the student disclosure form? I'm not too sure on how I can best advocate for myself.

In my previous institution, before COVID, I had an in-person appointment with the director of the DRC of that institution and talked to them about the troubles I had, and my history of accommodations before and up to high school, and I showed them the ""receipts"" of what meds I take and what my psychiatrist said about my diagnosis, and they gave me the green light to get the accommodations I needed.

Here it looks like the process is a bit more finnicky. It's asking me questions like:

""How does your disability impact you in an academic setting? residential setting? Why are you requesting DRC service?"" 

I'm not sure how to answer this best without sounding like I just want extra time on tests or sounding disingenuous. 

is there anyone I can reach out to for help? I'm also a remote learner right now so even if there was a physical DRC office that's currently open I can't physically be there.

"Considering transferring from NEU, looking for advice","Hi,

I am a freshman ECE major and I am considering (trying) to transfer to either UMass Amherst or perhaps Tufts (both schools I was previously accepted to). It's my goal to go to grad school for a PhD and I am wondering whether NU is the best place to set me up for this goal. I'm not sure if I like the idea of going on 2 6-month co-op's. Also, I don't like how a lot of the curriculum for EECE is a-la-carte (meaning it seems less structured than say UMass Amherst). Also, I'm in-state so UMass would be a lot cheaper and mean more money if I needed it for grad school, not that money is the main factor in this decision. I'm wondering if my previous decision to reject these other schools was a mistake given their more traditional academic bent. Has anyone ever been in a similar dilemma? If money was not a factor, what would you do? Am I missing something?

A message to the freshman class from an RA: calm the fuck down before you ruin the year for everyone.,"Let me start by saying this: I‚Äôm an RA, I‚Äôm 20 (underage), I drink, I smoke pot, I go to parties, I want all of y‚Äôall to go have fun and enjoy college 100%. With that out of the way I‚Äôll start my PSA. 

Jesus fucking Christ you guys need to calm down. I just talked to my residence director so all this info is at least pretty verifiable. There were a months worth of write ups in freshman dorms ALONE last night. Multiple ambulances called, and double digit freshman hospitalized‚Ä¶again, last night ALONE. 

To put it in perspective, my RA staff averages less than 1 write up per RA per year (excluding Covid mask stuff). We had more write ups than RA‚Äôs this weekend. 

You guys are partying on roofs and being shocked you get caught. You‚Äôre shotgunning beers in common rooms and wondering why you get written up. You travel in such unbelievably massive droves to Mission Hill that the BPD has told northeastern if they don‚Äôt fix it, the BPD will. You guys have no idea how abnormal this is. It‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre doing, it‚Äôs how unbelievably obvious, open, and out of control it is. The university is considering ‚Äúserious crackdowns that would change day to day life‚Äù and I for one would love to see that not happen. 

So peace of advice: walk to the hill in groups of 5, not 30. Don‚Äôt drink or smoke in visible places (or just go to the damn fens). If you‚Äôre doing stuff in the dorm, head to someone‚Äôs room and just don‚Äôt Blair music too loud, nobody will bother you I promise. Please take care of each other when you drink, and sleep on your side or stomach. And just generally speaking, at least try not to get caught. 

So please, go out, have fun, and party hard. Just be a little more discreet and reasonable so we all can keep partying too.",1631494750,1,0

DO NOT ADD YOUR OFF CAMPUS ADDRESS TO MYNEU,"Friendly reminder to absolutely not add your local off campus address to MyNortheastern!

Why? It can only hurt you.. here‚Äôs how it works..

Scenario 1) you have six friends over to watch football, or to play monopoly. A disgruntled neighbor, who hates ‚Äúthese damn students destroying their neighborhood‚Äù calls Northeastern &amp; submits a community report to OSCCR, which includes your address. Northeastern (OSCCR, NUPD, or Office of Community Engagement) gets the report and looks up the address in their myNEU database. They use the address to get your name, call you into OSCCR, and give you a talking to?

Scenario 2) you‚Äôre throwing a banger, and neighbors call 911. BPD responds and tells you to clear it out, they‚Äôre not asking for IDs of the tenants because the cops are chill &amp; just came from a murder or suicide call. Regardless, northeastern hears, views the BPD call for service log, and runs the addresses through the myNEU database - and then calls you in for a talking to.

Scenario 3) same as above, except BPD takes your ID &amp; writes a long report, which gets sent to Northeastern. You get called into OSCCR, but part of your defense can be ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt live there‚Äù BUT ONLY IF YOU DON‚ÄôT PUT YOUR ADDRESS ON MYNEU. This will get you out of any ‚Äúsupplying alcohol to minor‚Äù charges with OSCCR.

Don‚Äôt believe me, and still want to put your address on myNEU? Here‚Äôs an email exchange between City of Boston &amp; Northeastern community affairs, validating exactly what I said. Background here is by Northeastern  using police reports &amp; myNEU some poor kids had to talk to BPD &amp; northeastern because the neighbors despise them and submitted 18,000 complaints

I hate gaming laptops.,"I fucking hate gaming laptops.

Last week when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops.",1639865701,1,0

I will not go to school online,"I will just not go to school. And that‚Äôs my loss, and the rest of the world‚Äôs loss. I tried online school last year. Maybe you guys can do it, but I can‚Äôt. I have a learning disability. I tried it, I really did, but it just didn‚Äôt work. I got A‚Äôs and turned in every assignment but it didn‚Äôt matter, without in-person instruction and social interaction with my peers holding me accountable, I couldn‚Äôt manage my time and I turned everything in weeks late. I burned 30,000 dollars‚Ä¶ down the fucking drain, that‚Äôs not a good investment- for anyone. That could have gone to anywhere else, like charity, or mental health resources for the university.

Already, Northeastern has made clubs and events online- as if it has no cost. There is a cost. This is right on the track to going back into zoom lockdown. Say what you will- it is NOT the same, or even close. And -I would argue- not worth it. We do so many things to prevent Covid cases, but at what cost? People with pre-existing conditions, or who need preventive care but don‚Äôt know it, put it off and need expensive treatments later or even die. People die alone in the ER only to have their families visit their corpse in the morgue because visitors are allowed in the morgue but not the ER. People go years without seeing their family members. People like me (probably) fail out of school.

We can‚Äôt act like these restrictions don‚Äôt have a **REAL, PAINFUL** cost.

NEU Variant Data out of date,"Something you might have noticed is that while we had 80 new cases, the total delta cases on the dashboard only increased by 5, while the total omicron cases increased by 20.

Tuition boycott if Northeastern goes remote?,"Don‚Äôt know about y‚Äôall but I‚Äôm not trying to spend another 72,000 dollars to sit in my dorm and listen to a professor lecture on zoom who barely knows how to work a laptop. The Omicron variant is much more transmissible but there‚Äôs some early anecdotal evidence that it‚Äôs much more mild in its severity. If the lack of severity holds true Northeastern should seriously reconsider how they value these restrictions. I am deeply saddened by what happened to the student in Snell and I don‚Äôt know why he/she felt the need to do it, nor am I making any claims as to the restrictions that the school placed and how challenging it may have been to really connect with people as a reason for why he or she had suffered so much. But, I know that the remote learning, the burnout from it, and the isolation left many students with similar thoughts. So at a certain point, when do we start asking ourselves what is Northeastern‚Äôs role in creating the mental health problems of their students?

If this variant does turn out to be less significantly less severe (especially with all of the treatments offered with early detection today) despite high transmissibility and Northeastern STILL locks down clubs, Greek life, and moves everything back to zoom meetings, I don‚Äôt think a large-scale tuition boycott should be out of the question.",1639839129,1,0

Prospective Student here with a complex situation.,"Ok so I‚Äôm a senior applying to Northeastern ED2 on Jan 1st. However I don‚Äôt think I necessarily have the greatest stats as of now, but I want admissions to know I really am invested in this school. I wanted to take my schools colleges courses junior year but due to Covid they went online and I was putting a lot of time into tutoring my younger sibling as he had a lot of trouble with online school and was barely passing. All this to say now I‚Äôm not taking these classes until this year, but next semester. So I plan on taking two college courses (Intro to psychology and maybe American Sign Language) and hopefully take the AP psych exam and AP environmental exam, but for the AP‚Äôs I‚Äôm not taking the actual classes (cause my school doesn‚Äôt offer AP psych and I figured since I‚Äôm taking the college program I should be set with the exam and My school does offer AP EnvSci but I was told by many students the teacher for the class doesn‚Äôt prepare you for the exam and gives a bunch of busy work so I figured I‚Äôll just self study) I‚Äôll be self studying for them and taking the exams in may. All this to ask if I email Northeastern and tell them I‚Äôm doing this will they put those scores (I know they won‚Äôt be able to see the scores because May is way after the decision dates but I‚Äôll email proof I am registered for the exam) and college courses into consideration when looking over my application or will it be to late cause I‚Äôll be submitting all this after the ED 2 deadline. And does is it even with it to northeastern if I taking the AP exams without taking the classes? I really messed up and didn‚Äôt understand the importance of a rigorous class load for this school and I‚Äôm determined to make it up now.

In regard to the question ‚Äúwhat can Northeastern really even do to help?‚Äù,"I think it‚Äôs high time for serious talks between admin, faculty, and course coordinators about how learning can be done in a way that allows for sleep and breaks. I truly don‚Äôt believe it is necessary to assign 20+ hours of weekly work in a single class in order for learning to take place. 

It‚Äôs honestly an equity issue ‚Äî coursework should be designed such that even a student working 20+ hours a week to pay tuition can get their work done AND get 8 hours of sleep. This would also accommodate for people with learning disabilities who can‚Äôt get through to the DRC in reasonable time, or people with chronic fatigue / other hard to diagnose issues that make focusing for so many hours a day near impossible (not to mention those of us with severe anxiety and depression who have extreme difficulty keeping up, even with the help of medication and/or therapy)

I get it‚Äôs a radical thing to suggest not working as hard as possible all the time to pass classes, but I just don‚Äôt get the point. Classes could move half as fast, with optional advanced assignments, such that people who learn more slowly could actually thoroughly learn instead of cramming and forgetting while people who learn more quickly or independently could still have access to the standard materials. I‚Äôm sure there are other ways to create coursework that accommodates for people in different situations ‚Äî like come on. Let‚Äôs get creative.

I genuinely believe creating guidelines about reasonable amounts of coursework would drastically cut back on feelings of anxiety, hopelessness and despair, and that our community could be much healthier as a result. Not to mention how much more learning many of us would be doing if we were sleeping enough and balancing work with stress management activities. 

It shouldn‚Äôt be on professors to decide what their students are capable of. They should provide the resources to allow us to learn as much as we can while staying sane and safe. It‚Äôs so fucking weird that we‚Äôre treated as adults when it comes to sucking it up and being miserable for the sake of learning and being on the hook for tuition, but treated as kids when it comes to profs forcing cruel amounts of coursework &amp; deadlines down our throats because they think we won‚Äôt learn otherwise. 

The ‚Äúadult responsibility‚Äù we should be taking on is the responsibility to use the resources we have available to learn to the best of our ability. It shouldn‚Äôt be any person‚Äôs responsibility (at any age or stage of life) to suffer to the point of being suicidal. Ever. Being miserable doesn‚Äôt make you more ‚Äúgrown-up‚Äù. If there‚Äôs a student who needs strict deadlines and huge amounts of work to learn, that‚Äôs something they can figure out ‚Äî what makes that student‚Äôs experience more important than the student who needs more sleep and more time to work so that they don‚Äôt become suicidal?

I‚Äôm looking at Khoury with regard to cruel &amp; u reasonable workload (often on purpose) but would be curious to hear what it‚Äôs like for other colleges/majors as well and if this resonates with you. 

If you‚Äôre someone who does perfectly fine balancing workload and think that that makes you a valuable hardworking adult while other students are just lazy or immature or something, ask yourself what life might feel like if:
-	you had a part time job
-	you had an attention deficit or executive function disorder that made focusing extremely difficult
-	you had anxiety or depression that kept you from doing anything outside of classes because of low energy and motivation
-	you had a chronic illness or were sick for quite a while during a semester 
-	you were dealing with the sickness or death of a family member

Even the issues that warrant accommodation by professors don‚Äôt solve anything when work has to get done eventually ‚Äî getting extra time to do work just means doing double work the next week while still mourning/recovering/mentally ill. Our administration and faculty need to take a serious look at how learning can be done in an equitable way that doesn‚Äôt cause hopelessness and suffering for students with external circumstances.",1639746450,1,0

More funding for UHCS is absolutely needed but with the existence of wecare, find being 24hrs, and student insurance covering 80% for out of network therapists and psychiatrists, what other changes could the administration realistically make?

ANOTHER New Record Covid Cases,"On 12/14/2021, we had 57 positive tests, beating the record set 12/13/2021 of 50 cases. The positive rate also jumped to 1.26% ([https://news.northeastern.edu/coronavirus/reopening/testing-dashboard/](https://news.northeastern.edu/coronavirus/reopening/testing-dashboard/))  


Northeastern's dashboard still says that these are all the original covid strain, which is a load of nonsense considering that Delta and Omicron make up the vast majority of cases in the United States. While Northeastern hasn't stated that Omicron has been detected on campus, it would not be surprising if this is the result of the omicron variant, as Cornell University saw a similar spike ([https://covid.cornell.edu/testing/dashboard/](https://covid.cornell.edu/testing/dashboard/)) (&gt;1000 cases this week) and Harvard has acknowledged it's probably on their campus ([https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/12/17/covid-booster-requirement/](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/12/17/covid-booster-requirement/)).

Help You Can Get RIGHT NOW,"Hellow Fellow Huskys, 

In light of the recent tragedy, I feel compelled to share part of my story. I think Northeastern needs to do A LOT more to address the mental health crisis that exists but I want anyone reading this to know that there ARE ALREADY resources that can help and ones that have made an amazing difference in my life. 

This semester, I fell into the darkest hole I've ever been in. I was severely depressed and I struggled to wake up, eat, shower, etc. My roommates (the ppl I thought were my only friends) would see me crying and in crisis almost daily and never once did they ask if I was okay. I felt like the world was against me and if my ""friends"" couldn't help me, I didn't think anyone could. 

Eventually, it got so bad that one night when I went for my weekly midnight walk, scream, and cry, I called Find@northeastern. I told them about my mental health, my drug abuse, etc. 

They offered to set me up with BetterHelp, an online therapy service where I could be connected with a counselor and given unlimited therapy sessions. They sent the instructions to my email but it took three dark weeks before I even set up my account. Once I filled out the short questionnaire, it took 3 days before I got a counselor and another week before I was able to set up an appointment. 

Since then, I've been seeing my therapist twice a week and I finally feel like I've mad some progress towards feeling better. I have a long way to go and the service isn't perfect but it literally costs nothing and was the only thing that has pulled me out of this darkness.

What I want you to take away from this post is that even if you don't want to have a long conversation with the ppl at Find you can call +1.877.233.9477 24/7 and just ask for therapy through betterhelp and they will set you up. For those of you who need help but don't know where to start, I promise this is a good start and that if you are open to getting help, this help is there for you.

Waiting weeks to call Find and then weeks to set up therapy was not worth it. If you go through the steps it will only take a couple of days before you are able to actually talk to someone that you can continue seeing indefinitely. Please don't be afraid and DM or comment if you have any more questions.

In other posts, I hope we can start a discussion about what else the University can do. For now, anyone who needs a place to start just call +1.877.233.9477. The day I finally called I asked why it took me so long. I get it but I want you to know from someone who has been through it it can help.

Thoughts on organizing a peaceful demonstration to demand NEU better fund mental health resources?,"I‚Äôm not a people person or an organizer, but speaking as a student who is tired of seeing our voices go unheard when we ask NEU to provide better resources for student mental health, as well as someone who is upset and distraught at the recent news that may have been prevented with better allocation of mental health resources by NEU, I‚Äôm not quite sure what more our administration needs to hear to best cater to our needs as students with poor mental health due to toxic college culture and laughable mental health resources. 

I think our next step of action to make our voices heard would be to organize some sort of nonviolent student-led demonstration, maybe early next semester, to show the university that we are not okay with the current level of mental care support offered by a university that we give so much money to, and we will not accept things as they are any longer without standing up for what we feel to be necessary. 

This is a very undeveloped idea, this is just kind of my first visceral reaction upon hearing this upsetting and preventable news that can be blamed on NEU‚Äôs inadequate mental health resources, and I was curious what the community thought of the idea of standing up to our administration for better mental health resource allocation.",1639687048,1,0

Article on Northeastern‚Äôs Mental Health Crisis,"TW// suicide

Given the recent alleged suicide at Snell and my own personal experience, I‚Äôm writing an article for Burning Rose on Northeastern‚Äôs mental health problem.

I attempted suicide this semester. My situation was ignored by my counselor and the administration, with the exception of 2 professors, because my DRC accommodations have yet to be approved.

For context, DRC accommodations are accommodations students with disabilities receive after their DRC form is approved. The form takes up to a month to be processed by the DRC, and there‚Äôs no guarantee it will be approved. Because of this uncertainty, I felt I would only be taken seriously if I gave the DRC a detailed history of my trauma, sexual assault, and abuse. It was incredibly shameful for me, but i did it anyway for the small chance that my psychological problems would be considered by NEU. My friends who have submitted DRC forms have reported similar feelings of shame.

Did anyone actually get the warning texts from NUPD about Snell yesterday?,"I know that in the past I have gotten texts from NUPD about issues on campus, such as fires or crime. However, I haven't heard of anyone who received one of the supposed alerts about the incident yesterday. [This article](https://huntnewsnu.com/67337/campus/student-in-snell-library-found-unresponsive-in-apparent-suicide/) claims that ""the campus community was notified of the emergency situation in an automated text message"". The only instance of a text I've seen is weirdly just screenshots of iMessages on [NUPD's social media](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXgqZjylAE-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). This implies that some text *was* sent *somewhere*, just not to all students.

It just feels to me that this, along with the University's continuing silence on the matter, are just demonstrating that Northeastern wants this to stay as quiet as possible, which is honestly pretty messed up. I get that they may not want to share too much detail about the event, but they could still give some kind of alert.

How do we Tell Northeastern to Stop Killing Students,"Northeastern has so much money and doesn't want to take responsibility for the deaths they're causing on campus. 

 **It's not enough that Northeastern goes ""look! we have mental health services, guys, use them :("" because those services are understaffed, underfunded, and slow.** If you want a therapist either you can go to a counselor once a month or ""get refered"" to a therapist outside UHCS which will take weeks and not even guarantee you a therapist you will like (so more weeks will pass where you try to find a new one). 
Many kids won't even perdue the resources because of the energy and time it takes to do so. Mentally ill people can not be expected to take on helping themselves BY themselves. An advisor that takes care of 200 other students isn't enough. Telling us a hotline number isn't enough. Putting us on hold for 15 minutes isn't enough. Use that money and land your buying to make an entire mental health facility or something.
Stop admitting billions of students and throwing them to the wolves. Start paying attention to the students you already have.

**Therapy and medication won't go that far if you're failing classes because your trying to grasp onto reality but professors won't let up on class/grading.**
This college ""hustle culture"" fucking KILLS. It kills people and it's horrible it's being taught as a genuine way of living. With the amount of tuition we are paying, no one is fucking around about their future education/career. So give us fucking breaks when life hits us hard. 

I've been through the campus mental health ""reasources."" You know how hard I've had to work to get a psychiatrist, therapist, and accomodations? How much time (months) you have to put into that? If i didn't already have those resources back home and a family willing to help and the energy every couple of days to make multiple phone calls and emails just to get things order I may not have stayed at Northeastern or I could've been another dead kid on campus.

This is sickening that higher ups at this school can make millions of dollars and buy up acres of land while the people they're stealing money from are dropping like flies. I fucking hate this school and what it does to people. They need to talk to experts, listen to students, and fix their shit.

I have no idea what to say or research or who to talk to or what to do. I just want to do something. Fix something. Change something. I want to yell in a higher ups face and ask if they actually care about us. When a student dies on campus because of mental health related to school. Northeastern killed them.

Software Development: A Letter to Khoury College,"This semester in Software Development with Felleisen and Lerner was nothing short of horrible. If you aren't a CS major or haven't heard of the class, let me explain. The course serves as a sort of ""fundies 4"", wherein students are meant to use the knowledge they have gained over the past 2-3 years in order to develop a large scale software project from scratch. This sounds okay in theory, but the structure of this course feels more like endless punishment.

First, students are faced with endless moving goals, such as changing assignment parameters that are fundamental to a successful project. Not only that, but the assignments are structured in such a way that you may have to rewrite code that you spent 20+ hours on the week before. The professors attempt to emulate a pseudo ""corporate"" environment, but I would argue that college is meant to build you up, not force you to break down and wonder if you picked the correct major after spending weeks on a project.

Not only that, but if you do end up in a terrible corporate environment, it is much easier to quit, whereas this course is a requirement for anyone pursuing a CS degree. I cannot speak for everyone, but several of my colleagues mentioned that Software Dev took close to 30 hours a week, which is completely unreasonable.

The professors are also snarky and curt for seemingly no reason. Every answer on piazza and over email feels degrading and confusing, and in some cases even misleading (intentionally or not, I don't know). There was a clear ""god-complex"" on their part, where changes to the spec were not mistakes, rather they were ""clarifications"". They preach about ""good design"" while giving half or more points to autograding, which means that the code you worked on for 40+ hours and attempted to design well could just get a 0 for the week. There was never any acknowledgement of mental health, or even that spending so much time on one class is not healthy.

Finally, there are two partner switches throughout the semester, which force you to THROW AWAY the code you have worked on, and switch to another brand new codebase. It is essentially luck of the draw if you end up with a decent codebase, or if you get a codebase that is completely broken and doesn't follow the assignments at all.

Khoury Admins, if you're reading this please change this course, to at least make the lives of your students more bearable. I'm sure if you read the TRACE reviews, the ""hours spent"" section will reflect what I have said above.

angry rant about accel fundies 1,"we have a test next tuesday, right after thanksgiving break. ok, sure, fine. we also have homework due that monday (it's normally due on tuesdays) with absolutely no late submissions allowed. i get that the hw is supposed to be practice for the test, but it's also twice as long as it was last year apparently. at this point it feels like they don't really care about how we do in the class or preparing us for the test or honestly care about the students at all. most of my professors told us to take a break and not worry about working over thanksgiving break while fundies literally expects us to do twice as much work. like it honestly just feels cruel at this point, clearly they do not give a single shit about students' mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

i get that fundies (especially accel) is a course with heavy workload and even though it has been time-consuming, it has always been pretty reasonable. imo, this just isn't reasonable. if half the HW was optional (and they accepted late submissions) i would say ""yeah ok it's extra practice for the test"", but there's absolutely no reason for it to be 6 exercises when it was 3 last year, and due a day early with no late submissions allowed.

tw - SA Johnny Deroche,"&amp;#x200B;

if you haven't heard, Johnny DeRoche, a men's hockey play at Northeastern, was accused of SA a former classmate. there was a thread posted about this already ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEU/comments/qye7is/tw_sa_despite_allegations_mens_hockey_player/))

why the fuck is northeastern brushing this under the rug? WHY the fuck was Johnny DeRoche allowed to play in the last game? he has literal SA allegations against him that the university is trying to hide, just as UVM tried to. 

was there any sort of trial or questioning on him? how did it go? was he punished at all besides a pat on the back? he has literal SA allegations against him and he is still on the team, and still play's in the games. the head coach of the men's hockey teams was even asked about allowing him to play despite the allegations and the coach said that he was not allowed to comment on it? how fucked up is this whole situation?!!

i am not proud to be a student here. i am not proud to go to a university that brushes these kinds of matters under the rug. i am embarrassed to say that i go here because of how this situations (and many many others have been handled).

please , do what ever you can to bring this attention. email the head coach and the assistant coaches of the hockey teams, ask them why they are still allowing him to play. talk to the newspapers. comment on the university's instagram. make some noise, because clearly northeastern is doing nothing about it.",1637617794,1,0

First Year Who Recently Changed form CS and Math to CS and Business Administration,"I recently decided to change my major from Computer Science and Mathematics to Computer Science and Business Administration. This semester I took Fundies 1, Discrete Structures, Calculus 1, and First-Year Writing. Before making the change I was planning on taking and am currently pre-registered for Fundies 2, Logic and Computation, Calculus 2,  and Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning. Since the first semester courses for both majors are almost identical with the exception of Calculus 1 being replaced with Principles of Macroeconomics none of the classes for this semester really went to waste. Now, that I've made the change I've been a little unsure of what classes to take next semester. So far I have one plan:

Plan 1: Fundies 2, Business Statistics, Principles of Microeconomics, and Financial Accounting and Reporting.

Plan 2 (In case the sections for Micro fill up since the only class that I'm already pre-registered for and would work with my new major is fundies 2) :

Fundies 2, Business Statistics, Principles of Macroeconomics, and Financial Accounting and Reporting, 

What do you guys think? Do Micro and Macro sections tend to fill up quickly? What about the business statistics sections? Are these combinations of classes too difficult. Are any of these classes known for being very difficult? Do you guys have any recommendations for the professors?
Anybody have an alternative plan that I could add?",1636675550,1,0

Also the smaller company is way more flexible with how long I‚Äôd work, as well as days in person versus remote.

Can any upperclassman MechE‚Äôs answer a few questions about classes and schedules?,"I‚Äôm a third year ME major preparing to sign up for classes for the Spring 2022 semester. I have a pretty solid idea of what classes I‚Äôll be taking next semester, but I‚Äôm debating between a few classes to round out my schedule. I‚Äôve read the course descriptions and know which classes/sections fit in my schedule so now it‚Äôs just time for me to pick what I want to do. 
Here are my three choices and how they affect my schedule:

1. ME4505 (Measurements and Analysis with Thermal Science Application) + ME4506 (lab)
- With this schedule, my MWR would start at 9:15 and end around 3:15 (Wednesday would end at 4:30,bc of lab). TF would just be 1:25-3:15.

2. ME4508 (ME Computation and Design)
- I would also take ENCP3000 to match the extra credit
-With this schedule, my MWR would be 9:15-3:15. T would be 11:45-3:15, and F would be 1:25-3:15.

3. ME4555 (System Analysis and Control)
-I would also take ENCP3000
-With this schedule my MWR would be 10:30-4:30 (R would end at 3:15 instead). T would be 11:45-3:15 and F would be 1:25-3:15. 

My main reason for me asking is that even with the course descriptions I‚Äôm not very familiar with what each class covers &amp; will actually entail, including ENCP3000.

MSCS Aspirant - Confusion between choosing IU bloomington Spring 2022 vs NEU SF Spring 2022 vs NEU Fall Boston 2022,"Can some one help me decide both the pros and cons of choosing IUB vs NEU 
I have admit from both of them except due to space contraint boston was bot offered for spring 2022 but given San Francisco and portland maine as choice. waiting another 6 months wasnt an option since its already late. I heard tution costs could largely be compensated with co-op program. 


Choosing NEU SF would be risky since its new and also a sattellite campus. I was more and more inclined on NEU due to its reputation and co op 


1) Choosing IUB for spring 2022 and transfer to NEU Boson for fall 2022 - would this be even possible ?

2) how are job prospects for MSCS in Indiana as it had mixed reviews on jobs. I have come to know tution + expenses are cheaper compared to NEU. 

I am in a confused state now. I want to pay off education loan with deligent decision and would need some help in proritizing a better option. Please throw some light guys.",1635676686,1,0

Thoughts On This Schedule?,"I'm a first year CS/History Major Econ minor and next semester I plan to take:

- IS 2000: Principles of Information Science w/ Schedlbauer

First-Year CS and Math Major Changing to CS and Business,"I recently decided to change my major from Computer Science and Mathematics to Computer Science and Business Administration. This semester I took Fundies 1, Discrete Structures, Calculus 1, and First-Year Writing. Before making the change I was planning on taking and am currently pre-registered for Fundies 2, Logic and Computation, Calculus 2,  and Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning. Since the first semester courses for both majors are almost identical with the exception of Calculus 1 being replaced with Principles of Macroeconomics none of the classes for this semester really went to waste. Now, that I've made the change I've been a little unsure of what classes to take next semester. So far I've made the three following plans:

Plan 1: Fundies 2, Database Design, Principles of Microeconomics, and Principles of Macroeconomics

Plan 2 (In case one of the sections for Macro fill up since the only class that I've already pre-registered for that would work with my new major is fundies 2) :

Fundies 2, Database Design, Principles of Microeconomics, and Financial Accounting and Reporting, 

Plan 3 (In case all the sections for Micro fill up since the only class that I've already pre-registered for that would work with my new major is fundies 2) : 

Fundies 2, Database Design, Principles of Macroeconomics, and Financial Accounting and Reporting

What do you guys think? Do Micro and Macro sections tend to fill up quickly? What about the database design sections? Is financial accounting and reporting a good replacement for Macro or Micro? Are any of these classes known for being very difficult?",1635651320,1,0
Transferring between colleges after undergraduate acceptance,Hi I'm planning to ED to northeastern as an undergraduate this year. I'm quite concerned whether applying College of Khoury Computer Science will lower my chance at admission since CS is quite a competitive major. Would it be better if i applied for the college of social sciences instead. How difficult would it be to transfer between colleges in northeastern if I'm admitted? Would it be easy to switch from data science/economics to a computer science/economics major if I applied to college of social sciences? Thanks!,1635650017,1,0
CPS NEU versus Endicott College Master of Science in Information Technology,"Hey everyone!

Making friends as an International undergrad intern,"Hi guys,

As the title says, I came to NEU last month as a foreign intern to work on my thesis in the Physics department. Since I am an undergrad intern, I am having a tough time making friends or hanging out with people from NEU in general. 

Most people who actively come to the lab are grad students or post-docs, and I can not socialise as they are very busy with their work. Also, I did try asking them if they would be free over the weekend so I could hang out with them, and they weren't interested at all.

Since the lab is the only place I can interact with someone, I don't interact with students my age. The only time I can even talk to some students is while I am travelling to NEU, and even then, most of the students are busy with their own lives and can not talk to me properly. On top of that, COVID ruined a lot of things.

Are there any social media groups where people plan to hang out or socialise in general, as I am having a hard time meeting new people as no social interaction is negatively impacting me a lot?",1635644753,1,0

Besides emotional grievings these days, I am stressing out because I might end up losing the opportunity to matriculate at Northeastern. I am still pretty much an international student and I do not receive any scholarships from the school. My father has always been the main source of funding for my education at Northeastern. In other words, my family is currently undergoing a financial crisis situation. I, of course, want to proceed further with my educational journey in here, but I cannot continue when the person who paid tuition for me already died. Does anyone one know where and how to reach out to for support? Like resources, departments at Northeastern. Many thanks!",1635441713,1,0

My impressions of Northeastern,"(This post is just my personal experience and opinion not meant to offend anyone)

(N.U.in freshman) I've only been hear for 2 months so I don't know if this is an unreasonable/inaccurate statement, but I feel like there is an energy here that the only reason I should be here is to get higher salary (and a ""good"" job). I'm doing better than many of my classmates grades wise, a lot of whom only seem to care about passing(N.U.in is pass or fail). I just feel like there is a misalignment of my values and the values at this school. Obviously not everyone feels this way, but the main reason I want to get a degree is to gain more knowledge. I plan on pursing a PhD or a masters degree, but I feel like I'm just being fattened up to work at whatever organization has the best relationship with the school. Maybe I feel this way because all my top choices were liberal arts schools or because my mind has corrupted like smeagol trying to cling on to what my econ professor is saying over the cacophony of people who won't stop talking. Obviously things will change when I get into smaller classes that are more specialized towards my major(CSSH), but I feel like paying full tuition(nearly 300k) isn't justifiable for my ambitions from what I've seen. And now there probably won't even be room on campus for the massive amount of overaccepted students. I don't want to come off as a communist or a spoiled rich kid because I'm neither; I just wanted to rant and get peoples advice. I've thought about transferring and I would be able to save over 100k (at a school with similar prestige but seemingly different values) which isn't my primary concern, but I thought I would ask people who have more experience and knowledge than me before I made any decisions. 

TL;DR I'm not feeling the vibes of northeastern(as a school not the people) and I am thinking about transferring. Hopefully someone can help üòê",1635435352,1,0

Y‚Äôall plz just wear your freaking masks in the common spaces,"I get it, it‚Äôs super annoying and sometimes you just forget or you‚Äôre literally just going to the bathroom but then don‚Äôt act surprised or exasperated when we as RAs have to write you up. I‚Äôm not out here to get you, believe me having to waste my time writing y‚Äôall up for not wearing a mask is the last thing I wanna do. And yes, we are required to write people up for not wearing their masks in the common spaces, these days with no warning bc you‚Äôve literally been told for more than a month that you need to wear your freaking masks in the common spaces. Heck emails were sent out even before you got on campus that you need to wear masks indoors. 

Honestly, I get it, it seems stupid to have to wear masks especially when you‚Äôre sharing the communal bathroom anyway. But I don‚Äôt make the rules and honestly, it‚Äôs just annoying that y‚Äôall are that bothered that you have to wear a mask. As stupid as it may seem even to me, is it really that hard just to wear a mask for the few seconds it takes to get to the bathroom?

Also, ignorance is not an excuse! There are signs everywhere in the common spaces saying you need to wear a mask. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you didn‚Äôt bother to read those signs or any of the many emails that were sent out. It also doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre six feet apart or there‚Äôs nobody else there or you live together. You just need to wear an f-ing mask in the common spaces ok?

Pros: I get at least one summer semester off during my remaining years at Northeastern, more room for internships in the future, freshman year is optimal because after taking classes during summer 1, I plan to go on a 5 week dialogue, meaning that I‚Äôll still have time to relax before sophomore year 
Cons: no internship freshman year (but i plan on hopefully doing research this spring), my fall and spring course load will be loaded with harder classes

-waiting until a summer semester after junior year to complete 2 harder courses 
Pros: eases my workload in the fall and spring, i can do an internship freshman year
Cons: I would be into classes and then a co-op right after

I guess I should also take into consideration that summer classes condense 15 weeks worth of material into 8 weeks, which can be good or bad depending on the class
