"My advice:

1. put yourself on multiple waitlists now.

2. Email the professors who teach the course/the department offering the course, see if there's anything they can do

Ah yeah since you’re out of state the tuition is nuts. Look up if any schools near you are more reasonably priced and can transfer credits. Otherwise you just have to wait till the first week of classes because people should drop,1577754695,1,0
I have to take chem 111 with it too. That class is like 3 hours. I was decent at chemistry in high school so maybe I’ll be alright.,1577754543,1,0

"For an employer it's a huge pain to deal with international students because the first barrier is having to show that there are no US nationals who are suitably qualified for the job and that only international students are the only choice.  The obvious reason why employers want the internationals is because they'll accept lower compensation which is a moral and ethical issue of its own.

The other reason is exactly what you stated somewhat indirectly.  The internationals can basically pay their own way since they're required to have a certain amount of money.  They can take jobs but not really care since they can simply ask their family for money if it doesn't work out unlike the Americans who pretty much have to work since they need the money.

We could go into the issues of language and cultural difficulties which do make a difference in hiring, but again, that's another issue well beyond the scope of this topic.",1577675628,2,0

"Haha good. I can’t advise too much on that because I went the grad school route but a bunch of folks in my program went to med school.

I know they had to be more proactive during summers to shadow clinicians in their hometowns because the med center in State College doesn’t really do that and isn’t large.

"This isnt a question that strangers on the internet can really help with. You have to make the call as to which major you want to do in undergrad; you can always change it once you’re at a school but your choice in school may influence strength of other program options if you do want to change. I’ve seen people go to med school from various majors so I don’t think one major is better than another as long as you get the requirements you need done (a minor is a good way to achieve this). We also don’t know the other factors in your life that influence education choices: how close do you want to be to family, school size preference, etc. 

Guess my only advice is at this point start considering what you want in a school besides simply quality education. Both schools offer that.",1577659254,2,0

"The term ""sponsorship"" refers to sponsoring a H or EB visa - i.e. the company needs to apply (""sponsor"") these visas on the applications behalf. This does not apply to international students applying to internships.

As a student on F-1 or J-1, you only need a letter offering you employment and possibly authorization from your school's DSO. You then need to apply for the paperwork yourself; then get a SSN and provide these documents to the company to verify your employment authorization. For internships during the academic semester, things are a little more complicated but you still do not require a sponsor.

"I'm a senior and have struggled with the same thing overall in college. I came from a branch campus, so it was even worse because I was not here as a freshman and never formed a group of close friends. 

One thing I will recommend is that if you are invited to socials and parties, go (as long as they're not ridiculously stupid, out of control ones). Just don't drink. I'm in the same boat; I choose not to consume alcohol. And for the longest time, I had nowhere to even go because I struggled making friends and contacts here. But eventually, when I had the chance to go to some parties, I went and was glad I did because it was still a way to interact with people, and I was surprised to meet other people who weren't drinking either. I wish things would have gone differently for me earlier on because now I'm feeling much better about my social life, but now I only have a semester and a half left! So don't keep putting off creating a social life. It takes hard work for introverts like us...it REALLY does. It's exhausting. But you've got to keep trying, and accept that not every effort to bond with people will be successful. But some along the way will.

Absolutely go to clubs, too. That's huge. Get heavily involved in a couple of clubs. Become an officer eventually in something you're really interested in.

"Sophomore that has a 3.9 gpa, went to every single meeting, mock interviewed seven times with fund managers, basically studied for it like an extra class during the semester, did the case study for second rounds, and did not get in. In the final (second) interview round, I left feeling confident with maybe 2-3 questions I could have answered better but then was rejected. 

It is extremely difficult to get in. I believe it is very critical to know someone in the fund or else you need to be a girl or minority/have some significant story. Important note: they need to keep a quota for how many girls they have in the fund (girls get exclusive women-only breakout meetings and events). So almost all girls who get past the first round will get in. Nevertheless, you can still get in as a guy but just keep in mind that you're fighting an uphill battle",1574612076,1,0
"They lock you out of the dorm during break, meaning your ID won’t work to get back in. 

I imagine they make you pay because for break-access dorms, they still have to have housing employees cleaning and doing maintenance. There’s probably legal issues the university has to deal with if something were to go wrong during break to someone staying the dorms (especially if they weren’t supposed to be there). RAs can’t leave until everyone has left, for instance.

It sucks, but it is what it is. If staying at PSU is something a person will continually have to do, moving off campus as soon as possible is probably a good option.",1574611110,3,0

There wasn't an application or anything, I just got an email one day. Personal, I don't think they would reject you if you said you wanted aid, your SAT score and stuff are pretty good. To give you reference, my day score was around 1500 and my gpa was like 4.0 unweighted. But I have no idea what their threshold for scholarships are. Feel free to ask me anything about the University.",1574603750,1,0

If not, professor probably just feels your lack of commitment is a carryover from last year.  After last years performance, you should have committed to giving 110%.  But you didn’t because you missed multiple classes and waited to the last minute to turn a project in and didn’t follow all directions.  Everyone wants to go home for the holiday break but you claim to have an emergency, which could be 100% legit.  But based on past behavior, professor probably doesn’t believe you.  You’ve created the impression of not giving much of a shit.  So why should he?  Even if you do a 180 degree turnaround, it doesn’t mean everyone automatically forgets past behavior.  Calling for a “do over” is unrealistic. And now you want to report him?  Sorry that you had to learn this lesson the hard way.",1574483412,1,0

"Walk down to the EE building and find a human being. Namely Dave Salvia - if he still has that power. If not, he'll find somebody who does. I guess maybe La Porta? 

&amp;#x200B;

I also had major issues with the advising system (graduated '16). Schreyer had special advisers who covered each major. So when I changed from ME to EE, the department triangle (SHC/ME/EE) ended up leaving me ""homeless"" in terms of advising. Dave Salvia was my advisor, but this was ""impossible."" It was also right around when they change from EE to EECS. So in the not-so-distant past, the advising situation was an absolute clusterfuck. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that, do not forget that you live a 10-minute walk away from the humans that can solve your problems. Salvia and La Porta have an office. Find out when they're there and tell them you can't schedule your classes. They will help you. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the last 5-10 years, they've had several major changes to the way they schedule courses. But the last thing the university wants is people to drop out due to clerical errors. Still, there's not going to be an email that says ""hey you're not on track to finish your major, so we fixed it for you."" You're gonna have to go down to the office and push them to either fix it or tell you who can.

&amp;#x200B;

Another tip: *don't schedule anything if a deadline has passed.* Scheduled meetings are for things that can wait. If you've missed the class scheduling deadline, it cannot wait. At the minimum, schedule a meeting in person. Imagine you're working and your company applies a new system. That system causes a customer to lose a year's worth of profit. They would pay to fly your ass out there to fix it right away. Don't get intimidated by the university, you're paying big money for the degree (or somebody is), so don't just sleep on it until it's too late to fix it.",1573573211,1,0

Yes. Seriously. Just send them a note to use your deposit as the final month's rent, and to send you an itemized invoice for any additional fees, which you promise to pay.

It all comes down to your personal preference. Main campus has more opportunities but is also significantly harder. In my experience as an engineering major and coming from a branch campus I went from a 3.9 gpa to a 3.0. However my work ethic has significantly improved from attending main campus. I used to procrastinate and study the night before and get A's at a branch campus. Now I start studying a week before just to get a B if i'm lucky.

"Nobody will care once you get your first job or two. You will probably meet a lot of Penn Staters and you may not be able to relate to some experiences on campus.

Getting your first job though is a very important step after college. It’s much easier to network with companies at main campus because they go to the career fairs and such at main campus. They visit clubs, hold career building type events, and generally do other student engagements throughout the year. There are a ton of interviews held each year at UP around these events. These are probably major dependent so may not be 100 percent applicable to you.

From an experience perspective, you find what you want out of college. From a cost perspective I don’t know what makes sense. From a perspective of having the best opportunities to network and job hunt, I think UP wins out by a mile.",1573507469,1,0

For example, I majored in business and going to Smeal at UP gave me more networking opportunities, more variety of majors, and better job preparation and training.

There are lots of programs listed in there, many by well respected people that are either bulking or cutting, including nutrition plans, exercise plans, and Q&amp;A's. 

There are also idiots in there that troll, but if you're polite, and do some searches first, you'll likely find what you're looking for. And if you don't, they have sections for beginners to help give some pointers.

The number of posts there are mind boggling huge, so if you can't find it there you won't find it anywhere. Just apply the concepts, techniques, and nutrition, to what is available on campus (almost everything should be), and use an app like myfitnesspal, jefit, nike, or whatever fits your budget, as they go from free to pricey.

You might also be able to use your cell phone, or a $10 pedometer, to keep track of your distance. No need for anything fancy to count steps, aside from $10, a little journal, and a pen, to keep track of foods and exercise routines.

My 1st term was Summer '70...  And although that might sound like ancient history, I'm sure summer life at PSU hasn't changed THAT much....  Still mostly freshmen in East Halls (I was in 708 Snyder)  Everybody still eats in Findlay...  Other residential areas are mostly closed for the summer, although some may temporarily host large groups of people for whatever summer ""camp"" or ""convention"" they may be attending....  
Campus is slow &amp; relaxing compared to the hustle &amp; bustle of the regular school year...  It's GREAT!   The absolute best time to be in State College....  Take the time to get out, walk all around &amp; explore it.....

Over top the hoodie sweatshirt you can wear a lighter weight, *waterproof* windbreaker typed jacket to help protect from both the wind and the rain/sleet/snow...

"Looks like it's taking people awhile to comment on this. I don't think there's many people on this subreddit who can remember the old parades. Also, events like these aren't even advertised to commuting students, which I find annoying. If you don't live in a dorm and don't go to the hub often then you'll never see any posters about these things. 

For my first year seminar class we had to meet with foreign grad students. I asked them if PSU homecoming was the same night and every single one of them had no clue what homecoming even was. Watching the floats drive by on campus, I first assumed they were just doing hay rides. It took me awhile to realize they were actually supposed to be part of a parade. 
So to speculate on why it might not be as good as it once was:

Lack of involvement from lack of advertising to new students, 

Frats are less competitive these days, or have less money to spend on these things,

More homework nowadays or the parade was shifted to a bad time of year (this year it was half a week before midterms) so people had less time to pimp out their floats, 

Maybe the parade is more regulated and there are more rules against decking out floats for safety reasons. Maybe more of a regulation on the time frame of the parade. You cant exactly hype things up to every section of the parade if you're on a strict schedule to reach the end.

"Go to CAPS and they give you a few free sessions. But long term you should consider looking for help with a therapist; CAPS can help out with this. But I'm almost certain that CAPS doesn't have the ability to actually prescribe things; they just fill them. I strongly encourage you to approach therapy with an open mind however; medication can be dangerous and sometimes you really do just need to talk to someone about life and don't need medication. I'm not trying to belittle you here, please believe me, I know that medication is often helpful and useful. But they are abusable and can mess with you very badly.

Not sure what kind of situation you're in but both therapy and meds aren't inexpensive. CAPS can help you find therapists within your health insurance network and beyond, but ultimately your parents will notice that the insurance is being used. And speaking as someone who was in a very similar place, once my parents understood I wasn't ok the fact that they knew and were on my side was really helpful for me psychologically and practically. Again, things might be different and you may have reasons for wanting to not share with them, but if you're still dependent and not about to become independent recommend talking with them about it.

"I just checked the syllabus again and those are the only lines that specify submission details. As I’ve read over the emails more I noticed one other thing. I asked if I could have someone hand in my report for me, and he says yes. Then he specifically mentions that the electronic copy is due at 5, which matches with the syllabuses statement about the electronic copy being used as a timestamp.

I was looking at what complaints I can file through Penn State, I will look into filing a complaint on him. He’s retiring after this semester so I feel that’s it’s futile.",1574480324,1,0
"Professor is an ass. 10% deduction for hard copy coming in 20 minutes late due to needing to leave campus? Ridiculous. Toughest policy I've ever seen from any of my professors is like a 5% reduction for being 1 day late. I don't have any real advice for you other than maybe keep trying to resolve it with the professor by calmly explaining your personal situation and why you feel you did the best you could. Professor sounds like an asshole, but don't tell him that. Factor that into the SRTEs though.",1574480191,1,0
"That excerpt from the syllabus is unclear - the purpose of the explicit time stamp is to decide whether or not a project is late and by how many days. On the other hand, this would render the requirement to submit a hard copy as well somewhat meaningless. Perhaps this is clarified elsewhere. (Frankly I can be a stickler for details as well, but for a student clearly trying to play by the rules, why not just spend the 1min on printing- the electronic copy is only for plagiarism detection anyway.)

Personally I find some of the instructor’s comments in the conversation odd and frankly unnecessary. Typically I’d encourage a fact-based conversation with the instructor, but not so sure whether this person would be responsive to this, so perhaps a well reasoned complaint that the instructor is not following the syllabus with the undergraduate chair may be appropriate.",1574479401,1,0

He's looking to play hardball here because he thinks you'll just take it laying down. If you take it to the department head, then at least you made it not so worthwhile to act like a hardass to students. Remember to be respectful and not passive aggressive or sarcastic until after this blows over. If you come off as rude in any way while emailing your professor then he's just going to show it to the department head to make you look less credible and honest.

"So as you've mentioned in your email, his syllabus says one thing and he does another (electronic time stamp of assignment submission). Send him an email letting him know that he isn't following his own syllabus, or at the very least that his syllabus is ambiguous. Then tell him that you're going to bring the matter to the leaders of whichever department he's in. Make sure that he needs to worry about explaining himself to his superiors over thanksgiving break. Schedule a meeting or correspondence with the department heads and express your concerns. Inevitably, they'll drag him into it via email, phone call, or better yet, an in person meeting. Plus points if this correspondence happens over break. Worst thing to do in this scenario is to refrain from taking any kind of action and just swallowing this bullshit from him.",1574471010,1,0

I'd called maintenance (the only functioning numbers at 6pm on a Sunday night) when I found the situation as was (and you're right, I should have snapped photos, but I was in incredible pain and exhausted), and they said they'd get back to me right away. After an hour, I gave up waiting, parked the SUV in, and slowly walked to my apartment. I still hadn't heard anything from the office after midnight, at which point, I sent a very long, detailed letter to the office.

And despite me parking him/her in, I didn't get towed. I didn't get a ticket or a warning or anything. They just asked me to move my car when I was able, which I did almost as soon as they asked.
