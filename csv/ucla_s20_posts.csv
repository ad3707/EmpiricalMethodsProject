Datamatch is now live at UCLA!,"Datamatch is a free matchmaking service created for college students by college students to find true love. This year, we've brought Datamatch to 25+ universities across the country, **including UCLA!** 

**How does it work?**

Just sign up at [datamatch.me](https://datamatch.me/), create an online profile, and take a (super hilarious, in our opinion) survey written by us brilliant Cupids. Then, on Valentine's Day, your (romantic or platonic) matches will be \*magically\* revealed, and you can proceed as you please: ignore them, slide into their DMs, or wave awkwardly across the lecture hall. It's up to you.

**Sample survey question:**

Which one fell the fastest for you this year?   
A) Your GPA.  
B) The air quality index during fire season.  
C) Your sense of school pride after losing to USC.  
D) Your professor‚Äôs bruinwalk rating.

We hope you have lots of fun signing up, taking the survey, and meeting your matches (maybe one of them may turn out to be The One‚Ñ¢?). Drop any questions you have below and we'll be sure to answer!",1581200798,1,0
Midterm Score Physics 1B,Hey yall. I'm a physics major taking 1B w/ Gutperle rn. I got my midterm score and it was a 74/95 when the median was 76/95 (mean was 72 I think). I really wanna get an A in this class (or at least an A-) because it's my major and I already got a B in physics last quarter. I am already below the median on the first test so I'm already freaking out. Does anyone have any tips on how to improve to an A or am I basically screwed?,1581196741,1,0
Written consent for UWC to advise on take-home essay/midterm,"I‚Äôm trying to schedule an appointment with the Undergraduate Writing Center to go over the grammar and structure of my take home midterm essay.

When I select this it says ‚Äúplease be advised that the UWC can only work with you on take-home midterms and finals a if we have the express written consent of your instructor‚Äù. 
I think my professor allows this because he suggested we visit the center in the beginning of the quarter. How do I provide written consent? Do I write him an email asking if he consents to this and then forward it to them or can I just bring a piece of paper of him writing he consents on the day of my appointment? 

Basically, do I need to provide consent right away or can I provide it on the day of and in what format?

"I turned down UCLA 4 years ago, but wonder what could have been. What was your experience?","I am originally from the west side in LA, so UCLA was the last UC I wanted to go to when after being accepted to all of them. I went to field trips in grade school at UCLA, got my braces there, and had plenty of teachers who went there. I felt done with UCLA before I would have even started! 

 I chose UCSB for the beach, social scene, and a more relaxed environment. It is not as renowned (and the campus itself is nowhere near as beautiful as UCLA's architecture), but I had great years at UCSB and I am wrapping up my last quarter. I never would have grown in the ways I have if I stayed in my hometown for college. However,  I actually wonder what my experience would have been like at UCLA as my school journey is coming to a close.

What has your UCLA experience been like? Living in Westwood? I would love to hear from anyone, but it would especially be awesome to hear from fellow seniors or graduates who have moved on.

The Department of Psychological Science at the University of California, Irvine is currently accepting applications to our post-baccalaureate program in psychological science (the deadline to apply for Fall 2020 is May 22nd).¬†

**Program** **Overview:**¬†¬†UCI‚Äôs Post-Baccalaureate Program in Psychological Science is a certificate program that combines psychology coursework with research and/or internship experience. It is designed for people who have a bachelor‚Äôs degree (in any discipline); who are interested in a psychology-related graduate program, career development, or career change; and who could benefit from additional coursework, research and/or real-life work experience in psychology. Those interested in doctoral-level or master‚Äôs degree programs in a range of areas of psychology (including clinical/counseling psychology, social/personality psychology, developmental psychology, health psychology, psychology &amp; the law, and school psychology) or health (e.g., public health, medical school) can strengthen their graduate school applications by completing our program, which offers an individualized course of study based on each person‚Äôs qualifications and goals.¬†¬†Students who have completed our program have been accepted to a wide variety of graduate programs, including Ph.D. programs at UC Berkeley, Cornell University, and UC Irvine; Psy.D. programs at Cal Lutheran, University of Indianapolis, and Yeshiva University, and Master's programs at NYU, Columbia, and UCLA.

**Program** **Description:**¬†¬†The program consists of eight courses, which may include lower- and upper-division lectures, small seminars (including advanced statistics and research methods), hands-on research lab courses, and/or hands-on internship courses.¬† The program can be completed at the student‚Äôs own pace, in as little as 9 months or in as many as 24 months, depending upon one‚Äôs schedule and preferences.¬† A faculty advisor will work closely with students to help plan courses and provide guidance on obtaining letters of recommendation, choosing graduate programs, writing personal statements, and applying for jobs.¬† In addition, students will have the opportunity to attend our weekly departmental colloquia and other special events and to interact with our community of faculty, researchers, and graduate students.¬† For more¬†information, please visit:¬†[https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/post-bacc-page/post-baccalaureate-program-psychological-science](https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/post-bacc-page/post-baccalaureate-program-psychological-science)

I hate taking photos, especially when it's NOT consensual. I also hate how she just ruined my day. And now all I want to do is cry in my room and never leave it, to feel safe.

UCLA recent Alumni life update,"Hi,

I‚Äôm a recent UCLA grad from class of 2019 and I feel like I wasted my UCLA education. Btw, for perspective, I‚Äôm a 23 yr old male. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I had a pretty good experience at Ucla, probably better than a few others but I did not prepare whatsoever for life after UCLA and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here now, telling you all so you don‚Äôt make the same mistake as me. I hope this post doesn‚Äôt come off as me bitching or complaining but rather give perspective on my life advice and for one who seeks advice. 

A few details about my life @ the numero uno institution in the county. I joined a semi crappy fraternity my first fall quarter 2015 and essentially had most of my friends from there. I made a few outside friends but nothing too meaningful outside it and never really got involved in much else, albeit a meaningless internship and campus job. I also was a pretty heavy drinker and pot smoker who wasted most of my college days doing, you guessed it, those ‚Äúactivities.‚Äù I mean I also had a few hookups and booty calls, but I also regret not forming any relationships but that‚Äôs a story for another day. Once again, I apologize for my rambling. 

I graduated in, once again, you guessed it political science and actually had a pretty respectable gpa, 3.7, but I mean I was a north campus major so anything below 4.0 will get shamed lol. Anyways, I never made any professional connections, relationships with professors etc. Got a couple recommendation letters from TAs from 2016, but that‚Äôs it. And I kinda just went with the flow until I graduated, enjoyed my summer break, then quickly realized I was royally fucked with $50k in student debt, living in my parents house and sharing a room with my little brother. Not what I thought would happen after graduating from UCLAAAA, but here we are. (:

I knew I wasn‚Äôt thattt much of a p.o.s where I wouldn‚Äôt do shit with my life so I acted quickly and got a job as an instructional aid at my local elementary school but the pay is minimal and I‚Äôm working with old ladies and college kids who are enrolled in the nearest community college and mostly to themselves. Not necessarily my cup of tea. 

So enough rambling I come here in a two fold post. One to give advice, on NOT to be like me and not have a clear, concise and proactive plan on what to do once you‚Äôre outta school and to really make each day at UCLA worth it because it fucking flies by!! but I mean you‚Äôre all bruWins so you‚Äôll prob have better outlooks than mine. I‚Äôm so cynical, I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs just who I am, I‚Äôm trying to change!!!

Secondly, I come seeking advice from my fellow bruWins on what I can do to get out of this hole. My family is nice and there are a few aspects that I do like living back here, but the overlying part of me hates it here, did not think I‚Äôd end up back in this position after succeeding in most aspects of my life before now. I plan to move out but feel defeated as I‚Äôm in so much debt and only making $12 an hour.. I‚Äôve applied for some other jobs in my local courthouse which pay around $30K a year, but to no avail.

Thinking of just mass applying, trying to network in some way but using Glassdoor, Handshake, etc. Just seems like a useless process.. so pls some recommendations? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, must be kinda cringeworthy but keep Westwood warm for me and Fight! Fight! Fight! 

Much love.

Hlushchanka (and maybe math 33A in general) Tips,"Hi, for everyone who is taking Hlushchanka this quarter, here is what worked best for me in the class and how I tackled prepping for midterms and the final, and attributed to my relative success in the class. Disclaimer: Your mileage may vary.

Source: Took Hlushchanka in Spring 19 and got a B+, even though in the beginning I was as lost as much as most, if not all, of the people who are taking it now feel.

* Go to office hours. I can't emphasize this enough. If you can't go to his office hours, go to your TA's. If you can't, go to another TA's. If you can't make any of these, go to the Student Math Center. Personally, I did all of these I could from Week 3 on. Ask about questions from the HW, any practice tests you've taken, problems from the textbook, or about anything from the lecture.
* Read the textbook before/after lecture. The textbook provides good examples and is another source of clarification. Since Hlushchanka does go fast during lecture, reading it before will help you keep up.
* Focus on concepts rather than computations. While there are a lot of computations regarding change of bases and stuff, the calculations all boil down to just solving systems of equations and matrix multiplication. There's no use continuing to practice these if you don't know where to apply them and what matrices to use. When reviewing for the midterms and finals, I did more conceptual problems rather than computations. Always ask ""why do we do this?"" or ""how does this work?""
* Review the fundamentals. Everything in this class is connected somehow, so if you have a gap in your understanding somewhere, it gets very difficult to do things later, unless you are a god at memorizing the ways to solve every problem of every type.
* Ask questions during lecture. I know he comes off rude, but in my experience asking questions, Hlushchanka was always really nice and gave good explanations on things I didn't know. On the other end of this, please don't ask right now stuff like ""what is the image of a matrix?"" You should've asked that a while ago to be honest. If you ask thoughtful questions or need clarification (for something he said recently), there is no reason to be afraid.
* Watch the Linear Algebra series by 3blue1brown on YouTube. It helps a lot for understanding concepts.

Also, side note, I know Hlushchanka has sort of a bad rep among everyone and I won't deny that his class is difficult, but reflecting after taking his class, I think he is a really good teacher (especially if you are a math major) and he is definitely more fair than most. The fact that he goes super fast in the beginning is to make a lot of time to explain stuff like eigenvalues and eigenvectors. He also spends a good amount of time reviewing at the end of the term (from what he did during my time taking him). His pace is similar to the linear algebra upper division class I am taking now (which is basically teaching everything from 33a but with proofs).

I think a lot of the hate on him is the relative difficulty of the material of 33A and how different it is from every math class. It's very conceptual rather than calculations, e.g. the 32 series and 33b, so it can feel frustrating. Personally, I think the difficulty of math classes here goes 33A &gt; 32A &gt; 32B &gt; 33B rather than the commonly accepted 32B &gt; 33A &gt; 33B &gt; 32A.

Anyways, good luck with the class! I actually really enjoyed it (I distinctly remember enjoying the tests, believe it or not). If you have any questions, PM me or leave a comment and I'll try to respond to everyone.",1582238918,1,0

Since I haven't paid and the deadline has passed, there is now a hold on my classes and I can't drop a class. If I don't drop it by Friday, I will have a notation on my transcript which I really do not want.

Tips for avoiding germs in public places,"Hi y'all! I've seen a # of posts worried about the corona virus, so I just want to make a list of things that can help avoid getting some germs and protect you perhaps:

\- Carry handsanitizer

\- Cover your mouth when you cough and sneeze by utilizing the elbow method or sneezing INTO the inside of your shirt/ sweater. 

\- Wash your hands every time you utilize the restroom. Also wash before eating or handling food. 

\*Best hand-washing method: Wet hands first with water. Place a few pumps of soap in the palm of   
your hand. Rub hands together thoroughly for 20 seconds (make sure soap is in between fingers,   
etc.). Wash hands with water for 15-20 seconds. Turn off faucet (if not a sensor-based faucet) by   
using your wrist- not your actual hand. If possible, wash 2x\*

\- When exiting the restroom, pull the door handle with paper towels and dispose of them right after.

\- If a door has a handle/ knob: pull such knob/handle with the sleeve of your sweater, not your hand. If the door requires you to push it open, don't open it with your hand- push the door with the side of your arm. 

\-If using the elevator: push buttons with the sleeve of your sweater/ long-sleeve. Avoid using hands/ fingers. If you touch button with hands/ fingers, wash your hands or use sanitizer.

\- Avoid touching your face, mouth, and eyes. 

\- If possible, wear a disposable mouth mask. 

\- If possible, use sanitizing wipes to sanitize your phone, bruincard, dorm door handle, laptop, etc. 

\- (If possible) If you have been out for a number of hours, do not re-wear any piece of clothing you are wearing. Place in hamper to wash. 

\- If feeling sick/ under the weather, please visit the ASHE center ASAP. Whether you have a cold, flu, or even allergies, it is important for you to be checked up. If you are super duper sick, please stay in- for the well-being of yourself and for others. 

Take care everyone!",1580092540,1,0
COPE Health Scholars vs Care Extenders program at UCLA,"So I am currently at a crossroads about which program I should choose. My choice was COPE Health Scholar even though it is expensive but after reading some reviews about the program I don't know if I should join it or Care Extenders. Most reviews about CE were positive but for COPE,  scholars had a very negative outlook as the amount of money spent did not reflect the experience they got and on top of that the management is very poor.  I would like some opinion from people who have been in either program and which one I should join. Please be honest as I am afraid to join a program for which I have spent so much money and not get a good experience. Thank you so much in advance!",1580091519,1,0

Context on the IFC thread and a safe space to discuss sexual assault on campus,"Hi Bruins, I wanted to address the post about the Phi Psi frat and give a little bit of an explanation about how things were handled on our end. The moderator that was active at the time made a judgment call that because the accusations against a specific group in the post were difficult to verify, the post should be removed at least until we as moderators had a chance to discuss how this should be handled. 

Here is our consensus: it is of the utmost importance that sexual assault on campus is discussed and that the conversation is allowed to proceed. If even a single person is helped by talking about this issue, it is worth it. Which is why we are trying to provide this space for as open a discussion as possible. 

The one caveat that must be observed is that this isn't not the appropriate venue to make public accusations. Please please please, if you or someone you know is a victim of sexual assault please reach out to UCPD. Their phone number is (310) 825-1491 and they will hear you out and hopefully get the assholes responsible locked away. 

Due to reddit's rules against witchhunting, our hands are tied to a certain extent about these difficult to verify accusations. For instance, accusing a particular group of sexual assault will have to be removed, however sharing a reputable, investigated news story about the large number of alleged sexual assaults a certain frat has been accused of is acceptable. [For instance, here is a well written Daily Bruin article about Phi Kappa Psi ""allegations of sexual assault committed by one of the fraternity members"" and how ""The member accused of sexual assault has since been removed from the fraternity but still lives in the house"" as of April 25th, 2019.](https://dailybruin.com/2019/04/24/campaign-responding-to-fraternity-sexual-assault-allegations-urges-for-reform/) And here's[ another great Daily Bruin article about ""UCLA‚Äôs reluctant response to rise of reported sexual assaults""](https://dailybruin.com/2019/10/08/uclas-reluctant-response-to-rise-of-reported-sexual-assaults-requires-reform/) These are examples of articles that we can and are happy to allow on the sub.

I apologize about the delay on our response to the issue here. We take this topic very seriously and wanted to make sure we had a chance to discuss how best to handle things moving forward. Please use this thread as a place to discuss and share resources about we can effectively deal with the growing problem of sexual assault on campus. And as always, we welcome your feedback and are happy to dialogue with you all on how we as a subreddit should approach these difficult topics.",1580085023,1,0

Phi Psi Member here to clear the record,"It's kind of a joke how people on this sub can just eat up all these lies about Phi Psi. I thought UCLA was supposed to teach you all how to think critically? First of all, the fact is there are a lot of bitter people who are vested in seeing the downfall of greek life because they didn't get a bid. In other words, their sick little twisted fantasy is to spread rumors and tarnish our reputation because they couldn't make the cut. It happens every year and this year is no different. Unsubstantiated rumors from alt accounts defaming our reputation and character doesn't surprise me at all.

Second, there could be legal ramifications to speaking on these things in such a thoughtless and carefree manner. I'd recommend to anyone on this sub to tread lightly. We do have a legal team that is not afraid to take action against defamation.

Third, about the whole IFC thing: there may be a number of brothers on the council, but rest assured that would not prevent anyone who was accused of such horrible things from facing justice. Law enforcement gets involved and investigates these claims. So to try to paint the IFC as having more power than the local authorities to sweep this under the rug is asinine.

Have there been some allegations against us? You bet. But please know that we've always taken the proper steps to ensure that anybody who was harmed could receive due process. In the meantime, we've demonstrated a history of expelling members who have had claims against them to be found true. There is zero tolerance for that kind of shit in our house. We don't want it here; we don't welcome it. Everyone needs to understand this.

It is our goal it ensure that guests at all house feel safe and respected at all times. The past few years we have instituted new regulations to ensure this. Many of these new rules have been the brainchild of fellow brothers who serve on the council: we're talking SELF-IMPOSED rules here. So, if anybody is interested in mitigating these problems, it is definitely us.

Any allegations that were proven to be true effects shock and outrage in each and every one of us. We have no problem cutting ties with those who victimize women. And we fully cooperate with any and all investigations. I've personally talked to several people at the national level to discuss ideas and strategies as how to end these types of incidents.

If you are found to be guilty, regardless of whether you're a brother or not, you will face justice. Both in and out of the house. There's no ifs, ands, or buts about that. We have never swept anything like that under the rug. 

I will say however, that you shouldn't all take very claim against us at face value. While I concede that there have horrible incidents that turned out to be true, some of them have in fact been fabricated or exaggerated as a method of saving face. I know it's unpopular to say this, but it's the truth. I will be totally transparent about what we've been accused of, but that goes BOTH way. The fact is that some of these claims have been made up; they're lies. 

Finally, I just want to remind everyone that as an organization has exited on this campus for 90 years.  We have made tremendous contributions to the school:

\&gt;  Phi Kappa Psi continue to set the standard of what it means to be Bruin. Over the past couple years, our chapter has won ¬†Pi Beta Phi‚Äôs Arrow Spike Philanthropy twice, Delta Gamma‚Äôs Anchor Splash Relay, Alpha Delta Pi's Lion's Cup and made the championship game of Kappa Alpha Theta‚Äôs Shootout Philanthropy. One of our brothers is also the reigning 2018 Alpha Phi Sorority Mr. Greek Sweetheart. 

In addition, we have dozens of our brothers involved in community service projects on campus that serve the needs of the underprivileged and marginalized. This group of gentleman are exemplary of what it means to hold true bruin values. This smear campaign will not bring us down.

UCLA vs UWaterloo CS,"I was recently admitted UCLA CS. While I was initially very excited to go, I have read numerous stories online and from a current CS major there about how the course is overly theoretical and teaches outdated technologies, has less course rigour than other school's CS programs, lacks startup culture and overall is not extremely well regarded in CS. I was also told you are forced to take a lot of low quality engineering courses as the CS course is in the department of engineering. 

However, I have heard that it is possible to get into top tech firms if you are willing to work hard and look for opportunities (though this appears to be the case from any university), and therefore good internships and job opportunities can be found at UCLA.

I am currently waiting for an offer from the University of Waterloo, which I have heard has a very strong co-op program and is very well connected into Silicon Valley. Further, as an international student, the costs of tuition, room and board at Waterloo are about 18000USD a year cheaper than UCLA. It is possible to earn money in co-op terms at Waterloo which further offsets its cost, however I have heard it is also possible to earn a substantial amount of money doing internships at UCLA, though these are typically only found from sophomore year onwards. Due to co-op, the CS program at Waterloo is 5 years long compared to 4 years at UCLA, which means I would be paying for school for longer, but would have two years of work experience.

Would anyone care to shed on light on reasons to or not to pick UCLA in this situation, assuming I get an offer from UWaterloo. My end goal is to work at large tech firms in Silicon Valley.",1585447135,1,0

UCB EECS vs. UCLA Engineering - how to weigh student life vs. academics and post-graduation?,"Hi! I'm having a hard time deciding between Berkeley and UCLA as an undergraduate Engineering major.

I got into Berkeley for Undeclared Engineering (which would turn into EECS probably), and UCLA for Mechanical Engineering, except I'm looking to take CS classes or even switch to a CS major there.

After talking to several students at both colleges, it's become clear that UCLA's student life is superior, when it comes to the social environment, housing, food, etc. It seems that by going to Berkeley, I'm sacrificing all of that just for a slightly better education and more clout as an EECS graduate. My main question is: how much does the university I graduate from really matter in the job market? Do interviews and resumes (previous work experience) matter more or less? Is an employer going to inherently prefer a Berkeley graduate over a UCLA graduate if both students studied in the same major? And most importantly, if I'm sure that I'd be happier at UCLA, is it worth it to go to Berkeley just for the better post-graduation situation?¬†

(Also, on that note, if anyone knows anything about the amount of engineering or technology work/internship opportunities in the Bay Area vs. LA, that'd help me make a more informed decision. My initial thoughts are that there isn't a big difference because both cities are huge and have a lot of tech startups, but I know nothing.)

I cheated on my math final,"Yes, I'll admit it, I cheated. This is not the first time, either. It's funny though, part of me is relieved that I got caught: I will no longer have to spend restless nights worrying about potential consequences. Potentiality has turned into reality and now I await my fate.

God only knows what will happen. This time last year I faced a similar dilemma ‚Äì either turn myself in to confess or hope that I could slip through the cracks of the investigation and get away scot-free. I chose the former. And, fortunately for me, I was given a second chance. I highly doubt there will be a third. There will be no mercy this time.

I know; I did not learn my lesson from last time and, ultimately, wholly deserve what is coming.

I used Chegg for my math final and, any minute now, will receive an email confirming my involvement. My IP address is waiting only to be discovered and traced back to me. The evidence is definitive, I cheated. There is no fighting it now; what‚Äôs done is done. I know that this will not end well, not in the slightest. 

I don‚Äôt know why I did it. I have no clue why I wasted a second chance. I guess my penchant for exhilaration got the best of me. Perhaps it came from an illusion of invincibility: having gotten away with it once triggered my hunger to be audacious. I needed to push the boundaries. 

Perhaps in another life I was a gambling addict. Maybe I simply needed to feel alive: to teeter the fence between boredom and danger. But alas, I could not keep my balance. And the ramifications will be soon felt. 

Pity me if you will, but I do not seek your pity. I simply share with you my mistakes so that future students may avoid my error, lest they end up in the same position as me. 

As for the rest of you guilty of these misdeeds, I wish you good luck. Our IP addresses are logged and there is no point in fighting it. We cheated. And now, it's only a matter of time. 

Sorry again. I do not know what awaits me but I would like to thank everyone for being so helpful. Take care now.

Admitted! Please help me decide.,"Hello everyone,

I am a high school senior who was recently accepted to UCLA as a chemistry major! I am very excited and grateful for this amazing opportunity. I was also accepted to the engineering school at UW (I live in Seattle), which I am considering as well.

Here are some pros and cons of UCLA:

Pros:

\- The limitless opportunities of UCLA and Los Angeles I would take advantage of.

\- I want to explore different parts of the country, meet new people, and have new experiences. I am getting quite sick of Seattle.

\- Like I mentioned just above, I do not want to live in Seattle when I am older -- though UW is prestigious and well-known, I plan on attending graduate school, and a degree from UCLA could possibly open more doors.

\- Food.

\- Weather.

Cons:

\- Out of state-tuition.

\- I was admitted to an interdisciplinary honors program at UW (this is not a con of UCLA, but it makes UW a very attractive school, as the honors program is extremely selective and would make my experience at UW more of a small, tight-knit community feel).

I want to know if anyone has any insight over why I should pick UCLA over UW. I'm sure there are so many things I'm forgetting and some first-hand info would be helpful. I am feeling very conflicted, all help is appreciated.

Thanks!",1585424712,0,0
UCLA Extension (DCA) as an undergrad?,"Hi Bruins! I'm a current HS senior (rip) &amp; was recently accepted to UCLA.

**However**, I recently discovered the UCLA Extension Design Communication Arts certificate program that seems to be what I'm looking for. I was wondering if anyone had experience with taking this program as an undergrad. I'm planning to major in political science and would love to partake in the DCA program if it's manageable/affordable. The affordability is very important too: USC is currently about $15k more per year for me than UCLA is right now, but I'm wondering if taking the UCLA Extension classes would close that gap.

I get the need to keep this disease from spreading and I agree that shutting down these facilities, where a lot of people congregate, will help in limiting spread. But the way that UCLA has implemented these policies shows that the administration is really incompetent. 

After refusing to suspend in-person classes for so long, UCLA suddenly decides to go forward with it and announces that it would suspend in-person classes for two weeks. Yet none of the faculty were given training or support to conduct online classes and migrate exams online. As a current TA, it was extremely inconvenient to suddenly shift everything online and coordinate with the professor and students.

Can we all email the LS core to reconsider not making the final mandatory?,"Recently saw from UCLA's IG story that UCLA Academic Senate is asking faculty to consider when administering finals:

1.) Offer alternate assessment options

2.) Allow students to opt-out of the final and receive the grade they've earned up to that point

3.) Allow students who take the final to receive either the grade they would've earned up to that point, or the grade including the final

4.) Extend due dates

However, I personally don't think that the LS core is being considerate of these points as they're literally forcing us to take the final exam online as scheduled and also have given little to no information as to how to prepare for the final exam. With all of the chaos that has occurred over the past few days, I personally think that the LS core is not very considerate of the various situations that many students are going through as so many students have to deal with the fact that they have to move out since spring quarter is online and honestly final exams are the last things on anyone's mind as of now. Hopefully if they see this message and if we keep emailing this they will reconsider and make the final optional",1584404716,3,0

Mgmt 1a - Why does Gardner actually suck,"
Tldr: dont take Gardner, she sucks; me angy and stressed Ôºà‚óû‚Ä∏‚óüÔºâ




For future bruins considering taking this class, DONT TAKE GARDNER. This is gonna be a rant sorry lol

Yes, she is a good lecturer and yes, of course she has her pros BUT after taking her this quarter and recent things she has done, I need to blow off some steam here. 


This woman, even during normal operating hours of UCLA, consistently shows up to her 30 minute office hours (before class at 9:30am), 10-15 minutes late. Everytime I ask a question she does this thing where she stares at me, and  responds super slowly like I'm stupid. In class one day she was talking about tax benefits and stuff like Social Security and she turns to an Asian kid who looked a little confused and she said, ""yeah we do this in America."" 



LIKE WHAT????? What if he was Asian American why did she assume that he was an international student just because he looked Asian??? I don't even know if she realized she was being insensitive. 




She made it so difficult to view midterms giving us three hours and the line went on forever because some people took forever, and when she was asked to give us more time to view, she challenged us and asked whether we prioritized the class over our other obligations. Like we have other classes and we have our own schedule, and we were in line it's just we view it one by one and some people took 15+ minutes of the hour and there were 20-30 kids in line. 3 hours for 2 lectures of around 200 kids each is NOT enough. (She later gave us a little more time, but only after backlash.) 




(This is how she responded to Coronavirus) 

She is inconsiderate and did not respond to emails until the day before the exam, which she made 2 hours and you cannot go back once you click forward in your answer. Additionally, she made the test time-sensitive and no extension on when to take it, DESPITE THE FACT THAT SOME STUDENTS NOW HAVE A 10-13 HOUR TIME DIFFERENCE AFTER GOING HOME. Imagine having to wake up at 6:30 AM or 5:30 AM for your fucking exam that is TIME SENSITIVE and DOESNT even allow you to check your work. She's given absolutely NO INFORMATION on the format and what to expect, and sent these emails at the last possible minute. I've been relying on my TA for information, to whom she does not communicate with and are also left in the dark. I'm honestly so frustrated and stressed right now.

This was really all just triggered by how she responded to my email from last Thursday, today: the day of the exam.",1584381058,1,0

Could you help us understand how emotions buffer people against stress experienced by immigrants?  


To participate in this study, you need to be 

1.       1st (International students) or second-generation immigrant and

2.       In college or graduate school

You will only take some short online surveys (25 minutes long). We don't collect any information on immigration status or physical address. 1 in 5 participants will win a $25 Amazon gift card. This study satisfies the criteria for Exempt Research. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Report these idiots in USAC to the Election Board,"Words cannot even begin to describe how frustrated I am with these dumbasses. Props to the original poster who informed everyone of the upcoming proposal and the whistleblower who exposed these clowns. 

Shitposts and memes are fun, but **if you are really serious about abolishing USAC there is no better way than by beating them at their own game**. To really want to raise hell you should file reports with the Election Board. All of the rules and regulations that you can ding them on can be found [here](https://usac.ucla.edu/documents/elections/), and you can report them [here](https://www.uclaelectionsboard.org/). I'm sure there are plenty, and for any of you pre-law folks I'm sure it'll be a fun way to pass the time in quarantine.

When they are caught, guess what's gonna happen? Our good friends over at the Daily Bruin are going to write a couple of lengthy articles about their voter manipulation, and when they apply for a job or grad school the first thing their employers will see when they google their name is an article headline that reads: ""\[IDIOT IN USAC\] forced to resign after accusations of voter manipulation."" That will teach them to get off their high horses and pause their corruption. Now that I think of it, why wait? If you know someone who writes for DB, let them know what's happening. This is really juicy stuff and they have nothing to write about!

And please, for the love of god/science/whatever you believe in, VOTE. They want a high turnout, give them a high turn out. Campaign as passionately as they campaign. From what I remember (it's been a few years), there's never been a majority of campus that actually voted, so all of these proposals pass because its mostly these fuckfaces who vote and none of the rest of campus. Go to [my.ucla.edu](https://my.ucla.edu) and vote from May 4th-8th!

I came to this sub to be even more excited about UCLA and fall further in love with it. Saying I was surprised and disappointed hearing about the undemocratic and unethical functioning of the Student Association would be an understatement.

I have been the leader of my school council, a nationwide literature club, an Interact and a Rotaract Rotary Club, and my soccer team. This, is NOT leadership.

 It hurts my heart to see this evil side of UCLA. I have always thought of it to be a school that stands on compassion and leadership. But both these qualities are a lack in what's been happening to USAC. Oh I am waiting for the downvotes. But before them, I am waiting for the people who are willing, who are willing to fight for what is right and help me do the same. I don't have a political inclination, I just want to stay true- to my morals, my values, and to my school.

WHERE ARE TRUE BRUIN VALUES,"I‚Äôm making this reddit account because some of the stuff being posted on here is ridiculous. If USAC didn‚Äôt exist you‚Äôd probably be spending $1000s more every year on things like tuition, club due, laundry. USAC saves you money!!! 

I know y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want to pay $15 a quarter more. But do you want to pay the thousands of dollars uc regents want you to pay. Cause usac is who‚Äôs been stopping them. Y‚Äôall are quick to go after free stuff but don‚Äôt want to pay your dues. These $15 will specifically be helping the communities that need it the most. I‚Äôm so disappointed that there is no allyship within usac. Think about the Transfer students who don‚Äôt have a transfer resource center. Think about black students who don‚Äôt have a black resource center. Think about Muslim students that don‚Äôt have a prayer space. This money will go to building this things for communities that need space at UCLA. $15 a quarter is a small price to pay. If we come together we can make a difference. Also usac is going to take extra money that they have and make covid relief fund, so no usac isn‚Äôt blowing the extra money. 

This is bigger than you and me. This is what we need to vote for to help those that need it most. I‚Äôm thankful for what usac has done. I‚Äôm thankful for the for the people slate for stepping and running for the people. Usac doesn‚Äôt think about themselves when they make decisions, they do it for the greater good. And go ahead support Orion, support white candidates. But when this school is having a race war, don‚Äôt come to usac for help. 

Please please vote for my friend Naomi for President. She is an absolute queen and cares for the students that need help the most. She will prioritize you over herself. She is the only usac member that does not take a stipend. She is doing this for you not herself. We need a fighter

A friendly reminder to our community to be cognizant of the rules,"Yes, the hot topic at the moment is USAC. But please keep in mind to keep your comments respectful and civil per our subreddit‚Äôs rules. You can still criticize and dissect something without being overly vitriolic about it. At the end of the day, USAC is made up of students just like you and it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that there are actual people behind their titles on USAC. So keep it respectful and and in accordance with the rules.

Moreover, I‚Äôd like to remind all users that downvoting brigades are against the Reddit‚Äôs site wide policies and may result in a permanent ban. While it is not something moderators have much control over, it can indeed be passed along to Reddit Admins who do have more control.

Lastly, while it is my personal philosophy that moderators shouldn‚Äôt interfere too much with discussion and content unless it‚Äôs a clear violation of rules, at a certain point a topic might become oversaturated and take over the front page. Thus, we might create a megathread for all USAC related posts to go into if the current rate of  new USAC threads keeps up. This is simply so that the topic doesn‚Äôt crowd out all other posts and flood the sub. Other questions and topics deserve visibility too.

"Philosophy Majors, which lower-division courses do you think are most representative of the major?","I am currently deciding between two different majors and very interested in Philosophy. I enjoy learning about how to form concise, well-developed arguments, logical thinking, developing critical thinking skills, etc. I have a friend who is a philosophy major and she said that her major helped her learn how to think (well) and that it helps her in anything that she does (she learns anything quickly). However, I am not sure if I would do well with constantly thinking in the abstract, as I have never studied anything like philosophy. I would like to check a class out as a general education requirement to see if it would be a good fit. Any suggestions as to which lower division courses in the major is most representative of what the upper division courses will be teaching me?",1586551525,1,0
"If there is a surge of people running to gut the budget / force transparency / decrease officer stipends for USAC, we need to all vote them into office.","Basically title. If we want to cut to the root of the problem we can't just get heated over every dumb referendum and $2Mil in misappropriated funds, we have to cut down to the root of the problem and vote FOR people who will make permanent change. 

Seriously, their operating budget is huge and they do so little directly for students. Just like Janet Napolitano, their reaction to needing more money is to simply put the squeeze on our wallets rather than even attempt budget cuts or oversight. 

Unfortunately this kind of bloated localized committee isn't uncommon, but the only way to disband it is to consistently turn out for people that want to change it.

USAC Sucks and But Also...,"New student here.  Not too well-versed in the politics (pun intended) of USAC but have been reading through a number of threads about USAC and the grievances you all have been voicing against them.  To make things clear, I find their actions egregious and do not support raising student fees in any capacity.

However, I also find it quite interesting that many of you based on your post histories (and presumably as college students) are left-leaning in your politics.  Do you not realize that advocacy for redistributionist, high-tax policies (both major parties are at fault tbh) is in direct conflict with how you treat this USAC election?  Why don't you complain every time politicians raise taxes on our mostly middle-class parents?  Are any of you experiencing cognitive dissonance from you POV?  Forcing people to pay more and more burdensome taxes across the board is no different from USAC raising mandatory fees.

I hope this doesn't come across as combative.  I just want to hear your perspectives.",1586548878,1,0

Do we have to give back any of our aid if we moved out of housing?,"Hey so I moved out of my housing spring quarter and I could have sworn I read on some email that our refund amount would change by like a value of $600 I think. I received my refund before canceling my housing contract as I canceled my housing pretty late (like March 28). My refund was the normal amount and I have no outstanding balances on my BruinBill account. I have not received any emails asking for me to give back some of my aid. So I was wondering if there was some other way that I was supposed to pay it back or if I should check anything else ?? Also, has everyone else refund amount changed or stayed the same?

BTW all my financial aid is from the Cal Grant and Regent Scholarship, no loans. I receive more than $2000 for the Regent Scholarship because of need; but I thought my need would lower because of I am no longer housing at UCLA. But I think it's highly likely it did not change just because its a scholarship and not a loan

**If you are interested in participating, please fill out the following eligibility survey:** [https://redcap.stanford.edu/surveys/index.php?s=78N8LRAMT9](https://redcap.stanford.edu/surveys/index.php?s=78N8LRAMT9)

**No in-person visits will occur until COVID-19 has resolved**, but portions of this study, including screening and consenting potential participants, can be done remotely online! Eventually, when it's safe to do so, volunteers will need to complete two study visits which will involve a blood draw, a brain MRI scan, and some questionnaires.

Volunteers will also be compensated $150 for their participation!

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me, Isabelle Hack - I'm the ME/CFS Clinical Research Coordinator, and would be happy to go over any concerns you might have! My phone number is (650)-503-4668.

Thank you so much for your time!

GREEK LIFE?,"‚ÄúHi! I'm thinking of going through recruitment this fall, and I was wondering how many girls are usually in a pledge class? Does it vary for each house? I hear there are usually around 1,000 girls who go through formal recruitment, so I was wondering how many girls actually get bids.‚Äù Saw this in an earlier post but it was never answered! 

Also does anybody have tips on joining a sorority? I really want to but I‚Äôm extremely nervous about the whole process because I heard it can get pretty intense. Is it true that looks are definitely a factor? Is it possible get dropped from every sorority? Would LOVE to hear any advice/ insight about the whole process!!!",1586472662,1,0
This community should be ashamed of itself,"Anybody who upvoted the thread about USAC fees should be ashamed of themselves. Anyone who feels that underserved communities on campus don‚Äôt deserve much needed resources should be ashamed of themselves. Anybody who co-signs threads without first checking their facts should definitely be ashamed.

USAC, on other hand, should not be ashamed for anything it is doing right now. No other organization is doing what USAC is doing at the moment to support UCLA students. We have nothing to apologize for or explain.

$15 is NOT is a burdensome amount. To make the argument that $15 is breaking your bank is the ridiculous proposition, not ours. What we want is equality on this campus.

Nobody has gotten back to me since I sent them messages yesterday afternoon.

I‚Äôve talked to my parents about paying the $5k+ in 3 installments but we just can‚Äôt afford that since my mom has been laid off and my dad barely has any work. I don‚Äôt know what to do now. I took a 1.5 years off from UCLA to figure what I want to do with my life but it all feels like the universe is trying to stop me from being happy and getting an education. 

I just feel so miserable and can‚Äôt concentrate in any of my classes or do homework. It‚Äôs all so overwhelming. I just want to be back at UCLA but it feels like it‚Äôs just not meant to be. I‚Äôm tired of my life feeling like it‚Äôs on hold all the time. It all feels so pointless. Like no matter how hard I try nothing even matters.

USAC is once again trying to increase your fees! Vote NO on both referendums May 4-8. This is not the time to increase student fees.,"USAC should honestly be ashamed of itself. [They want to increase student fees by $15.33 for every student.](https://dailybruin.com/2020/04/08/usac-approves-candidates-and-referenda-for-online-spring-2020-election-ballot/) In light of so much uncertainty right now - the fact that we don‚Äôt even know whether we‚Äôll be back on campus in the fall - it is a complete joke that they propose an increase in fees.

Due to COVID-19 many of us are out of work. Many of us are barely scraping by. Many of us have our finances tied up in helping our families. A non-insignificant number of us are financially independent and need every dollar to weather the crisis. And yet, during a time like this, more of our money should go to USAC? The $9 million they collect every year currently isn‚Äôt enough?


Many students are facing severe financial burdens and for them to add to that at a time like this in incredibly poor taste. I mean, are they tone deaf? They should honestly be advocating for lower student fees given that the student body is not even on campus to utilize all the ‚Äúresources‚Äù they offer. They should instead offer a refund on fees. But what do they choose to do? Increase fees! It‚Äôs detestable.

If a significant portion of their programming is not available because of the current pandemic, that suggests that money will remain unspent and available in their budgets. The programming costs have shrunk to almost nothing I assume, with NOBODY on campus, and no resources being offered. Therefore, they should REFUND this unused money back to the students instead of keeping it all and asking for MORE. They cannot he serious right now.

The truth is that USAC relies on low voter turnout and low voter awareness to essentially pass whatever referenda they want. They know most people don‚Äôt pay attention, and know whatever they put on the ballot is almost guaranteed to pass. When they‚Äôre the only people voting, they get what they want.

Be that as it may, the student body is NOT a blank check. You cannot shake us down for more money at will to fund vague ‚Äúnew‚Äù programs that 90% of the student body will never know, use or hear about.

The fact that USAC wants to increase student fees when one of their offices [refuses to account for $2,000,000 in funding is absurd.](https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/14/public-information-is-lacking-for-over-2-million-used-by-two-campus-committees/) They don‚Äôt even have their finances in order, yet they want another half million dollars to add to their already inflated coffers? Are you kidding?

Please spread the word and vote NO on both referendums starting May 4. Don‚Äôt let USAC get away with it this time. They‚Äôre counting on low voter turnout and awareness to get this passed when everyone is distracted. But this time we‚Äôll be prepared! Please keep USAC accountable.

Shame on USAC.",1586458098,16,0

Is it fair for me to ask for a small portion of the rent from the person who is subleasing from my roommate in this situation?,"a close friend and I lived together this year. Unfortunately, school is online for the rest of the quarter and our apt company is not giving anybody refunds (as they are with ppl on the Hill). So basically we're paying for a room that we're not using, because both my roommate and I are back w/ our families away from that area. Fair enough, everyone else who paid for an apartment instead of a dorm is in the same shitty situation, and it's not like we can break the lease cuz the apt company already sent out a letter to everyone saying they will pursue litigation if anybody tries. 

But a new situation arose recently- our mutual friend talked to my roommate first and they worked together an agreement to sublease his portion of the rent. Normally, if I were living there, I would not even question this. But I feel like with this current pandemic, it gets complicated. At the end of the day, the friend who is subleasing will be using the ENTIRE room (my roommate and I live in the same room), as I am never going to be there. I have no way of monitoring whether he is going to use my items or anything. Plus, I still have to pay for utilities, and who is to say he doesn't use it excessively? Also, because this subleaser works at a store and likes to live a social life (I have no way or right to monitor what he does socially, but I just know he likes to hang out w/ friends a lot), this poses a risk for me because if I ever want to come back (I still have shit to bring back), who is to say he doesn't get the virus and pass it onto the surfaces we have? I understand the chances of this happening are pretty slim, but it is still a risk for me nonetheless. So in essence, I was wondering if it's fair for me to ask for a small part of the rent at all? Maybe about 10%. Again, the main part is because he would be using the ENTIRE room since I won't be there, whereas if I was there I would never even consider this. 

tl;dr- my roommate (who happens to be a close friend), is subleasing his part of the rent to a mutual friend of ours'. But since I wont be there, the subleaser would be getting the entire room to himself, as opposed to just my roommate's portion of it. Is it fair for me to ask for just like 10% of the rent (I still pay full rent for that place regardless)?",1586411691,2,0

Currently, our Judicial Board can be overruled by a 3/4 vote of council ‚Äî a low bar to pass, given that council has a tendency to vote unanimously. And this was no exception. Only Brandon (Gen Rep 3) and I voted in favor of separating the judiciary.

There‚Äôs a reason why the US Supreme Court can‚Äôt be overruled by Congress. Judicial independence protects against abuses of power and violations of the Constitution. (https://www.britannica.com/topic/judicial-review)

If I become President, I will fight for judicial independence.

Vent Post: I don‚Äôt want to be a doctor anymore.,"
Hey ya‚Äôll, I‚Äôm venting here because I hope that at maybe at least one other person feels somewhat the same.

When I was younger, I wanted to be in the STEM field. I desperately wanted to become a scientist or a doctor- it was my dream. Or at least, I thought it was. I have learned since then that I am stuck between 2 lives that I really want to pursue- I want to become a doctor/be in the medical field, but I want to just live a normal, sub-par domestic life and be a high school teacher. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong- I am incredibly grateful to be here. However, I am the type of person that just wants to get on with my career. I don‚Äôt want to attend 4 more years of schooling after graduating, and then a couple more years of residency. I am impatient.

But where can I even go with a Biology degree after grad, if I don‚Äôt end up in pre-med? I‚Äôve heard job outlooks aren‚Äôt great, as Bio majors are a dime a dozen out in the career field. But if I change my career path, my family will see it as a failure and a waste of my time at UCLA. If I went to CSUN or CSULB, they would have a different mindset, but *because* I am at the #1 Public University, this weight on my shoulders has made it that I don‚Äôt want to continue pre-med. Not because I hate the material (I actually love it), but because I simply don‚Äôt want to spend 10 more years of my life reaching a point that I‚Äôm not even sure will be up to my expectations. I know the money for being a doctor is good, but it‚Äôs also not what I want to spend the rest of my life doing. I just want to settle down and start a family, and have the stereotypical life of an American citizen.

Does anyone else feel this way?",1587550921,1,0

UCLA probably making huge bucks out of students,"**Problem of tuition:** 

As an international student, I am paying around $15,000 for this quarter. Huge scam if you ask me when I have to wake up at midnight to watch lecture live and actively participate. 

Some of the fees we pay are stuff we can't even utilize because we are back at home. 

I am currently taking 18 units. This quarter is literally almost the same as UCLA summer sessions. 18 units of online summer session would cost me $5083. Why do I have to pay three times more for the same quality of education? If $5083 is enough to pay professors, TAs, etc. and maintain the campus why not pay back students partially so that it can help students in time of economic difficulty. 

I may not be the best accountant or statistician but I am 99.9% sure that UCLA is making profit now. I am not one of those rich international students in Ferraris, and I think students deserve to know where the excess money is going towards because someone is making big bucks out of students who just want to learn and see their friends back in LA.  

This is just me ranting because I am stressed about taking midterms while looking at a computer screen at 3 AM and my professor cutting out every 5 minutes.

"TL;DR: Understanding the USAC budget is kinda complicated, but it doesn't have to be."," 

https://preview.redd.it/jjagefzsuau41.png?width=2732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87d25c91fd0aace63c9644858c6b3b7c932d9b6c

The USAC budget is public. It‚Äôs 393 pages today ([https://usac.ucla.edu/docs/budget.pdf](https://usac.ucla.edu/docs/budget.pdf)) and you probably don‚Äôt have the time to read it. It also doesn‚Äôt help that it's in accounting speak.

That‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg. The budget is for the purpose of keeping track of how much money is controlled by which group. The budget is not to inform you of how the money is being spent. For that, you have to look at the expenditure list. Across all the budget accounts, there are thousands upon thousands of expenditures that usually add up to \~$10 Million. The budget is categorized. The only problem with these categories is that most of the budget goes into the two biggest ones (out of about 60 categories): \~$5 Million for special fee remittance and \~$2 Million for programming\*.

So, what‚Äôs special fee remittance? That is money that is given to other entities (such as the Community Programs Office, the place with the test bank). Now if you want to know where special remittance is spent, well, then you have to track down the budgets of all entities USAC funds (which of course are formatted differently).

Even the expenses within USAC are hard to parse. Descriptions are terse, and there are many acronyms such as: rvrs, dep, ao, pb, api, xfr, pd, mlk to name a few. Some acronyms are overloaded, and in other cases, there may be 10 variations of a single word. And the line items that are clear might be a combination of multiple purchases.

So if you want to know the answer to a simple question like ‚ÄúHow much of my student fees was spent on food?‚Äù, good luck. And what if you want to see the big picture?

That's why my office has been working on software to make all of this accessible to you: software that would read, sort, and visualize all of this data. Because I think this would go a long way towards building trust. Because this would enable everyone to be informed.

I wanted to finish this before the end of my term. And maybe we will pull it off. But even if we did, we‚Äôd still need some policy changes to make a uniform budget format for all entities that receive money. We‚Äôd still need to add this to the website, and we‚Äôd still need to make the data public. And we need to set up a system for future budgets, so we can bring lasting change: something bigger than our time in office, than ourselves.

We need, in short, follow-through. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm running for reelection.

"The CUB Referendum is about ASUCLA, don't let them make you think otherwise.","The CUB Referendum posted a list of questions and answers about their referendum to Facebook. I thought I'd post some honest answers to their questions, since the campaign isn't being honest about what it's for.

Some background: I've been involved in this area for several years, and wanted to clear the air about what's really going on behind the CUB Referendum.

**[Q1. What is the CUB Referendum and what will students gain from this?](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=128229868783744)**

The main purpose of the CUB Referendum is to give ASUCLA a bailout. At the end of the day, **it's an ASUCLA bailout referendum**. The posts on this subreddit naming USAC as the group to blame aren't entirely wrong, as USAC offices would get a cut of the fee, but by far the majority of the funds go to ASUCLA.

ASUCLA, as you may know, is the parent organization of USAC. It's not as prominent because a lot of what they do is more apolitical than USAC. They run Ackerman Union, Kerckhoff Hall, the UCLA Store, on-campus restaurants (not dining halls, but the ones on the main campus) and a couple other small services.

ASUCLA has had a financial storm brewing for years, especially since the 2008 recession. Daily Bruin has [covered it](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Adailybruin.com+asucla+finances) from time to time, but basically here's ASUCLA's overall financial picture:

* For decades, they made a ton of money from the UCLA Store, which covered most of their payroll and other expenses.
* In the 1990s, they spent millions of dollars expanding Ackerman Union, adding what are now levels A and B, because they wanted to increase sales at the UCLA Store by bringing it into a bigger space.
* The expansion almost bankrupted ASUCLA and, as it turns out, expanding a college store doesn't make students buy any more hoodies.
* Since then, they have basically had no increase in store or restaurant sales despite increases in the minimum wage and other costs.
* Their textbook store is also bringing in way less money now because of Amazon, which is hurting them even more.

Okay, so given that history, it's clear that ASUCLA has been losing money for years and years. (It also explains why they haven't really kept Ackerman or any of the on-campus restaurants as clean or nice as the dining halls.) So why not help them out with more fee money?
* ASUCLA already takes in a ton of fee money. They collect several student fees, including the Ackerman Student Union Fee, Ackerman/Kerckhoff Seismic Fee, Arts Restoring Community Fee, Bruin Bash Fee, Green Initiative Fee, (portions of the) PLEDGE Fee, (portions of the) Student Programs, Activities, and Resources Complex (SPARC) Fee, and the Undergraduate Students Association (USAC) Fee. All of these fees are paid to the Registrar's Office, which then disburses most or all of them to ASUCLA. With all of these combined, ASUCLA charges more than nearly all other UC campuses in required student association fees. However, they point to just the first one (Ackerman Student Union Fee) and say that it's lower than the combined fees at other UCs, and conclude that UCLA students are paying less than at other schools. A one-to-one comparison, where the student government, media, and services fees are all included, would be more appropriate.
* ASUCLA's main fee, the Ackerman Student Union Fee, originally was supposed to cover all the costs of running the Student Union. However, over the past few years, it has transitioned to just offseting their losses from running restaurants. If you look at their financial statements on their website, **[ASUCLA loses about the same amount of money each year running its restaurants, as it brings in under the Ackerman Student Union Fee]**(https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/9vfhnh/ucla_should_have_starbucks_on_campus_like_uci/e9cg9im/). Basically, your fee subsidizes the fact that their ASUCLA brand restaurants aren't profitable. (Reasonable minds may ask why they need to operate ASUCLA brand restaurants at all, instead of just renting their space to other companies that pay money in rent.... your guess is as good as mine, but it probably has to do with job security for ASUCLA's career restaurant executives, making north of $100k)
* Because the Ackerman Student Union fee just subsidizes restaurant losses, ASUCLA doesn't have any other money to play around with, and is relying on the UCLA Store to fund all of its other programming
* ASUCLA has not made any significant cuts to its overpaid career executives for years (under at least the past 3 executive directors), preferring the idea of raising more funds via referendum instead of trimming its overhead like any nonprofit not based on a college campus would do. Ask any ASUCLA staffer and they will confirm.

So, in terms of Question 1: the CUB Referendum is aimed at bringing almost $2 million per year into ASUCLA's coffers. Students might get additional services or space from ASUCLA. The organization will almost certainly use a portion of the money to expand Ackerman (again) into its former loading dock near Gateway Plaza. And they'll probably spend $50k or so on a Black Resource Center. But all that is guaranteed based on the text of the referendum is that ASUCLA will have decision-making power over the money, including on how much of it to allocate to each purpose.

**[Q2: Who drafted the CUB Referendum?](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=128229902117074)**

Different USAC and CPO offices are listed on the official answer. But the driving force behind this referendum is ASUCLA, and my hunch is that their executive director took the lead in telling USAC what to include in the referendum. USAC and CPO will pick up whatever scraps ASUCLA leaves them after winning.

**[Q3: What communities would be supported by this referendum?](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=128229935450404)**

This is a misleading question. 13 different student groups are listed in the answer, but you can be certain that the money won't be split evenly, 13 ways, amongst those groups. More likely, you'll see over $1 million of the annual funds be given to ASUCLA's general fund, and a small sliver of the money be set aside for community work from student groups. ASUCLA and the referendum's organizers are going to be very careful to not announce any specific funding levels for specific groups.

**[Q4: Why suggest a $15 fee increase during a pandemic?](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=128229942117070)**

ASUCLA has been planning a referendum for at least 5 years, under both Pouria Abbassi and Bob Williams. They decided to pull the trigger before COVID-19 hit, and now they're stuck. Now they're hoping that only USAC and CPO-affiliated students will vote.

**[Q5: Why do students have to pay for these services? Shouldn't UCLA be paying for this?](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=128229975450400)**

This question is amusing because the referendum actually calls for ASUCLA to pick up the tab on UCLA Student Affairs' rent payments (to ASUCLA) for the Transfer Student Center in Kerckhoff Hall. Effectively, the fee guarantees that ASUCLA gets this money, at least $100,000, ""carte blanche"" to spend on whatever they'd like. But it also means that UCLA won't have to spend their money on rent anymore. So... the CUB Referendum will actually be passing responsibility from UCLA to a new student fee.

**[Q6: Who will be in control of these fees?](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=128230002117064)**

The answer to this question is accurate, though it is worrying that it states that ASUCLA will work ""in consultation"" with other groups that are not fiduciaries of the student body.

**[Q7: What happens if the referendum doesn't pass?](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=128942068712524)**

ASUCLA will have to go back to the drawing board, likely will have to lay off some of its unnecessary executives, and might have to negotiate a deal with UCLA to split the cost of any Ackerman expansion, the same way that the ASUC at Berkeley split the cost of their new student union with the campus administration. It won't be the end of the world. And UCLA + ASUCLA will both be more than capable of making a Black Resource Center if they spend their money more effectively. Lastly, students wanting to pray in Ackerman will continue to be able to do so in the third-floor Bruin Reflection Space.

----

That's all. At the end of the day, the CUB Referendum is an ASUCLA bailout fee. Maybe if ASUCLA cut some overpaid career staff and stopped running money-losing restaurants, it would be able to spend its existing Ackerman Student Union fee to expand the student union building, build a Black Resource Center and more. However, they'd prefer to ask you to pay extra money for a new fee instead, so that they don't have to make those hard decisions.

Communication Majors (help),"I‚Äôm absolutely desperate to get into the COMM program (took me a while to admit my current major has been making me miserable) and any tips I could get from those who got in would be amazing. 

Also, do the amount of lower division graded classes matter? I know they say to apply you need at least 2 lower-div class credit for the COMM major application, but would they look less on applicants who only have 2? Conversely, do they look more favorably on those who have more than 2? I‚Äôve been stuffing in STEM classes throughout basically almost all my time here and only have 2 Comm lower-divs done due to my recent realization about switching.

I'm an incoming grad student and am trying to finalize my housing applications. does anyone have any insight into the  UAS 2bd/2ba apartments? are those relatively available or is it hard to get placed into them? if you rank those above Weyburn, does it reduce your chance of getting a Weyburn placement? i'm from out of state like many people and have 0 idea of how UCLA does their grad housing placements but would really, really like university housing.

Forgoing Job Opportunities Due to COVID-19,"I am grateful to live in a relatively remote area and that no one in my family has contracted the virus, although two close family members have compromised immune systems.

Not worrying too much about the immediate impacts of the virus has left me to ponder what may come in the future. Knowing that many students have had to give up their employment opportunities this year, combined with the projections of how the virus may spread this summer (up to 200k new cases and 3k deaths per _day_ in June), has given me the impression that this pandemic will significantly impact our way of life for much longer than first anticipated and that we students will have a difficult time finding jobs in the coming years.

Obviously, there is much more value to college than academics. It‚Äôs important who you meet, what organizations you decide to participate in, and where you work in between. Not having done anything much other than academics before the pandemic, I feel like I am missing out on a lot, and I‚Äôm sure a lot of you do too.

I want to know what you all think about how life outside of academics will change in the future.

Taking Next Year Off UCLA,"Hey ya'll!  


Hope everyone's staying safe.  


Need advice!

I'm an international student on track for a 3 year graduation in 2021. In light of Coronavirus, I lost my internship etc. I was just wondering if I should take the whole year off next year and graduate in 2022 like I was originally supposed to... or should I stick with my 2021 plan. 

Since I am an international student, declaring non attendance for me would mean I lose my visa so if I do that I might as well take the whole year off instead of just 1 quarter if classes are going to be online because I am legit losing my mind taking online classes rn. I know this sounds bad... but I really hope I get to have a commencement ceremony so I feel like odds of getting commencement in 2022 is higher than 2021 and job prospects for internationals right now are super slim so should I wait out the year?  


Any advice would be helpful :)

Action Based Endorsements,"The name of the game is action. This sub has made it clear that we're tired of faux action based initiatives that just create more do nothing committees and increase bloat. Here is a list of endorsements for those who have concrete and actionable plans whose effects are real, matter, and can be measured rather than the tired old ""raising awareness"" rhetoric.

In these endorsements, I will rate those running by positions and statements they have made that match the following model: ""Achieved x using y measured by z"". For those unaware, this a common model used by recruiters to rate the effectiveness of an applicant's resume. You must be clear about what you achieved, how you did it, and why you know it mattered.

While bringing back the flyaway bus may not be a high stakes initiative, it is clear about what it does: providing a way for students to get to LAX, how it does it: talking to the UCLA transportation department to fund a new bus, and why it matters: counting the number of people that use the bus.

On the other hand, opening up stipended student seats may sound impressive, but it fails to answer the question of why it matters. What it does: added stipended student seats to the Academic Senate, how does it do it: talked to [whomever you need to talk to], and why it matters: ? Of course people will copy and paste the same ""increasing x"" or ""improving y"" but there are no measurable results here. Same goes for every initiative centered around ""raising awareness.""

I don't have endorsements for every position because there were some that I don't think anyone brought actionable items to the table and somewhere a lot of people did.

President:

Orion Smedley
Orion has proved himself to be Reddit's posterchild when it comes to criticisms of the government's disconnect with the student body. As the leader of the Cost Cutting Innovations slate, his platform has always been oriented towards actionable goals that have real effects. As General Representative 2, he ran on a platform to bring back the flyaway bus and did exactly that. While other officers were adding student seats to councils that no one knows about or spending money on programming no one attends, Orion continued to focus his efforts on issues students face in real life such as the reducing student fees.

In response to a question about accountability, Orion stated that the current student government has put pressure on the CPO office over inadequate reports in the form of withholding stipends. It is not difficult to see him continuing to put this kind of pressure on those who mishandle student fees in his tenure.

Josuel Vasquez
The STV model allows for students to rank multiple choices and for the second spot the endorsement goes to Josuel. He has a very simple platform consisting almost solely of actionable items: refund the the spring quarter fees and give priority enrollment to the most vulnerable in our student body.

IVP:

Brandon Broukhim

Brandon hits the nail on the head for why so many students are disillusioned with student government in a single word. Transparency. Until the recent referendum sparked scrutiny for budgets, many students didn't even know their representatives were earning $10K stipends or that millions had gone missing under their nose. He brings valid criticisms to the government he was a part of and lays a concrete plan to improve accessibility. He talked about getting better equipment and paying out of his own stipend to better engage students in this online era.

Brandon also demonstrated a history of actionable plans as this year's General Representative 3. He made expansions to the food closet, negotiated discounts for students in Westwood stores, and fought to move the drop deadline this quarter.

Facilities Commissioner:

Draco Tong

In the debate, Draco focused his platform on realistic measures he would take to address sustainability issues. He talked about his participation in the sustainability Grand Challenges and how he would use this practical research experience to make UCLA greener. On the other hand, his opponent Sachi fell back onto the old approach of ""making committees"" and ""engaging with administration.""

In the closing statements he brought up the point that so many of us have identified with. He is an Electrical Engineering major trying make practical changes for students and is repeatedly told that he doesn't have the political experience to navigate bureaucracy. He feels that there has not been enough representation of South Campus perspectives which has led to the incessant creation of do nothing committees that only serve to allow friends of officers to pad their resumes.

If you want genuine change like improved elevators and solar power, then go with Draco.

Transf*r Student Representative:

Deven Streeton

In my opinion, Deven narrowly beats out Zuleika for the Transf*r Student Representative endorsement. Zuleika is a student that embodies many marginalized communities on campus, e.g. transf*r, first gen, and parenting, but falls into the the establishment trap of endorsing the creation of ""committees"" and ""spaces"" that don't solve real problems. On the other hand Deven brought a solutions oriented platform to the table, characteristic of the CCI slate. While Zuleika was name dropping dozens of transf*r related committees, coalitions, and centers, Deven was very clear that the best solution for transf*rs was to centralize all these different resources.",1588658274,1,0

"TL;DR: Textbooks are expensive, but they shouldn't have to be."," Ok. Why are textbooks so expensive? Greedy publishers? Well that's part of it, but not all of it.

You would expect that once students have purchased enough textbooks, there would be a satisfactory supply. Students would buy and resell used textbooks, kind of like a decentralized library. Just give it a little time, and we‚Äôll reach that supply. Well, sorry. With every edition the publisher just changes the order of the problems so that students are required to get the new edition.

I talked with one of my professors about this. She wanted to keep using the old edition, until ASUCLA told her she couldn‚Äôt. Why? Because ASUCLA simply doesn‚Äôt have enough of them -  it can‚Äôt guarantee that it can stock the store with the old edition.

Alright. We know the problem, but how do we fix it? One is to encourage professors to print the actual questions on every homework (rather than page numbers) so you can use any edition. Another is to fix the ASUCLA textbook selling paradigm. ASUCLA loses money on textbooks (subject to how you interpret their profit and loss statement). But there‚Äôs a way to fix that: serving the role of a facilitator/central marketplace for peer to peer textbook sales. I‚Äôve already identified a UCLA startup that is developing an app to simplify the whole buying and selling experience, the need for which is apparent if you‚Äôve ever tried to find the one textbook you need in the morass of Facebook groups (I mean really, people post a picture of 20 books, and expect you to play I-Spy). Imagine instead putting your textbook in something like an Amazon locker (except B-Plate style to save money). When someone buys your book, they are given the code, and open the corresponding locker. All done through a simple interface, and protected with your Single Sign On (SSO).

The pros of USC are:

1. I can graduate in 3 years

North Campus dominates UCLA politics and that needs to change,"Just for the record, I'm not advocating for Orion. It looks like it because Orion is the only one advocating for South Campus causes which means I support his platform. However, I would be more than happy to vote for other students advocating for South Campus issues.

From the platforms that most USAC candidates run on to the recently released officer evaluations by the Daily Bruin, it's pretty clear that there's a clear bias towards North Campus oriented agendas. 

As a user pointed out in another post, there's a pretty clear discrepancy in the way the Daily Bruin writes about some platforms. 

Looking at Orion's platform that received a rating of 1

&gt; [The quality of dining hall ingredients, elevator speeds and lightly used shuttle buses weren‚Äôt at the front of students‚Äô minds.](https://new.dailybruin.com/post/usac-officer-evaluation-orion-smedley-general-representative-2)

compared to Naomi's platform that received a rating of 5

&gt; [Riley aimed to make decision-makers more accessible to students. Thanks in large part to Riley‚Äôs office, student Academic Senate positions are now stipended, which could open up seats at the table to students who couldn‚Äôt afford to donate time to academic policy debate without pay. Riley also worked to instate four student appointment positions on the public safety advisory committee following the Getty fire to ensure a student voice at the table in emergencies.](https://new.dailybruin.com/post/usac-officer-evaluation-naomi-riley-academic-affairs-commissioner)

the bias is pretty clear. Thousands of students eat in the dining halls every day. Using better quality ingredients is a sentiment that I bet nobody opposes. On the other hand, I'm graduating this year and I nor any of my friends have ever even heard of the Academic Senate until last quarter when departments were fighting with them over finals and making classes P/NP. 

They even wrote for the special election last year 

&gt; [Smedley‚Äôs goals ‚Äì such as organizing a bus between UCLA and LAX ‚Äì ***showed him to be out of touch with student needs***, as the lack of student use caused the FlyAway bus to be phased out earlier this year.](https://dailybruin.com/2019/10/27/usac-fall-2019-special-election-no-endorsement-for-orion-smedley-for-general-representative/)

Well surprise surprise, he won. 

This is a part of a larger pattern in UCLA politics. 

South campus majors don't run for office. More importantly they don't vote. So when it comes to it, USAC is filled with the same people who push initiatives that stroke the ""woke"" ego that is so pervasive among the self proclaimed journalists at the Daily Bruin. It's absurd that a candidate can run on a campaign that wants to restore a tangible service to students and gets called out of touch while another candidate is praised for adding seats for students we don't know to a senate we've never heard of.

Right about now is where people jump into the comments saying ""You have no idea what kind of impact [literally any committee] actually does for you."" 

You realize UCLA is throwing you a bone right? They give you a couple bucks out of every student's pockets so you can push those ""woke"" initiatives to pad your resume and play pretend government. But when it comes to important stuff like figuring out how to deal with a wildfire near campus, those ""student voices at the table"" don't count for anything. The folks who run one of the largest public school systems in the world aren't going to rollover because some uppity sophomores started to panic in the face of a real emergency.

Anyway back to the point. 

To USAC

You know why this sub hates USAC? Because for the first time, you have to campaign online. Which means you can't surround yourself with ""woke"" students who were already going to vote for you while being reported on by ""woke"" journalists whose only criticism is how you violated election rules by making a facebook post 20 minutes too early. On this sub, you're dealing with a user base that skews heavily to South Campus and now they're figuring out that none of you actually represent what they want in a candidate.

Rather than push a bunch of platitudinous platforms that call for unquantifiable changes like ""increasing diversity"", ""improving representation"", or ""raising awareness"", do something a large untapped portion of the student population will get behind.

I want better wifi in Boelter. I want the more dining options in the bomb shelter. I want free printing in the Boelter library. I don't want 3 hour labs that start at 6 PM. I want curriculum changes that teach practical skills than theoretical ones. Money would be better spent on those things than another initiative advocating for supporting students services with student service support.

To Daily Bruin

Get a better idea of what students want before reporting on what students want. There's such a circlejerk of writers pushing out out of touch pieces only to be validated by other writers who say the student body has no idea what they're talking about. 

You called Orion's platform out of touch but he won the special election. You said the block party got out of control but students who lived on that street said your report was exaggerated. Imagine how embarrassing it's going to be when you called Orion out of touch again and he ends up winning. Some of you need to reflect on why you deny the experience of South Campus majors. I know I'm not alone in saying that the Daily Bruin has lost a lot of credibility to me in the past year alone.

To South Campus majors

Vote. Stop USAC candidates from carrying out bullshit agendas that don't meet your needs. This happens because we're apathetic and the 15% of voters coming from North Campus get to dictate which student issues get attention.

Better yet run for office. Make the changes you want to see and cash in on that $10K stipend while you're at it.",1588574728,1,0

Am I missing something? USAC,"So for the USAC external VP candidates, there's the one guy Aidan, and in his campaign promises he says that he would like to "" Fight for UC affirmative action through ACA 5, the repeal of Prop. 209. ""

I know some people on this sub liked this candidate, so I feel like I'm missing something. I personally am super against affirmative action in the way that it's been historically used by colleges/universities to tailor which students they accept. Is this an unpopular opinion or something? Do most students want to bring affirmative action back or something?

more usac tea I'm sorry,"I'm not against the slate system at all and I'm sure I'll get wrecked for this but I feel like our student body is kind of being bamboozled and it bothers me deeply so here we go.

Both the For the People and Cost-Cutting Innovations slates have some strong candidates, and some candidates who are under-qualified. FTP candidate Elijah Wade has no experience and never showed up to the debate. CCI candidate Jong Hyeon Lee has copy-and-pasted platforms and didn't show up to the debate. He also has no social media presence and didn't do the virtual meet the candidates video. You literally cannot find him. I know a few more candidates who didn't show up to the debate, but they're not contested. 

A lot of organizations are endorsing the FTP slate down-ballot without looking at the individual platforms of the candidates. Some of the FTP candidates have opponents who are better suited to represent marginalized communities on council, but because they're not with the slate, they're not even considered. 

It's frustrating to see this level of scheming during a global pandemic. So if you have the ability to vote tomorrow, PLEASE look at everyone's platforms and BE MINDFUL of endorsements that endorse an entire slate without exceptions. 

You can support a slate and not support EVERY SINGLE CANDIDATE on the slate. You're going to see slate stuff all over your social media and in every group chat, but don't jump on the bandwagon UNLESS you have read up on all the candidates and still choose to vote that way. 

THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT SLATES ARE BAD. Slates exist for a reason, but there should also be an element of awareness when interacting with them. Mad respect to FTP and CCI, mad respect to the independent candidates, mad respect to anyone running or campaigning because this is a shit-show.

Don‚Äôt know if I should commit to UCLA. Please help,"First and foremost, I‚Äôm an extremely indecisive person. From video games, to relationships, I‚Äôve always thought the grass was greener somewhere else. I applied to UCLA on the last possible day (late Octoberish I believe) just for a hope to get in. I‚Äôm an out of state student majoring in cell/molecular/develop bio. I‚Äôm about 90% sure I want to go pre-med, but for sure know I want to go into some type of clinical/sport medicine/healthcare field. I recently chose to go to UF, which is still a great school and much cheaper for me. I had no intention of going to UCLA, and my mom ordered UF merch, grad party attire, all the works. Going to UCLA was always kind of a fantasy dream for me; it would be my ideal situation if cost was not a factor. My parents have adamantly told me to not worry about the cost of where I go, but I don‚Äôt know if putting then under the financial stress of UCLA full pay + additional schooling would be wise. I was sold on UF, found a roommate, and up until now was excited to go. That was until I got off the UCLA waitlist, and have about less than 2 hours to decide if I want to go to UCLA or UF. Of course UF is the more logical choice, costs less, Ive been set on it for a while, but I can‚Äôt get the thought out of my head that I may regret not going to UCLA.

Another Rant about Math 32B S20,"I am appalled by the blatant lack of regard for students‚Äô mental health and time during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Can these people not understand the insane amount of stress that students have to go through because of the current conditions? I, personally, have come down with COVID-19 and am forced to isolate myself in my bedroom for weeks, possibly even a month. This is particularly important in my case since my mother is immunocompromised while on chemotherapy and is at a higher risk now more than ever of dying. What‚Äôs more, added to the amount of time taken out of my day just because of the extreme precautions I need to take to isolate myself, I have to deal with the crippling fear of the impending moment that my mother dies just because of me.

Given that students like me have to face such harsh conditions, I cannot fathom how the professors for this class could give us quizzes that take twice to three times as long as a normal quiz in a normal math class, not even mentioning how much more difficult the quizzes are than the in-person math classes I have taken.

Additionally, it puts a bad taste in my mouth that the professors waited until the very last moment to give an extension for the insanely difficult second homework assignment. The extension did nothing to help those of us who sacrificed the time we could have dedicated to other classes, homework assignments, and examinations to finish the assignment before the due date. And trust me, many students gave up their studies in all other classes that week just to finish that homework assignment.

Question about summer eFan,[deleted],1589660351,0,0
Summer financial aid gave me more grant money than the costs on my bruinbill,Will this excess money be taken back? Is it free? Is it apart of the cares grant somehow? My eFan only says the money is a University and Pell grant. I'm also enrolled in 15 units so I though i would've only been covered for 12 units.,1589659713,4,0
The Truth About UCLA Finance and Consulting Recruiting,"THIS IS NOT A SHTPOST. So I recently saw something on WSO about UCLA being shtty for finance recruiting, and decided I might as well make a post here to educate everyone about it. As an alum on the east coast who had to grind just as much as a non-target, no name state school kid had to, I feel like I should write a post to well-inform potential incoming students before they end up committing to UCLA. However, note that I was in one of the clubs, so I was still lucky to have mentorship from my upperclassmen.

UCLA, for a school with a 12% acceptance rate and considered the #1 public school and a top 20 school, is actually a complete non-target for investment banking and other high finance careers generally outside of LA, and a semi target for jobs even within the LA area. A lot of EB spots in LA are usually taken up by Ivy kids from the SoCal area. Also each grade at UCLA probably consists of 6500 kids, with probably about 2000 business-interested kids? And in total for kids that breaking into IB/S&amp;T/ER, only about 30-35 kids max a year. UCLA does have IB Workshop and Sharpe Fellows as solid programs for sending kids into IB, and each of these programs takes about 20 kids, with about 90% overlap between the two programs. However, the IB workshop is also run by students, compared to workshops at other universities run by faculty, so a lot of the times, the kids being let in to the workshop are just those with friends from the previous years in the clubs.

Don't even get me started on consulting recruiting. UBS' consulting workshop takes a good amount of kids as well, but only like half of them actually manage to break into consulting. For MBB, UCLA sends about 5 a year, and mid-tier (Parthenon, LEK, Accenture, Deloitte) and low-tier consulting (ZS, KPMG, Mercer), they send about 10-15ish. Also, Deloitte Tech Consulting is not consulting at all, so don't be fooled by that.

Also take into account that 90-95% of those kids that get those top jobs were kids in one of the finance/consulting clubs on campus (there's about 3 legit finance clubs and 4 legit consulting ones? and each has like a 3-4% acceptance rate), so even if they somehow didn't get into Workshop or Sharpe, they still have their alum and upperclassmen showing them the ropes and/or pulling strings for them to break into those top jobs. Oh yeah, speaking about alumni, people tend to tell you to network with other alumni at your school. However, UCLA alumni are actually pretty bad - they would usually only help you out if you were in their club or their frat. I just happened to get lucky and get into a club, but the general finance vibe at UCLA is very toxic. Like one of the finance clubs has been starting to get a reputation for being sexist...

It's just so unfortunate that UCLA does so poorly in high finance and consulting recruiting, but it's a great school for accounting (where most of their business-interested kids end up), which is kind of sad considering how highly ranked of a school it is. This might also be attributed to it being such a research-focused school (which is great for STEM majors). But hey, if you're satisfied going to a back office audit job, UCLA might be the perfect place for you. So being realistic, it's actually incredibly hard getting into IB/Consulting/S&amp;T/ER from UCLA.

You're not just competing with other Econ and Biz Econ majors, but kids from other majors as well (like STEM majors that decided that they wanted to do business), and this is just my anecdotal experience, but STEM majors tend to do much stronger in recruiting. Just take a look at any Engineering or Life Science major that recruited for finance or consulting on Linkedin.

If you are strongly considering UCLA, you probably had a good chance at getting into Cal, UMich, UVA, UNC, Notre Dame, Vandy, GTown as well, so if you did, I would strongly advise you to pick one of those schools instead. For example, UVA is ranked below us with double the acceptance rate, but it sends over 100 kids into high finance careers every year. While we send 35 AT MAX.

It sucks a lot, but if you're at UCLA, and even though you might be incredibly capable, if you're unlucky and don't get into ANY of the 7? clubs or Workshop/Sharpe or happen to be a woman/black/hispanic/native american/queer, I honestly think you're kinda screwed. Just a warning.",1589659411,15,0

AMCAS question?,"I took Spanish 101 (equivalent to Spanish 1/2 at UCLA) thru an online community college over the summer but I decided to take Spanish 1 again at UCLA (cause the online kinda sucked). There is no UCLA transcript notation as a repeat, and I was able to send both the CC and UCLA transcripts to AMCAS. However, I'm wondering whether I should count it as a repeat. I saw on SDN that it wouldn't be a repeat since I took Spanish at two different institutions, but I wasn't able to find an official statement from AAMC about this. What should I do, please? Thanks so much!",1589653974,1,0
Does housing effect summer financial aid,"I selected off campus before for my housing status for summer before they announced c-session would be online. I just got my financial aid letter for summer and it is a lot more money than my summer tuition and it says it is based off of the housing I selected. 
Do I need to change off campus to commuter since I am living at home even though classes are all online now?
I was told we didn't even get money for housing last time I went to financial aid so I didn't think it was a big deal but looking at my award letter now I wonder if they gave me money for selecting off campus and if I need to change that

*struggles and failures* thread,"I just thought now that I‚Äôm away from other students and campus that people have not been as honest or transparent about their struggles or failures (I don‚Äôt blame people but just the general competitiveness of college esp in UCLA). In this anonymity, thought I‚Äôd create a thread where people can share their struggles or failures that they otherwise would not tell anybody in person on campus. Recently, there has been a lot of posts about students struggling, and I just hope we‚Äôll all bond through this with whatever specific struggles each one of us has.

I‚Äôll start with:

I  begged my professor to not present my research paper during finals infront of them SECONDS before I was about to go. Straight up infront of them, I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready.‚Äù The disappointment on their faces marked the lowest point of my college career. #fail4success",1589621721,1,0

Attention r/UCLA: Help us complete the subreddit wiki. We could really use your expertise!,"The wiki page on the sub is something the mod team has been meaning to get done for about a year. We forgot about it for a while until a new student messaged the mod mail recently lamenting the fact that none of the links in it worked. And we've decided to move forward with the project by asking the community to help fill in the rest. 

Right now it's still just a roadmap with different categories and sections. Shout out /u/sunrise-land for putting that together!

We've created a google doc for anyone to contribute as much or as little as they want. There are sections ranging from admissions to the best places to eat in Westwood. So whatever knowledge or expertise you can offer, it would really help.

If you feel that an additional category or section is pertinent, feel free to add one! For instance, if you've got good tips on getting research experience and applying to labs, fire alarms or block parties, those could make additional sections. The sky's the limit here. Basically, anything you feel is important for incoming students to know or that you wish you knew when you arrived at UCLA is welcomed!

If you'd like to contribute but don't know where to start, some of the needed information might be found in old threads on /r/UCLA, as well as different UCLA websites. For example, I knocked out the Bruincard section by summarizing bruincard.ucla.edu. Another example is [this useful thread](https://redd.it/dt9th8) by /u/confirmedpenguin, which would make an excellent reference for the enrollment section, etc. More references can be found in these [two](https://redd.it/9itxyf) [threads](https://redd.it/51ahur) by /u/batmanatee. So there's lots of info already floating around on here that we just need to centralize on the doc. 

I think the wiki would be beneficial to every student, especially new admits. It would be nice to have a consolidated place to find answers to FAQs or basic info about UCLA, something useful for new and current students alike.

So if you find some extra time in your day, check it out and help us knock this project out as a community! Whether you're a new student, current student, or alumnus, we could really use your help and expertise on this. Link to the doc below!
