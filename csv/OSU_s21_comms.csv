"Most of 8th and 9th are free. Pretty sure 11th is, and Chittenden definitely is. 

I'd avoid Chitt personally. Impossible to find parking after it gets dark and (Chitt Fest aside) your car is likely to get hit or, at minimum, messed with. My car was sideswiped and, on a separate occasion, I found a huge dent on the top of my hood as if someone threw a bowling ball on top of it. Less notable, but my side mirrors were often pushed in and my wipers were up quite a few times. Not a big deal, just annoying, but if you're protective over your car it's not worth it. Though, if you park beyond Summit, it's not really an issue.",1621310227,2,0

So at OSU you have your pre-reqs for your major, the courses for your major, and general education requirements.

English will fall under one of the general education requirements. Take a look at what that looks like here: [https://artsandsciences.osu.edu/academics/current-students/advising/ge](https://artsandsciences.osu.edu/academics/current-students/advising/ge)

So let's say you want to get a bachelors of science and you're in the college of arts and sciences. Take a look at the right hand side of the pdf on page 3. It says you need 6 hours of a writing course. The first writing course can be ANY of the three listed, so you'd be all set for that first writing course!

(Because some courses are different amounts of credit hours, you can check here: [https://classes.osu.edu/class-search/#/](https://classes.osu.edu/class-search/#/) to see how many credit hours a course is and make sure you'll fully fulfill the credit hour requirements of each category)

They are the same thing pretty sure. I looked on transferology and i got credit for 1110 and 2367 or whatever so i'm done with english (level 1 and 2 req). Engl 1110.01 and 1110.02 both count as level 1. you only need to take one of them. My 2367 counts as level 2.,1621306875,3,0

They allow pets (2 max) and the pet deposit is $250 and pet rent is $50/month. Water is billed quarterly and electric is not included, BUT with it being a small space, my bills are usually $50/$60 a month. Also has working A/C!

"The recent change seems to be allowing people who are eligible for work study but don't take it. Everyone was eligible before if you were doing a work study for financial aid. With that said it seems to vary a bit from county to county. 

I get foodstamps from back home in Cleveland. I have received food stamps for my entire time at OSU at the max amount for a single person with no kids for the past 3 years. It was $192 per month when I started then a cost of living increase raises it to $212 last year. And now a temporary 15% boost on top of that from the pandemic stuff has pushed it to $244. 

Being in an educational program at least back home counts as a educational/vocational/training waiver that stops you from having to seek work to keep the foodstamps. I usually work the summers but its not enough to affect my eligibility. I've gotten a work study offer but only was able to take advantage of it the first year. And my case worker has never asked about it. The only thing they want to know is that I maintain 6 units or more every semester including summer and that I maintain a higher than 2.0 GPA. 

If for some reason that isn't how it works in Columbus, that's really unfortunate. Students are almost always below the poverty line if they are supporting themselves without assistance from home. On a side note there is one program that you can take advantage of even if foodstamps don't work and I know this works in Columbus because I applied and got it through Franklin County. It's called HEAP Winter Crisis and the PIPP plan. 

They take new sign-ups from November 1st through March 31st but it works all year. It allows anyone making under a certain amount per year to get help with utilities. They paid off my balance when I got signed up 3 years ago and then from then onward my gas and electric have been set at $10/month each. It saves me $150+ per month. It's meant to allow you to be able to run heat all winter or air conditioning all summer without worrying about the wildly expensive bills.   All I had to do was show them my financial aid package minus loans since that doesn't count as income and then explain how I pay my bills out of it. Financial aid packages as nice as they are pretty much always leave you below the poverty line. 

Between HEAP/PIPP $10 per month utilities and EBT food stamps its been pretty life changing and has helped me through the pandemic. I think everyone in school should qualify but at least right now if you want the HEAP/PIPP and are one of these low EFC financial aid recipients just look up Franklin County Community Action or the Breathing Association. Both places are still signing people up for winter crisis sign ups til the end of March. I can't speak for EBT in Franklin County but that's too bad if it doesn't work the same as the PIPP plan.",1613853183,1,0

"Former OSU grad student here (graduated 2020).

Here's my two cents, for what it's worth. Columbus has many vibrant communities, all depending on what you like. If you want to be a part of the OSU community and care about football games, bars, partying (if all that comes back soon), then I'd recommend sticking closer to campus--Short North, Italian Village, Clintonville so long as you don't go too north (gets to be kind of boring IMO.

I lived in north Clintonville for a long time in an apartment complex built in the 60s. It was super close to Target and a Kroger, which was great, but the complex itself was poorly maintained and had so many issues. It was also filled with a lot of older people, and it was too far away from OSU to feel part of the community.

I now live south of campus in a recently-constructed complex, and I love it here sooo much more. Modern appliances that work and there is easy access to downtown and parks/biking trails. 

For what it's worth, I would \*not\* move to Westerville or somewhere that far. I think that's kind of wild, but it all depends on how involved you're looking to be. Personally, even when I lived in north Clintonville, it was always nice to be able to hop on the 2 or 102 bus and be on campus in 15-20 minutes. The bus system here is decent, or at least it was pre-COVID. (I haven't ridden in over a year).

"First of all, congrats! That's awesome, I hope you enjoy your program here.

I'm also a grad student here if you wanna shoot me a message with any questions! Regarding apartments, I would stay the fuck away from areas within a mile of campus, particularly to the east of campus. I was THIS close to signing a lease before I realized it was right around the corner from a frat and my late 20s ass does not want that. The grad students I know live in Clintonville or further south of campus. You'll wanna check bus lines for the campus bus system to inform your decision. My apartment is right next to a stop and it is lovely and makes any distance not a big deal. There's also a part on the OSU website that has reviews from students about the various leasing companies in the area, but I don't remember where that part of the site is.

Is it easy to make friends? Yes and no. If you're in grad school I can safely assume you are mid-20s or close to it (perhaps older like myself or older than that) and the truth is, without the typical undergrad things like dorms and house parties, it is kind of hard to make friends. If you are fortunate enough to have people in your cohort you enjoy talking to then bam, friends right there. Be friendly and open about your interests with your new department and I'm sure you'll find it easy to make friends. It also doesn't hurt to get involved with whatever club or organization your department might be apart of. That's helped me meet a few people, though in COVID times it is harder, I'll admit.

On paper resumes we looked exactly the same, the difference between us is just what kind of subjects we know.

Nobody looks at what ‚Äúspecialization‚Äù you choose in ECE. The different paths (EE or CE) really only have an impact on what you learn while earning the same degree. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest pursuing a Computer Science minor or even switching tracks if it means spending an extra semester and energy to do so if your purpose for getting that minor or switching tracks is to make yourself more marketable when applying for jobs. ECE is so closely related to software that nobody hiring will care or distinguish the difference from my experience. They‚Äôll hire you based on computer science knowledge you have.

Of course if you‚Äôre planning on switching to gain personal knowledge on the subject as your main goal and you‚Äôre early enough where it wont have a significant impact on graduation time then that‚Äôs totally different.

"Hi OP, BS&amp;MS EE here, focus in power electronics &amp; controls. 

I can't speak too much to making the decision between the two because for myself it was very easy; I always loved playing with electrical hardware and always wanted to know more and how it worked so I naturally went down the EE/hardware route. I also never really liked coding all that much so that made the decision much easier. 

For how I and many of my friends have described the difference: EE is going to be mostly hardware or physical systems focused with software mostly abstracted away or not mentioned, CSE is going to be basically purely software focused with hardware abstracted or not mentioned, and CE is somewhere in between; think like firmware or low level coding where an understanding of the physical system at some level is required but not at a super deep level. 

If you feel like you have an interest in both some hardware and some software and don't want to just do purely one, then CE might be the way to go. Feel free to DM me if you want to chat further about this!",1620223652,2,0

Why the hell is there the rule that you need to press the button to get the walk sign? The time period where it is safe to walk exists regardless of if you pressed the button, so why make the indication of said period dependent on the pushing of said button?


If they are on timers, are the timers time dependent (in other words, will the timing be the same at 6:00am as they are at 8:00pm or different)? Because I feel like having that be the case could be really useful at some intersections, for instance at Neil and Lane if the commuter rush had a timer favoring the Lane traffic then every other time of day had a timer favoring it far less it could really ease some issues there (for both pedestrian crossing and traffic flow).",1621264931,3,0

Taking notes is fantastic in Notability (and there are TONS of other note-taking options available if Notability isnt for you.)  The screen quality on the iPad is second to none, and the Apple Pencil is the most precise digital writing instrument available.

Carmen works great in Safari as well as having a mobile app that also works really well.  You can submit assignments that you complete in Notability right into Carmen, or you can upload them to onedrive/google drive then submit from there if that's more your speed.

My iPad still gets about two days of use from me before I have to charge it, and the pencil lasts even longer.  There are a few options available in the iPad line up right now so I'd recommend doing some research and seeing which model would work best for you.

"You would have to research this and see how much overlap is between the courses.

Like if you can take classes that would count for both requirements for major coursework, then a double major would be fine.  If there's no overlap, and you can't petition to allow for overlap then they recommend a dual degree option.

Now it's important to understand that they recommend it because double majoring and doing a dual degree for two disconnected areas of study are *basically* the same requirements.

For example, I started out as a double major in Civil Engineering and Russian Language, and discovered only last semester that they were so disconnected that I might as well switch over to a dual degree.  It did add one more class requirement (I needed to hit the upper division hours for the College of Arts and Sciences, and I only needed 2 credit hours to do so), but I figured at that point why not? Signed up for an easy class and now I have two diplomas to show for it. 

You would be better served talking to your advisors about it, but this is my experience.",1621211086,3,0

"It looks like you made a post about getting into OSU, or your chances of getting in. Please keep in mind the following:

- No one on r/OSU can accurately tell you if you will be admitted or not. Many things go into deciding whether or not someone will be admitted, and the admission standards can shift from year to year. 
- Take a look at the [""Who gets in?"" page](http://undergrad.osu.edu/apply/freshmen-columbus/who-gets-in) on the OSU Admissions website. It provides a class profile, and a brief overview of what admissions counselors look for in an application. 
- Keep in mind that meeting the expectations listed on the admissions site, or having similar credentials to someone else is not a guarantee that you will be admitted. Year after year this subreddit receives a small number of posts from people who exceeded the admission requirements, but were not admitted. 
- If you have specific questions about being admitted, your best bet is to [contact admissions](http://undergrad.osu.edu/contact-us) directly. Although r/OSU can be helpful, it's better to talk to the people actually making the decisions.

CIS is also a good complement to MIS, though they‚Äôve imposed limitations on elective overlap, which might be a scheduling problem. Whether you want to take both MATH 2366 and Foundations 1 is also a different story... if you‚Äôd want CIS purely for the programming, I think it‚Äôd be more efficient to learn languages outside of class anyway after having the fundamentals of programming down (very translatable afterward). Ultimately, it just comes down to whether you‚Äôd rather spend your time in class studying stats and math, comp sci and math, or something else that interests you.

While there may be more options in Columbus, they can get old quickly, especially if you don‚Äôt have the financial freedom to enjoy the more popular (and expensive) areas of the city like the Short North. 

Furthermore, Columbus is spread out, and it is difficult to explore if you don‚Äôt have a car. We do have the COTA bus system, but it is obviously not as quick or convenient as driving.
