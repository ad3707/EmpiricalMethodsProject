Some students are in paid productions while attending school. Most grew up doing community theater. However, there are some like you that recently became interested and a decent chunk that are interested in more technical aspects of theater. I definitely think you can pursue the major here, no problem, but you will not have any advantage and you will probably struggle with job prospects after graduation so I may suggest double majoring in something marketable since you aren’t coming in with considerable theater experience. 
As for admissions, they definitely prefer students with a lot of theater and related experience but that is because it shows demonstrated interest in the program. It would look odd, for example, if you competed in science Olympiad, tutored for chemistry, and volunteered at a hospital but then decided to apply primarily as a theater major.

"I had a really tough freshman year too. I had a girlfriend who was terrible to me, and that colored a lot of my experience and took up a lot of my time. But if I'm being honest with myself, I also didn't take care of myself and I didn't take advantage of all the opportunities around me. 

First off: Mental &amp; physical health. If you aren't sleeping, you're gonna be miserable. Take naps if you need them. Make sure you have a warm enough coat for when it's cold out. Do your laundry and make your bed so you always have a nice place to lay your head at night. These small things will give you a better physical sense of home and make you more comfortable. I used to stay up until 4, not studying, just fucking around, then go to my gross bed in my clothes and wake up miserable the next day. There is the feeling that you need to be doing all things at all times, but you shouldn't be afraid of taking time for yourself and doing things for yourself. Side note: People shit on CAPS, and partly rightfully so. But here was my CAPS experience and maybe something that will appeal to you. I saw a CAPS person after a particularly bad experience. They tried hard to refer me out to a therapist in Evanston. I was resentful because I wanted them to take care of me, but the reality is they can't keep up with the demand from students. I sought out the therapists they recommended me to, and I still go to the same person 8 years later. I personally don't even see it as treatment for mental illness, it's more taking care of my mental health. You work out your muscles to build strength or cut fat, you might as well exercise your brain in order to maintain your state of mind. I really, truly, could not recommend therapy more highly for anyone, regardless of whether or not you're going through a bad time.

Second: Friends. There are people all around you, and even if the people in your immediate vicinity aren't your closest friends, you can find other, totally interesting and fun people elsewhere. I am lucky that I'm still close to some people I lived with freshman year, but also some of my closest friends are people I didn't meet until junior or senior year. I had a really good friend freshman and sophomore year from my PA group who latched on to me and my friends, and realized a little later that he didn't vibe with us as much as he did during fall of freshman year. He joined a Christian group on campus and realized these were the people he was meant to be with. My point is that you don't have to find all your friends right away. It will happen for you, it may just take time. The easiest ways to grease the skids though would be finding classes and/or clubs that meet your interest. Clubs always are excited to have new members, and if you're meeting people in clubs or classes, you already have one interest in common. That's a place to start. And also don't be afraid of reaching out to your Peer Adviser. They're supposed to be your first friend on campus, and if they're good, they'll really make an effort to help you get your feet under you. If not, I really recommend reaching out to the Wildcat Welcome and the office of First Year Experience (if they still call it that). It's literally their job to make sure new students are having a good time, and I can tell you from experience that they're some of the most passionate, empathetic people on campus.

Third: Class. Yes, ultimately you're here for school, and yes, class can absolutely put you in a mental hole if you are being made to feel inadequate by your classes, but don't be afraid to take a hard look at yourself and decide if your major/school are right for you. I brute forced my way through McCormick, and if I'm being honest with myself, I should have maybe given myself the opportunity to look at other majors. It wouldn't have hurt, at the very least. I knew a PA group of McCormick freshmen when I was a senior and probably half of them left for other things in SESP or whatever and they were way happier. And I was happy for them! They found something that made them feel good and still maintained their interest. 

Fourth: Transferring. I almost don't want to put this here but you said you might not be the right type of person for Northwestern. You applied and were accepted, so you AND Northwestern both thought that you were the right type of person for Northwestern, so the first point in your favor is that you were selected because they thought you could do this. But you're new, and you may not have found your footing yet, so I'd say it's worth giving it some more time. However, you may find yourself thinking at a certain point that you or they got it wrong, and you don't fit in at Northwestern. There's really, really no shame in it. I just think you have to take a look around and ask, did I do everything I could to try and find my place here? And if you can honestly say yes, and you still don't feel at home, you should feel no shame in trying to find somewhere else where you belong. I came to Northwestern still devastated I didn't get into my top choice, so maybe that was part of the reason I was kinda miserable at first. And I even thought about transferring, hoping I could still go to my first choice. In the end, I found my niche and ended up loving it. But it didn't happen all at once. It grew and changed over the full course of my time in school.

It can be really lonely, and intimidating as well.  There were definitely times where I felt like everyone around me was making close friends and doing well in classes, and I was just struggling.  But it gets better with time! I'm a senior year now, and a lot of the close friends I have now I didn't meet until winter or spring quarter freshman year or, for some of them, sophomore year.

"So, to preface this, I'm a junior here currently, been here for all 3 years. Econ major/Soci minor in Weinberg. Far from a straight-A student here, but also not floundering anymore. I ran into something similar my first quarter here. Came from a low-income background in a much smaller state (Chicago metro has nearly 5x the pop of my home state and even the city itself exceeds it by several hundred thousand), not the most social person, very different interests/tastes, had an absolutely terrible roommate and dorm, etc. Loved it the first week, novelty wore off, disliked it for the next 6 weeks or so.

It took me a bit of time to figure out that you dont necessarily have to fit in 100% to have a good time here. There are guaranteed at least some people here who you will fit with, it can simply take a bit of time to find them. It's hard to say how the best way to find them is other than just talking to people; I found mine when I was looking for a new roommate and found one whose interests were exactly the same as me. Sometimes I do still wonder if a different school would be a better fit, but I'm perfectly happy here and don't want to change anymore.

As for the topic of not being able to relax, it can come from several things. For your first quarter, you'll have a bit less time than normal just because of TND's and other freshman events. Northwestern is also far more stressful in general than many of the other elite schools, as a result of the quarter system (it's one of 5 ""elite"" tier private schools on the system, though the UC system is also on it). Also once it gets cold that adds to it. One of the biggest things with it is you have to learn how to manage your time properly. Being on the quarter system means you can't just slack for half the term, crunch for a 2 week midterm period, then relax again. The amount of time you're putting in should be comparable to that of a job (if not exceeding by a bit) when you combine class and out of class hours. Once you get this down and learn how to balance your classes properly, it can be pretty easy to get at least a couple hours of relaxation a day, if not more on some.

On the topic of balancing your classes, there's a useful resource when you're in CAESAR called the CTEC's. They give you info about the class you're looking at from people who have taken it previously, such as quality of instruction, hours spent per week, and so on. Seriously, use them. It took me a year to start, and once I did, my weekly schedule became way better. Make sure you dont have too many high hour classes per week, and avoid any with professors averaging low scores. It's honestly pretty rare to see a class with a teacher having less than a majority of 5/6s (6 is max) on their teaching, if it's a 2 or 3 average, avoid that professors class like the plague.

This turned out a bit longer than I was intending, but figured I should do something useful while waiting for IT to actually do their job. If there's something I didn't cover, anything you're curious about, or just want elaboration on something, just drop a reply or message me and I'll get back to you pretty quickly.

In high school the range from regular classes and honors was significant enough to warrant being in honors classes, but the majority of people at NU are super bright and the gains are marginal from taking the honors classes imo. From my experience it just made the curve harder and also made class selection less flexible (because there's only one class slot for all the honors track).

"Hey! I’m happy to answer to the best of my ability based on my experiences (I’m a male though, so I can’t speak too much to the experience of being a woman in McCormick).

Professors in McCormick vary. Some are definitely invested in students’ learning and work hard on making their classes interesting. Others not so much. For intro level classes, this can be especially true because you don’t have as much choice over which courses you are taking and with whom you are taking them. That said, CTECs (course and teacher evaluations) are normally pretty thorough and help you to avoid bad professors once you get to upper level classes.

Class sizes definitely get smaller as you get deeper into your major, and you definitely can become close to classmates within your major, especially in majors that follow a more linear progression. By my senior year, I would say my classes averaged probably 10 students, though there is some variability by major.

Curves again depend on the professor and the course. In my experience, most classes curved the average to around a B-.

Again, I’ll let others speak more to the experience being a woman in McCormick. But I know that while a lot of my female friends faced difficulty at times working on group projects with male peers or dealing with professors who didn’t believe they were capable, a lot of them also found support and community in groups like SWE (society of women engineers) and Women in Computing.

As for social life, it is definitely possible to have a good social life without joining a Greek organization. The Greek community does make up a large percentage of the student body, but there’s also an even larger percentage of people who don’t join. You can still find community among your major or within other student groups. I think the time it’s hardest socially to not be in Greek life is while rush is happening because your friends who do rush will likely be spending a lot of time in that process. That said, any barriers that are formed at that time tend to break down pretty quickly, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. You’ll find your people.",1568247037,1,0

"I read somewhere that double major needs to involve Weinberg for one of the majors (as a non-home school). For example, one can do a double major with an engineering field and economics, keeping McCormick as your main school. This will require meeting all requirements of McCormick and the particular engineering major, and that of economics major. However, distribution and foreign language requirements of Weinberg need not be met. 

Now, I don't think it can be worked other way around: i.e., do an engineering major without meeting all requirements of McCormick.  Part of it is that engineering field tends to have more of a prerequisite structure, but otherwise also, McCormick does not want to give an engineering major without requirements like Math, Science, EA. DTC, and basic engineering.  

You may want to check if other schools (communication, for example), will allow a major from within the school without all of school's requirements being met.  Otherwise, double major will not be feasible, you can only do a dual degree.",1568221807,1,0

"The attached post ought to help, but for the basic rundown: McCormick ensures you get a solid Engineering background with the Engineering Analysis sequence, design courses, and basic sciences, while Weinberg is a bit more flexible with your electives, although there is the 2 year language requirement. I think the crux of the decision tends to be, do you want 2 years of some language (which can be take it or leave it) or 2 quarters of DTC (the core design course) (the first of which is universally a bad experience (the way it's taught, not the subject matter, I'd argue), and the second of which is very hit or miss)?

That said, if you plan to double major as opposed to major/minor, it is more sensible to do CS through Weinberg.

McCormick also used to have a Depth requirement, but that's gone, so they're even more similar than ever.

So tldr, McCormick for engineering background, Weinberg for more flexibility in supplemental material.

"As somebody who was in your shoes almost a decade ago - everybody is struggling. This isn’t easy for anybody. There’s just a need everybody has to not look like it, for some reason. It’ll eventually come out in various ways years later, but nobody is as put together as you think they are.

As other people have said, this isn’t high school. There’s way more effort involved in doing well. In high school, NU-bound students could do well by just being smart. That’s no longer enough - everybody here is smart. From this point forward, it’s about habits.

Here are some tips I wish I knew when I first started off:

* Keep a daily planner/schedule (physical, not digital. That’s important). Write everything on it: classes, project due dates, homework, meetings, exams, parties, plans with friends, etc. It’s literally not worth the brain capacity to remember something you can write down. This will free your mind up a bit and keep you organized. Take it everywhere

* Make an effort to complete homework a full 48 hours before its due. Plan to finish studying for an exam 48 hours before you need to take it. Trust me - being early is simply a mental adjustment, and it’ll make a world of a difference in your retention and stress levels.

* Never do work in your dorm/apartment. Your bed is for sleeping. Your room is for hanging. The library/computer lab is for working. Having a designated place you “go” to for work helps you keep track of when it’s time for retention and when it’s time for relaxation

* Build out a weekly calendar. Start with adding your classes and weekly meetings. Add in some time for the gym. Add in blocks of time for homework/studying, each block being between 2-4 hours at a time. You should have 1 or 2 blocks a day, 4 days a week and 1 day on the weekend. Follow that schedule, even if you don’t think you need to do anything that day. It’s about discipline. Reread the notes, read the textbook, read ahead. There’s always some you can do, and this keeps you prepared.

* Leave your phone at home when you go study. I’m serious. At worst, turn it off and put it into your backpack.

These tips, combined with some of the stuff I’ve seen in other comments, should help a ton. After high school, success is all about habits, not intelligence.

Good luck!",1572534718,1,0

"You might need to get used to studying/working differently in college than in high school. For EECS 111 specifically (I’m a CS Major), in class, do you actively take notes? If not, do you listen and go through the slides and the code with the prof? Or do you kinda pay attention and kinda not? In that class specifically, I found that I (who took hand-written notes as the professor went through the slides) did much better and understood everything much better than my friends who either just scrolled through the slides with her or just fully did not pay attention. And in future CA classes, where I did not take such detailed notes and just went through the slides with the prof, I found that I understood everything much less. Now if you are being an active participant in class, and you’re studying hard, and still not doing well, I’d recommend going into office hours. Talk to your professor and tell them that you’re struggling, and tell them what it is you don’t understand. Ask them what the best way to study for their class is.

"Free speech is valuable because the only way people can grow and society as a whole can progress is through exchange of ideas. I think it clearly has value beyond the fact that the constitution says so and I don’t believe you think it has no value either. I think we just disagree on the limits of it (if you think the only reason free speech is valuable is because of the constitution then I don’t really know what to say). 

So broadly on the two reasons you said Sessions shouldn’t have been allowed to talk 

1) Educational value

Like I said before, this is way too high a threshold to set. If I gave a speech on why I thought unicorns were real, it would enrich nobody’s education. I don’t think the university should censor me though. Setting this as the threshold also makes it absurdly easy for admin to ban anybody they disagree with for being uneducational. 

I didn’t go to see the talk so I’m not sure about this but 
what lies did he tell? I can imagine he packaged information in very misleading ways... but that’s no different than the wage gap myth which has been perpetuated by countless speakers. I’m also fairly certain his speech wasn’t basically fuck minorities. The Daily article said he talked about having a more interventionalist foreign policy and the liberal bias of academia among other things. These seem like issues which are valuable to discuss and not mainstream at NU aka they wouldn’t have been brought up as much otherwise. There’s educational value here - and even if there wasn’t, that’s not adequate reason to censor somebody. 

2) Safety

There’s a difference between somebody actively calling for harm to be done against others and somebody proposing policy proposals which do not favor people. I’m not American, Sessions immigration policies would undoubtedly not benefit me. However I would never play the victim and try to censor him. As somebody else brought up, Obama’s drone strikes have harmed people or people’s’ families on campus. Bill Clinton’s crime bills have harmed people on campus. Should we also ban them from speaking if they wanted to give a talk? Saying that harm could come from policy thresholds is way too restrictive or a standard for censorship.",1573582982,1,0
"I'd say the difference between the directory and the other problems that the Daily found is that the students voluntarily showed up to the event and should have known their pictures would be taken or that quotes they gave would be used whereas your inclusion on the directory is involuntary and there is no opt-out. To me, the Daily should have reached out via email if using a directory. That seems less intrusive to me. Better yet, they should have collected info from people who showed up and agreed to give the Daily their contact details. 

As for quotes, yes, I'd be fine with that policy. The source's perceived safety/privacy rights have always been incredibly important to safeguard the availability of future sources.",1573582917,1,0

"Nice downvoting quality reddiquette.

You are right that we aren’t bound by the first amendment. I never said we were either. Free speech has value outside of the first amendment, it is a good thing to have in and of itself. 

Like it or not, Sessions policy proposals are ones that a sizeable amount of the population supports. It is counterproductive and ridiculous to pretend that they don’t exist and shelter students from it at NU. 

To be clear, is your line for not allowing a speaker that they are uneducational or that they incite violence? The former seems way too restrictive and subjective and frankly I’m not sure what that even means. The latter Sessions wouldn’t fall under. Policy proposals are  massively different from calls to violence. Tbh I’m not even sure how you can argue they are the same. Even if they were the same, bringing him to NU doesn’t cause any additional violence. If you weigh the nonexistent risk of violence against academic freedom it’s clear what comes out on top. 

If you want to give those speeches you should be allowed to. People should also be allowed to call you a moron for doing it. That’s how freedom of speech works.",1573575108,1,0

"I’m a libertarian so when Sessions goes off about civil rights bullshit or immigration issues or some marijuana crap, I’ll be the first to oppose him.

But who decides the point at which “some people just don’t deserve to be listened to”? It can be extremely subjective, and when people say things like “it causes emotional harm”, what the hell does that mean? The way to challenge the rhetoric that Sessions uses is by using logic and actually engaging him, not by trying to silence him. It just adds more fuel to his opinions and his movements.

I’m not intent on listening to people like Sessions; i’m intent on going to a school that will allow me to listen to talks from people from all political ideologies, whether is be communism or socialism (which i despise) to the alt-right/fascism (which i also despise). The best way to be an informed citizen is to hear all opinions, Constricting the range of acceptable opinions is just constricting our society’s thoughts.

I’m just afraid that this subjective metric of “causing harm” is just used as a scapegoat to silence people that you don’t agree with. It seems to me that it’s being used to silence right-wing speakers in many universities.

"I get that we are living in more culturally inclusive (and consequently sensitive) times, which is a good thing 99% of the time, but referring to Jeff Sessions speaking on campus as a ""traumatic event"" is just bizarre to me. Would Obama's drone policy make his speech on campus a ""traumatic event"" for Middle Eastern students or his massive deportation drives traumatic for illegal immigrant students or latinx folk? I doubt it. It really just seems like ""traumatic event"" is code for ""someone I don't like"" or ""Republican/conservative."" As someone who will probably never vote Republican in my life, if there is no massive party movement, this seems so incredibly immature and privileged. I grew up in a very purple state. You do not convince Republicans or moderates that your ideology makes more sense by name calling them or pretending like they are scum. You win ears and hearts by listening to people and talking to them respectfully. That may be harder to do now more than ever, but it is still necessary. This sort of trumped-up language may increase inner-party unity, but it does not grow the number of supporters from outside the cause. 

It sounds like the Daily fucked up regarding how it contacted students and that's about it. If you're going to an event, you can expect to show up in a photograph somewhere. That's the risk of going to the event. If you're giving quotes for an article, you are likely going to be quoted. If students want their quotes removed, that's fine, but pretending like the university would have punished them is pretty bad faith. The university, under the current administration, would never do that.",1573526101,1,0

"/u/ronswanson54321, just to add to this: 

1. Make sure your solid, distinctive reason is not something like ""the school is close to where I live"" or ""it's prestigious."" There are answers I have gotten in the past from applicants, and it does not reflect well on them. Show the interviewer you've done some research about the university and that it brings something unique to the table that you really love. 
2. Dress business casual, but we are specifically instructed not to tell you how to dress. As long as you're not wearing a graphic tea and jeans, you're fine. We are also instructed to not comment on how you dressed. 
3. Definitely arrive 15 minutes early to take into account unfamiliarity with the meeting location or traffic delays. 
4. Agreed, just relax. 
5. Questions are a necessity, as your interviewer will very likely give you the time at the end to ask them. 
6. Do not bring your resume. We are instructed not to accept them. The whole point of this interview is to get to know more about you outside of what you've already submitted to admissions. This interview is much more about ""fit"" than it is about academics. 
7. Express support for our football team if you want. I'm sure the above poster was making a comment in jest, but I know people sometimes don't get that on the internet. Showing that you'll be a passionate Wildcat and proud alumni can go a long way. 
8. I'm burying the lede here, but make sure your answers are nuanced and expansive. They don't need to be novels, but if I asked you what you liked about cooking club and you answered ""making food is fun"" and stopped talking, then that's a useless response for me. Talk about the community you've formed or how deep your passion for food is (maybe even where you got that passion).

Weinberg's CS degree has the same curriculum, though, and I honestly don't think there's a huge difference between a BS and a BA in the industry. So I'd highly recommend taking CS through Weinberg if you are definitely doing the linguistics major; this would keep you in Weinberg and save you some hassle.

There's also a dual degree program if you want to complete the core requirements for both schools: https://www.weinberg.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/major-minor/about-majors/dual-bachelors-degree-programs.html",1574617221,3,0
You can do it in either one you want but you’ll have to take more classes if you decide to go the McCormick route.,1574617070,3,0
"I am a student who is applying to Northwestern this year. I had my interview, in person, and it lasted around 1hour and 5 minutes. The interviewer asked me questions for around 45 minutes and then we had a conversation for around 20 minutes. 

I do not know whether 20 minutes is bad, and I think it depends more on how you felt after your interview. I wouldn't worry if I were you.",1574593489,1,0

"When I first came to campus, I found myself a bit lost in many ways (academic and career goals, social and economic struggles, among other things) and I would like to share a bit of my experience here with you all. I went through quite a lot of difficult life changes when I first got here and I definitely knew I needed to reach out to someone. But I really didn't know where to start or how to even begin. Growing up, I was always very independent and addressing ""mental health"" was unfamiliar to me. I also didn't want to burden others with my own problems. But I'm very thankful now that I can say I am currently receiving the assistance that I need through NU. Here are some things that helped me:  


1. **Dean's Office** \- They assessed my needs and granted me free, full coverage of NU-SHIP, covering all my medical needs. They also guided me through my medical leave (due to a concussion) and supported me. (Shoutout to Mona!! So thankful for this wonderful lady). The Dean's office has many wonderful and amazing people. If you have no idea where to start, go here! 
2. **SES Office** \- I applied through One Form (but the application is now through the Financial Aid Office as the Emergency Fund). I receive reimbursements for my therapy copays (one session is 50 minutes, the copay is $20 but I submit monthly and am lucky to have my expenses covered). They also have a Students Activities Fund (I got reimbursed for Archery Membership dues just by applying!! Super quick and easy). Their office in Plex also has free coffee/tea/hot cocoa and free/open study rooms available! 
3. **Searle Health Center** (located on Emerson St) - I pick up prescriptions/refills, book appointments for any medical/physical needs (very easy to do so on the Student Health Portal!!), and they also have over-the-counter meds, ice/heat packs, painkillers, birth control/emergency contraceptives, etc.
4. **CAPS** \- There are quite a bit of mixed reviews on campus regarding CAPS. I think they are definitely understaffed but the individuals who do work there are wonderful and extremely helpful. I can't speak for others but at times when I needed the most support, I called their number and they booked me for a consultation immediately (to be fair, I was at the point of crying on the phone). I think everyone's experience at CAPS will be different. After a certain point, they referred me to an external therapist (due to limited time/resources and just the way CAPS works). 

I hope I was able to provide useful information from my experiences. Please share yours in comments!!",1574541964,1,0

Because it is speech, to make a political statement.

"I mean, sure? If you think people in general being offended by flags and other symbols is pathetic, I guess. Many people would probably disagree, especially if they feel strongly about the connections/history of that stuff, but you're entitled to think what you want.

But if you think this is just for ""social points"" because they're Chinese, I think you're running a few assumptions under the hood. There are a bunch of people that genuinely find claims of Taiwanese independence frustrating - it's weird to assume that all or even most of them are actually pro-Taiwanese independence and are forced to say otherwise publically.

And even for the people doing it for ""social points""...is that worrying to you because of how ""artificial"" it is? Because that's not just a China thing. Virtue signalling is worldwide, especially on social media. No reason to get more worked up about it happening here.

You're aware it wasn't just the flag of Taiwan, but a flag that supports Taiwanese independence, right? Saying that holding up that flag is no more political than the US flag is the same as saying that the Confederate flag is no more political than the US flag. I think most NU students and alumni, let alone the students in the picture, would have a problem being associated with that. (Not at all saying that Taiwan = the Confederacy, just trying to use an analogy you might be more familiar with to show how touchy this subject can be for mainland Chinese)

"Yes, this is common industry practice. 

The power conferences (Pac-12, B1G, B12, SEC, and ACC) want a couple cupcakes on their schedule every year. These games are normally at the beginning of the season, so they help the teams figure things out in a lower pressure, but still game day, environment. Wins also make the fans happy, even over crappy opponents. Last but not least, two easy wins puts a team only four wins away from becoming bowl eligible. 

The problem is that these cupcake schools have no incentive to come play at a power conference school. Ticket sales go to the hosting school, the cupcake schools know they are going to get clobbered (though, there are rare upsets), and they know the likely losses will hurt their chances to go bowling. How do the power conference schools fix these  problems? Money. They pay the cupcake schools to come out. In a vacuum, the number is always absurd, but then you factor in the fact that roughly 30,000 people showed up for the UMass-NU game, and all of a sudden you break even with an average ticket price of $40. With the absurd amount that some seats cost, $40 is a very possible average ticket cost, even if the median ticket cost is far lower. That does not even include merchandise sales and money from TV contracts.

"IEMS with a minor in computer science can be a good preparation for a data science career (at least you are getting all classes that a data science degree at  schools like Michigan or Purdue requires).

IEMS and CS double major seems to require 55 classes, or 7 classes more than what is required for a McCrmick degree. Without a lot of AP credits or taking 5 classes many quarters, it may be hard to finish in 4 years.

In general, industrial engineering at NU is essentially a ""pre-consulting"" degree for a lot of students. Although, in conjunction with a graduate degree, there have been more people recently using it to prep for a career in data science.  
  
CS, in general, prepares you for a career in tech as a software engineer. And again, you could combine with grad degree if you want to do data science.  
  
If you're interested in statistics, it's honestly way easier to add a stats double major (I think only 9 classes). Career-wise - I don't see a whole ton of benefit in grabbing both.",1576686097,1,0

You are super ahead of the game, so if you contact when everything gets up and running again January 6th, I'm sure they will be able to accommodate you. 

If it aligns with your beliefs, there is an all women's dorm, Hobart House, on campus. For your first year, living on campus would make the transition to college way easier in my opinion! From group projects, to grabbing dinner with people you met in class to going to office hours, club meetings (which almost always happen in the evening), many midterms, living on campus just makes everything way easier!

"First of all, only go to law school if you’re absolutely sure you want to be a lawyer (or do some other career that requires law school). I’d highly recommend looking into the legal studies major/minor because it opened a lot of doors for me that got me lots of work experience when I was in your shoes (I double majored in poli sci and legal studies) I took a couple of years off working as a paralegal after undergrad and I wouldn’t change it for the world—I knew I was making the right to decision to go to law school and it helped immensely during 1L year, and I know a low of people who did similar things and decided that a legal career wasn’t for them. Saved them lots of stress and money! Alright. That’s all for the unsolicited advice!

You’re gonna want the highest GPA you can possibly get! But know that a more average GPA can be offset by an amazing LSAT score. In my experience it’s easier to overcome a median GPA with a 170+ LSAT score than a spectacular GPA with an average to below-median LSAT score. If you can do above average in both metrics, you’re golden and will be very competitive at most T14 law schools. Like others said, a 3.7 is just about median to below median at most top law schools. Other top schools have medians closer to 3.8-3.9. Do your research into why going to a top law school is so important to your future job prospects (this is also something that my legal studies major helped me with).

I’d recommend really thinking on your decision, though. I know a lot of fellow law students who kinda stumbled into law school and hate it, are miserable and see no end in sight because of how much money and time they already invested into it. Just know what you’re getting into!",1576534531,1,0

NU Philharmonia, on the other hand, I feel is treated very much as the ""not serious"" orchestra -- I think Dr. Hasty could really have higher expectations and push the group more. 

Maybe *because* there are very few music students at Cornell, there's more space for non-majors -- so I was a little disappointed when I came here for grad school.

"I think the problem is that Northwestern has always been a college that was sandwiched in and grew in place. A lot of other colleges have rural landscapes to expand into, or had big set out campuses from the beginning. NU started small and stayed small. They had to BUILD land just to expand because the town-gown relationship was so bad at the time.

Because of that, everything just gets developed as needed and there doesn't seem to be a comprehensive design plan. That's why the setup of campus is so nonsensical. Residences all strewn about with no central location. The student center and library are boxed in by a lake and academic building. Dining halls are just kind of randomly interspersed where they fit. Etc.

"I was a minor in Legal Studies but got it mostly by accident. It was a supplemental major I Think (if I remember correctly) so you had to have another main major? But I don't think that's true anymore. But it is by application, so you can't start as a Legal Studies major.

It's a pretty interesting major and the classes I took that counted for it were interesting, though most of them were just random history and sociology classes. It's very much interdisciplinary and I don't think there is a ""picture"" of what it's like for everyone since it's different for everyone.

Mostly, the classes are ones that have at least some tangential relation to law. I took a modern American history class that I think counted simply because we discussed laws and government structures. I took a the sociology of cities that I think counted. One on the history of the development of modern american cities, etc.

Overall, I think it seemed like a pretty interesting and flexible major. When you get to NU, try to take the Law and Society class with Laura Beth Nielsen (I think that's her name, it's at least close) if you can. She was amazing. Very knowledgable, engaging in class, easy to talk to if you needed help or just wanted to chat, etc. She only teaches that one normal undergrad class a year I think.",1575404584,1,0
"You got the right answer below, but I just wanted to add one thing.

The Econ major at NU was reclassified as a STEM major for international visa purposes. That doesn't really add anything to the discussion, I just think it's an interesting point. Our Econ department is pretty well recognized for being decently rigorous on actual math/stats background.",1575403998,1,0
"Lots of people switch out of engineering at NU. Lots of people switch out of engineering everywhere honestly. It's not bad if you decide to switch out at all as long as that's what you want.

Two recommendations: 1) try to find a solid community of people to be with, and I don't mean an overly professional or activity-based group. This sounds unrelated to academics, but NU is tough and really stressful sometimes. Finding a club/organization/community that's a little more relaxed and social is really important imo. A service fraternity, gaming group, archery club, whatever it is, find something that's not overly intense. This will help you not get burnt out whether you do engineering or sometihng else.

2) I, personally, thought NCA was okay. Not great, not bad, just kind of alright. But probably worth a visit at least. Depending on how you feel about your McCormick advisor, they can be very beneficial. My Weinberg adviser was a great help in just talking through my decisions. I obviously had to go to my major advisor for more specific info, but he was also a helpful guide through processing my own thinking.

All that being said, I think one of the best things you can do is talk through it with upperclassmen. Look for older friends/acquaintances who are still in engineering or who started in it and dropped. If you don't know any/many, maybe ask your PA or RA if they know people, which they almost definitely do. Advisors were often great, but a lot of the details of everyday life at NU are something only really the students can ever have a full grasp on.

I'll also add, if you don't enjoy engineering, the value of that degree specifically is a little overblown. Don't get me wrong, it's a great thing to major in if you enjoy it. But I'm pretty sure I read the real average salary of engineers is actually stagnating or declining in the past few years because there's a glut of students pursuing it. I think the only ones still increasing in real wages are more niche ones like electrical, petroleum, etc. Stuff like mechanical, chemical, etc. I think isn't really improving in wages.",1575403825,1,0

And even having a tiny bit of background makes a huge difference in that class. For me, learning the basic CS concepts on top of some random language that google can't help with and just general stuff like running programs and dual booting my laptop and shit was really hard.",1575400434,1,0

"I had it with prof. Lascar last winter. He has participation points where certain days he puts up clicker questions and if you get them right you get the points. You need 6 points total I believe throughout the quarter to get the full credit. If not, you get a 0 for participation even if you had 5/6 of them. There are 3 exams (open books/notes) and there is no curve, mind you. However, averages are around 33/40 so take it as you may. Therefore I recommend you brush up on whatever you forgot or read ahead or else you may end up on the lower end of the distribution. Labs are easier than 135-2 though, easier in the sense that you can actually do them individually with time to spare if you read the manual beforehand and pay attention to the TA's walkthrough. The equations for lab are also just numerical (not much deriving). As for lab reports, the TA you get can make it difficult or easy. In my case, we needed to  do additional questions posed by the TA in addition to the lab report, and some of these involved doing proofs which could get conceptually difficult. He also had a strict format for the reports. It wasn't hard, but just very tedious. I don't know if other TAs did that though. Overall, I learned a lot and it was more enjoyable than 135-2 with prof.

The distribution requirements are also v easy to fulfill. the quarter system also helps boost your gpa if needed because you take 12 (or up to 15) classes a year vs 8 on semester so If you do poorly one quarter you can make it up by taking easy classes the following (important if you’re considering grad school). Many people also end of graduating a quarter or two early so you can save $!

"I took MENU in McCormick, and I'd recommend it if you'd like to consider majoring in math (but for that I would recommend taking math 300 as well). It is alot harder; I cruised by normal calculus classes but was challenged in MENU. If you know you want to stick to engineering but also want harder math try to get into the applied math honors program which is  more based around applications in an engineering setting. Otherwise, MENU is a good otion. Also you probably want to take 290 to start off with, as its calculation based whereas 291 is all proofs. I haven't heard of any McCormick students take 291 as it is just too difficult to do in a reasonable amount of time, and as an engineer you are pretty time pressed.",1568672618,1,0

"As for international admission, when you are applying for admission you will be need-aware. Unlike U.S admission which is need-blind. This means admissions counselors know your demonstrated need and it is considered a factor in your admission. 
While I know a handful of international students who received full financial aid, most were from underrepresented countries or had absolutely stellar credentials. 
You may be at a disadvantage because there are an unbelievable number of applicants (and eventually students) from India each year, many of which do not apply for aid. Make sure your SAT is in the high 1500’s and find a way to stand out! Best of luck.",1568647371,1,0

"Favorite: I loved my PA group. They’re hit or miss for everyone, but we vibed really well and I enjoyed being with them.

Least favorite: It’s a whole few days dedicated to extroverts and it’s really tiring. They give breaks but it’s really not enough. They force you to do the dance and sing songs and,,, well,,, everything was exhausting. It almost makes you look forward to school, which is really sad.",1568638329,1,0
