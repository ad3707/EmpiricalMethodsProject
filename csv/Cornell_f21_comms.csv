"My input of living here in Ithaca for 5 years. Order from Casablanca from DoorDash, they are the best priced and most authentic New York style pizzas in Ithaca that I've tried. And I've never had issues with DoorDash, they give you an entire refund if something was wrong. 

Also, yeah NEVER fucking order from Enzo's/Mama Teresa's Pizza, I have gotten food poisoning from there. The reason it has two names is because the owner is typically vulgar and rude and angry to people who get the wrong order, which he does constantly as a way to cut costs; a lot of Cornell students do not like confrontation let alone being able to handle a phone call. So he changed the name to revive the reputation on review sites.

"Yes, you have it bad and should talk to someone. 

I've also suffered from social anxiety and specifically some of the self-consciousness you mention.

It made me realize, how did I never notice this before? Then I realized, shit, if I didn't notice that then people definitely aren't paying as close attention to me as I've always feared. That moment of realization has stuck with me for 10+ years now and helped me get over some of my anxiety.

The only other thing that will help you is practice. The more you shut yourself away, the more awkward you'll become.

Demographics: Hispanic Asian Male, Upper Middle Class

Target: Applying ED to CALS for Information Science

Academics: 107.24/\~110 Weighted, 97.04/100 Unweighted, SAT 1570/790M/780V (CALS is Score-Free rip)

Activities: MIT Artificial Intelligence Summer Program, DECA President, Math Society Co-President + Math Team Captain, Founding Member of Hackathon Team, Morgan Stanley Finance Program, A Bunch of Competitive Music Things w/ Leadership, 100+ Hrs Community Service Volunteering

Awards: DECA International and State Awards, Regional Hackathon Third Place Team Thing, National Merit Semifinalist, National Hispanic Recognition

Other: Can't really rate essays and letters of recommendation, but I definitely feel like they all connected together under a few themes. Got a supplemental rec from my MIT Instructor, CALS essay talked about my interdisciplinary experiences leading up to choosing Information Science w/ the second half discussing my own fit in Cornell/CALS/InfoSci

My actual question is how much do quarter one senior grades matter? I'm assuming my school will send them for the ED round but I have an 82 in Calc BC atm. All my other class grades are just as good as in previous years, and my core math class grades have always been on the lower end (90-95).

If they did this I would potentially sue them. They forced me to get the vaccine or I would have to leave the country and lose funding that I already have. There is no reason it should have been forced upon me if the goal was my own health; the only justification, which they used, is they are forcing it to prevent spread throughout the population.

And Cornell has so many groups from all over ...

For better or worse most people are social creatures and that have people close to us of various age groups.

Hence, this virus can still hurt me even if not from direct hospitalization and it is absolutely still worthy of being tracked in some capacity.

The point however never goes away that using hospitalizations in the low-age groups (which is also true for covid) is not very meaningful and case counts are a lot more indicative of anything worthwhile. 

At the very least, you are arguing how neither hospitalizations nor case counts would be important for such an age group. But if either would be important, case counts would be the one to use.",1639876159,1,0

"I had to do this last year. I contacted the course administrator for the course I wanted who then gave me approval (If the course you want is full, you need to ask the Professor and the course administrator to make sure they can increase the class enrollment size). For me, I only had to email the course administrator. She filled out the form, gave department approval, and submitted it to the registrar. The registrar then added it to my schedule during add/drop. If I were you, I would email your course administrator as soon as possible to see what steps you should take. Good luck!",1637762866,1,0

"&gt; only 1-5% of all covid cases resulted in hospitalization, the risk to the general public has been quite low since the beginning, the CDC mortality page i keep linking has been the same one since before vaccines.

1/100 to 1/20 odds of getting hospitalized for getting the disease (haven't even double checked this, working directly off your cited stat) sounds pretty awful personally. Especially considering lower-income people who could have more trouble affording the costs (especially in the good ol' USA). But I suppose you don't have to worry about this yourself given your stance on the matter, and are not concerned with other people's health as you also mention.

&gt; i dont outsource my health to people that wear lab coats or a piece of fabric.

...so you're opposed to modern medicine as a whole? That was developed using laboratory science, performed by people in hospitals who have always wore masks. Do you refuse to go to the hospital/doctor, never use any mass-produced medicine, etc.?",1636742692,5,0
