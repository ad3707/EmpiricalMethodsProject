Is it worth it to have an electric scooter on campus?,"I kinda trashed my bike the other day but I have a scooter at home and am contemplating bringing it to campus, but I had a couple of questions:

1) How do people go about locking/storing them when in class? It's a GoTRAX scooter so it's a little heavy and big, but it folds and can be carried. Is it smarter to bring it into classes or to just lock it outside tech or wherever?

2) Going off the last question, what scooter locks would you recommend, and are there often cases of them being stolen despite being properly locked?

3) Is it actually realistic to expect to use it in the winter? I know how brutal the wind is when using them so I want to make sure I won't be freezing to death when the temperature drops and I use it.

Transfer Advice,"Hello,

I am currently miserable at my school and am looking to transfer places. For reference, I have a 3.89/4.0 GPA and majoring in psychology and criminolgy (but may switch to criminal justice, pre-law, legal studies, or sociology if crim is not offered). I think I have a pretty solid resume for having lots of leadership and work experiences, on campus and home. There are many reasons why I want to transfer. 1. My academics are too easy. I am on the track to graduate in 3 years with two majors, a minor, and a certificate. 2. My school is a cult, and everyone admits it. These are honestly the rudest and most selfish people I have ever come across in my life 3. This is a very big party school. I know that most colleges have a lot of partying and students drinking, but that's the entire culture here. It is very difficult to find a group of people who will actually be friends and do things with you other than party and drink 3-4 days a week. 4. I need better friends. I've had so many people within the now starting two years of being here pretend to be my friend and not really be. I've been excluded from more things than I have been invited, and I have noticed that the friends I have made in class only talk to me for help on exams or to get notes. I'm sure that this sounds like a lot of complaining, but being here has been really bad for me mentally and physically. My school is in a very rural area and not requriing the vaccines, so COVID and symptoms have been going around like crazy (at least 2 students died from it and students have admitted that they don't care). It's just a very toxic atmosphere for me here and I am sick of crying myself to sleep every night. 

I have a couple of questions:

1. What is the transfer process like? I'm looking at statistics, but I want to know from the student perspective. Are there opportunities for transfers to make friends and fit in at school, even as a junior in college? I'm not too concerned about the academic side as I really like school and learning and I'm pretty good at managing that. I'm just worried that I will end up sitting in my dorm alone all of the time. Which speaking of, what is the housing like for transfers? I know some schools have a transfer dorm, is that offered here? I'd like to be on campus because I feel like that is an easier way to connect with others and the school, especially not knowing the area well enough to find somewhere off campus.
2. What do you like and dislike about the school? Before I make my decision if I am accepted, I want to know if it is actually worth transferring in to. Let me know about why you guys do or don't like it here
3. What is the party scene like? The school I'm currently at has a top ranking for party schools. I know that it is a normal college thing to go out and get drunk. For health reasons, I can't drink in general, but have gone out a couple of times with friends while they get wasted. I don't mind maybe like once a month, but people at this school do it almost daily (there are some people who do it multiple times a day, everyday). I'm kind of an introvert, and love nights in playing games, baking, watching Netflix, etc. I like to have fun and make memories, I'm just not into going out and getting drunk all of the time. I'd like to surround myself with like-minded people, but that is just not possible here. How easy would it be to find good friends who feel the same as me? Or is the student life just always going out?

Sorry that that was a lot. I would truly appreciate any feedback that you guys can give me. This school was actually not my first choice, but a last minute decision that appeared to be the best (which I now know isn't the case). I would really like to turn my college career around and be happy. If I end up staying another year for the degrees or to catch up on the year I lost from COVID, I'm fine with that. Again, I just really need to get out of here. Also, would it look bad if I took a gap semester in the spring before coming in the fall? I'm not sure if I can last here any longer mentally. I may take some community college classes, but that may be too many credits to transfer and a waste of money.",1633823236,1,0

Students and NFTs unlocking campus properties,"Its been incredible to see the overflow of creativity in the NFT Marketplace

I wanted to present a more utilitarian NFT which involves community input and buy in.

RealCryptoEstate Keys are NFT collectibles, but also a social experiment in these early days to see how well glued the NFT community is.

Enter: mintable --&gt; realcryptoestate

Currently, people may be buying and selling their homes by accepting Bitcoins/crypto. Other aspects of the real estate transaction such as hiring a real estate lawyer for documentation (title/deed), would still require Fiat. 

How RealCryptoEstate Keys work:

\-The first buyer of the NFT holds the key and also kickstarts the journey

\-They may choose to sell to another community member on campus for ETH or Fiat, which would be used to fund their property purchase

\-This could then be used: a rental deposit, a first home, an investment property near a college campus etc. The seller of the NFT can always use to convert their realized gains to Fiat and purchase

\-The original key holder effectively unlocks a property with the NFT and that key starts taking a course that would be fascinating to follow.

\-The second holder of the key can sell the NFT to another community member and the process repeats

\-The NFT key can also be traded directly for a property to a seller willing to accept the NFT/ETH (other local real estate transactions processes and registration would still use Fiat).

Each key takes on a life of its own and the course it takes can be followed. This will require NFT holders to note where they are from and the kind of the property they acquired with as much or little detail as they would like. At the very least, the Country or City the key lands in would be interesting to follow.

Tracking can happen on Reddit (realcryptoestatekeys), or Twitter realcryptoestate

Imagine the NFT key jumping Towns, Counties, Borders, Countries and Continents. The data provided will have zero malcontent, but simply show how well adopted NFTs are and how well connected we all are. 

The price of 1-2 ETH accounts for the higher amount that real estate transactions typically requires. 

The first few phases could see the key unlocking a modest first home, mobile home, or a campus investment property . Eventually, the key could take on a path towards unlocking a home on the Bird Streets (LA), a Hamptons Estate (NY), Rosedale (TOR), Winecountry Estate (FR), Castle (UK), Danang Beach property (VN).

OK! So lets go unlock the World!

I know that there is no way I can afford a rental in the nearby suburbs (I'd need at least 3 bedrooms). I grew up on the south side and I think that's affordable for me but there would be safety concerns to be honest.

I'm a prospective ED applicant. Which college should I apply to?,"A bit of additional information: I'm not entirely sure what I want to major in yet, but I've narrowed it down to civil engineering, communication studies, and other related or similar fields. Civil engineering is my current top pick, but I'm a little hesitant about the engineering core. My options right now are as follows:

1) Apply to McCormick, take engineering courses for a year, and if I'm dissuaded by them transfer to another college within the university.

2) Apply to the School of Communications (or maybe Weinberg) and take enough engineering courses that I could transfer to McCormick later if I want easily.

Any insight or advice would be helpful. I'm also curious as to how people feel about NU's dual degree programs, and in particular about doing a dual degree in music. How manageable is it, and how hard is it to start the program sophomore year?",1633317867,1,0

Hello, Is there anyone in the Master of **Science in Energy &amp; Sustainability Program?** I am interested in this program, while the information about the class sounds limited. 

My background is B4 consultant, and I want to choose renewable energy and EV industry as my postmaster focus industry. Five years of working experience focused on public sector smart city-related projects. As an international background in Asia, the employment situation might be a priority for me.

If anyone can share more about this program career support, job market insight and class experience,

* How is the capstone experience? Does it provide a great connection with a potential hiring company?
* How is the recruit situation for the international students?
* Tesla-like company and business development position\\project management is my focus; anyone can share?

As nontypical energy background Asian students, what regular job they did after this program?

And I’m already so overwhelmed and stressed out with school and my mental health has deteriorated so fast already (i already have a weekly therapist and monthly psychiatrist appts, not sure what else to do lol) 

At home, I didn’t have to worry about figuring out meals and grocery shopping entirely on my own, cleaning, accounting for 10-15 minute walks everywhere which takes up time, or getting ready and looking presentable every single day.  Living at home was just WAY easier!! Obviously I helped with grocery shopping and cooking and running errands at home, but it was a team effort. My roommates and I get along great but we all just do our own thing with meals etc. 

And also I’m processing  this duality of being socially exhausted while also feeling socially alone (I have lots of newer friends, but not the same as my super close friends and family at home). 

And I’m 100% for masks, don’t get me wrong, but with all this stress, my sensory issues are heightened and all I could focus on in class today was the feeling of my mask driving me absolutely nuts.

Medill MSJ Chances?,"Hi all, I am in the midst of applying for a Master's of Science in Journalism with a Health, Environment and Science specialization from Medill, but am unsure as to what my realistic chances are, and what I should be emphasizing.

I graduated a few years ago from a decent (not top tier) school with a good 3.7 GPA, but I never even grazed journalism during undergrad. I double majored in International Relations and Chinese, and all my experience in journalism has been professional since graduation, and kind of accidental. I've spent around the past year and a half working at an environmental journalism start-up, first as an intern but after a few months was promoted to a high-up editor position with a lot of responsibilities. I recently left this job as I was offered a 6 month editorial fellowship in reporting with an important and well-known US media outlet. I honestly never considered journalism as a career, but the past year has really opened up my eyes to the field and to how much I love writing and reporting, especially environmental news.

My question is, how much will my lack of demonstrated interest towards journalism as an undergraduate be counted against me? How much will my professional experiences (albeit limited) help me out? And I guess most importantly, just how necessary is a masters to launch a career in journalism? Should my experiences and upcoming networking and learning opportunities from my fellowship be enough to offset the benefits of continuing my education and getting a degree in journalism?

Help Me Hear Your Stories in Navigating Northwestern's STEM Curriculums,"Hi everyone,

Reading a lot of posts on this subreddit, I have found that a lot of people criticize / complain about NU and in many ways these complaints are sometimes related to academics. As a result, I thought an initiative I am leading would be particularly relevant here and was hoping to reach some of you to hear what you have to say. I am hoping to work with administration to make your concerns heard and to push for some changes to be made.

More specifically:

I am currently collecting feedback on how Northwestern’s STEM curriculums can often be overly taxing on students, especially those of us coming from underrepresented (i.e first-generation, low-income, poc) backgrounds. My end goal would be to encourage administration to make some changes in either broader, major curriculums, or to change up some of the courses required by some degrees. Please fill out the form below (or comment) if you have at any point in your undergraduate career have felt like a specific class has been severely imbalanced (has demanded way too much of you) or if you feel like your degree as a whole has been like this. Within the form I included a document describing my experience with McCormick as well as the experiences of several other students that have filled out the form. Given that STEM degrees often have overlapping requirements, I believe insights from everyone would be helpful. Be as specific or as broad as you would like, whether it be one sentence or a memoir, I want to hear what you have to say.

[https://forms.gle/fbDNAwXGG9aHrAPbA](https://forms.gle/fbDNAwXGG9aHrAPbA)

Sorry if the form seems kind of sparse, I meant for it to be very open ended. Definitely check out the Google Doc linked inside for more detailed information. Also feel free to share this further as I am hoping to reach as many people as possible! 

P.S the form is completely anonymous!

If you don't feel like filling out the form, feel free to comment below as well!

Thank you all so much!

Plan your years at Northwestern with Plan Northwestern,"I always see a lot of people manually making spreadsheets for their 4-year plans, so I decided to simplify the process with a new website: Plan Northwestern!

&amp;#x200B;

**Plan your classes**

Search across every course at Northwestern and drag them into your plan. You can search by course number and course name, and you can also view the course description, course prerequisites, and distribution areas right from the website. There are even a bunch of placeholders you can use (for example, a theme course placeholder) if you aren't sure which class you want to take to fulfill a requirement.

&amp;#x200B;

**Make multiple plans, save, and share**

The URL saves all of your plan data and is updated as you add or remove courses, so you can just save the URL somewhere to access your plan again. Of course, you can save as many URLs as you want, and you can send them to others so they can view a copy of your plan, or maybe use it as a starting point for theirs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Customizable**

Attending for more than four years? You can add up to ten. Taking classes over the summer? You can add a summer quarter to any years you want. You can customize what information you see with a bunch of settings. There's dark mode, too, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

**Easy to use**

Easily and quickly search for any course, and just drag and drop them into the quarter you want. If you don't want to drag and drop (or if you're on mobile), you can just click on the course and select the quarter you want to add it to.

&amp;#x200B;

**Feedback appreciated**

I'm always open to adding new features and making the site better. There are easy ways to post bugs and suggestions.

In addition to our chapter encouraging young and diverse populations to donate to Carter Blood Donation Center, we also participate in advocacy work. We believe it is not fair to engage such populations without also fighting to make the blood world a fair and more equitable place. Our major focuses are the MSM deferral, racism in the history of donation, and sickle cell disease. For example, we partnered with COLLAGE, GMHC, and ACT UP on our Advocacy Art Challenge.

NW SPS vs College of Engineering at another school,"I was recently admitted into the Masters in Data Science program at Northwestern, as well as the Masters in Data Science programs at Rice and Tufts University. All these programs are online, and the curriculums and tuitions are similar, so it’s really coming down to reputation and prestige at this point. 

Objectively, Northwestern is more well known, is a higher ranked school, and has more prestige, but I know that the school of professional studies is easier to get into, so I don’t know if this brings down the prestige level. The Rice and Tufts programs are part of the College of Engineering at the respective schools. Also, the Rice and Tufts programs have the exact same program offered in person, too, whereas Northwestern’s is only offered online. Since these programs are relatively knew at all the schools, there isn’t too much data and stats out there, either. 

Idek if any of this matters since it’s not like which school the program is a part of will be on my resume. Is this something that future employers would a) look up or b) care about? Do employers care more about school or program reputation? Any insight would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",1638405824,1,0

Medill? Indecisive about Major,"Hi! I applied ED to NU this year, and although results didn’t come out yet and I shouldn’t get ahead of myself, I’m already having doubts about my major. 

I applied to Medill but I know I want to double major in International Studies and/or Econ, the question is do I want to do journalism as well? 

Here are my concerns:

1. Journalism is a dying field and it doesn’t pay well. Our family isn’t financially comfortable enough to support me as I struggle to find a sufficient job after college. Ideally, I would love to have a decently paying job so I can support my living costs and pay loans by myself. I heard that Medill‘s prestige in the journalism field makes landing a job somewhat easier, along with alumni connections and such. But to what extent do these help? Is it worth majoring in journalism just for these opportunities/advantages? 

2. I am horrible at deadlines. Idk if I want to have a career that relies so heavily on flushing out articles on a timely basis. I’m really more interested in the long-term projects like documentaries or something like that. Does Medill offer classes for these type of interests? How good are they? 

3. One reason I’m fine with “settling” with journalism is because it would greatly enhance my writing skills in general, which will help me with careers that aren’t necessarily traditional journalism based. (Marketing, etc) Again, the question is, is it worth majoring if I know I probably won’t go into that exact field? 

I already read a lot of disappointing posts about Medill’s courses on Reddit lol which is why I’m having this dilemma. 

Can anyone share their experiences with Medill? (The vibe, workload, fun?, usefulness, career prospects, etc.)",1638155915,1,0

Did I make a mistake applying ED to NU?,"I don't know exactly where these feelings started, but I've been having horrible swings in my mood about my ED application to NU, and I need someone to tell me straight on whether I'm being stupid, or whether I should actually withdraw my ED app.

In essence, I'm a strong student overall (36 ACT, 4.0, good ECs, Northwestern internship, research, etc) with a mediocre-ish essay. Because of a mix of procrastination and low self confidence, I felt as though my essays turned out pretty poorly (they're probably average-good, but nothing insane). For a long while, I had always had my eyes set on the Ivies (but for nothing more than prestige reasons). Due to a mixture of panic, anxiety, and wanting a sense of finality by December, I decided to apply ED to Northwestern instead, since I really liked the school and thought it would be great to be done with everything by December (assuming I get in, which I thought I had a higher chance of with NU).

Now, don't get me wrong, I love the idea of being a Northwestern student, did an immense amount of research on the school, and would still love being a student at NU. It's just that the more I read about the school and its culture, the more I feel like there is a chance I might not end up not enjoying the experience. For one, I don't plan on drinking or doing any heavy partying, yet past testimony and words on this sub suggest that I could be screwed socially if I don't partake in either of those things+Greek Life. I'm also thinking of doing a CS/Econ double in Weinberg, which I've heard more mixed-to-positive things about, but again, uncertain about this as well. I'm defo a less socially-outgoing, more laid-back person who would prefer a balance between small hangouts and outings, so again, idk how well I would fit at NU with such a personality. I've started to have thoughts that a place like Brown would have that more casual, intellectual environment compared to NU, but again unsure if it would be worth the risk of withdrawing just for this. I also am not suuuper sporty/into sports (like I enjoyed watching as a kid, but I've kinda lost interest in the past years)...don't know if I'd be super into sporting events, but this is very trivial. Correct me if I am wrong about any of these things/if you have an alternate opinion.

I'm still like 90% certain I'll be happy as a student at NU, but I also know people around me will always ask why I ""settled"" and didn't shoot my shot at an Ivy. So basically, should I withdraw, risk it all, and try to shoot my shot in RD at the Ivies (and NU, if that's possible), or just stick w/ NU ED and not look back?",1638071717,1,0

Do you have to live on campus to make friends?,"Ugh so I am a sophomore this year and I lived off campus all year last year w/my boyfriend (who doesn't go to NU). I kind of regret it a tiny bit because I think living in dorms would've allowed me to meet way more ppl but oh well, it was the choice I made at the time. I also got a housing exemption for this year so I now have a lease that doesn't end until June, trapping me off campus. 


I'm kinda worried this is going to make it hard to make friends this year. I went to the norris night event last night and it was lowkey miserable to be there w/o knowing *anyone*. I'm skipping the rest of the wildcat welcome events and just hoping I can meet people in classes and clubs, but I'm worried everyone has already grouped up and it's going to be a LOT harder since I'm not living in a dorm. I did make one friend at NU online last year, but ideally I'd like to know more than one person here. I have other friends in the chicago area so it's not like I have no friends at least (still salty my best friend had the audacity to go to uchicago though), but it still really sucks. 


I'm guessing not many ppl had my experience because usually you're forced to live on campus and I think the housing exemptions are hard to get. I live in rogers park so I'm fairly close to NU and once school starts I should be spending all day most days on campus. If you had to guess, how feasible do you think it would be to just meet people through classes and clubs? I have *some* faith in my social skills/I'm not super shy or antisocial. But I'm definitely not super extroverted. And also yesterday my faith was shaken. 

Idk I really figured I’d be fine but wildcat welcome was depressing and now I’m not as sure 🥲",1631984766,1,0

So when I was applying, and like filling in my first year major, I accidentally wrote physics just from habit, cause like physics is another on my really big interests, but I was planning on submitting something like cognitive science or something in bio. Instead of this (like a fool) I just submitted my application.

Will this sink me? Should I call and see if they could possibly change it? I would be able to call them nov. 1st so It would be before their deadline. Does it actually matter that much tho?

- Look up specialists for your issue
- Be as specific as you can be (color, race, sex, age, political affiliation)
- Schedule as many initial consults (it's free)
- In-person vs Telehealth
- Do your own research on the different treatments out there

should I take Spanish 203 as a freshman who’s not totally confident in her Spanish?,"Hi! I placed in Spanish 203 because I got a 5 on AP Spanish during my junior year. I’m thinking about possibly minoring in Spanish, so I definitely do want to take a couple classes during my 4 years here. But, I’m really nervous to take Spanish 203 because it’s definitely a lot more challenging than the introductory courses, and I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep up. I did get a 5, but that was like 2 years ago and because of COVID, it was pretty easy to get an A in the class. I did study a lot for the exam, but it was a shortened version that I’m not sure I would’ve done as well on if it were the full one. My senior year, I took an intermediate Spanish course that was painfully easy, so I definitely forgot a bit especially since graduating. My advisor said I don’t need to take Spanish this quarter, but I’m afraid that if I wait more, I’ll keep forgetting the language and it’ll just be harder for me. Thanks!

tldr; I was placed in Spanish 203 but I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep up because it’s been a while since I’ve studied Spanish at a high level. I’m afraid that I’ll just forget more if I push it back to a later quarter. Any advice?",1631149646,1,0

How possible is it for someone to shift from career in HCI to Private Equity?," 

Professionals in Human Computer Interaction help in creating websites and apps for tech companies, SaaS cos, FMCG companies, etc; which is using the ideas of 'mass psychology' for commerce.

Using the skills accrued while working in HCI, MBA should help get the aptitude to slide into Private Equity; as managing / flipping a business is largely about knowing market consumption i.e. what market wants and cash flows  
(not entirely though, talent management and etc too are required);  
Hence, an HCI degree will have transferrable skills of how consumption works and then an Ivy League MBA will help get foot in the door for buy side finance.

I have a degree in finance from a regular college in Mumbai with a 3.0 GPA. Worked in State Street Bank for a year and then slid into advertising during the pandemic. Private Equity takes the elite of the elite of B School recruits and the aim is to sharpen your profile as one, hence I chose HCI as it is a easy transition for me as I am already doing the same work in advertising. The intent is to have a great profile and preferentially work in Management Consulting (as Accenture and BCG too have Ux roles) to sharpen up my profile and skills in making products for mass consumption and then get my MBA to transition in Private Equity

My questions

1. How possible is it?
2. What do I have to be prequalified with before applying for an MBA? Would CFA work? (large part of that is corporate finance)...Would courses from Wall Street Oasis, Peak Frameworks, Corporate Finance Institute work?
3. Do they need pre MBA industry experience or will it be the same ritual ie working in M&amp;A for an investment bank first after MBA and then get in PE after some experience?

Also, the aim for MBA is either Ivy League / M7 like Northwestern or bust",1636650259,1,0

I know that I have until the end of sophomore year to declare a major, so maybe I can start preparing for my audition next year.

BA/MS in CS or double major in CS?,"Hey guys, 

I'm a junior who's almost done with the Psychology major, and I started taking CS classes last quarter, so I haven't completed very many CS courses. Currently, I'm considering either double majoring in CS and Psych or doing the BA/MS program for CS. Either way, I will be able to graduate on time. 

Getting a Master's in CS seems more prestigious because it apparently allows you to have higher pay. And surprisingly, the BA/MS program actually has fewer credit requirements than the CS major, which is really appealing for someone like me learning CS late in the game. However, I'm not sure if the data showing the pay raise is only applicable to people who got a bachelor's in CS as well (and not in some other field).

Was the HEERF aid for everyone receiving financial aid? Or just some of these people?,"Back in October people I know got emailed that they were going to receive money due to the HEERF funds that Northwestern was allocated. The [website](https://www.northwestern.edu/sfs/help/faqs-heerf.html) says:

""Who will receive Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds (HEERF) funds?

Evanston undergraduate students receiving need-based aid in the Fall quarter of the 2021-22 academic year, and PhD, DMA and full-time MFA students currently enrolled in the 2021-22 academic year are eligible for these funds.""

Does this mean that everyone who receives need-based financial aid should have gotten a check due to HEERF? Or do only people who receive a certain level of aid get a check? In the latter case I'm probably not eligible, but in the former I definitely am. So I want to make sure I didn't miss out in the former case due to the email not coming through or something.

The first thing I did was email [NUHEERF@northwestern.edu](mailto:NUHEERF@northwestern.edu), but after weeks and more emails from me that haven't answered my question. So I was wondering if there are people here who receive aid and didn't get HEERF, or conversely people who don't receive much aid but did get emailed about it.",1636831235,1,0

My realistic chances at Northwestern,"I'm an international student who would really like to attend Northwestern University applying to major in Economics.

Higher Levels:

-Economics-6

-Business Management-7

-Arabic B-7

Standard Level:

-English A-6

-Biology-7

-Math Analysis-6

With the additional two points from EE and TOK.

I have, I believe, good ECs that are unique to where I come from, and gotten a few awards and did a fair amount of volunteer work. My letters of recommendation I am sure are really good since the teachers really like me and respect me. I am happy with my Northwestern essay and my personal essay is decent. Plus I am a legacy student (my father got his Masters from Kellog).

However there is something that it really worrying me, I have a gotten a C in IB Math and I am really concerned that this will get me rejected from Northwestern. Also, I am asking for financial aid, but not asking for an extreme amount.

Question about McManus Center,"Hey guys, I just got admitted to Kellogg for the Fall 2022 term :) . I am an international student so I think that living in McManus would be the most convenient option for me and would allow me to interact with more students. I have some questions that I could find online regarding McManus that I was hoping to ask you guys.

1. Can I rent “Two Bedroom Family” room even though I don’t have a spouse ? 

2.  Do they allow parents to stay in such room for 1-2 weeks ? (This would allow me to take care of them when they are visiting from abroad)

3. Is there bike parking available ? Is bike theft common ?

4. Is the range electric, induction or gas ? 

5. Is the “acceptance rate” for McManus high or low ? Does every student who apply gets a room?

Thank you so much! See you soon.",1639340790,1,0

Probably very few people agree with me on everything. I just don’t see the possibility of forming an entirely new social circle here.

The avoidance of contradiction by SCIENTISTS:Mathematicians DoubleThink,"Magister colin leslie dean points out

The avoidance of contradiction by SCIENTISTS:Mathematicians DoubleThink

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink

Doublethink is a process of indoctrination whereby the subject is expected to simultaneously accept two mutually contradictory beliefs as correct, often in contravention to one's own memories or sense of reality.

EXAMPLE

you know 0.9999... (the 9s dont stop) is a infinite decimal thus non-integer by notation

you know 1 is an integer

yet you also believe

you say

1=0.9999...

without contradiction

because now you say

0.999... is now an integer

here is the doublethink

1 integer = 0.9999... non-integer infinite decimal

ie

an integer is /=a non-integer

which is a contradiction in terms -which your doublethink does not see

thus

maths ends in contradiction

AccessibleNU question,"Current freshman here. Although I did well academically my first quarter, I really have difficulty falling asleep before my finals, I’d always go to bed on time but would either not be able to fall asleep or simply wake up too early due to anxiety despite taking medicine as prescribed by my physician. This meant I ended up taking all of my finals on just 3 hours of sleep. It’s specifically an issue with finals since they are scheduled early from 9am - I never had issues with midterms as they were much later in the day (~7pm). 
I’m not too sure if this is something I could discuss with AccessibleNU, perhaps asking them if I could take the final at a time later during the day. I’m afraid they will just see this as me trying to gain some sort of “advantage” by taking it later, or perhaps taking it earlier and telling other students the questions.

Mechanical Engineering Exchange Student in Spring 2023 (!)... What courses to choose?,"Ok so this goes a long way but hear me out. I am a Mechanical Engineering Master's Student at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, and I am set to spend an exchange quarter at NU in Spring 2023. Going through the whole application process takes a long time, which is why I have apply for an outgoing exchange at my home university already this January 2022.

As part of my application, I have to hand in a preliminary study plan (of course, I can still change it later). Since the course catalogue for Spring 2023 does not exist yet (duh!), I will go off the courses from Spring 2021 and assume they'll stay more or less the same (is this correct?).

My question is if any of you can recommend any particularly good courses or have any tips on how to plan your courses at NU. I know this is subjective, but at least at my uni, there are always some courses which are well-known to be good (or bad!), be it due to the lecturer, the content, or whatever.

I am studying mechanical engineering, and am specializing in Robotics, Systems and Control. I am also interested in computational engineering and applied math. Also, by 2023 I will be a grad student with 4.5 years of studying on my back, so maybe you can recommend good courses for more senior students? As far as I can see, there is no way of seeing a priori which courses are recommended for which level of studying - is this correct?

These are all the courses I am considering:

- Mech Eng: https://class-descriptions.northwestern.edu/4820/MEAS/MECH_ENG
- Eng Sci and App Math: https://class-descriptions.northwestern.edu/4820/MEAS/ES_APPM
