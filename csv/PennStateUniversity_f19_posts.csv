How good or bad is the wifi in the dorm buildings?,"Hey all, I'm an alumni.  I used to work for Residential Computing (back when it was founded!) and I was curious how the wifi is in the dorm buildings.  Back in my day, there was no wifi, only 2 ethernet jacks per room.   It seems like the process now is only slightly less painful (registering mac addresses for each connected device, etc)

When it comes to Roku/Xbox One/PS4/Netflix/Hulu, etc, do you get good reliable signals?   Any latency in playing games or hiccups when streaming Netflix?

How do I go about cremating my pet in State College?,"I'm very sorry for posting this here but r/statecollege has 700 members and I don't know who else to turn to at 2:30am.

TDLR: I'm bad at looking for these things especially in the state I'm in right now. Does anyone know of places in PA within a 2 hour drive that could cremate my poor bunny?

Math 411 vs Math 417,"I want to take at least one 400 level differential equations course, and out of the four offered, I have narrowed it down to these two. If you have taken one of these two, could you tell me how rigorous these two were compared to each other? 

On one hand I've noticed that 411 is listed as a prerequisite for a few graduate courses, and since I'm planning to go to graduate school, it might be a good option. On the other hand, I'm very interested in dynamical systems and since 417 offers some insight into this field, I'm attracted to this course as well. 

I suppose the tie breaking factor for me would be the level of rigor employed in each of these courses: I would like to take the course which is more ""theoretical"" than the other. So, I'd appreciate any insight from those who have taken these courses. Thanks!",1571282914,1,0

Penn State World Campus Questions,"Hey all, I'm thinking of transferring to the online campus. I am presently a Virginia resident. I was wondering if you could help me learn a little bit more about the school.

Can you speak to internship opportunities (while in school) as well as your success with job searches, especially taking into consideration it is an online program?
2. If I were to get in touch with an advisor, could I get a transfer credit evaluation of some kind  done before I apply so I know which of my current university credits will transfer?
3. Do out-of-state and in-state students pay the same amount of tuition for the online campus? Or, being a Virginia resident, do I need to pay out-of-state tuition? I did do my research, and could only find a per-credit hour charge, nothing for in-state/out-of-state.

The Mystery of the Steam Tunnels,"Recently something very strange has been going on the in the steam tunnels underneath campus. The tunnels have always been place of interest. Back in 2002 a group of students went down and explored and mapped the tunnels. Since then, all entrance to the steam tunnels has been strictly banned and motion sensors have been added to the entrance. 

Four weeks ago I first noticed something strange happening in the tunnels. I saw what looked like a group of figures entering one of the steam grates. Since then I have been obsessed with what is going on in them. 

I did some research into what could be happening in the tunnels. I tried to find anyone that would be given access to the tunnels other than staff. Maybe a exploration club or secret society. The school confirmed that they have a zero tolerance for students entering the tunnels, and wouldn't give anyone access due to safety concerns. That raised the question, what did I see going into those tunnels?

Maybe I just saw some construction workers doing a late shift. But they weren't wearing high visibility clothes and there almost a dozen of them. Maybe it was some students sneaking into the tunnels. But how did they get in and not set off any alarms?

I can only see one explanation, there is a secret much bigger than any club or ""secret society"". Consider the possibility that there is a fourth secret society. A real secret society, unlike the three that are commonly known. A secret society with student and faculty involvement. They meet in the only place they know they would never get caught.

At a school like Penn State a society like this would have incredible power. Skull and bones, Parmi nous, and Lion's paw are really just glorified clubs, for leaders to socialize with each other without holding any real power. Now, a secret society with faculty involvement, that would have power. Students would be able to directly influence the school without being elected and entirely in secret. It would be a schoolwide scandal.

I know my theory is a long shot, so I've been doing some investigating into the possibility. The first time I noticed people entering the grates was on a Tuesday around midnight. The following Tuesday around 11 I visited all the grates locations I knew of to see if I could find them again. I couldn't find anyone, but I did hear music coming from the grates outside the eisenhower auditorium. The following Tuesday was a total bust. After walking the path of the grates for an hour I found nothing. 

I think it is likely that they alternate the days that they visit in order to make their presence more difficult to find. Instead, they might have seen my previous post on the subject and changed the day they meet.

Since the second week I haven't found any more evidence that people are meeting in the steam tunnels, but I'm only one person, and I can't be everywhere at once. My hope is that people reading this might be interested and decide to help me find the truth of this situation. 

I think it is unlikely they would have this post removed, but I suspect it will drive them to be more careful in the future. Stay sharp. The truth is here, we just need to find it.",1569265282,37,0

"Turning 21 tonight, need some tips","The long wait is over. I can finally shred my fake ID. Naturally, I'm gathering up some buddies tonight to make a trip to the Phyrst.

I need some advice from some veterans. As the bar scene is impossible to get involved in unless you're 21+, I have no experience with it (in State College at least). 

Right now I'm planning on heading to the Phyrst at around 11:30p. Will I be able to get in before midnight? Will it be crowded?

I've also heard that other bars downtown won't let me in on my 21st, or won't serve hard alcohol. If this is the case, any other bar suggestions besides the Phyrst?

Just thought I'd add this in here: I like to drink but I almost never get belligerent. Not the type to drink until I can't speak/stand up. So getting kicked out / turned away at the door (probably) won't be an issue, except maybe at the phyrst (I've heard they're strict)Ôøº.

PSU after football,"Let's assume for the sake of argument that college football as we know it ceases to exist in the future.  Concussion fears lead to lawsuits, regulation, nobody left to insure it, I don't care.  I'm not interested in arguing about how likely this is; just take it as an assumption.  I am wondering about how you think this would play out at PSU.

1) How would it happen?  Who even has the power to do this?  Perhaps PSU would be among the last schools clinging to football as other programs shut down nationwide.  On the other hand, I bet that if you took a vote of the faculty today, it's entirely possible a majority of them would vote in favor of shuttering the football program immediately.  PSU also has one of the most overreaching risk management offices of any university.  So it could happen quickly, but depends on who is involved in the decision.

2) What would it mean for PSU sports?  Would football culture just transfer to another sport?  Maybe soccer?  Would we get as many visitors every weekend?

3) How would it affect PSU academically?  Less public interest leads to declining state funding?  Harder time recruiting students leads to decline in undergrad quality?  Or lack of hooligan culture gets us more serious students?  What about faculty recruitment?

4) What would it mean for the town?  Obviously hotels and restaurants etc would lose a lot of revenue.  Some of the stores selling blue and white crap or restaurants catering to alum nostalgia would probably go out of business.  But this would also lead to falling rents, and maybe other restaurants and small stores would be more viable.

Anyway, feel free to weigh in on these or anything else in the hypothetical. Please don't weigh in on the likelihood of the scenario itself.  One hope think the town or university would have already thought about this; does anybody know of a report somewhere?",1568664122,0,0

Upstairs neighbors are becoming a nightmare to deal with at the Pointe,"Since the first week of school, often at varying times throughout the day, my upstairs neighbors have been extremely loud in their day to day activities. These times can range from as early as 11am to as late as 3am on random days throughout the week. 
What they do is not limited to:
Stomping their feet extremely hard. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôre trying to break the floor with how hard it is, it makes stuff in my room shake sometimes too.

Screaming either off the balcony or inside. It can be heard quite easily since we have one window cracked open. Screaming is incoherent and usually sounds like gibberish so I couldn‚Äôt make anything out.

Throwing....something. I can‚Äôt really describe this, but it sounds like someone‚Äôs picking up pieces of furniture and lobbing it across the room. 

My roommates and I have discussed this as the problem hasn‚Äôt gone away. I left a note on their door asking them to please tone whatever it is they‚Äôre doing because it‚Äôs become a nuisance to all of us. They haven‚Äôt seemed to really follow that and we even have reason to believe they vandalized our door decoration yesterday after my roommate yelled at them from the balcony to be quiet because he was trying to sleep, around 1AM.

From what I understand, I have only seen 2 females and 1 guy who lived there. I don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù who reports someone for being loud, but I have run out of patience with them.",1572529670,5,0

"Going up next year, just needed to rant","Hey guys, when I first began attending my commonwealth campus for the 2+2, I was a fervent believer in the whole ""one university, many campuses"" statement that gets thrown around by a lot of the administration. Now I'm finding out what I've always suspected. A lot of the opportunities at UPark are barred to me just because I'll be a junior when I get up there. 

I'm majoring in Finance so I wanted to try to get onto the NLF, however slim my chances were. Now I know they're non-existent because you need to have 4 semesters remaining to get onto the board. I wanted to try to get into a business frat, but I've heard through the grapevine that the best ones don't accept juniors, whatever the best ones are. Leadership positions feel so far out of reach, not because I have to start from scratch because I've done that before, but because a lot of the orgs only want people that have been at UPark for all 4 years. 

I can't help but feel like I've shot myself in the foot by going to a commonwealth when I had the opportunity to go up to UPark originally but decided not to because of the money. Now it feels like I'll be living a second-hand citizen life at an institution I thought would be setting me up for future success and would be the time of my life.

If anyone's a commonwealth student and has come out of the 2+2, I'd really appreciate some reassurance. Or any advice at all, because right now it feels like that moment when you know it's game over but can't stop it.",1572217215,5,0

PLEASE READ: Detailed Explanation of Good Samaritan Law and Penn State‚Äôs involvement,"I‚Äôve been reading a lot of discussions about the incident that occurred this weekend and just wanted to fully explain the context of the Good Samaritan law, since many people have incorrect information. 

The Responsible Action Protocol was implemented by Penn State after the Beta Theta Pi incident. It strongly aligns with the Good Samaritan law. It states that if someone calls 911 to help someone who is showing signs of alcohol poisoning, neither the caller NOR the victim will face any underage, possession of alcohol, etc. 
HOWEVER, the caller must IN GOOD FAITH believe that they are the FIRST person to call for help. Doesn‚Äôt matter if the caller is intoxicated by drugs or alcohol. The other people present at the time are NOT covered and should leave the premises if they are worried about facing legal trouble. 
The caller must also stay with the victim until help arrives.
The only reprimand that the two people involved will receive is that they have to attend an alcohol education class on campus FREE OF CHARGE. (Saves both people $200 each)

If there are any questions, please ask them below. I am very confident in my knowledge on this topic, and I enjoy spreading the information because it could save a life.",1571853331,73,0

People On College Ave / Beaver Ave Drive And Walk Like Idiots,"I drive for Uber and Lyft and I‚Äôve never seen such god awful driving and clueless walking in my life.

Firstly, cars just pull out without checking mirrors. I‚Äôll just be going down College and a car will pull out of one of the street meter spots and I have to hit my breaks. It happens so many times a day I lost count. You also have people changing lanes and cutting you off or people flying their doors open and making me swerve to avoid hitting them. People also randomly swerve into my lane. This road gives me anxiety.

Secondly, college kids have no common sense. None. I know its a college town and kids just think they can walk out whenever, but can we obey traffic signs? The big red hand means DO NOT WALK. Also, people trust cars too much to stop. I don‚Äôt know why kids cross the crosswalk on college ave without looking for cars first. 

Its a very stressful place to drive. I might get hate for this post, but I needed to vent honestly.",1568348154,19,0

Red Link Bus Drivers Rude AF???,"Has anyone noticed that the red link bus drivers are rude as fuck ??? Theres always something they're triggered about. Almost like they just make up their own rules just because they love telling people they cant do something. The blue loop and green link drivers are always waaaay more nice and the things you get yelled at for on red link you never get yelled at for on the green link and blue loop. A red link driver told this girl (in the most rude obnoxious tone i might add) that she cant come on the bus with a closed cup of coffee. Guess what i constantly see on the other buses? And not a single complaint from those drivers. The girl had to wait for another bus because of course she didnt want to throw out her $10 mug. This morning this kid was waiting for a lady in a wheelchair to exit the red link bus via ramp. After she exited, assuming that she was the only disabled person that needed to get off, this kid walked on the bus. The red link bus driver waited until he was half way down the isle and yelled in an obnoxious manner ""YOU CANT DO THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT"" the kid ignored him and just sat down (I would have too). Seriously, what is WRONG with red link bus drivers and their shitty attitude? I don't have an issue with the rules, I just have an issue with the way they speak AT people and not TO them.

"Failing a CompSci ETM, what can I do?","I'm a sophomore who is on track to have 62 credits by the time the semester is over. I had plans to go to UP for my last 5 semesters, but have struggled in Math 230. I currently need a 98 on my last grade, the final, to pass the course. 

I've already signed a sublet agreement for the semester I had planned to be at Main Campus but I just found out that if I fail this course then they can revoke my transfer acceptance. And I'll have too many credits to declare in the CompSci major at all at UP.

Our furniture looks like it‚Äôs from the 80s and it‚Äôs awful. This company is the worst I‚Äôve ever come in contact with. Our apartment is so expensive but falling apart. I hate them.",1573489736,1,0
Has anyone taken MATH 140 online not through Penn State?,"In order to declare entrance to my major, I am required to take MATH 140. Considering that Mathematics is not my strong suit, I figured I would be better off taking the course online than at University Park. I was planning on taking it through Penn State's World Campus, however they apparently only allow World Campus students to take MATH 140 at the World Campus. Thus, I am curious if anyone else knows any other places online that I could take this class and still get the transfer credit. Any help would be greatly appreciated since I kinda need to figure this out soon.",1573487544,1,0

Do I drop MATH34 or PLSC 003,"First year at PSU, political science major. I have been doing poorly in both math of money (MATH34) and intro to comparative politics (PLSC3). 

I‚Äôm at a point where the late drop is coming this week and need to decide if it‚Äôs worth keeping either class.
Initially, I was doing semi decent in comp politics, and to be fair the description for the class had me thinking it was similar to a course like international relations or international politics, not realizing it was a course full of equations and charts. So I‚Äôve struggled with the in class exams and I‚Äôm sitting at about a 65%. I don‚Äôt know anyone in the class either, so I can‚Äôt really talk to anyone after class about it. I also cannot find ANYTHING online regarding the notes, nothing. I‚Äôd need a 60 to pass but the way it‚Äôs going I don‚Äôt think I can keep my grade. The professor also has the homework on canvas, 1 assignment a week 12 questions 1 try. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs gonna be many chances to easily bring the grade up.

MATH34 I have something closer to a 50 something in the class. I managed to find a friend who can help me with the homework and the assignments but there‚Äôs only 1 final exam left that will actually bring my grade up to passing. I spoke to my professor about it, she said I‚Äôd need to do ‚Äúexceptionally well‚Äù on the final in order to get a D. It‚Äôs a huge gamble to keep the class since I am terrible at math.

I have spoken to my advisor back in October about what I should do. He did recommend to me that I take a math in the summer at my local community college and transfer it over if I do decide to drop MATH34. I think I‚Äôm better off dropping  my plsc3 course because 2 of the classes I‚Äôm taking next semester count as comparative politic credits. I don‚Äôt want to have to drop two of my classes because it might mess up my financial aid which I definitely need. Any advice  from people who have been in similar situations?",1573396914,1,0

On-Campus vs Off-Campus Housing,"Hello all!

I am a current 2+2 student at a branch campus and I am set to go to UPark next year. My roommate and I were planning on getting an apartment with a couple friends off campus and I know they think that everything will go swimmingly this first year on our own. I was talking to my father the other day about this apartment  and he suggested that we should try for on-campus housing for our first year at UPark and get an apartment for our final year.  

For those who have done 2+2 and then moved into an apartment, what difficulties did you face that you didn't suspect? Do you recommend that on-campus housing for the first time at UPark or if you have experience living on your own, is an apartment a good idea?",1573258884,1,0

I cant do this though since it was used as an example in class. I'm having a hard time finding any local issues that also has research to suggest solutions. My only personal issues with PA and PSU are penndot construction (which i cant really find research on to support a solution), skateboards/bikes which honestly isnt a big issue, and the cold weather, which obviously wouldnt be a valid topic.

I just had a few queries, hopefully they don't take up much of your time.

1. How would you rate your experience taking classes, balancing full-time work+school, the rigor, and professors?
2. Do World Campus students have just as much ease getting summer internships and getting hired for jobs?

Down With Penn State!,"Penn State is the engine of our economy in State College yet successfully exploits its students, employees and alumni raking in enormous profits from outrageous tuition, robbing students and employees (No employer should make their own employees pay to park!) for parking, charging over 30X its cost for water and making countless $millions from sports while paying its president and football coach more than many earn in a lifetime.  Many say ‚ÄúPenn State is a necessary evil and primarily a giant degree producing cash register leaving many students with little more than a pile of debt‚Äù ‚Äì not far from the truth.  What happened to universities existing for the public good rather than focusing on profits?    
And why hasn‚Äôt Penn State seriously cracked down on alcohol which leaves several students dead annually and some alcoholics for life.  How about two strikes and you‚Äôre out?  
Employment is the real evil.  I worked two years full-time with union employees earning double my compensation for the same job (How fair is that?) only to have a manager‚Äôs relative get my position unionized.  I was fired and physically assaulted by a manager and called a pedophile at a the Penn Stater hotel after giving a mild opinion about the Sandusky case, fired for not supporting gay marriage and called racist for saying ‚ÄúI support the laws of the country‚Äù when asked about illegal immigration ‚Äì always being polite.

I looked over and there‚Äôs a bike cop standing there, I open the door for him and he asked me ‚Äúis this Brumbaugh Hall?‚Äù so I said yea and he started walking in and asked for my PSU ID.  I handed him the ID, he stared at the picture, shined a flashlight on it and kept looking at me and the picture over and over again.  He looked real concerned and asked me if I was sure it was my ID card, so I said yea and he made me recite my ID number and spell out my last name before handing it back to me and swiftly walking away towards the elevators.  I was a bit shaken up, I thought I was boutta get in trouble for literally doing nothing and he just left with no solid explanation.  I‚Äôm confused as to why he was allowed to do this or why he did it in the first place, are cops just supposed to question any student they see?  I‚Äôm not mad or anything I‚Äôm just confused, I‚Äôm completely sober and I was just FaceTiming a friend in the lobby in my pajamas.  I was literally nothing suspicious but he still seemed to think I was trying to commit some wack ass crime while I‚Äôm literally just standing there.

Homecoming parade: then vs now,"I'm a townie who grew up going to the homecoming parade every year.  I brought my own kid for the first time this year, and I have to say I was very underwhelmed.  Can anyone else confirm that it used to be a lot better say 20 years ago?  Or is it just a rosy memory of my youth?

The frats used to do real floats -- towering edifices off tissue paper and chicken wire going way above the flatbed of a truck.  It wasn't uncommon to have moving parts and other cool effects.  Now they mostly just spell out their initials around the base and have a few members milling around on top, maybe wearing matching outfits or blaring music and tossing candy in the best case.  There were a couple decent ones this year, but for the most part nothing.  Why even bother?

They also used to have more local high school bands (Bellefonte, Tyrone, whatever -- not just SC).  These are fun to watch for a kid.  Now it's mostly replaced by local dance and twirling schools for little kids, which are fine, but meh.

And the rest of the stuff is just not as fun as it was.  It's nice that the alum group from the central tier of New York (or wherever) showed up, but there are too many of these sorts of groups in the parade.   At least a few of them put in a little effort, unlike the greek orgs.  There used to be Shriners on mini-motorcycles, jugglers and other performers, all kinds of fun stuff to watch.  Now it's mostly boring boring boring.

The Blue Band (and the alum band) is great.  But they're really the only thing worth showing up for.",1570326505,14,0

"Having ""retroactive"" FOMO","I‚Äôm a senior here now and felt like posting about something I feel like I‚Äôm going through. I was really introverted in high school and always struggled making friendships outside of forced environments from school and sports. Things didn‚Äôt change when I started college because I started at a really small branch of Penn State. I worked a lot for a few years while commuting there but I was still soul searching for what I wanted to major in/do with myself. I jumped around a bit in terms of majors and never made friends. 

I eventually transferred to UP obviously and spent my first two semesters here still searching and without any real friends at all. Having to go directly off-campus did not help and only worsened the isolation. Long story short, I slowly started making effort to get involved in clubs and activities and I found a major that I really love, so that solved a big question mark. Now I‚Äôm a senior and slowly but surely I‚Äôve made around around a dozen or solid friends who I talk to or work with on the regular. They came from club involvement, within my major, class work, etc. so we have a lot in common. I used to have absolutely nothing to do outside of class with anyone and I spent all my time alone, but now I at least have something to do occasionally with some people, which is good for my mental health, I think.

The problem is I‚Äôm a senior and just as I‚Äôm starting to feel much better about my social life and connections, it‚Äôs almost over. That‚Äôs become the new disappointment. I can‚Äôt help but look back and wish things had gone differently, even though I wasn‚Äôt that kind of person back then. I wish I had started at main campus, lived in the dorms, bonded with people, etc. I never had those experiences and now that I‚Äôve had sort of a taste of a healthier social life (for me) here, I‚Äôm having retroactive FOMO. Now I wish I could spend more time here because I‚Äôve started to really enjoy it, but I graduate in just a few months and then it all falls apart again. I do well making connections in forced environments, but I struggle making connections in all the freer parts of life where everyone is doing different things. I‚Äôm still very introverted, but I‚Äôm not totally satisfied with that like some are. But I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs really what I feel or if I‚Äôm just blindly jealous of those who seem to be living it up 24/7. Is that real life? There seem to be super social people who already have their huge, established circles, and then people who are just uninterested in connecting with others at all. Even now, sometimes when I try to make conversation with people, it seems like many are just miserable and uninterested. The number of people I notice going about their days on campus silently with dreadful looks on their faces is high. It depresses me.

So, to summarize: I‚Äôm feeling disappointed again because after a lot of time and effort spent creating real friendships, I‚Äôll be graduating soon and then it‚Äôll be all over and I‚Äôll feel completely alone again. I understand that you just have to keep making friends wherever you go, wherever you work, but it‚Äôs just so hard and draining for me. I‚Äôm having retroactive FOMO because I never had the experiences of living on campus and being close with people and it seems like those experiences are fun and important. If anyone else has ever felt the same type of thing, or has any input to offer, please share :)",1569722015,9,0

That being said, I‚Äôm thinking of leaning towards doing Computational Statistics at the Eberly College of Science in which I think provides the best of both worlds in still involving programming but with more statistics. But what I‚Äôm most concerned with is whether I would get a job and the opportunities as compared to being in Computer Science.

Should I continue and stick it out or should I switch? I don‚Äôt know what to do and it would be great if any of you could provide some insight to maybe guide me or at least have some things for me to think about.

Thank you from kid who is lost in what to do in life! Btw I set up an appointment with my advisor but I wanted to hear first hand experience.",1569690247,1,0

- I plan on going for Computer science, I have been programming since I was 12 years old and for the past 2 years I have been an intern at an Advertising agency where we build, host and manage websites. We have some huge clients and I have experience in web development from this. (Note: Despite being an ‚Äúintern‚Äù I am considered a full on employee within the company - I work on and manage sites, front and back end, of hospitals, pharmecutical companies, and much more) I do NOT want to follow web development as a career choice as the real money is in Software development. What should I do to prepare? What areas of math should I brush up on now, what classes should I and should I not take, what clubs should I join etc..

- To put it plainly, I enjoy the devils lettuce. Will it be easy to obtain? Are the campus security always on the lookout? Could I easily sneak off somewhere to light up / could I rip a pen out of my dorm without too much worry? I do not drink so idrc about alchohol however I‚Äôd like to know how Pennstate is on grass, I would hope its quite common like most colleges. Most importantly however, what is Pennstates policy on ganja and what will happen if Im caught?

- How‚Äôs the party scene? I plan on doing a lot of studying but I am quite a fan of the occaisonal party and I would assume its quite large speaking that the school is huge. 

- Where are your favorite places to hang with friends? 

- What is good OUTSIDE of campus? Cool places to go? Things to see? etc..

Why is the State College restaurant scene so bad?,"This comes up from time to time, but I am hoping someone might have actual insight into the market forces at work.

I think most people who have lived somewhere other than State College would agree that the restaurant scene here is pretty grim.  Not only are there fairly few places at the &gt;=$15-20 price point, most of the ones that do exist are not really up to snuff.  Take somewhere like Liberty Craft House or Federal Taphouse; they charge $15ish for a burger, like you would see in a comparable pub in bigger city.  But the burgers are lousy in comparison.  I am not just talking about comparing to big cities; the food in Ann Arbor or even Urbana is much better.  Heck, Reedsville has a restaurant that's vastly better than anything in State College, and arguably Millheim too. 

So what's the problem?  Labor shortage?  Too much staff turnover so the cooks never learn how to cook?  Rents too high for non-chains?  Alumni/tourist dollars keeping bad places from having to up their game (cough cough Corner Room)?  I just don't get it; there is plenty of demand, everybody in town over the age of 25 complains about this, and there are plenty of people who would pay.

Don't get me wrong, there are some good options.  Sauly Boys makes a decent burger for literally half the price of the places I mentioned, and there are a (small!) handful of more casual but pretty solid places like Little Szechuan, India Pavilion, Juana's...

The shots we would want are below, but we would love other suggestions too! We will pay the standard rates, but most professional photographers have said they would not do our favorite ideas. lameeeeeee. 

-Feeding each other wings from Wings Over (super messily).
-Getting tacos at Yallah and passing out at the tables.
-Drinking Pitchers at the Gaff, a beer at Pickles and a freeze at Cafe. Maybe kicking ass at air hockey at Champs if we can pull it off.

"Anybody who knows any firm that even considers ""International"" students for Internships ?","So I am a sophomore with Biomedical Engineering major. I am an international, and its one of those classic problems that we experience and it's honestly annoying. It's like an undeclared law, to make it next to impossible for a student on International visa to so much even get an internship or co-op, or even have his application considered for one.

 If you tick the 'sponsor' checkbox on the PSU career fair site, you will zero companies interested. While I am not openly bitching (or maybe I am), is there anyone who got an internship or a co-op, or who knows the right places to apply to.

I have stalked every linked connection, probably used my premium to harass and spam so many employers, I wouldn't be surprised if I made it on the National list of spammers or something, but I really feel like I am drowning in a sea of confusion with my major and I want to know if I should spend the rest of my life doing this. 

And the only ONE SOLID way of knowing if its not for me, is spending time in the industry and actually working things out.

So if anyone has any idea, or knows any firm that might be happy or willing to review my application, Please do let me know. Help much appreciated.

I'm an 18 year old senior applying to UNC Charlotte for next year. I took a tour back in August of this year and the tour guide was amazing. What I'm wondering is what facts/opinions about UNCC (good or bad) might the tour guide not have been able/allowed to ask.

Also what are some other things an incoming freshman should know?",1571702205,1,0

moving to major in CJ?,"I've been exploring my options for a bit now, and I really think that Penn State could be right for me, the altoona campus. I'm a freshman right now, but doing all of my classes online through a school in Denver because my mom won't let me move out of state until I am 18, which will be this April. 

I was originally planning on moving to Colorado and attending school at UC Denver, until I realized that the heavily discounted rate is only for online, and I would essentially be paying to go to an over-glorified community college (there is absolutely nothing wrong with community college, just saying that 30k a year is way too much for cc). 

I am now very interested in finishing out my education at Penn State Altoona, because it is a lot cheaper than my other options plus it is still a great school! I would be moving from Oklahoma, and was wondering what you guys personally thought of the school. Is it worth the move? What is the climate like? What about public transportation? Stuff like that.
