"Just because you are being sensitive doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt stand up for yourself. This will be a valuable life lesson because your roommate will not be the last asshole you meet and are forced to interact with. Talk to your RA  or deal with this situation directly or it will only get worse. Also try to get some sort of locking container for your food.

I have some food sensitivities, for instance I hate tomatoes. Some people are convinced I just haven‚Äôt had *these* tomatoes and I should try them. They still  taste disgusting. The only way I can get people to stop is to describe my sensitivity in a way they will understand. 
‚ÄúThey make me vomit. I will vomit right here if I try them‚Äù. It‚Äôs a lie but at least they comprehend now how I feel. Try telling your roommate he smells so bad that you will uncontrollably vomit.",1580133922,1,0
"i personally know that with certain people you are too scared to talk to since they have a hostile nature, an RA is a bad idea for social anxiety since they are guaranteed to have you talk face to face and then youll go back to seeing your roommate every day after the talk and it may make things worse.


the advice i would give is either move or talk to housing directly about feeling unsafe/harassed in your home. i was in the same position and ended up encouraging the people to leave the dorm.",1580129066,1,0
Cost of living is simply too high in this region. We can lower the price by building more housing to increase the supply. However homeowners do not want this to happen because it will devalue their homes and lead to a decrease in rent prices. Housing cost and property value has a lot of effect on how prices are dictated in general area.,1580125582,1,0

I feel the exact same way too about not wanting to say anything in case I'm being too sensitive. I would suggest talking to the RA like someone else said but I know I wouldn't be able to do that myself because I can't handle confrontation.

"COLA has always been about the issue with "" Cost of Living"". However, the method they go about it is incorrect. The main things that drive cost of living is food, housing, and utilities. Food is manageable, utilities are cool except PG&amp;E, and housing is expensive due to low supply. If COLA passes and the pay for TAs increase. The homeowners for off campus housing will continue to raise rent to the fair market price. The TAs may afford it because they get the pay raise but the undergrads who live off campus do not. Even if undergrad tuition is not increased as according to COLA plan. They still cannot prevent the rise of rent for undergrads off campus. The local city council will not allow further housing development because homeowners are incentivized to maintain current market prices or increase them. The only hope is to build more housing on campus to increase housing supply thereby driving cost of living off campus down. Even there we face heavy opposition.",1582275012,1,0
"Both of their stances revolve around limiting development of the school and lowering admission rates as it's resulting in overcrowding. This is extremely concerning when you look at the proposed long term development plan and student population growth. That is seen as the main source of the issue that needs to be addressed.

Of course one can argue that limiting development of the school is unrealistic given multiple reasons. However, the proposed plan is outrageous when you look at the proposed student population. There's literally no room for that amount of students. This results in high demand, low availability, which obviously causes rent to sky-rocket. Yes, more housing needs to be constructed; however, considering my other comment and the city's position to also limit the growth of the school has led them to this stance. Sure, rent control would hurt the crisis because it does not address the underlying issue.

"How do you pay for your meal plan? most students pay online. 

Thus, ""free food"" is actually ""prepaid food"" for the vast majority of people... i actually worked at the dining hall and mayyybe like 10 people actually pay per day. 10x $12 per meal is $120. 

$120 in lost revenue. Wow. even if you multiply that by 10x to account for alll those people who hear about the free food it's... $1200. An unrealistically high estimate that's still a woefully small revenue hit.  

Basically, these shutdowns don't work because the dhalls don't miss any real revenue. when i asked the grad student shutting down a dining hall what he thought about this, he said ""it should cost them at least $30,000"" per day that we do this

"**2018 West Virginia teachers' strike**

The West Virginia teachers' and school personnel strike began on February 22, 2018 with a call from the West Virginia branches of the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, and the West Virginia School Service Personnel for school employees across West Virginia to strike. The strike, called in response to anger among teachers and other school employees over low pay and high health care costs, involved roughly 20,000 teachers and public school employees and shut down schools in all 55 West Virginia counties, affecting some 250,000 students. It lasted until March 7, 2018.The strike inspired teachers in other states, including Oklahoma, Colorado, and Arizona, to take similar action. Teachers in other states, including North Carolina and Kentucky have also coordinated protests and walkouts on a smaller scale.

"&gt; Grad students are paid to TA--20 hours a week. So part-time work. For which you are paid &amp; $ 2,400 plus. For part-time work. The other work is for your self-interest only

You seem to be under some misconceptions here. PhD students are admitted to perform research at the university. They are provided with a stipend and part of the conditions of that stipend is that they perform other duties to include TA or GSR duties. The rest of your time is not 'self interest only' no matter how much you want it to be. The rest of my time is dictated by my department, specifically by my advisor. This is how PhD programs in the US work - you perform research (which is one of the primary functions of the university) and you help teach (the other one) and for this you get a stipend. The teaching is limited to 20 hours not because it's part time but to simply make sure you have enough time to perform research, because (as any professor will tell you) this needs to be your priority.",1582273022,1,0

"First, Grads work more than 20 hours a week. If you include research then they are working alot more. Maybe you think they shouldn't be paid for that, but it's quite literally a good that the university owns the IP rights to and profits off of. Grads are full time employees of the university, and whether they funded through a TAship or a GSR is more of a adminstrative issue of delegating funding sources. 

You might argue that grad research shouldn't count as work, but it is labor they are expending for the profit of the university. It is categorical different than something like undergrad course work, which does not have any value to the university. 

Second, average rent in Santa Cruz is 1100 to 1200 for a single room, so they have 800-900 left over. Then they have utilities and food costs, medical costs (because deductibles and co-pays aren't free), car costs (maybe you could argue this is a luxury, but for ppl who want to live further away to save on rent, it is necessary to get to campus), student fees (another $100 a month), etc. Even when grads do break even every month, it leaves nothing it put into savings, nothing to cover the costs of an emergency, etc. That's survivable, but it's not livable. 

I personally don't know of a single grad that has their own apartment (besides some small studio/efficiency set-ups). Almost every grad has roommates. Having a family isn't a luxury, and people who have families shouldn't be unable to access grad school unless they are independently wealthy. Grads also don't get summers off. Many work other jobs and those that don't are researching (which again, is a job). 

Your point about undergrads being worse off is fair, but I'd like to offer two rebuttals. First, that grad students and undergrads are different in so far as undergrads are ""customers""  at the university and grads are employees. Grads are making a targeted demand on their employer to pay them a living wage, something that every employer should provide. This means the University's obligation to them is going to be different than it is to undergrads.

More importantly though, you're right, SC is too expensive for everyone. But instead of getting mad at grads for trying to improve their situation, there are other remedies to this problem: pushing for housing developments in the city to drive down the costs of rent, demanding the UC stop expanding and reduce the number of students they admit next year, protesting against tuition hikes and for fair wages for student jobs. These are all actions grads would willing support undergrads on. I'm honestly really sick of these takes like ""things are bad, undergrads can manage, why can't grads?""  Maybe we don't just accept that it's bad and try to fix it.",1582272884,1,0

Calling someone on financial aid entitled is ridiculous and illogical. Additionally, grad students DO get financial aid and they DONT pay for tuition, part of the contract is getting tuition waived. Don‚Äôt you DARE insult me for having to take out loans and be on financial aid and stop using the word entitled like you have any idea what it means.",1582272828,1,0

Students are historically poor, because they do not work full-time. Surprise. Some hard-working people don't earn a TAs salary working full-time.

And when you chose to live in an expensive coastal town with low vacancies and high rental costs, did you never do the math? Hate to break it to you, but you aren't special, and most people who rent and live in Santa Cruz struggle with high rents and low wages. And your wages are pretty good for someone pursuing a degree.

So why are they successful now? Partly because of laws that forbid such blatant discrimination. And partly because the groups involved took responsibility for their own success.

"Taking some time out of midterm studying to reply to this post.

First off im glad that some other people in the UC system find their emphasis on diversity and inclusion overwhelming.  And I find this is true from the student's perspective as well in both admissions and at the university. 

I am not a first gen college student, not from an minority group(Asians are considered a minority everywhere except for higher education and STEM?), and am from a financially stable family. I would like to say however that my family DID NOT start out with this, and when my dad went to college(in CA at  UCB), there was no emphasis on diversity or inclusion, and was pitted against other students as equals without race being taken into consideration. He worked three days a week from 8PM to 3AM at fast food for minimum wage in High School to help save for college, all the while earning top scores in his class. When he got to college, he found that his high school education was very poor and worked extra hard doing lots of self study to make himself equal to his peers who came from well to do families. This hard work was what built up my current family situation and it is the same for pretty much every student not considered as ""diverse"" 

I am not saying that underrepresented people do not deserve a right to go to university, as I see many underrepresented students who bust their ass working hard to get a good education for a good job. However for ever underrepresented student who works hard, I see another one who does not work hard, does not try to make up for lower academic standing from high school, does not study and spends time partying, blames professors for making classes too hard for them since it is for ""rich people"" etc. The UC has included this ""diversity"" number in their equation far too much in their admissions, as university is a privilege and should be taken seriously by students who work hard and do not give up in the face of trouble or unfairness. The result is that I see many students who care almost zero about school, and do not deserve a spot as a student at the university and take up spots for other students who would kill to have the education and resources offered at UC. (in fact reducing the number of low effort students will likely solve issues like impacting of classes as the students will be more likely to pass the first time)

The reality of this issue really hit me last quarter when I was trying to enroll for classes(im a declared cs major with junior standing) and was unable to get a **single CS class** that I wanted. To preface this, I was in college scholars program and therefore had priority enrollment. For those of you who don't know, the program is hand picked students at freshman admission who show exceptional aptitude and desire to learn. The fact that I do not have priority enrollment as someone who enjoys classes and has a strong desire to learn and score well, but priority enrollment is given to someone solely based on race and social status makes me furious. *Race and social status are not indicators of how someone will utilize university and anyone who says so is tying race and economic standing to how someone's personality or work ethic is which is both absurd, stereotyping, and borderline racist.* I have already done the math and have found it is highly unlikely that 1.1k spots in junior level classes were taken up by senior standing students so therefore the only students who could have rushed into those spots are EOP. I have nothing wrong with EOP and think that it is a good program as it is something that my parents never had and would have made their lives a lot easier, however I also do not understand why there are so many EOP students that it can fill the entire upper division Computer Science class roster before an Upper Div student can even enroll. Especially when I see a good number of underrepresented students not leveraging the university at a tool for learning and job training but instead as a play space for partying. 

Feel free to disagree with me, call me elitist, but I hope at least a few people agree with me that the universities versions of diversity and inclusion are forms of racism and undermine merit.",1581200724,4,0

The difference in median rents between San Jose (for example) and Santa Cruz are miniscule ($100-200 max pm) but the cost to commute between the these regions 4 times a week would be ~$150 pm not accounting for the extra vehicle maintenance that would be required from such a commute.",1581192470,1,0

"‚ÄúFaculty at universities across the country are facing an echo of the loyalty oath, a mandatory ‚ÄòDiversity Statement‚Äô for job applicants.

Any activities which are designed to be color-blind, ethnicity-blind, and background-blind, instead treating students as individuals rather than as members of particular groups _are_ rated lower.

As a single activity that's part of a broader portfolio, it would be a good contribution, as anonymous grading is a well-recommended practice.

The loyalty oath comment is highly hyperbolic. There are many different activities one could do, and no single approach is required. If a candidate becomes informed and pursues activities that are backed up by research (and there is plenty of easily-accessible research out there in terms of the problems and good practices), they can include a wide range of activities and practices in such a statement. The rubric doesn't specify specific activities that a candidate must have done to score in the 4-5 range. That is, aside from the first part, which is purely knowledge-based. If a candidate doesn't seek out information (or worse, willingly ignores information), then I would also question whether they are a ""top candidate.""",1581189772,1,0

"The issue is _how_ they support all students at UCSC. A statement such as ‚ÄúI will grade essays without knowing the identity of the author‚Äù is considered a 1 on the rubric (read it!), yet that‚Äôs exactly the procedure that the search process follows in evaluating diversity statements.

Prof. Thompson‚Äôs pieces say this succinctly: the process rejects candidates who don‚Äôt share a particular view of _how_ to provide a supportive environment for all students. And this is no different from the loyalty oath that faculty had to sign during the Red Scare of the 1950s.",1581188821,1,0

"Doing 120 (Renau) + 107 (JJ) right now. Honestly, the material for either of them is not particularly difficult. I'd almost say they're both easy. I wish I took a third CS class, I'm bored with just these two. If you care about programming- look for something to do on the side of 120/107 or take another class with programming.  


For 107 with JJ, the material and exams are not horrible. His lectures however, have sometimes been word for word from the slides, and his way of reading/speaking has too many pauses and is too slow. It has put myself and others to sleep. It is so horribly boring. Since the lectures are basically word for word from the slides, and his slides don't really explain stuff very well (they just say ""this is happening,"" not ""this is why this is happening""), you will have to teach yourself. Alternatively, just learn how to do the problems and not understand what's going on, just go through the motions. It seems many are doing this and doing well.   


You're taking a different 120 professor that I don't know anything about, but I'll say the 120 material is typically pretty intuitive and easy to digest.

UCSC definitely has a very specific vibe that not everyone can appreciate but for those that can, it can provide an amazing experience. Personally, I hated UCSC when I first arrived because of the people I lived around in the dorms, but I made an effort to find the right people that I could connect with and ever since then, living in Santa Cruz has been a blast. Not gonna lie though, the number of issues that the school has and makes the students deal with each year just keeps increasing. That's probably why you are seeing so many anti-UCSC posts. The students and many of the advisors are awesome people but the administration unfortunately is... i dont even know..

Point is, if you're enjoying your time, screw what others have to say. I'm going into my last few quarters at UCSC but feel free to reach out if you need anything :)",1585461224,1,0

"The sad fact is that CSE uses lecturers not ladder rank faculty to teach the vast majority of its classes. Some faculty teach the core classes, but most of them teach boutique classes that do little to help students graduate. 

The list is easy for you to create on your own from here:

[https://courses.soe.ucsc.edu/courses/cse](https://courses.soe.ucsc.edu/courses/cse)

Mackey, Finkelstein, Tantalo, Julllig, these are the people who teach more of the core classes. Then there are ladder rank faculty who teach core classes, Van Gelder, Long, Alvaro, JJ, Sesh, and a few others. Then there are ladder rank faculty who teach the boutique courses. These faculty should be ashamed, but aren't, since they give not a single shit about the students and just want to play in their own sandbox.

A lot of people hate on Van Gelder, for example, but he teaches only courses that students need to graduate. Look at the others, and ask why they are not teaching classes that will get you out and done.",1585457144,1,0

"&lt;feeding troll&gt;

I would love for you to actually explain why ""Tryna"" looks stupid, and why üëèmakes me look like a ""stupid Karen"" and what exactly that means and why it's bad. I'm positive you knew what I meant in both cases and thus-- I communicated.  I doubt you'll actually explain. 

With ""tryna"" I was ~~tryna--~~ *attempting to impart* a sense of levity, fun, and not-taking-myself-too-seriously. You know, an attitude appropriate for a casual forum like Reddit. 

Maybe you have a prescriptivist way of looking at language that demands that people use text and only text in written conversations. No emoji's allowed. Prescriptivist demands like that are just... dumb (prescriptivism is also just always dumb). Text lacks a massive amount of information that we'd normally have in face-to-face conversation. It makes sense especially in casual settings to use every tool available to get information across. This is what GIFs, reaction images, and yes- emoji are for. 

Maybe you're just an old man yelling at emoji-shaped clouds? you don't like it 'cause it's new and breaks the rules, or isn't *your* preferred method of communication. 

Maybe you value professionalism, and that'd be a fair argument if this were Linked In or something. I'd never use ""üëè"" or ""tryna"" in a professional document. But this is fuckin god damned acurs'd reddit. jesus. People have engaged with this post, so I can't've done such a bad job. 

I don't think you value professionalism though. Cursing and personal attacks about stuff that certainly doesn't matter is not professional, and I don't see how ""tryna"" looks more stupid than that. üòò

"^ saying a general phrase ""international travel"" is a blanket term for all international travel. While ""blocking China"" is a part of international travel, ""blocking international travel"" implies blocking many/all other countries.
Chickens are birds, all birds are not chickens. Chickens cant fly and are birds, not all birds cant fly.

Edit: To respond to the original claim of ""not too shabby,"" blocking travel is not enough to control a pandemic allowing any amount of potentially infected people back in to a healthy population, one must guarantee that they can in some way, not contaminate, or at least control the contamination of the healthy population. We had no prepared tests or cures, and allowed people to travel at will. When we did have tests, they were inaccurate with a horrible confidence interval.

"I'm not as interested in our response to international travel. Regardless of it being somewhat later or earlier, it doesnt drastically change the overall approach to dealing with the virus. That is, the hidden/mis-counts of reported cases so that insurance and campaigners can hide the damage to improve their profit/polls, and the lack of preventative measures employed by the states and poor testing (including accuracy of tests, dispersal, production, etc). Theres additional issue in the news reports of only reporting deaths without statistically and accurately representing how many cases and breaking them into relevant age groups and conditions, as well as calling it something similar to the typical flu. One should be optimistic, but no much as to spread false hope and misinformation about how soon we could reopen borders and release sheltering orders. Theres a lot to dig in here, and the overall lack of state and federal leadership, to put simply, is an abomination for lack of proper organization and directives.

I also take issue with the violence and racism but that's not related to the topic of prevention of virus spread.

I link this video [The Pandemic Playbook] (https://youtu.be/Z42G8Wus4kA), regardless of party lines. Pandemics and death should not be a partisan issue, it's humanitarian.

"1) Practically none, there are some but it's gonna be fairly low %. Like 10% and that's only for classes with CE overlap, like ECE103 for example. 

2) I'm a guy, I can't answer this too well, but of the girls that I met in my earlier years none of them dropped out of the majors they were in since I kept seeing them in subsequent classes.  

3) I've found it's easy to get to meet people, and I don't think college affiliation matters. Of the people I know, a couple are from nine, 2 are from crown, and another is from RCC.  Although this really becomes more so on you to get to meet the people than anything. 

In terms of advice for EE, get your math and physics done, and get it done well. I'd recommend trying to get 5C out of the way by the end of your freshman year, as well as either being able to take AMS 20, or taking/taken by the end of your freshman year. These are the major prereqs for EE101 which opens up the rest of the major classes to you. Although, do keep in mind you still have to take Math 19A-23B alongside the AM math series. Although you're only gonna need 19B/23A for physics, and 23B for more physics.  Idk how far along you are, but if you've taken calculus you can totally get all of your lower div math and physics done in your first year, which creates A LOT of freedom in your curriculum planning. Although I'll admit most people don't take 2 math classes and a physics class together like I did, but if you can I'd 100% recommend getting them done since it opens so many freedoms by having it done at the end of your freshman year. Also take every Petersen class that you can. Dudes a massive cunt, but he's also the professor with by and large the best structure that's conducive to learning. His classes will make you work, but they will be BY FAR the most valuable classes you take if you put the effort forward.",1589767354,1,0

"Have you checked to see if you have completed the IGETC req's at your CC? If you have, you will have automatically completed your GE and they cannot ask any more of you. You need the CC to send a transcript with the IGETC certification on it. 

If you have not taken something you need for IGETC, do it before Fall and confirm with counselor at CC that they will send the cert to ucsc. Without IGETC cert,you might have to take more ucsc classes and that will cost you way more in the long run. 

If you are missing a gen ed, PM me. I took CC online classes all over the state before I transferred and I might have a recommendation for an easy class to close the IGETC gap.

"Congrats on getting in! 

I'm a girl studying robotics engineering which is one of the majors under the majors under the ECE department. Being a girl is sometimes weird taken the few girls in my upper division classes, but I've never found that to be a problem. You will see a decrease in girls in your classes once you hit upper divs, but that's both because lower divs are often a mix of other majors and because in general people drop and there's a decrease in class size for upper divs. 

I'd say in the upper div classes I've taken so far, around 10% of my classmates were girls. I don't think that's had much of an effect on anything for me though. Joining orgs like ACM-W and SWE are great ways to meet other women in the departments and the female professors have quite interesting stories to tell about their own experiences. 

I've never had any problems meeting people to work with, especially if you're more of an extrovert. People tend to be friendly, especially in lab classes and during tutoring/lab sections. Another thing is once you get to your upper divs, you'll be taking your classes with pretty much the same group of people, so you'll get more comfortable with them. Lab classes and design courses often force people to work together anyways to figure out problems. 

I don't know of college affiliation would have a significant effect on anything. Most of the people I've befriended in my major, I met in class. I'm from Merrill and I didn't know anyone in my major there, but my 2 closest robotics friends are from C9 and Cowell.",1589746975,1,0

"Hey! I can't speak much to other colleges, but I've been living in Crown for the last four years. It's a bit more STEM and academically oriented than some other colleges, which is something I looked for going into my freshman year and has been really nice as a bio major. It can be a great way to connect with people in similar majors or who have a similar academic focus.

One thing that comes along with this is the social scene. Crown tends to be less social than other colleges on campus, at least in terms of parties and that sort of thing. The social scene is usually on the quieter side. On the downside, it can be a little harder to make friends than I imagine it would be in other colleges. On the plus side, this means that you can go to the party rather than having the party find you. You usually don't have to worry about being woken up in the middle of the night by people who are drunk/high. Also people are really friendly, especially when you reach out, so it isn't hard to break through that barrier.

I'm a grad student at UCSC but was an out of state somewhere else for undergrad. Out of state is so super expensive. Unless an out of state school (UCSC or otherwise) has great financial aid (NOT loans) or is the best fit or program for you, it's definitely worth seriously considering in state, even if just for the first two years to work on gen ed classes. Seriously. Being on the other side and have 37,000 extra dollars in loans because I did out of state four years sucks a lot and I think UC out of state is way more than that.",1587621034,1,0

"Amazing. Every class I've taken in EEB has been a great experience, especially the upper divisions. The people that would be teaching you are some of the most renowned in their field, any of them would be excellent references for other labs or even people to get to know to work with them one day. This is also kind of shallow, but the coastal science campus where most of the EEB upper divisions are held is absolutely GORGEOUS, the proximity to the ocean makes the courses so much better since labs can be more hands on and it's a great place to relax. I can't think of any other class room where I can step outside, walk five minutes, and see otters, pelicans, seals, sea lions, and even whales (yes, I saw all of those on one day last year, it was magical). The advisors are all really helpful too.

If you do end up coming here, make good use of the opportunities. One of my professors always offered to refer us to people he knew in the field for internship and lab position opportunities, and if I had the time to fit them in I would have taken them.",1587619391,1,0

"What is your career goal? I'm a 4th year neuro major. I transferred as a MCD major and decided to declare neuroscience as I plan to go into the healthcare field and wanted to have a narrower major. I think the neuro program is very complete and chances are you can get in a research lab if you are thinking you may want to go into graduate school. I reccomend you look into the STEM diversity programs and see if you qualify. 
I took the developmental neuroscience class which is not a major requirement but it was an excellent class to strengthened my understanding of early nervous system development. The major overlaps heavily with human biology, and MCD biology so check those out too. If you want to take an extra year at CC that's okay as it could allow you to take additional upper divs when you transfer. However, the directly related upper division neuroscience classes are limited. I reccomend  you go to the major page and read the class descriptions, see if they are of your interest.",1587606832,1,0
