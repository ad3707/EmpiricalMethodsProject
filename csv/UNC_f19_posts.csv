Army ROTC Questions,"Just got some questions for those of you here who are in/have been in ROTC at UNC

1. Do the PT tests operate on the PFT or the new CFT?  Is there a plan to switch to the CFT soon?  

2. How selective are summer schools? (ie: Airborne, Air Assault, Mountain Warfare, Northern Warfare, Robin Sage, Sapper, etc) Have you been to one and could you comment on it?  Is it true that they're only open to those with 300 PT scores?  In short, are they attainable goals to strive for or simply crapshoots as to whether or not you'd be selected?  I'm under the impression each school gets X number of slots and handles the distribution of the slots by themselves, but the only ROTC students I've had the chance to speak with were first years or green-to-golds.

(one thing that seems to have went over my head is whether or not the completion of an ROTC summer school counts as the actual school, ie do you get an airborne tab if you do the summer program?)

3. How has ROTC impacted any study abroad or internship goals?  That's one big thing that's made me a bit weary about signing up as I have always planned on studying abroad at least one semester during university.

4.  How is the balance with academics?  My understanding is you're signed up for a single class which meets a few times a week (MWF?  MWRF?) and leadership lab, but how much do the responsibilities reach outside of scheduled time?  

Sorry if this is a lot, just don't know where to ask and the contract element of it has me uncertain.",1569302646,4,0

how do you go about this?,"hi, i’m a relatively new reddit user (had an older account, lost password, yadayada) and this is my first post so go easy on me, fuckers.

im gonna be short and to the point - how do you guys find someone you met at a party and want to talk to again? friend/romantic interest/otherwise, what do you do when you left before you could get any of their information?

all i know is their name and what they’re majoring in - both the name and the major being pretty common, making it feel impossible to believe you’ll see them again.

you felt like they might’ve also had interest in seeing you again, but not enough to the point where they’d go ~really~ looking for you.

do you just hope that you’ll run into this individual again somehow, someway, on a campus with thousands of students? or do you (must not be a pisces) just let it go and give up? 

i feel like my best bet is to keep going to parties with the same type of crowd and hope we’ll run in to each other again - but i have a feeling this might become exhausting.

3) biology is not a science

3) biologists dont know what a species is-thus theory of evolution is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense",1572129090,0,0

The COMP departement is wanting to become a school. What do yall think of that?,"Its been an ongoing problem at UNC that the comp department cannot keep up with the student demand, the department has nearly quintupled in 10 years iirc! Class sizes are absurd, and students are getting jipped of valuable professor time. Many large courses are starting to be run by TAs (see 426), and other courses are hardly givin the time of day by the prof (see 411 last semester with Bishop, or 550 this year with Pizer). It almost seems like many people in the department are fed up with the whole thing, and students are left to deal with the fallout. And I can see why. How can a single professor manage 200 students? Much less balance their important research, like literally helping cure cancer. Demand for TAs is high but many TAs are left high and dry and sometimes left overworked if my sources arent exaggerating. Is making the department into a school and having entrance requirements the best choice though? I mean in a perfect world students would be able to study what they like and the school could just hire more people and purchase more resources. As much as I hate the idea of denying students education they desire, having lackluster courses is getting to be annoying and devalues the major. As stated early on this sub, most prof dont teach more than the average google search. Also, it has been said many students only get into CS because they beleive that is their ticket to an easy 6 fig salary, but they hate the major.

Im a bit split. What do you guys think should be done? What are some things that could be improved? Has CS always been like this?",1571513332,32,0

UNC students create ‘anti-racist’ alert system as tensions over Silent Sam still fester," Racial tensions on North Carolina’s flagship campus continue to persist. Students at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill have created a “UNC Anti-Racist Alerts” texting system to warn each other when pro-Silent Sam demonstrators are on or near campus.

“SMS alerts when white supremacists are at UNC-CH. … Not an emergency service nor university affiliated,” its Twitter page [**states**](https://twitter.com/UNCAlerts).

The alert system was created last month as some continue to clash over the Confederate statue Silent Sam, which was [**torn down**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/protesters-forcibly-topple-confederate-war-memorial-statue-at-unc/) by students and its pedestal [**removed**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/photos-show-unc-has-wiped-out-every-last-scrap-of-silent-sam-from-campus/) by the school last year.

Exchange student -- Housing in Northern Campus?,"Hi there, I'm an exchange student from Hong Kong coming in Spring 2020 struggling with my housing application. So far I've only been considering Northern Campus since I've heard that freshmen usually reside in Southern Campus and I'd like to avoid all that freshman hype (esp when I'm introverted).

Having perused the info on the housing website, the choices I have in mind right now include Spencer and Old East. I like how some rooms in Spencer have a sink in each room, and that it is **NOT** with central air-conditioning and proximate to Franklin St. One downside is that the room dimensions are slightly small for double-rooms (?). And Old East just 'cause it looks so antique. 

Overall, is Spencer a good choice in the Kenan community? I'm not sociable and enjoy quietude + nature (sunlight, a view of greenery and all that) in my room -- Kenan community seems a good choice. Distance from campus isn't a great deal for me -- I'd rather be proximate to where I can buy my daily necessities. Also, any recommendations for cleaner rooms and nice bathrooms?

I was wondering what the odds of acceptance and what are some things I should do to differentiate myself from the other applicants? 

I think I will end with about a 3.7 gpa this semester for context.

Who do I contact about these insane exam circumstances,"I took my Math 231 exam this morning (section 3 with smirnov). 


First off, the room the exam was scheduled in was already occupied by another class about to take an exam (some type of physics iirc) so our class ended up spending 20+ minutes trying to find/get in contact with our professor. He ended up showing up outside the original location at about 8:10 (it was an 8 am exam) and told us we would probably wait 30 minutes to see if it could be rescheduled or the exam would be cancelled. Around 8:45, he told us that we would actually be taking the exam right now at a different building a decent distance away. 


By this point, much of our class wasn’t together back at the original building and only about 70 of us out of the 150+ class even ended up making it to the new location. We started the exam in the new building at about 8:52 and he sent the new exam location by email 5 minutes AFTER it had already begun. This was the first communication he had given all morning. It was a 3 hour exam, which was supposed to only go to 11, so I missed an important event since it didn’t end until 11:52. All the extra stress of dealing with this shit instead of taking my exam at 8 in the correct building like we were supposed to made me do pretty bad on the exam, not to mention that it was just hard in general.


Who can I contact about all of this? Also, if anyone’s experienced something similar before, how will this be handled? I couldn’t imagine they would drop the exam from just the 70 that didn’t show up but it also doesn’t seem likely that half the class should get a 0 either.",1575653433,1,0

CS Transfer Student lost on what to do,"Hey there, I am a transfer student from a community college (AS). At the start of the semester I was excited and happy to be here. I enrolled in COMP 401 and MAT 381 along with a FL and an LFIT course for my first semester. The semester started out fine, I was familiar with java programming and coasted through the first couple of assignments. I started to fall behind on the content in both my MAT 381 and COMP 401 course and was lost on how to complete most of the assignments. Admittedly I should have taken advantage of the LA's for the COMP course and started going to my MAT 381 office hours early in the semester. I started to become very depressed because I wasn't doing as well as I would have hoped. I dropped a 50% on the COMP 401 midterm(30% of the course grade) but decided to keep pushing on and hope for a curve so I could continue on with the CS courses in the spring. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will definitely pass the two classes, just probably not with a C (current grade is a C before a7 and the final). The problem that I'm facing is I might not pass 401 and the 401 section in the spring is full. If I do not pass 401, or get into 401 in the spring I will have to waste my spring semester waiting for the fall so I can start again (with the new curriculum they're introducing). So basically I'm super behind on getting my major requirements out of the way, and am lost on what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly expected a lot more from the CS department, I realize that a lot of this is my own fault but I can't help to think that the insanely large class sizes and how the course is structured had an impact on my ability to succeed(30% of my grade depends on the midterm and 35% on the final, so 65% of my grade is dependent on two tests wtf.) I haven't really been happy at UNC during my time here and have been considering transferring to UNCC because some of my close friends go there and have told me that UNCC CS is better structured than UNC's. I would be worried about pushing my graduation date back by transferring again, but if I don't get a C in 401 or get a C in it in the spring then I'm literally starting from square one in the fall again. I get that UNC is a more prestigious school than UNCC but I feel like the CS program at UNCC is better than UNC's.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate your advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Sincerely, a person who is stressed to the max.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: might not pass 401 this semester, cant retake it in the spring because the only section is full, so starting from square one in the fall. Considering transferring to UNCC because of (what I believe to be) a superior CS program and it wouldn't push my graduation date back.",1575432615,1,0

Opinion: The fb meme group is kinda pathetic sometimes,"It's literally just 

1) Blatant political opinions disguised as memes (the woker the better of course)

2) ""I hate my life"" and other zoomerisms (dAE FInaLs stRESfuL just isn't funny at all)

3) Generic college stuff (see #2).

Of course, I've seen lots of funny, niche, UNC related content there. But it's annoying to log on and be inundated with memes that are ultimately *complaints* about the school. Yeah, college is tough, and sometimes the university does stuff that contradicts your values, but that's kinda the point, no ? One of the apparent benefits of a college education is being taken outside of your comfort zone and into the real world. So why do we take a place for students to escape that to look at funny memes and turn it into a complaint box ? Like why are you even here if that's going to be your outlook.

And yes I see the hypocrisy in complaining about a meme group because it complains too much",1575409623,1,0

Worst moment: had a professor hate me from the first day and give me low scores on papers that were actually good. Also my laptop is making crackling noises and I still have like 1500 words to go on an essay. Will it die? Only time will tell. 

Best moment: had another professor who liked me from the first day and has graded my trash papers far more graciously than I expected. Also a fun and interesting course with relatively low stakes.

An Appeal to Not Buy a Meal Plan,"As many of you receive your acceptances to UNC within the coming weeks, you will be faced with a the first-year checklist for things to do before you get here. Among that checklist is to buy a meal plan with Carolina dining services, which many students decide to do. Myself included. However, I think that the meal plan is one of the biggest scams new students can fall into, unless it is paid for by your financial aid.

**Meal Plans**

Don't buy an unlimited meal plan. No matter how much you think you are going to eat at the dining hall, you aren't going to eat in the dining hall as much as you think you will. It's just throwing away extra money, as even though  Even stopping by for the occasional snack, you are still spending way more than you need to for not a lot of variety. You can go up to Target and buy tons of snacks with lots of variety for much less money. A meal swipe on block plans is around $11 or $12 depending on the plan you get. That's pretty damn expensive for a meal. And then your money is locked into a block meal plan, which often has swipes left over by the end of the semester. 

**The Dining Halls**

Both dining halls are... lackluster to say the least. The food is not that great (when you're at orientation/visits they definitely prepare the food better to lure you in). And the staff can be very hit or miss, some are great and are very talkative, but some can just give terrible service, and for 12 dollars a meal, that is unacceptable in my opinion. 

**So What Should You do Instead?**

Well, if you want to eat at the dining hall, you could become an authorized user on your parents credit card or get your own card and just buy meals at the door price, which is better than how much a meal swipe normally costs at breakfast and mid-day, and only slightly more expensive at lunch and dinner (about a dollar or two more expensive). On top of that, you can get cashback as well as build credit for when you are in the real world. Or you could go eat out at other places, which have better food for much cheaper.
