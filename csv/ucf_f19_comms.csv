"I'm a bit late to the party replying here but; UCF has pretty good opportunities for students who seek them, and our education helps us explore really cool things on the side too. Volunteer with the arboretum and learn about the Florida environment and get some fresh air, take a course in matrices and linear algebra or programming to make things with Houdini FX as an art student, or get some parts from skycraft and make something in the TI engineering lab.

The natural world is magnificent and the resources UCF will enable you to better understand it. If you're not a STEM or some kind of medical major you should at least seek electives that will help you explore our natural world. It is magnificent.

The library will help you learn more about whatever are interested in better understanding before pursuing a project related to it, from academic papers to books that document the subject very well. And do not ever limit what you do to your major, because there are too many awesome things to do for us to limit ourselves, just don't bite off more than you can chew.

This is why I have enjoyed my time here a whole lot. The University is just trying to facilitate a whole lot of students which can be difficult but they do provide the resources you need to do a lot of fun side projects that makes all the challenging classes more tolerable",1572534629,1,0

My advice is at least twice a week (I do Mondays and Thursdays) have some kind of to do list you update with the dates on them hanging on your wall somewhere.  Calc 2 and discreet have lots of homework, and phy#2 can as well, but if you take time to understand it, then do the homework for about 2-4 hours a day you should be fine.

"I only applied to UCF and UF. For me, the three biggest things that made me choose UCF were money, location, and the honors program. UCF offered me $30,000 to go to their school, UF offered me $0.00. As somebody who plans to go $125,000 in debt for vet school, making sure that my undergrad was mostly paid for was a huge thing for me. Location was also a big thing for me, as cliche and superficial as it sounds. I wanted to go to college in a place that I had things to do, and while UCF is still about 25 minutes from downtown Orlando, there's still somewhere I can escape to if I feel trapped on campus. In Gainesville. theres nothing like that, and that's not somewhere I wanted to spend the 4 years of my undergrad at. Gainesville is the only place for an hour each way, and I worried I would feel trapped very quickly. And I don't know if you applied for honors at UCF or UF, but it's honestly made the biggest difference in how college has been for me at UCF. First of all, drastically smaller class sizes. Honors classes cap the amount of students at 20-25 depending on the class, versus classes upwards of 250. The staff there also genuinely cares about you if you make the effort to know them, and they help you connect with your fellow student so you don't feel completely lost your first semester. We also get first pick for classes, which is huge on a campus of close to 70,000 students. UF's honors college is nothing like that as I've heard from my friends that go there.

I had a semester where I was #11 on a waitlist for a 45 person class the week before it started and I got in. I made it to #2 the day before drop ended, and emailed my professor and she was able to allow me in the class by extending her class size to bump the waitlist.",1577761840,1,0

"&gt; Florida was a 2 party state for consent, but the law does not apply in your place of work.

Your initial search results were mostly correct for recording a *conversation*. We are a two party consent state. This really only applies if the lecture allows questions. If the professor does not take questions, then I believe you're in the clear in regard to that law. A side note, there is another concern if you're recording a student near you has a verbal conversation either with a person in class or over the phone. If they weren't notified you're recording, the you don't have their consent to capture that conversation. I think video recording could also be a problem if students are in front of you with their laptops open, you could inadvertently capture their messages/emails on video.

The main issue here is not that you're recording a conversation, but that you're recording a lecture. The lecture is private work, or property, produced by the professor. The professor and/or the university, varies by university, are the rights holders to those lectures. It gets weird.. a spoken/oral lecture is not protected by copyright. Once that oral lecture is recorded then it is a copyright protected work created by the professor, but in your possession. If you only use it for personal use, it is unlikely they would ever know, but you technically have possession of their work without their consent. If you share that work it opens a whole can of worms. That might sound unlikely, but if a friend skips class and asks if you can share your recording that is what makes it a bigger issue legally.

My guess as to why it's such a concern for professors is if you record their lecture then share it on a public platform like YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, etc.. It is possible the university, if they own the rights, could take action against the professor for failing to prevent the recording and redistribution of the lecture. Part of getting people to come to UCF is to hear certain professors lecture on select topics. If that can be reproduced online for free, then that could negatively impact UCF.

I read a little more and note taking services (by hand) are a grey area. You or the note taker are creating the work, but it's summarized version of the professor's protected work. There are arguments about who owns the rights in those situations, mainly professors bring this up to prevent note takers from selling summarized versions of lectures for profit.

Here is a freely published article from a journal that discusses concerns on both sides. The side of a professor/university wanting to capture a lecture and the side of students recording lectures for their purposes. It's lengthy, so I haven't read the whole thing yet.

He stole the idea from other universities where students already had the idea, it wasn't his original idea. He then paid someone in another country, I think India (?), to program it. Neither the idea or the work was really his.

Then he posted here, and I warned him about the stress he could be putting on the servers running myUCF and how his constant requesting of data was likely negatively impacting other students. He more or less said it wasn't his problem if other students had worse service. He said UCF needed to worry about it, in short UCF needed to spend to accommodate his service he was trying to milk students with. Big picture, he was purposely degrading the service students use to sign up for classes, which surprise surprise, would drive more students to rely on his notification service for when they could sign up for a class. 

He gave no care about UCF students or improving their lives. He also charged five times more than the other services he stole the idea from. He was driven by greed and saw nothing wrong with his actions. I even commented he should contact UCF administrators before going further, and he said they were stupid or something similar and that would be a waste of his time.

Then when he appealed he stuck with his stance that degrading service for other students wasn't his issue and he saw nothing wrong with his actions. You can/could see his presentation online.

"Hes a great teacher and a funny guy but no one should need him to pass the foundation exam. Study study study. Divide the exam up.

Second one is linked lists, also fairly easy once you get the hang of it

Third is stacks / queues, alot of the times its a simple post fix to infix, they surprised me with a weird version of that look at the recent september exam when it comes out.

Those 3 questions are 25 points and are on fairly basic stuff

The next set of 3 is trees, hash tables, and some other stuff but overall not too bad.

The last half of the exam tends to be harder (at least for me) but if you did good on the first part you dont need too much from the second half

Also most 5 point questions are actualy a cake walk, there are 4 of them usually a free 20 points.

"I developed slight PTSD after dealing with a hostile roommate during my first semester here. He was a very manipulative person and once I stopped letting him get his way the started to act very violent and aggressive.

It got to the point that he threatened to murder me in my own home, broke into my room and trashed it and broke a few of my personal belongings. He told me he was going to stab me for canceling the cable that he wasn't paying. I had to call the police and have him arrested (he moved out very fast after that).

This whole ordeal caused me to develop minor PTSD and I would get mini panic attacks if I saw anyone who resembled him on campus as I legitimately thought he was going to try to murder me after I got him arrested.

I had to seek therapy after that happened since the whole experience caused me a great deal of emotional distress and many triggered emotions. I couldn't trust anyone who wanted to be my friend after that happened which caused me to become more socially isolated.

"I had a mother who passed away from cancer and I'm at high risk for it so I'm aware of the risk. I will concede that's a problem that your party deals with better, but currently I'm not dying so I value well-being of millions of people over the relatively small portion who have cancer in comparison. But I do feel that as poorly structured as the health-care industry is, the quality of doctors that I've dealt with have been spectacular; depriving them of their exorbitant pay would demotivate them to pursue the profession. But I don't know, I guess most of the inefficiencies in healthcare in the money grabbing insurance companies, and I will concede that--as I've said before--democrats deal with that better than republicans.",1571976311,0,0

"What?!?!?! I HAVE to ask him about this in class tomorrow! Yeah he just got his PhD and got signed on to teach for some indefinite period of time as far as he knows. He probably needs a few semesters‚Äô worth of good evaluations and I have no doubt that he‚Äôll not only be made into a tenured research professor, but a very distinguished and successful one in the math department because of his genuine passion for teaching and his awesome sense of humor.",1571973402,2,0

"Rosen, at least in my experience so far, is like this. They do require certain versions of textbooks, but that's only officially, and if you wait till the first day of class they will basically tell you that you can get the old version of the book because almost nothing has changed, if you even need the book at all. At least in my experience anyway.",1571972216,1,0
