I don't understand how this works. Help pls,"All I understand so far is I am accepted into UCF for the 2020 fall semester as a freshman.

They said I chose my major as Pre-economics or something, but I don't think that's what I put. I'm pretty sure I put integrated business. But now I hear it's a BSBA and people look down upon it? Why? I also hear there's MINORS you can choose along with your major. When registering for classes, how do you choose classes based on that? I also heard you can change your major. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ALSO don't understand credit hours and all that. And I also know there's people fighting to get specific classes and specific teachers, how do you that when registering? Where do you even register?

&amp;#x200B;

I also need to go to orientation. But I can see there's a knightro orientation and a pegasusasrio and all that, what's the difference?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very confused and know literally nothing about what any of this means or what to do. I literally need a step by step explanation and tips of all of this, since my counselor can't explain it and neither can my teachers. I am also doing online school, so my teachers aren't easily reached. I would appreciate any bit of help, I don't know anyone who went to UCF and I'm fairly new to the United States.

Should I double major Emerging Media (Character Animation Track) and Computer Science?,I'm very interested in going to UCF but I'm not 100% sure on my major. I've always wanted to do something with animation and more recently video games and I like to keep my options open so I was considering double majoring but I'm not sure if that's such a good idea considering that I've heard Comp Sci is very difficult at UCF. I know that I don't want to give up animation but it would really help with what I want to do in the future to have a strong Comp Sci base especially since I'm not sure I want to go into the film side of animation and would most likely prefer to work in the video game industry (plus is all fails I would be able to get a job with a comp sci degree much easier than with an animation degree).

Anyone want to go to the SGA meeting today to advocate for a change in the sick absence policy?,"Hey I'm going to go to the SGA meeting today to advocate for a change in the excused absence policy. Right now it varies with professor and some professors have a rather strict one. Normally I wouldn't think twice about it, each professor has a policy and that's fine. But it's come to my attention that when professors have a rather strict policy more often than not people will show up sicker than they normally would otherwise. That presents a problem for those that have compromised immune systems where a common benign illness, might mean serious sickness that will make them unable to come to class for perhaps weeks. Even without a compromised immune system, what student wants to get sick because another student didn't want to go through the hassle of getting a note?  I already brought it up to them in an email and all they did was restate DOE policy, didn't even attempt to address the issue since the issue is the DOE best practice in the first place. So that's my proposal, I know this is a controversial issue, one side holds that if you feel sick stay home, the other side says 'fuck that, I'm not fucking my GPA over because I have a bad cough'.

I could clearly see that the man was holding a camera so I let her know and she seemed to instantly relax. She got on the bus and everything was fine, I just can't get over the fact that middle school kids are worried about these things.

Withdraw from class with Bright Futures,"I'm currently receiving the highest level of Bright Futures that covers 100% of my classes. My GPA is great (somewhere between 3.4-3.6, in that range) and I've done well in all my previous classes but I've had my mental health issues exasperated this semester and while I've started medication, it hasn't kicked in quite yet and I'm really having a rough time.
Three of my classes are manageable but one class in particular is really kicking my ass and because it's causing me so much trouble it's making my other classes that much harder. I'm afraid I may fail it and I'm just worried about my Bright Futures.

What will happen if I just withdraw from the class and become a part-time student? Will I have to pay back some or all of my money but still receive the aid in the future as long as my GPA is good?

What will happen if I just fail the class? Will that terminate my Bright Futures or will I have a second chance? This isn't my first year, which I know first year students will get a pass if they fail to renew their Bright Futures, but this isn't my first year...yet again, my GPA is still good and I don't think failing this one class will make it dip below a 3.0 (especially if I do well in my other three classes)


I'm at a loss here. I absolutely need Bright Futures or I won't be able to go to school or pay rent, but I'm struggling while my mental health regulates itself. I feel like if I just let this class go, I can at least salvage the other three classes (which are requirements for my degree, while this difficult one was merely an elective)

Prospective School Psych Grad Student Needs Answers!,"Hello!

So I'm currently applying for the School Psych Ed.S. program for the fall of 2020, and I'm a bit pissed. I had all my documents in on time for the early consideration deadline on January 15th, except of course for the fact my GRE scores which I ordered a good 5 weeks ago. I didn't get a legit answer from the department about being considered for an interview only that they couldnt offer admission until all the documents were recieved. I know my wife whose currently a grad student here was offered an interview without all of her items submitted, but it's a different department.

Does my program have access to my application despite not all items being in? Will my application be held up until those GRE scores are recieved and then submitted to the specific department? Anyone have an answer for me?",1580075467,1,0

A professor at Seminole State College, Mark is known for his outspokenness of the board‚Äôs outputs and lack of transparency amongst its Supervisors. He wants to completely re-brand the board by making it relevant to the community through education, partnerships, and boosting its social/political capital to generate more impactful conservation practices.Mark found his love for conservation during his early college years working for Lukas Nursery in Oviedo, FL. There, he fell in love with nature and the way it brings people together. After finishing graduate school, Mark wanted to become more involved in local conservation efforts which led him to the Orange County Soil and Water Board. As a constituent and stakeholder of the board, he was appalled to see the board in its current state. ‚ÄúI thought, ‚Äòwait, I vote for these people‚Äô‚Ä¶and then I went and saw for myself the uselessness of the board because they couldn‚Äôt meet the basic necessity of a quorum‚Ä¶why are some Supervisors showing up to parades but can‚Äôt show up to one meeting per month?‚Äù he recently said in an Orlando Sentinel article. During his studies of Public Administration in college, Mark understands the importance of community relevancy, stakeholder responsibility, transparency, and accountability. ‚ÄúWithout any type of community input, our municipality system and the effects on home rule will be significantly damaged,‚Äù Mark expressed.Mark has volunteered for a number of community organizations that greatly affect the citizens of Orange County and Central Florida. One of those being Support Our Scholars, which helps underprivileged young women obtain mentors and financial help to attend college. Similarly, Mark left the private sector to help students obtain their GED, and ultimately reach their goals through education. Mark‚Äôs extensive studies while in graduate school has enhanced his abilities to understanding how to effectively run a board such as the Soil and Water Board. ‚ÄúIt is a pretty easy fix honestly, it will just take some work and dedication, just read my Strategic Plan I published‚Äù, said Mark.

Currently, Mark maintains a decent following on Facebook and is fundraising to support his efforts come Election Day.

Punishing students for having excess credit hours is wrong," 

I have been in and out of college for 10 years, I'm 29 years old. My family doesn't have much, my father is terminally ill and I honestly don't think he has much longer to live. My mother, God bless her heart, works so damn hard at 62 years old and basically lives paycheck to paycheck. I've been trying so damn hard to finish my education and the past 3 years I really tried to buckle down and finish. Last semester I found out last minute that all my financial aid would be taken away because in my state (Florida) if you have too many college credits they punish you by taking your funds away and doubling the cost of your tuition.

Because of this, I had no way to purchase my textbooks or pay my rent, I was even having to resort to stealing food and going thru the garbage at fast food places to reduce my spending. The stress of all that caused me to fail all my classes, I was then put into a mental hospital because I almost committed suicide after going through all that. After I got released, I was told that I will be dismissed from my major because of my grades. I will now have to change my major and stay in school for a year longer if I want to graduate. I tried to appeal my financial aid and they rejected the appeal. I went into extreme detail as to why I'm ""over-credits"" (moved to 3 different states, had to transfer to 3 different colleges many of my credits didn't transfer but they still count it as my attempted credit hours) in the response letter they didn't even care, all they said was "" your appeal has been rejected because you are over-credit hours.""

I am now in the process of waiting for an answer for Medical withdrawal in order to have those grades expunged from my transcripts from last semester so that I don't have to say in school longer than I already have. My family worked their butts off and scrounged up money for me to pay my rent for this semester but because I'm still waiting on an answer for my medical withdrawal I'm only enrolled in 1 class. I feel overly pressured by my family AND the government to finish. All my friends also want me to finish.

I'm always told the same thing ""you've come so far, don't give up"" ""you put so much time and money into this, don't quit now"" Yeah, I get that. But for me to do well in school I have to put 100% of my effort and school. I can‚Äôt work a fulltime job and get A's. I've tried numerous times, I can only do well when I'm working very minimal hours but now I have no financial aid to help me pay my bills while in college.

I'm so tired of putting my life on hold for school. I'm almost 30 for Christ's sake I'm been here too damn long for a damn UNDERGRAD degree. I have put my life on hold for this, put off jobs, friends, relationships, family time all for this stupid piece of paper. I'm almost 30 and I making 9 dollars an hour, when I try to find better-paying jobs they keep harping on having a degree when I've been working for over 10 years, no one cares about my work experience.

I feel that I'm just not meant to succeed, I feel like I'll always be stocking shelves in a retail store the rest of my life, I just want a career, I want to help my family, but school keeps getting in the way of that. I‚Äôm trying so hard not to stay in retail for the rest of my life.",1579887948,1,0

The quarantine taught me that I need to actually LIVE my damn life.,"This virus and quarantine actually made me reconsider a lot of my priorities in life. I take a lot of things for granted.
I focus so much on studying and work that sometimes I have to cancel plans with my friends, don‚Äôt that trip I wanted over the break, decide not to go on dates and etc.
Now that there‚Äôs a quarantine and I sit at home, I literally cried because I didn‚Äôt do so many things  I wanted in my life. I know that I‚Äôm young but I don‚Äôt want to be in the same situation when I‚Äôm old regretting all those things and chances I didn‚Äôt take.
I know it‚Äôs gonna be over and we‚Äôll go back to normal lives but I‚Äôm thankful that this situation taught be to LIVE from now on rather than plan all the time and dream about this perfect life I‚Äôll have in the future but now I need to just workworkwork  and ‚Äúsuffer‚Äù.
So don‚Äôt be like me and when we go back to normal lives, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask that girl/guy you‚Äôve always liked out, take that small trip, start your dream hobby, apply for that dream job and just do what you‚Äôve always wanted to.

"Questions Regarding Bright Futures, S/U Grades, and Withdrawal","I took 3 classes in Summer 2019, 4 in Fall 2019, and enrolled in 4 this semester. In summer and fall I passed all of my classes, however this semester I began having trouble even before the COVID-19 crisis hit us. I withdrew from one of my classes before spring break, and thus had to pay back the bright futures money for the class. I wasn't happy and couldn't get it appealed but I did it.

But now I've heard that you can keep your Bright Futures with S/U grades as they still count for credit hours and don't affect your GPA. There's another class I'm currently in that I don't feel so confident about, so I'm considering taking a S/U grade for it as I have a feeling that I'm going to fail it. 

I feel good about my other two classes, as I have a solid A in one and a strong C in the other. I will pass both of those, so I'll have 27 total credit hours for this year, which is above the yearly minimum for Bright Futures to be reinstated (and if the U grade still counts for credit hours, I'll have 30).


Basically, am I at all at risk for losing Bright Futures even when I've tanked two classes this semester? I know one W will be okay for me to continue, but will a W and a U have any sort of negative impact on me continuing to get my aid? I know I could probably find this information somewhere online, but trying to look it up felt so overwhelming and confusing.",1585444255,1,0

1. Is it really full cost of attendance for out of state? I‚Äôm a New York resident, is the scholarship still going to cover everything?

2. Is the scholarship enough for the summer semester and extra fees like laundry and a meal plan? I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd get the meal plan, but I‚Äôm curious after hearing you have to pay for laundry machines with your own quarters. Also, I think I‚Äôd be living in tower 3, which seems to be 11.5 months - does the scholarship cover the extra summer months‚Äô tuition and housing + whatever meal plans, fees, etc. I‚Äôd need for those extra months? 

3. Do you need to fill out the FAFSA to get the scholarship? My dad hasn‚Äôt filled it out for my sister, I‚Äôm not sure he wants to do it :‚Äô

4. I‚Äôve seen the words ‚Äúscholar‚Äù and ‚Äúfinalist‚Äù being tossed around a lot on NM scholarship sites, so I have to ask: is the full ride scholarship only for a National Merit Scholar (the ones who get the $2,500 awards) or all 15,000 finalists?",1585423546,1,0

I was wondering if I should add some sort of ""I am sorry to bother you"" or a better way to introduce myself?

Here is my email below:

&gt;Dear Professor Doe:  
&gt;  
&gt;I hope all is going great. I am a current computer science student here in UCF trying to enroll for your course. Unfortunately, due to misunderstandings when transferring over my transcripts and the Covid-19 delay, I was not awarded the required prerequisite and was placed in ABC XXXX. I saw in the course description that with the right permission I would be able to take them concurrently and was told to contact the professor of the course. I also certainly believe I am able to perform in this course and have strong prior knowledge.  
&gt;  
&gt;I would greatly appreciate your help with this matter as since I have all other classes fulfilled; not being able to take this course would leave me with only one course to take, thus cutting my aid and severely delaying my graduation date down the road since every course is a prerequisite of one another, especially BCD XXXX which is the main starting point.

Leftists masquerading as professors need to know that Campus Reform exists to ensure personal politics isn't used to brainwash susceptible college students. CR has already led several successful campaigns to have such professors fired for knowingly and purposely breaking university rules and regulations. Now more than ever, with the defeat of communist/socialist Bernie Sanders and pipedreams like socialized medicine, liberals have been increasingly antagonistic. Campus Reform takes its mission serious in order to provide everyone with a safe and educational environment free of discrimination and personal agendas",1587512160,0,0

Tips for a deciding incoming freshman,"To start off, both my parents are alumni and HUGE knight fans and I‚Äôve grown up in Orlando visiting my grandma who works on campus. For a while I was turned off to UCF just because I wanted to go away for college and UCF felt so local 

Right now I‚Äôm between the UF PaCE program (I really wanted to go to Florida but PaCE feels like a scam to me) and UCF. I got the UCF gold scholarship for $14,000 and have bright futures so that looks really nice to me, plus a job here if I needed it. For PaCE I‚Äôd probably stay home the first year and work so I could save some extra money to move to Gainesville. Financially, UCF is a big win 

I‚Äôm not entirely sure what I want to major in. I switch off every day between biology, premed, nursing, psychology, I don‚Äôt really know. I‚Äôve been hoping the college experience will help me figure that out, right now I‚Äôm down for biological sciences

I wanna know about the culture at UCF. Are there a lot of opportunities that will help me figure out what I might like to do? How are internships etc? Student facilities? What about the party life, not that it‚Äôs a priority but are there a lot of good parties and chances to get a little crazy? 

Also I‚Äôm really interested in the arboretum, if I choose UCF that‚Äôs the first thing I wanna sign up for, I love plants and follow the Instagram and it looks like those would be my people. And the outdoor adventure club seems really neat!! 

UCF is a great school and I know that, it‚Äôs just hard for me to get over the UF hype everyone gives around here. If I choose UCF I want to be really excited about it and get over my old dream of being a Gator and be genuinely stoked to be a Knight! 

I‚Äôm sure next year will be a little strange because of the virus right now and the coming years in general life will look pretty different. I‚Äôm trying to make a decision the best I can through the current circumstances

TL;DR if you can offer and advice about UCF, anything about your experience and why you chose it and the great stuff it has to offer I‚Äôd love that! Cons as well, just anything about your experience a potential incoming freshman should know. 

Thanks so much! Go Knights!!",1587449435,1,0

why you should NOT attend UCF,"For anyone thinking of attending UCF this one‚Äôs for you. 

Before my senior year of highschool, I never heard of UCF. Like ever. Then I started researching, and deep diving on youtube and I fell in love. I went to Knight for a day, went again for a tour with my mom (I live in GA), I met so many people randomly that either went to UCF or had a family member go and swore it was the greatest experience ever. That was a lie. UCF has such a beautiful campus with an extremely diverse student body, but beyond that everything is a facade. This past year has been hands down the worst year of my life. 

When accepted into UCF I received the Pegasus Gold scholarship which was around $36k i believe split over 8 semesters. My parents had also set up a florida prepaid account for me when I was younger- which is the only reason I was looking at FL schools to begin with- so we assumed I could use both. That however was not the case. When I attended the Knight for a day session we asked someone from financial aid and was told no. Then on the tour we spoke to two people from Student Accounts and were told yes and no. Very confusing. I then spent the entire summer going back and forth between emailing and calling both financial aid and student accounts (because they would always transfer me back to the other) and was finally told by 3 different people- not including someone from FL prepaid- that I could in fact use them in conjunction. 
So everything was great, I accepted the scholarship and declined all loans because with the scholarship I would‚Äôve gotten a refund. When the semester first started I still had my scholarship during the add/drop period, the day that ended is the day my scholarship disappeared from my account. No email, no call, nothing. I spent 2 weeks being sent between financial aid, student accounts, and first year admissions. No one could explain anything, no one gave me anything in writing as far as policy, the only thing they could say was that the money from the scholarship was already gone and they couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. Im in Orlando alone- no family, no friends, my parents are working and I was quite literally running around campus having to miss classes trying to figure out how Im going to be able to pay to go to school. Im frustrated and crying and already struggling in classes. After sending emails and going to offices and cc‚Äôing anyone I could think of I finally had to get my account reversed so I could get enough in loans to pay for the fall semester. My first loan was only $800. To pay for my housing, tuition, and fees. $800. 
My mental health took the biggest plummet of my life. I was severely depressed, failing classes, broke, couldn‚Äôt make any friends. I went to CAPS- didn‚Äôt help much. Random charges kept popping up on my account all semester $600, $250 for that, $150 for this and I would have to ask my parents- who have 5 other kids- for money so last minute or i‚Äôd be at risk of something else. 
Spring semester rolls around and I have even less money than the fall for my loans. I had to pay $860 for my tuition and the loans went to housing minus $350 that I had left to pay. On Jan 20 I applied for fall 20 housing, on Jan 30 I was waitlisted and cancelled my application. I never got the $250 back so Im assuming it went to housing. On February 20 I paid the remaining $97 charge on my account to release my transcripts. I have now been going back and forth with housing over the last few days because my covid refund is only $400, which is substantially lower than all 3 of my roommates, and no one has been able to give me a real answer on anything. Housing released and email saying we would receive 25% back of housing dues but now they‚Äôre telling me I didnt pay it all or that the refund is for my tuition which does not make any logical sense. 
UCF does not care about anyone but UCF. They do not value your time, they just want your money. They will lie, they are extremely unprofessional, and they offer no real solutions to anything. I thought I would‚Äôve loved this school, but coming here was the worst decision of my life. I have been fighting tooth and nail since I got here, sacrificed my mental health and money I didn‚Äôt have to begin with.

The price is currently $750 a month, and will change to $789 a month in August, as they raised the prices for the next year.

Normal Patterns For Summer Waitlists?,"I don't have a ton of experience with UCF courses in the Summer.

Well, after being waitlisted somewhere in the 60's, I find I must re-evaluate this view.

For people with more experience in the Summer, is this the normal waitlist demand/pattern? I was having a suspicion that maybe it had something to do with the unique circumstances presented by the coronavirus this semester, and that maybe it caused a lot more people to re-take classes from this semester over the Summer that normally would not have had to without the coronavirus.

So yea, normal waitlist pattern or an aberration due to the unusual circumstances this semester? If it makes any difference, this was for Linear Circuits II.

I am currently a student at FSCJ in Jacksonville and I currently have 43 credits with a 3.3 GPA. I am planning on getting my A.A. and hopefully transfer to get an International Studies B.A. I meet all the basic requirements but I am a bit unsure about the foreign language requirement. I took French for two years in high school and got an F and D, but my high school let me graduate, and FSCJ let me enroll (foreign language requirement is listed as complete on the school website). Now on the UCF transfer page, the section regarding transfers states that the language requirement will be satisfied (entered college after 2016 so this applies to me). Could someone elaborates on whether satisfied means waived or complete, and would I have two take two language classes currently to supplement? 

I have Spanish classes starting tomorrow, and with respect to the language and the people that speak it, I would rather not spend time and money on something I might not necessarily need. I am instead interested in the Arabic courses offered at UCF as I want to get the Middle Eastern studies minor which makes sense to take.

Life after Graduation,"I'm currently at the beginning of my final semester here at UCF before graduation. I transferred here in Fall 2019 with the intention of graduating with a Business Management degree at the end of Summer 2020, but I recently had to switch to a degree in Integrative General Studies to ensure I could graduate on time. So with that said, I'm hoping that some alumni could weigh in and give me some feedback as to what life was like after graduation. What did you do? Were you able to get a job? Where did you live? Was life as enjoyable as while you were in college? Do you have any suggestions or advice for things that I should be doing in this last semester or things I should do after graduation?

Right now I'm still trying to figure out exactly what my plan is. I want to continue living in Orlando rather than going back down south to live back with my parents, but I realize that it's expensive here and I don't have any jobs lined up. My plan is to start with an internship and then use that as a means to land a job that can pay enough for me to live here in Orlando. Any suggestions for places to live or ways to find a decent living situation would also be appreciated.

On top of trying to get my career/ housing situation figured out, I also want to get my social life figured out. I transferred here 9 months ago without knowing anyone and had high hopes of making friends and putting together an ideal college social experience, but it just didn't quite turn out that way. I went to clubs, events, spoke to people in class, and did everything I could, but was unable to get past the phase of being acquaintances to actually having good friends to hang out with. Having the Covid-19 pandemic breakout midway through my second semester definitely didn't help that. So my hope is that I can still live here in Orlando and still put together a social life just as good as I could've had in college even though I'm graduated. Please feel free to share any input on this as well.

tl;dr I hung out with this girl for this first time in a study group. No big deal. Then coronavirus happened and nobody saw each other again. Then, the other day she texts me to check up on me and what I have been doing. My GF gets mad I'm talking to this girl (nothing serious, just a classmate).

So here is the update: my GF decided to break up with me. And then I went to the classmate to try to explain the situation and why I can't be friends with her. So she said ,""oh....I see...."" Then, we didn't say anything else. I'm crying about losing my gf and this shit show semester, then I randomly get a text from the classmate saying, ""hey, if you need to talk, call me"" and so I just took it because I needed someone to talk to. Then, I just talked about everything and she's cheering me up. And we talked for an hour then hung up.

Tonight, she just texted me saying she wanted to hang out since a couple of places opened up around ucf.

Physics 1 is hell.,"Im completely done with this semester and it‚Äôs only one week in üò´.

Im a health science major (pre physical therapy) and decided to knock out physics in 6 weeks. Never taken physics in my life, assumed it wasn‚Äôt that bad especially online. Boy was I wrong.

I spend about 8-9 hours per day reading the textbook and watching youtube videos explaining the content. My professor does do lectures on zoom, but they‚Äôre practically useless because he only ever scratches the surface for around an hour when it‚Äôs supposed to be 2 hours. Expects us to teach ourselves the majority of the material and doesn‚Äôt help during his virtual office hours.

I basically get every single question on our assigned homework wrong even after endless reading and studying. I won‚Äôt know how this class is gonna go because we only have a midterm and final and I‚Äôve heard averages are very low for those. I‚Äôm hella scared for my grade.

When looking at the major requirements it says I have to take College Algebra, but it seems like if I score a 70% on the test I would be taking the class above it such as Pre-Calculus algebra or College trigonometry.

My question is, if I score like I am hoping, is there any rule saying I need to take a math class every year or anything like that? If i have my math credit, and supposedly placed in college trigonometry/precalc algebra, would I have to take it?

I heard the math classes are aweful so I am trying to avoid having to take them if I don't have to lmao

My chances of getting in,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone got in with a similar situation as me. I know my stats are terrible but UCF is really my dream school and I‚Äôd love to get some advice!

GPA: Weighted: 3.6 Unweighted: around a 3.0 (I am finishing my junior year so I don‚Äôt have the final semester of this year averaged in yet but it is probably the best one of my high school career so far!) 

SAT: 1120 I know it is low like my GPA but this was my first attempt. I am going to see if I can take it again in August or whenever I can. Did not take ACT.

AP‚Äôs: Took HUG in 10th grade. This year I am taking Psych, government/macro economics, language, and capstone (which is a new AP program that they introduced to my school to see how it works). Next year I am taking the second year of capstone and lit. 

Foreign language: not sure how much it will help but I took 3 years of Latin 

Extra curricular: Varsity basketball since 10th grade 

Volunteering: 25 hours every year since 7th grade

My high school: I believe it is in the top 5 in the state of Florida for public schools and around 55 in the nation. It is a very rigorous college preparatory school.

Legacy: Mother, father, older brother, and older sister all graduated from there. I‚Äôve been a fan of UCF football and basketball ever since I was a kid!

Warning about affiliated off campus housing (TL;DR DON‚ÄôT DO IT)," So I have been living in off campus housing for almost three years and in the next month I will finally be leaving. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable naming the location just in case there‚Äôs any backlash against me. But I want to put some warnings out/stories for transfer students or in coming freshmen. 

 To start my first roommate In affiliated housing wasn‚Äôt even a student, they were living in the apartment with their boyfriend and were almost 30. They were very rude and dirty but nothing worse then that. My second roommate had a dog, they never properly took care of the dog. The dog lived in their room and was never allowed to leave and would cry and bark all day long. When I made a complaint for the dogs safety the apartment complex basically said they already approved the dog so there‚Äôs nothing they could do about it‚Äôs treatment. My third roommate was an actual decent human. 
So my first warning, move in with someone you either know or have met prior and feel comfortable moving in with. NEVER trust the match system. 
 My next issue has been with rent. If you were to compare my rent and many other off campus renting options almost all of them are over priced in comparison to non affiliated housing. For comparison the average affiliated off campus housing that is 4 bedrooms is between 600-800$ per month sometimes not including utilities. When the 4 bedroom I‚Äôm moving into that is not UCF affiliated is 525$ INCLUDING UTILITIES. Affiliated housing is grossly over priced and often has horrible lease terms such as not being able to break your lease. 
 Another issue I‚Äôve had moving around to different apartments in affiliated housing is how the apartments are upon move in, my recent apartment had multiple things broken and was filthy paint splattered all over the floor no electrical outlet covers etc. it really just shows that they don‚Äôt care about who moves in or moves out they just want your money.
 My last issue has to do with the pandemic. I was at most content with paying my over priced rent until the university shut down. UCF affiliated housings response to the pandemic has been little to nothing. The only ‚Äúhelp‚Äù that they‚Äôre offering where I currently live is no fees if I sublease my apartment. I cannot think of one person who wants to live in an over priced apartment for a MONTH. 

 These affiliated apartments should be forced to give us some portion of our rent back because we can‚Äôt use half of the things that make living in these horrible apartments bearable. 

If you take anything from this, DO NOT LIVE IN UCF AFFILIATED HOUSING IF YOU DO NOT HAVE TO!!!!",1589640068,2,0

Confused How to Move Forward....,"So I need some advice about graduating...  
**Major:** Health Sciences  
**Minor:** Health Administration

I have 7 classes left for my major (20 credits) and 3 classes left for my minor (15 credits). I took a 2 semester break due to personal reasons and am lost what I should do from this point forward. Today is the last day for adding classes if I want to add additional more. The classes I am doing for minor there are really good professors available if I do some in summer and all available online even if I choose other semesters to complete.

**Major:**

* Biology II (BSC2011C) - 4 credits
   * Taking it transient
* Pathophysiology II (HSC 4558) - 3 credits
* Epidemiology of Chronic Diseases (HSC 4501) - 3 credits
* Applied Health Research Methods (HSC 4730) - 3 credits
* Restricted Electives - 7 credits
   * Health Psychology (CLP 4314)
   * Principles of Health Communication (COM 4022)
   * Professional Development in Health Professions (HSC 4008)

**Minor:**

* Fundamentals of Health Information Technology - 3 credits
* Organization &amp; Management for Health Agencies - 3 credits
* Restricted Electives - 3 credits
   * Principles of Healthcare

I was wondering how realistic is it and really necessary to complete a minor or should I just graduate with only my major. I honestly do not know what I want to do in the future or if I want to just pursue a major in the health field and just have an educational degree. Where I am also lost is, if I take minor I am seeing myself graduating during the Spring semester of 2021 because my advisor does not recommend putting that much load of work after coming back after 2 semesters, even though the minor classes are really easy I could split it within 2 semesters with 5 and 5 classes. I am putting options and I would like to see what opinion would be best.....

MINECRAFT CREATIVE MODE BUILDING EVENT," 

Starting at the stroke of midnight this Monday (5/18) and lasting all week until the final minutes of Sunday (5/24) you will be able to access and claim a plot of land on the MineUCF creative Minecraft server. You will have a 62x62 plot of land all to yourself to build to your hearts content. You can also find the MineUCF discord server in the **#server-portal** over in our [discord server](https://discord.gg/4DR9SQj) if you haven't joined already.  

To join this event, all you have to do is connect to the Minecraft server and then type in ""/creative"" once you've spawned. This will teleport you to the creative world. From there you'll be able to claim a plot by typing in the ""/plot auto"" command.  

Over brief deliberation, we decided that the best theme for this event would be no theme at all. Go crazy!  You'll be able to find additional information on this contest on MineUCF's [official discord](https://discord.gg/K6GV2dS).

You know what you do on the practice? Vocab it's almost all vocab, or questions that have you pic words that describe the vocab or seniors that you have to pick fits with that  vocab word. But, on the HW you know what they have? Guess 2 to 3 questions related to the vocab then the rest being like on this date Mr Dr. scientist did a thing what was the thing and it's importance? The worst part is if you get a bad grade it does not let you see what you did wrong, what the hell! yes don't let me see what I got wrong so I can understand later for the very disproportional exam that is going to come up, yes perfect strategy.

Undergraduate Decision (HELP),"Hello. I am making this post because this is a desperate hour for me. I have 2 days to decide.

I got my letter back from UCF telling me that I‚Äôd only be able to attend in the fall if I start in the summer instead, presumably because I applied later than I should have. 

I really don‚Äôt know if I want to do that.. my alternative is to do Valencia for 2 years and then transfer to UCF after that, after all it‚Äôs less money and it‚Äôs the same kind of classes as well. 

My mom and her side of the family, however, don‚Äôt see it that way. Despite all the explaining, all they see is ‚Äúcommunity college‚Äù and will disown me if I go through with that. Even though it‚Äôs the same outcome overall.

I don‚Äôt know what to major in. I make good grades, but I don‚Äôt know where I want to go in life. I genuinely have no idea. So there‚Äôs that.

Part of me says maybe I should just take a leap of faith and try the summer class, but that‚Äôs a big commitment to jump into a 4-year university for me, even though I‚Äôm pressured into thinking that‚Äôs the right thing to do. I don‚Äôt really want to do summer classes at UCF but I know my family won‚Äôt look at me the same if I go to community college, even if I‚Äôm literally transferring after 2 years.

I have to mark ‚Äòaccept‚Äô or ‚Äòdecline‚Äô on myUCF before the 19th, so I‚Äôm asking for help, reddit. Thanks in advance.",1584418409,1,0

Decision: UCF vs Miami (OH),"Reposted here via recommendation from r/ApplyingToCollege. Also posted on r/miamioh

I have tried for months to make a decision between these two schools.

At UCF, I would major in Economics at the College of Business Administration. I am in the Burnett Honors College, and the Compass program. I will be living on campus for the first year, and actually want a roommate.

At Miami, I will also major in the Economics program at the Business school. I am not in the honors program or any other program for that matter. I like the housing here better.

Total cost for the two (including room and board each year)

Miami - $30k (In state) (Has a 4 year tuition guarantee)

UCF - $31k (Out of State) (No tuition guarantee)

Scholarship awards

Miami - $32k

UCF - $30.5k

I began to lean towards UCF, but had difficulty deciding to attend due to the use of the REAL format (meeting 5 times only per semester, the rest is teach yourself). However, I found out that the BHC will make me only have to take one of these classes over 4 years. There are also concerns about being required to take unrelated classes.

At Miami, I like the living situation better. I also like the requirement to live on campus for two years. However, it feels so secluded, and I don't know how fun it will be. However, at UCF, it feels incredibly huge, I don't know about that either. UCF also has a lot of commuting students, but the mere size makes many still live on or near campus. The business program is better, however, I am not in their honors program. There is no possibility about being required to take online classes at school. While the class sizes are much smaller, it equals out to UCF's honors small class sizes.

I live in Cleveland, OH. I like the availability to take the LYNX to MCO airport to fly home, vs having my dad pick me up 3.5 hours away (I won't have a car at either). I have no problem with the distance away from home.

I would like to return home to CLE after school, but it can absolutely change.

I also have somewhat of an interest in engineering.

I believe that Miami will give me a few more credits due to AP, but UCF requires less credits to graduate.

I had two visits scheduled for a second look, both of which were cancelled due to Coronavirus.

What should I do now? Which sounds like a better option?",1584404712,1,0

I am very open-minded, chill, do not tolerate rudeness, and consider myself an introverted extrovert :) Please comment or hmu if you'd like to talk or meetup (if this corona thing ever ends :/ )!",1584287020,1,0

Anybody here planning on moving in to the Pointe apartments this August? I need your help...,"Seriously, that‚Äôs all there is to it. I had signed a lease with them for the Fall 2020 semester but stuff happened in my life and I will not be attending UCF.

&amp;#x200B;

But I didn‚Äôt know exiting a lease before it starts was impossible without having to pay for it...which is something I cannot afford

&amp;#x200B;

It‚Äôs their B2 arrangement. 2bed/2bath and 915 square feet, $790 a month. \[Floor plan here\]([https://thepointeatcentral.com/floorplans/b2](https://thepointeatcentral.com/floorplans/b2))

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of signing your own lease, I‚Äôd put your name in the release form and then after we both do the necessary paperwork you‚Äôd have the apartment for August 22nd

&amp;#x200B;

Please message or DM me guys, I know this is my mistake but I just simply cannot afford without student loans (which was my original plan before backing out of the school)",1584285844,1,0

Jobs - select up to 2 jobs, things you're doing anyway, to gain server currency (e.g., mining, digging, and exploring).

Armored Elytra - combine different armors with an elytra in an anvil to armor up and fly (type of armor you can combine with/wear is bound to rank).

Better Sleeping - majority rule for the time to cycle to day.

Chairs - you can actually sit!

Chest Shop - place a configured sign on a chest in the market district and you too can sell your goods.

Custom Items - there are only a few custom items in the game so far but more will be added over time.

Dynmap - see the map of the explored world online.

Lift - elevators, enough said.

Minepacks - rank bound extra storage space

Towers Room Selection for Returning Individual,"Hi all

&amp;#x200B;

Just wondering if anyone had a poor experience with room selection as an individual who was returning to Towers. I liked living in Towers this year, but I didn't like living on the top floor, so I opted to choose a new room next year. I'm not selecting with a group, so my room selection is quite a bit later than those who are selecting with groups. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be unrealistic to expect a 4/4 and a private bathroom given these circumstances? Groups are only able to choose rooms with the same amount of vacancy, i.e a group of 4 can only go into an empty dorm, and a group of 2 can only go into a dorm with a vacancy of two rooms.  I imagine that on room selection day, I will only be able to choose from a room in a 4/2 or a 4/4 without a private bathroom. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone who was in a similar situation share how their experience was? Thanks.",1584144939,1,0

March 13 Updated Coronavirus Guidance email from UCF,"**March 13 University Update**

**Updated Coronavirus Guidance** 

Starting Monday, UCF will move to remote instruction for at least two weeks. Students are         directed to not return to campus during this period ‚Äî you will be able to access almost all campus services remotely. 

**On-Campus Housing** 

Residence halls will remain open only as a last resort to on-campus student residents who have no         other place to stay. Students who need to return must follow the travel guidelines below and must let Housing know of their plans by responding to the form in the Housing portal. 

We are taking these unprecedented steps because of the immediate need for social distancing, which is critical in preventing the spread of COVID-19 among our campus community and our families. That means avoiding mass gatherings and settings with large numbers of people and maintaining         distance from others when possible. 

Online classes will continue as usual starting Monday; face-to-face classes will be available in an         online format on Wednesday.

**Employees** 

All UCF employees are expected to report to work as usual. 

In preparation for the potential that some of our employees may need to work remotely, we are         directing all campus departments to begin preparing for that possibility as an additional measure to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. 

We understand that not all employees‚Äô jobs can be performed remotely. Departments should begin         identifying tasks that can be done remotely and those that cannot, as well as determining which employees would still need to report to campus. 

Thorough, helpful guidance for employees and supervisors about working remotely is available here:         [https://www.ucf.edu/safety/coronavirus/faq/](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpostmaster.smca.ucf.edu%2Femail%2Fredirect%3Furl%3Dhttps%25253A%252F%252Fwww.ucf.edu%252Fsafety%252Fcoronavirus%252Ffaq%252F%26instance%3D1942%26mac%3D6eb7266c5973d5dc1a9add0028a25239%26recipient%3D293513%26position%3D0&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckurtramos%40knights.ucf.edu%7Ce0b0d5b8ea3f4a83331308d7c7a25b7f%7C5b16e18278b3412c919668342689eeb7%7C0%7C0%7C637197372447070295&amp;sdata=9R4EQRXxguSmqhsseumK%2BPNdphJBqMPUzWrn06EarcU%3D&amp;reserved=0). We are developing additional guidance that we will provide early next week. This will include guidance related to employees in high-risk categories, such as pregnant women and those with serious health conditions. 

**Travel**

Earlier this week, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, and [global         travel is restricted](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpostmaster.smca.ucf.edu%2Femail%2Fredirect%3Furl%3Dhttps%25253A%252F%252Fwwwnc.cdc.gov%252Ftravel%252Fnotices%26instance%3D1942%26mac%3Df9353c98138ab49fe265daf5d5718bb8%26recipient%3D293513%26position%3D0&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckurtramos%40knights.ucf.edu%7Ce0b0d5b8ea3f4a83331308d7c7a25b7f%7C5b16e18278b3412c919668342689eeb7%7C0%7C0%7C637197372447080297&amp;sdata=1rnHbCyHy8o1FLszknTZ2yUlpAVmis3j2c%2FmJAbXSKw%3D&amp;reserved=0). Everyone is expected to monitor their health, limit interactions with others, and upon showing symptoms, immediately self-isolate and contact their health care provider. 

Based on guidance from state and federal officials, UCF is prohibiting all employees‚Äô official         university domestic and international travel for the next 30 days. The exception is employee travel between UCF campuses, which remains permitted. 

Those with planned university travel will receive an email with guidance on canceling their trip. No Travel Approval Petitions will be approved at this time. More information about work-related travel is available here: [https://www.ucf.edu/safety/coronavirus/faq/](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpostmaster.smca.ucf.edu%2Femail%2Fredirect%3Furl%3Dhttps%25253A%252F%252Fwww.ucf.edu%252Fsafety%252Fcoronavirus%252Ffaq%252F%26instance%3D1942%26mac%3D8b0dbd800e65d4f8844cad89b9ea251d%26recipient%3D293513%26position%3D1&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckurtramos%40knights.ucf.edu%7Ce0b0d5b8ea3f4a83331308d7c7a25b7f%7C5b16e18278b3412c919668342689eeb7%7C0%7C0%7C637197372447080297&amp;sdata=wdOffwZVT9pDa3zI30pWO%2FeGg%2BMISdAUqCii9vnCJF4%3D&amp;reserved=0).         

As UCF has previously  shared, any faculty and staff members or students returning from a         country that has a [CDC         Level 3 Travel Health Notice](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpostmaster.smca.ucf.edu%2Femail%2Fredirect%3Furl%3Dhttps%25253A%252F%252Fwww.cdc.gov%252Fcoronavirus%252F2019-ncov%252Ftravelers%252Findex.html%26instance%3D1942%26mac%3D0f386a6b1bacf21b0a3825b3e2fbcb34%26recipient%3D293513%26position%3D0&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckurtramos%40knights.ucf.edu%7Ce0b0d5b8ea3f4a83331308d7c7a25b7f%7C5b16e18278b3412c919668342689eeb7%7C0%7C0%7C637197372447090294&amp;sdata=Z9J6%2BVi8X678RpeQJ1JA3ZYgSnv2Q3VDVAcqCvmEyI4%3D&amp;reserved=0), which now includes almost all of Europe, should not come to campus and must self-quarantine for 14 days upon return. Employees who have to self-quarantine should reach out to their supervisors to discuss possible telecommuting options. 

Personal domestic and international travel by all students and employees is strongly discouraged during this unique time in an effort to best protect you and those around you. 

**Campus Events and Activities**

UCF will suspend all campus events starting Saturday, March 14, through at least Monday, March 30,         mirroring the period of remote instruction. Should the period of remote instruction be extended, the suspension of events would automatically be extended for the same time. New events should not be scheduled. 

Cancellations include all UCF Athletics events, UCF Celebrates the Arts, Knight-Thon, meetings of         student organizations, admissions tours and other academic and recreational meetings and events. 

Academic advising offices will remain operational, but advisors will not meet with students in         person until further notice. In order to receive advising support, students should call or email their advisor or advising office to schedule an appointment via phone or video conferencing software. 

UCF is taking these steps with the safety and wellbeing of our campus community top of mind. It         is imperative that you also prioritize your personal safety by practicing good hand hygiene, limiting your contact with others and contacting your healthcare provider immediately in the event you         present flu-like symptoms. 

This is a dynamic, stressful situation that requires everyone‚Äôs continued flexibility and         understanding. UCF is committed to regularly sharing information on [UCF‚Äôs         coronavirus website](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpostmaster.smca.ucf.edu%2Femail%2Fredirect%3Furl%3Dhttps%25253A%252F%252Fwww.ucf.edu%252Fsafety%252Fcoronavirus%252F%26instance%3D1942%26mac%3D631d315ce500c052cc6ec73f7b3e78ed%26recipient%3D293513%26position%3D0&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckurtramos%40knights.ucf.edu%7Ce0b0d5b8ea3f4a83331308d7c7a25b7f%7C5b16e18278b3412c919668342689eeb7%7C0%7C0%7C637197372447090294&amp;sdata=vtLqDZPvxqWW36ToAT2BXD5r96Y0NT6Q4z0b9y3jf8E%3D&amp;reserved=0) and communicating through email and [UCF         Alert](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpostmaster.smca.ucf.edu%2Femail%2Fredirect%3Furl%3Dhttp%25253A%252F%252Femergency.ucf.edu%252Fucfalert.html%26instance%3D1942%26mac%3Dac1b1d7244faebbff1f5708a5a71c22b%26recipient%3D293513%26position%3D0&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckurtramos%40knights.ucf.edu%7Ce0b0d5b8ea3f4a83331308d7c7a25b7f%7C5b16e18278b3412c919668342689eeb7%7C0%7C0%7C637197372447100282&amp;sdata=QPLRk8lVVGIjdrs5zBqx2MTU24dMvMU5rdJK1WyYAAw%3D&amp;reserved=0).",1584141929,1,0

Why is QMB 2 so poorly taught?,"This is my 2nd rant. Of all the REAL classes I have taken at UCF so far, this one is by far the worst.

My take on making John C. Hitt Library open 24-hours after working there for 3 years.,"Since it's SGA election season and some candidates are using it as a platform, students are now starting to talk about the possibility of opening the library open 24 hours again. I was gonna write a post about this last year, but decided not to. However, I'm starting to see more students wanting to make it happen. I get it. I hear y'all. But try to hear me out too.

I'm gonna be blunt and say that I think it's a bad idea. 

Why? 

Because I know that students will not take advantage of it.

How do I know that?

Because I've seen it. 5 days/week. When I was worked the closing shift until 1am (and 3am during finals week).

By the time it's 11pm-midnight, the place is dead. 95% of the students would've gone home. And the remaining 5% are students that either studying for real or just fucking around. Then there are homeless patrons, that literally just walk into to ask for public access to the computers, then goes to take a nap on one of the couches. IYKYK (I'm talking about you Chris--). There was also another time when I had to make sure that everyone has cleared the floor after we closed and I found a group of students having a mini pizza party and watching Ratatouille in one of the group study rooms. Like wtf, guys--

I know that there are a few dozen students who do want the library to open later and would actually take advantage of it, but it honestly isn't worth it. They would need to pay for staff and security (let alone the utilities of a 5 story building) just for some people to study overnight, when they can go to All Knight Study. And trust me-- the library staff does NOT get paid enough to begin with; they don't need a messed up sleep schedule either. 

There was one thing my coworkers and I had always agreed on: students who stay late at the library should just go home. Have a test in the morning? Try to get a good night's sleep. Need to finish an assignment? Go to All Knight Study. Don't have a computer to use at home? Borrow a computer from LibTech (which by the way, would be a better use of SGA funding; they really need more devices to check out to students).

In the end, this 100% my opinion based on what I've seen on a day-to-day basis. If any of you fellow Knights feel otherwise, you're absolutely entitled to feel that way and by all means go support the candidates with that platform.

So TL/DR: I think a 24/7 library is poor use of SGA funding and students won't actually stay there overnight for academic purposes.",1583294900,1,0

I want friends,"Hello! I‚Äôm new to reddit and I transferred to UCF in Fall 2018. Since then I have not made a single actual friend on campus, or off. I don‚Äôt know how common that is but it doesn‚Äôt really matter. I grew up in Albania with an entirely different general mindset about life and I feel like that has alienated me in a way from people here because it feels like I can‚Äôt really relate to anyone around me. 
I don‚Äôt like getting drunk because alcohol was available to me from a young age and I never developed a taste for it, but it seems like the only way to meet people around UCF at least is to frequent bars and clubs and participate in drunk activities. I absolutely hold no judgment, people can do whatever they want to entertain themselves, it‚Äôs just not for me and so far I have not found anyone who feels the same way. 
That‚Äôs not to say I don‚Äôt do substances though lol. I‚Äôm just a laid back stoner who values comfort over most, I love cooking and seeing people enjoy my food, I like to chill with my streaming services, I like to draw sometimes, I love listening to music but I have no ounce of appreciation for trap or anything of the sort (which is another thing that makes me feel alienated) however I always appreciate a good melody and a unique vocal which is why my top three are Tool, System of a Down, and Deftones. I‚Äôm not the most out there person but I enjoy being around energetic people because I‚Äôm quite energetic myself especially in conversation, which is really what I‚Äôm looking for. 
Even though I could probably spend the rest of my time at UCF all by my self and still come out the other side chilling, it would definitely be nice to be able to share it with a friend or two. I apologize if this post sucked, I‚Äôm not great at selling myself, but I figured it couldn‚Äôt possibly hurt to put myself out there. 
I‚Äôm also really into astrology but I am not all in your face about it although I would prefer to be able to discuss it with another person who is at least interested in the topic. Also I‚Äôm a Chemistry major, I‚Äôm tall as hell, and I love the outdoors but not if it involves physical activity other than walking/strolling.

Withdrawing from Classes after change of major,"So, this is my second semester at UCF.

I changed majors to Environmental Studies, and I‚Äôm feeling better about my academic future. However, this change occurred after I had already signed up for my 3 courses. I went and talked to someone in Fin. Aid (since I used a pell grant for school, next year I have to take loans out since my families financial situation has changed) since I wanted to withdraw from CS1 and they told me as long as I don‚Äôt drop ALL of my classes I will not have to repay the school for the class. That left me with my ENC elective and OOP this semester. 

As the semester has progressed, I‚Äôve been getting my ass kicked in OOP and I‚Äôm struggling to keep a C in the class now. I‚Äôve been considering withdrawing from OOP as well because A) I don‚Äôt want to have too many credit hours in the future to where I have to pay more per credit hour and B) the course does not benefit me in any way toward my ES degree. I‚Äôm just sort of lost as to what I should do. I feel like I‚Äôll be a quitter for dropping OOP because it‚Äôs not going well, but if for some reason I bomb the class, I won‚Äôt be able to go back and use grade forgiveness to fix it.

I am wanting to know what students at UCF think about this since the Coronavirus is all over the media and is new while the Flu has been around for a long time. Feel free to comment below or private message me if you are able and want to comment.",1583247256,1,0

Good internet providers?,"So I live at home with my parents, pretty close to campus, so far it‚Äôs been pretty good, but I‚Äôve been having to use my mobile hotspot on my phone as internet and a recent job offer is requiring me to have a stable internet connection, does anyone know of any good, preferably cheap internet providers here in Orlando? I remember in my old hometown that if you were a high school student and had a certain income you got a discounted rate on internet service, is there something to that equivalent here? Thanks everyone",1583246402,1,0
UCF Business in the Honors College,Hello! I recently got accepted to the honors college and was wondering if it helped people who are interested in business? I only hear bad things about the business classes at UCF but I'm hoping with the honors college I would be able to take smaller business classes for freshman year and avoid that problem...Would that be possible? Any tips for people looking at business majors? (But not finance or accounting),1583245222,1,0

As a requirement for my major I am conducting a research study under the guidance of my professor, Dr. Amy Reckdenwald. To collect data on this topic I have developed an anonymous online survey. I am requesting your assistance in recruiting subjects for my study. This study is only for individuals who are 18 years of age or older. The survey should take 1-4 minutes to complete. If you have any questions about the study please feel free to email me directly at darwashington@knights.ucf.edu or Dr. Reckdenwald at [Amy.Reckdenwald@ucf.edu](mailto:Amy.Reckdenwald@ucf.edu).",1583244813,1,0
Does anyone know how to solder?,So I‚Äôm having problems with my Pok√©mon Green game on the GBA and I looked up why and apparently it‚Äôs super common for this to happen and that I probably need to replace the battery in the cartridge.

Garbage Cans on campus,"I tend to pick up trash that doesnt look gross when I go out for walks on campus (generally just paper/cans/bottles), but if I'm walking on any of the outer sidewalks, I can never find trash cans. If my goal was to only throw them away, I could cut through a parking lot to the interior of campus and throw it out there but I feel like people shouldnt have to take a 3 minute detour for that. Last night I picked up 3 beer cans, and for 2 of them, I was carrying it for 5 minutes before I came across a trash can, and in that time I passed a few people who probably thought I was out for a late night drink. rant over",1583220019,1,0
