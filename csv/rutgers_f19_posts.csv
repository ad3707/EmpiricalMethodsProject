We‚Äôre weeks into the school year and it‚Äôs still impossible to sleep at night in these dorms,"I have not slept comfortably since the school year started up. These dorms are incredibly hot at night and it‚Äôs unbearable. I have asthma that reacts really poorly to heat and it makes it so hard to breathe and sleep at night. 

I get not having AC in the residence halls. It‚Äôd be expensive, hard to manage and be very wasteful energy wise. Here‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt get, these buildings don‚Äôt seem to be designed to control the temperature any other way. There are ways to cool down a room/building without ac, you‚Äôd think a university would find a way to do it 

For example, the dorms could not have these giant fucking windows with flimsily blinds that‚Äôs hardly block out the sun, making it so that during the day the sun just beats down hard on you and because it‚Äôs going through a big window into a tiny dorm it‚Äôs gonna heat up your room tremendously. 

At night? Idk what they could do but come on this school is full of engineers and no one has ever wanted to try and efficiently (both cost and energy) allow us to just enjoy the temperatures of our rooms?

Has anyone applied and been successful as transfer for Spring as a freshman?,"\*\*SORRY IN ADVANCE\*\*

I applied as a HS Senior to Rutgers but unfortunately did not get in to SAS or RBS and I plan on applying again as a freshman for the Spring 2020 semester. 

My concern is that there isn't a lot I can show for the time passed. I don't have a college GPA yet, so I can't establish that I am relatively a better student in college than I was in HS. I have taken up becoming a Research Assistant at Penn State (I know, BOO!) and joined a couple academic business clubs. I plan on writing about these activities in the recommended essay, but mentioning them will only take me so far. (Plus, I heard Rutgers is notorious for just admitting students based on stats and not even looking at activities or the essay)

So, has anyone gotten into the Spring semester as a freshman? If so, what do you think strengthened your application the second time around (assuming you have applied to Rutgers once before)? 

Also, for all students (primarily transfers), what do you think Rutgers primarily looks for in a transfer student? And, what can I do to increase the chances of getting in for Spring 2020 and not having to wait until Fall 2020?

Also, if you would like to ""chance me"".

"""Genuine Curiosity"" technique for freshmen to get into the Aresty Summer Science program","Hey all, there are some very nice guides already on how to navigate the Aresty system, and you should definitely take a look at those. But here is how I got in to the program, and it is advice you might not find elsewhere. Also, you'll need to start working on it ASAP.

If you don't know what the Aresty Summer Science program is, click [here](https://aresty.rutgers.edu/programs/summer-science-program).

Your goal is to befriend a professor before the end of this semester, and have them sponsor you for the program.

Step 1: Read the headlines for ""new discoveries"" on any given website. For STEM majors, that would be a science website. Look for the outrageous clickbait-title articles, like ""[Flexible ceramic aerogel withstands extreme heat and cold](https://cen.acs.org/materials/nanomaterials/Video-Flexible-ceramic-aerogel-withstands/97/web/2019/09)"", ""[FabRx: The First Clinical Study Using Personalized 3D Printed Pills (In Humans)](https://3dprint.com/253567/fabrx-the-first-clinical-study-using-personalized-3d-printed-pills/)"", ""[Crows love cheeseburgers. And now they‚Äôre getting high cholesterol.](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/08/crows-high-cholesterol-urban-cheeseburgers-animals/)"", ""[Absurd Creature of the Week: The Parasitic Worm That Turns Snails Into Disco Zombies](https://www.wired.com/2014/09/absurd-creature-of-the-week-disco-worm/)""

Step 2: Keep reading until you find a topic that is, to you, totally funky and fascinating. Read about it until you can comfortably explain its coolness to a friend. Seriously, find something that you like and want to learn more about. That is the only way this method will work. You might already have something in mind. What was it that made you choose your major?

Step 2.1: Your goal here is to read up on the topic until you come up with a question related to your topic that you **can't** find the answer to online.

Step 3: Find a professor who is doing research aligning with your interests. You'll get the most luck by googling ""your topic of interest + Rutgers research"", haha.

Step 4: The hard part. Contact the professor. Send one e-mail to their .edu address explaining what you are curious about, why you are curious about it, and **ask them the specific question that demonstrates your understanding of the topic**. The subject line of your e-mail is the question you've chosen. Wait. If this doesn't work, see if you can find the professor IRL and chat with them. Don't push, many professors are incredibly busy. Just try again with someone else.

Step 4.1: Meet with the professor and see if you get along. Also, get your question answered :)

Step 5: If there's a match, ask to help with the professor's research, and follow through, no matter how trivial the task. If they don't want your help, ask for advice on how to get involved in research at Rutgers.

Step 6: If everything goes well, eventually ask them if you can be their Aresty Summer Science student! **A shocking amount of professors don't know the program exists!**

&amp;#x200B;

End result:

1) You are very knowledgeable on a specific topic within your chosen field. This helps focus your college experience. It might be strange to pick your industry specialization right after starting college, heck, you might not even want to continue your major by the end of this year. Doesn't matter. **Pick a topic, become an expert, and you will grow to love it, regardless of how your interests change.** That's psychology babey.

2) You have a working relationship with a professor.

3) Maybe you get in the Aresty program. Maybe you don't. You've done your best, and now you are well-equipped to get involved in research for the coming semester.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck. And tell me what topic you choose ;)",1568328908,13,0

"COMMUTERS, LET'S UNITE!","Recently, there has been a huge influx of posts about non-existent parking in Livi. In the past there have been petitions against parking tickets that have been created, but let's get to the root of the problem. There are not enough parking spots for people to park in. Now normally the practice of overbooking is okay, but there is a certain margin that is allowed, for instance, let's say a plane overbooked by 5%. There is a chance that a certain amount of people will not make it to their flight, and thus there are extra seats in the plane. In short, companies profit by overbooking. But now imagine a plane that is overbooked by 50%-100%, there is obviously a big problem here. And yes, in about two weeks people will stop coming to class and so the parking lots will free up, but this problem will continue to persist. As Rutgers allow more and more freshmen, there will be more and more commuters on campus, and less and less of parking availability. We are all aware of the vicious cycle of not being able to park; 

1. Can't find a spot, so you waste 30 mins driving around 
2. You give up and park somewhere you're not supposed to 
3. You get a citation and Kaching! Rutgers is taking more of your money

Why pay almost $200 for a parking pass when you can't even park? 

The solution? We gather everyone who park their cars on campus, and we physically count the available parking spaces. If we can prove that there is insufficient structure for students and faculty, the administration will have no choice but to address the problem.

My homework's 95% as well. I make so many dumb mistakes it pisses me off. I could've gotten an 100 on Exam 2. Like fr, on one no partial credit question I had to use logarithms with L'Hopital's Rule and my final answer was x (arbitrary number), but I forgot that x was equal to ln L, not just L. I even wrote down ln L = xyz in the beginning when u had to take log of both sides but then I forgot to continuously write it, and I forgot to look at the beginning of my work, so I just wrote down x instead of *e\^x.* Like I know the stuff, but I keep messing up bc of accidental dumb mistakes. And I got a 0/10 on one partial credit question where I had to use implicit differentiation and I accidentally just used chain rule even though ONE OF THE QUESTIONS ON THE EXAM BEFORE THAT WAS AN IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION QUESTION WITH THE EXACT SAME WORDING, which I got right. Like the question said to leave your answer in terms of only x, which is an indicator of an Implicit differentiation question, and honestly idek why I used chain rule. I did a 10 point question in like 2 steps lmao. My brain was telling me I messed up but the nerves of the testing environment got to me and I just kept going.  I'm just worried I'll make dumb mistakes on the Final and that'll ruin my chances to get an A. So far, the midterm exams have been straightforward to me, but I just keep making accidental mistakes.

Calc 152: What It's Really Like,"The dreaded Calc 152. My professor called it the hardest Calc at Rutgers and most people tend to agree. Harder professors mean harder tests and then you don't stand a chance getting a good grade. Just take the L or retake it. 

I'm here to tell you that none of this is true. 

First of all, let me warn everyone by also mentioning that I come from an extremely competitive high school in New Jersey, so the math I am used to is much harder than college math. However, as a freshman I am still adjusting to college life and classes, so I guess the difficulties balance out. I'm making this post to tell people what Calc 152 is really like. 

Apparently I had a very hard professor, but a good one. She covers more material than the others, but her averages are slightly better. For the first exam, around 13 people got above a 90, and fewer qualified for an A since the cutoff was 92, out of 70 something people. This is actually better than most classes. Now I know this may be scaring you because the stats go against my main argument. But let me explain. Let's start with the basics. 

The course focuses on integral calculus, with many non-calculus elements in the series and sequences topics. The first exam is mostly based on the the last few topics of the College Board AB curriculum, such as volumes of revolution. Exam 1 has higher averages than exam 2, most likely for this reason. 

Misconception 1: the one about harder professors giving harder tests. 

The test questions are actually picked from a pre-approved question bank created by the coordinator. While some professors, like mine, may cover a topic more than the required curriculum, this means that the test CANNOT be unfair across sections/ professors. 

I've also noticed that a few questions come from the practice tests/questions. No reason to get these wrong. 

Misconception 2: this is a very hard class. 

No. Like I said, I may be used to harder math, but the exams could not be more straightforward. In high school, I don't remember any of the honors or AP math questions being anywhere close to straightforward. These exams are exactly what you should expect. In fact, they are easier than you would expect. 

Here's the secret about low averages: attendance. 

My professor decided to start taking attendance just for her own sake, to see how many people show up to lecture. Most days, somewhere between **25-40 people are missing.** 

Do you know how you learn math? By going to class. Math is literally the one subject where you most definitely HAVE to show up to class to understand what is going on. The exams are exactly the like example problems shown in class. So the people regularly not showing up have no chance of getting anything more than a C. 

Now, most of the difficulty strangely lies in the homework. The textbooks recommended problems (not graded) and the online problems that are graded are many times harder than the content you are expected to know. It is okay if you feel like you have no idea how to do the homework because it actually is much harder than the stuff you need to know. 

I know that many people attend lectures and try to do all the homework and still cannot get the grade they want in this class. This is not about you guys. Maybe math just isn't your thing, and maybe there's something going on in your life. Or you need new ways to study. In any case, I would imagine most people do not fall under this category. 

If you are planning on taking Calc 152 anytime in the future and are worried about its difficulty, **do not be.** It is not a hard class. You cannot bitch about the class if you put in no effort at all to show up to lecture and pay attention. Just keep up with these lectures, do your homework, and there's no reason you shouldn't get an A. 

Yes an A.",1574482080,1,0

The Daily Targum is censoring coverage of Rutgers Hong Kong protests,"Last night, a student-led panel was held at the Douglass Student Center^1. Five anonymous people from Hong Kong talked about police brutality, sexual abuse by police and other topics related to the protests. Throughout the event, mainland Chinese students interrupted the speakers, insisted they be allowed to record the panel (even though it was strictly prohibited due to safety concerns) and laughed at videos of protesters getting assaulted. 

The [Targum article](https://www.dailytargum.com/article/2019/11/panel-featuring-hong-kong-protesters-sparks-debate) mentions none of this. They portray it as the mainland Chinese students ""not feeling heard"" and the event ""sparking debate"". When in reality, the mainland Chinese students did everything in their power to disrupt the panel and suppress the Hong Kong protesters from speaking. 

**None of the following is mentioned in the Daily Targum article:** 

* As soon as the panel began, mainland Chinese students kept yelling out and interrupting the speaker, insisting they be allowed to record the event (obviously very dangerous because the speakers wanted to be anonymous for their own safety). 
* When the panelists played clips of police violence, the mainland students snickered and scoffed. 
* Mainland Chinese students accused the Q&amp;A of being rigged. This was proven false, because after the mainland students spammed the question form with 100+ questions, the panelists did their best to answer their questions (which were all along the lines of ""Why are you supporting violent riots?"", ""Why don't you show the full videos of what happened?"", ""What do you expect the police to do, give protesters hugs?""). 
* Most of the mainland students were on their phones when the panelists were speaking, and would only put them down to interrupt the speakers with snide remarks. They were not there to learn or to listen. RUPD had to step in multiple times to make sure things remained peaceful.
* During the intermission, the mainland students encircled an older woman in the audience who was defending Hong Kong. She was visibly upset as they were yelling at her and trying to intimidate her. They did this to other audience members as well.  
* When the panelists mentioned the Chinese government's censorship of the media, all of the mainland students got up and walked out, yelling in Chinese. 
* They taped their poorly-designed flyers over the sign for the panel, and tried to hand them out to audience members.
* After the event, RUPD told us to exit through an alternative route, because a gang of mainland students were harassing people at the front of the student center. 
* The students who lead the panel are receiving death threats. 

It is unethical and undemocratic of the Targum to whitewash the mainland Chinese students' actions at the panel. Being impartial is not about making both sides look good. The mainland students' disruption of the panel was a concerted effort to undermine the Hong Kong movement for democracy, human rights and freedom, and to silence the students who support it. We rely on the Targum to learn about campus news, and that news should be presented truthfully.

Computer Science Question: Need Advice,"I'll get straight to the point.

I'm half a year behind every CS student since Data Structures was full my Spring semester of freshman year, so I'm taking it right now (Sophomore Fall). Technically, every CS student is advised to take Computer Architecture after Data Structures, ALTHOUGH I don't need to have it to declare my major next semester.

Now here comes the question. Computer Architecture is offered by a single professor, who has a rating of about 25% on rate my professor. The class itself is quite difficult. I've only heard the worst about this particular professor.

On the other hand, Intro to Computer Graphics is also offered next semester, which is a much harder class, but the professor teaching it, to me, seems like a very decently educated individual who knows how to teach (unlike Computer Arch).

In essence, what do you guys think is a better choice? 1) Take an already hard class with an awful professor 2) Take a much harder class with a overly decent professor.

I'm in a dilemma. Thanks!",1573516863,1,0

To the person on the LX who decided that earbuds aren‚Äôt for them...,"PLEASE for the love of Lord Snipp realize that almost no one (and I mean no one) cares to hear your music. I don‚Äôt care how badly you want to listen to it. Common courtesy says that if you don‚Äôt have earbuds, you don‚Äôt get to. I don‚Äôt care that you‚Äôre just vibing. I don‚Äôt care that you forgot your earbuds. I don‚Äôt care about anything except you respecting the social contract of the Rutgers bus system. 

And aside from it being a pet peeve...

Even if you think people should be tolerant of your decision to blast your music, keep in mind: doing so may negatively affect the health of someone else. As someone who suffers debilitating migraines, I can attest that getting on a bus during an attack is bad enough without having someone‚Äôs phone blaring. Every bass drop is a knife through the skull. It takes every last bit of willpower to not scream. And it isn‚Äôt just those with headaches that may be affected. Keep in mind that there are students with a variety of conditions that may predispose them to hyperstimulation - again, the bus system already is a threat. Please, please keep in mind that what for you might be some mindless background noise can be excruciating to those around you.",1573507342,1,0

I would like to see him one last time before he is gone forever. the problem is that i have an exam 8-11am and they want to make his suffering end. I asked my professor if i can reschedule but he is being a bit stubborn. A piece of his email ---&gt;"" I do not like to judge and have no idea what your family emergency is, but if this emergency is something that can wait until after you finish this exam or other exams, I suggest that you take the exam tomorrow morning and attend to the matter after the exam.

I would honestly hate for my cat to suffer any longer while i am taking the exam all the while that will probably be on my mind the entire time during the exam that he is suffering and i need to finish this asap to go home and lay him to rest.

Applied in Dec 2018 (my senior year), waitlisted in Feb 2019, rejected in Jun 2019

Currently going to a 4-year university

GPA for Fall 2019: 3.750 (4 A's and 2 B's) - 16 credits

\--

High school unweighted (when I applied to Rutgers SOE): 3.17 (yeah my junior year wasn't exactly the time of my life... unweighted for that year was a 3.09 and my clown ass really thought SOE was gonna take that)

As of graduation: 3.24 (my senior year unweighted was 3.47)

High school weighted (when I applied): 4.03

As of graduation: 4.10 (senior year weighted 4.34)

SAT: a little below 1300 (again I didn't really care about myself in junior year and I still hate myself for getting such a disgusting score :/)

Sooo here I am applying for SOE, SAS, and SEBS again for Fall 2020 transfer (I also didn't realize that I could have just put ""undecided"" as a major for SAS or something last year, hence why I didn't apply to either there or SEBS)

Any idea if my college GPA will make up for my horrid high school stats? I put the ""as of graduation"" GPAs because I'm pretty sure they're gonna ask for my high school transcript.

Also any idea if I'll get, perhaps, auto-accepted into at least one of these schools?

Why can‚Äôt professors post grades throughout the semester,"This is a small rant so excuse the grammatical errors, I just needed to get my feelings out.

We have deadlines for homework, projects etc. they should have a deadline for when grades should be returned. I feel like I would‚Äôve been way less stressed during finals if I knew my grades so I knew what I grade I needed to get on the final to pass a class. I‚Äôm still waiting for final grades (I know they have to be in by the 3rd). I know a lot of these professors have to teach a lot of students and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre under stress as well but I‚Äôm just tired of having to hound them down to see my grades, it‚Äôs just very frustrating.

Get a job at a big tech company with a BS from RU.,"I've been researching RU's CS program a lot and have been really confused. On one hand, people say it is really hard, and on the other hand, there are people saying they have 4.0 GPAs and don't think it is managed that well. So, what is the CS program like and do you think that you get a good education?

My main question: what are the job prospects like? How hard is it to get a job at a big tech company like Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Uber, etc.? I know these companies will only hire you have you take initiative outside the classroom to work on some other projects. However, if the RU program at Rutgers is really hard, do you have time to work on extra projects outside the classroom? How hard is the program? I'm comparing RU with Arizona State university. At first glance, RU is ranked higher than ASU, but then I see an article like this... [https://qz.com/967985/silicon-valley-companies-like-apple-aapl-hires-the-most-alumni-of-these-10-universities-and-none-of-them-are-in-the-ivy-league/](https://qz.com/967985/silicon-valley-companies-like-apple-aapl-hires-the-most-alumni-of-these-10-universities-and-none-of-them-are-in-the-ivy-league/)

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to work on the west coast, not in NYC. So, is Rutgers good for getting a job at one of these companies? What about internships? How hard is it to get an internship? RU is in-state for me which is why I'm considering it and want to learn more about it. So, what are your thoughts?",1575657643,1,0

rut #2 in overall philosophy,"see https://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/overall-rankings/


# **if we had these 2 options:**

1. remembering everything but feeling and valuing differently

2. feeling and valuing the same sort of things but remembering nothing

then what would you choose?

most of us would choose the 2nd one


this shows that our values are more important than our memories, as values are the resulting effects



- thanks to source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocunV4JX4w

**heres a simple example of values &amp; value priorities**

when we make the claim 'There is no money in poetry'

- this shows &amp; reveals a bias that we have

- since there is no poetry in money either, and yet we dont say that

# ‚ÄúWhat makes it the case that in (say) moving his finger, an agent acts, as opposed to merely being involved in something‚Äôs happening? Equivalently, when an agent moves his finger, what makes it the case that he is an agent, as opposed to being a patient?‚Äù

that's 'the standard story of action' from princeton

- see paper http://www.princeton.edu/~msmith/mypapers/Smith-FourObjections-2012.pdf




**there is no good evidence and no signficant evidence that we're able to tell what actions are 'intentional' and what are not**

**given this, i'd not assume and falsely imagine cultural  ideas of agency, freedom, choice, self-determination, or other made up ideas**

- since i dont believe in these made up ideas anymore, i cannot talk in a way that assumes these made up ideas to actually be scientific facts in life, since there is no evidence 

**ppl in many culture &amp; nations live their life without the assumptions of these ideas of agency, freedom, choice, self-determination, etc**

- so this indicates that living without these falsely imagined ideas is possible



**we also do not know if everything was causally deterministic, but if everything were, then we would be sure that there's no agency, choice, and freedom etc**

in physics, some things are causally deterministic, and some things arent

likely more than 50% of all things are not causally deterministic, and that by itself doesnt mean that agency, choice, and freedom exist



**if there were such imagined things as   agency, choice, and freedom, then to what extent is this agency choice &amp; freedom limited or constrained?**

nobody knows but we know it's highly limited &amp; constrained 

- we have no idea if an action is 'intentional' or not, be that our own or actions of others 

- without knowing if something is  intentional, we have no idea if this action is based on our control or not


**not only do we not know the extent, but dont know the minimal requirements of having agency, etc**

&gt; Nonetheless, it falls short of giving us everything we have reason to expect from account of personal autonomy.

&gt; In particular, challenges to different approaches sketched above suggest that they do not spell out the minimal conditions under which person‚Äôs exercise of authority over how she behaves reflects her own power to determine how she exercises this authority.

&gt; Minimal self-state seems to require nothing more nor less than being power behind whatever reasoning directly gives rise to one‚Äôs behavior.
Yet none of the accounts we have canvassed here seems to capture this important, most basic, form of self-state.

- see https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personal-autonomy/#ChalIdenMiniCondPersAuto



**there are external (like gravity) &amp; internal factors (like from neuroscience) that all limit &amp; constrain our options, choices &amp; control over our destiny &amp; our lives**

RUGonna Jump,"As a Rutgers Student, as well as a person who deals with some what serious mental health conditions. I‚Äôve found that the University, along with many other institutions, doesn‚Äôt really know how to deal with mental health and or people who might hurt themselves. The University offers CAPS, which is now billing students directly if they aren‚Äôt covered by your insurance. They may toss you over to 303 George St. where you‚Äôll be seen once a week by a pseudo interested councilor with about 100 more pacientes then they should have, then you‚Äôll be seen by a psychiatrist for roughly 15 minutes to talk about what pills they want you to gargle. While all this is happening you‚Äôve still gotta preform in all your classes. It‚Äôs not like you can send your professor a well worded email asking them not to fail you because your currently crying hysterically over someone eating the last bagel. When mental illness starts acting up it makes focusing like trying to draw a circle with a broken wrist and a half a bottle of taquilla.

does anyone unironically prefer webassign over the online physics thing,"for physics 203 online.

I feel like it's basically webassign but with penalized tries, and no way to show solution. I literally spent 2 hours (8:30-10:30) on the last one and got a whopping 0/10 right. Now if I re do it I can get a maximum of 75% but I'm probably not going to do all the questions because they're so hard. The videos don't help since they just go over the concepts at a really basic level and the problems in the videos are usually too separate from the homework questions to just follow the video as a guide.

inb4 ""just use your brain, and apply the subjects from the videos to the problem"", yeah. That's what I've been doing the past 2 hours and I got them all wrong.
