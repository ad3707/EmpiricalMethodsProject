SEAS,"I want to go to Grad school, therefore I will need good grades to go to Grad school. I am worried that I can‚Äôt get good grades at UPenn. Therefore, I am asking the questions below.

Upscale Freshman Housing,"Hi everyone!!!

I was recently admitted to Wharton which I'm really stoked about. However, I'm concerned about the quality of freshman housing *‚Äî* specifically surface area.

As far as I can tell, the largest bedroom in Lauder College House is 112 sqft. This just isn't going to cut it for me because I'm used to a 500 sqft bedroom with a queen bed. I really can't imagine how people live without a living room in their dorm. I also NEED a full kitchen because my passion is cooking. My daddy is willing to pay for an on-campus dorm and an on-campus apartment. Don't worry I'm not spoiled or anything it's just that I have the money so I want to use it.

My budget is \~$5000/m for the apartment. Has anyone done a similar thing and can give me recommendations on which buildings I should check out? I don't think that distance should be a big issue because I have a Boosted Rev scooter.",1585422678,46,0

Latin Honors (Dual Degree),"Hi,

Does anyone know how latin honors work for dual degrees? I know there are GPA cutoffs, but is the cutoff based on the transcript (two-degree) GPA or do they calculate your two GPA's for each of the two degrees separately? 

In other words, if your combined (transcript) GPA meets a cutoff do you get the same latin honor on both degrees?

Anyone know about this?",1585418794,1,0

Can internationals apply for work-study if they didn't ask for financial aid?,"I recently got accepted to Penn, and given the current circumstances, I do not think I'll be able to afford it.

All of you need to hear this,"Do not go to penn just because it is an ivy league. Do not go to penn just because it is an ivy league. Do not go to penn just because it is an ivy league. Do not go to penn just because it is an ivy league. Do not go to penn just because it is an ivy league. 

DO NOT GO TO PENN JUST BECAUSE IT IS AN IVY LEAGUE.

If the only thing keeping you from going somewhere else (where you might genuinely be happy and a perfect fit) and coming here is that it is a high reputation school: FUCK OFF. Save yourself the misery. People will lie to you and say this is the greatest place on earth. This is so awesome ahahaha I love Penn. But they are full of SHIT. Now, I am not saying your experience will be as bad as mine (freshman year was the worst year of my life thus far), but what I am saying is you guys are all on top of the world because you got accepted into ‚ú® ‚ù§Ô∏è üëë Penn‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®üëë and you are grossly underestimating the impact of things like dorms, hookup culture, penn face, dining hall food, etc. that you won‚Äôt develop a hatred for until you are actually here. 

Also, don‚Äôt overestimate the value of going to ‚≠êÔ∏è‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èPenn‚≠êÔ∏è‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è or wharton or whatever. That don‚Äôt mean shit. Make your own life for yourself outside of the box everyone else has built for you. You can be successful ANYWHERE. 
Side note: people here are tryhard and got their heads up their asses for no reason.

At the end of the day, they are going to be washed up old people that sit at home and do the same shit theyve been doing for 18 years or longer while you have college and the rest of your life to live for yourself.

When you guys ask if ‚ÄúPenn Face‚Äù is real, and someone says? ‚ÄúNo! WTF?!?penn is awesome and great and fun!!!!‚Äù YOURE ALREADY EXPERIENCING PENN FACE BITCH

"How to do well at Penn (mostly for students already at Penn for a year, not newly admitted students, contains some econ/finance jargon)","Realize that everything is about efficiency. Put in a minimal amount of effort to get maximum results. Produce until marginal utility equals marginal cost. That means for grades, make sure that you put in just the right amount of work to get a pass or an A. 

Read all your syllabi. Outline all your classwork in a neat calendar to ensure that you don‚Äôt submit anything late. Then do a weighted ranking of all your assignments by their due date and importance and start plugging away through them at the beginning of the semester. Aim to finish thirty percent of all your assignments within the first two weeks of school. 

If you are excellent at something, you will be admired. If you are mediocre, no one will give you attention. So, make sure you join a club and become the absolute best at leading it. Completely restructure the way that the club is organized if you must. Make it into your own pet project and make it successful. 

Another important thing to pay attention to is reputation. Scientifically, it has been shown that people who are more important in a room give less eye-contact to people who are their inferiors. This means that if you want to project your dominance onto other people, you should give people less eye contact. This means that when you‚Äôre walking on locust walk, you should not wave to people you recognize. waving only wastes time and gives you popularity. You‚Äôre not at school to become popular, because popularity wastes time. This means that you should act seriously, act professionally, act smart, and above all, act like an adult. You‚Äôre no longer a teenager anymore. 

Make sure to take time to rest and take care of yourself. But do this in the most effective way possible. Exercising, meditating, smoking weed, and going for a drink are some of the more effective ways of relaxing. All of them can be accomplished with little time wasted. Drinking should be reserved for days where you do not have a large exam in the week after or for days in which you do not have anything to do during the day after drinking. Casual flings are a plus. If you can effectively have them without the emotional baggage, go for it.

The earlier you graduate, the more successful you are, so do not be afraid to load up on classes and graduate in three years. Sub matriculate into the engineering school‚Äôs master‚Äôs program if you can. Transfer into Wharton or M&amp;T as early as you can, because Wharton sounds good on a resume.

Don‚Äôt waste your time voting, because it takes a lot of time to learn about politics enough for you to understand the policy issues. Rather, find a friend who is politically involved and who you respect. Copy their votes. Voting is not like an exam. You‚Äôre allowed to get the right answers from someone else. Better yet, do not vote, because voting is a waste of your time. Politics is only impactful on the aggregate, and since the people around you almost always vote Democrat, it does not really matter anyway, regardless of whether you‚Äôre Democrat or Republican. You will only have influence if you spend significant amounts of time trying to persuade people and have conversations. That again is a waste of time. 

Long run, you will be more impactful the more money you make, so it‚Äôs more important for you to spend time trying to figure out how to make money. Then, you can invest in lobbying efforts to change the government. 

Do anything you can do to get an A in a class. That means asking your friends for prior exams, asking your friends for prior homework, drinking red bull, and taking Adderall to finish essays. While empirically, Adderall does not help high-performing students do better on exams, it may help you focus to finish assignments. You may also develop a dependency but weigh the risks. Do not help people within your class unless you‚Äôre confident that you can one-up them. They are your competitors, not your compatriots.

Most students at Penn end up going into investment banking or consulting after college, even after controlling for the time that each person agonizes about what kind of career they want to have. That means, to be the most efficient, you should not spend time trying to find out what your ideal job would be. It‚Äôs a waste of time. Rather, aim high. Aim for the best consulting job there is and start preparing in freshman or sophomore year summer. Get some pdfs of books and start practicing cases with your upperclassmen friends.

Upperclassmen friends are more useful than underclassmen friends. Upperclassmen can help you get things. Underclassmen only drag you down. There are plenty of people out there that can help you talk about your feelings. You don‚Äôt have to spend too much time talking to your friends. It is far more efficient to talk to someone at CAPS than to spend time taking care of yourself because the people at CAPS (or a private therapist) are trained professionals and are paid to listen to you vent. Friends come with all kinds of baggage and are inefficient investments.

Treat your time as the cash in a discounted cash flow investment. Each unit of time you invest in something, you expect to get future units of time as a return. Know that the benchmark investment is in good grades and a good career, so anything that has a net present value that is lower than that investment should not be pursued. Some friendships have a positive net present value. Other friendships have negative net present value (they will not save you any time in the long run). These friendships are worthless and should be trashed. 

In general, it is difficult to find out which friendships have a positive or negative net present value. Therefore, look to social network analysis. The wider a social network you have, the greater the likelihood of your future success. However, the bonds between you and each person you know do not have to be that deep. They just must be slightly deep. That means that you should not invest too much in getting to know people. Just invest enough so that if you were to email this person in a couple of years, they would remember who you are and do you a favor. 

Make sure that you never consider sunk costs. That means that if you‚Äôve invested a lot into building a relationship with a friend, but then it turns sour, and there is better opportunity elsewhere, ditch that friend and find another friend group. Some friends are toxic. Friendships are not worth it. 

Remember, as you end this semester at Penn and start a new one, being efficient is the most important thing you can do to have a meaningful, successful life. Put on that Penn Face and become your true self.

TLDR: don‚Äôt let this become you.",1585283946,1,0

Discussion: Should the P/F opt-in deadline be extended to be after the semester?,"Hi everyone! I am wondering if people on here prefer this semester‚Äôs P/F policy that was announced yesterday, or would rather have it changed to be like other schools that are letting students complete the semester (and see their cumulative course grades) before deciding whether the classes will be letter graded or P/F. I would love to know what you think!

My personal thoughts: I believe it SHOULD be changed (new deadline should be end of May at least) because a large hurdle of virtual learning is that we may not be able to study well for the final exam, research effectively for a final paper, make an amazing presentation via Zoom, etc due to our individual at-home circumstances. Hence, having to opt into P/F by the 13th April will not help people who, due to the nature of virtual learning, end up getting low grades on their finals. I, for one, have no clue how I am doing in a class right now because we have very few scores right now (70% of the class grade is based on a final in May and a paper due after the new P/F deadline).

Let‚Äôs discuss below!",1584803320,1,0

you guys gotta stop with this,"this is just a quick rant. 

I'm not in support of everything Penn is doing but some of y'all really act like Penn's main motive is to get you in life. Behind Penn is a real person working behind the scenes. They are REAL people who are dealing with this situation too. There is a reason why Penn had to kick out everyone under such a short period of time. You guys have to remember that every college did this to their students and they wouldn't make such a drastic decision if the cons didn't outweigh the pros. Like sure Penn hasn't always done everything right but you guys need to also try and understand the position they are in as well. 

Another thing is that PENN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LAID OFF BON APPETIT WORKERS. I bet 90% of you didn't even read the article and just read the heading, which I believe was highly MISLEADING. Penn is NOT the one laying off the workers and it Is also NOT Bon Appetit laying off the workers.

Psychedelic Science Seminar on 2/24 @ Hall of Flags!,"The [Penn Society for Psychedelic Science](https://pennpsychedelics.org/) is hosting Ingmar Gorman and Elizabeth Nielson on February 24th @ 5 PM at the University of Pennsylvania.

**Psychedelic experiences are known to be some of the most profoundly moving of one‚Äôs life, and researchers are finding early success with psychedelic-assisted therapy for the treatment of depression, addiction, and PTSD. Outside of a clinical setting--with peer groups, underground therapists, or in ceremonial settings--these experiences can range from intensely terrifying to profoundly positive. Yet, the average therapist has little training on how to help patients reduce the potential for harm and weave these experiences into the course of therapy, enhancing the potential for a beneficial outcome. In this talk, we present a way of shifting the paradigm in psychotherapy to include psychedelic experiences as potentially valuable in the quest for healing.**

How is the MSE/CIS program,"Hi all, I'm currently debating whether or not I should come to Penn for the MSE/CIS program. My only concern is finding an internship in preferably a bay area faang or unicorn company . My other choice is UIUC MCS. I already have close friends at UIUC that can help me with the job search environment there, but at Penn I don't have such luxury. After looking on Linkedin, I notice that most of the stellar results from the Penn graduate career brochure were from kids who were Penn undergrad, did the 5th yr MSE program, and had stellar internships starting from freshman/sophomore yr whereas at UIUC MCS students were able to achieve faang without out of this world backgrounds.

Of course this is only from my personal observations. It seems like Penn's strength lies in its brand for IBD and consulting and most of the kids who get into big tech were good enough where they could have made it from any school. Overall I am confident in Penn undergrad CS students, but not Penn MSE/CIS students who came here from a different undergrad. Does anyone know more about this program and if there is a strong enough community with the program where on average there are at least opportunities for people to get interviews for big tech?",1586474780,1,0

Is Wharton worth it?,"Obviously I might get some very biased responses, but I honestly just don‚Äôt know who else I‚Äôm supposed to ask. Basically, I just got in RD to wharton and I‚Äôm choosing between that and UVA.

I‚Äôm in state at UVA and I was accepted as an Echols scholar. I also into Wharton.

KCEH vs. Stouffer Single vs. Quad Single,"Hi,

Currently my first choices are KCEH and a single in Stouffer, but I can't decide - my understanding is that KCEH is in between the Quad and NCH in terms of social life, and that Stouffer is a very small community but you can almost guarantee a single and everyone is tight knit.

If anyone can comment on either of these college houses' social scene (or about anything) I would appreciate it a lot!!

Proposal: Wharton Fundamentals Online with In-person Recitation?,"Here is a proposal I want to send to whomever is in charge of Wharton curriculum. 

Please give me some constructive feedback on why you think this idea is bad or great. If this post is too long for you, don't comment.

All Wharton fundamentals course lectures should be online with recitation sections where the professor/TA reviews homework in an interactive format with students (e.g. TA grades students' homework, and students put the homework solutions on the whiteboards and answer each others' questions). Tests should still be done in person, as there are many methods of getting around online tests.

&amp;#x200B;

This is for a few reasons:

First, often times, students do not want to attend lectures for the Wharton fundamentals courses. They are often filled with \~40-100 students and don't allow for much engagement.

Second, typically, these are massive lecture classes. Replacing the massive lectures online would clear up space in the university to hold other events/lectures by notable speakers. If they are not massive lectures, they often are classes that are back-to-back in one room.

Third, these foundational courses don't change year to year. I have talked to alumni from 20 years back and spoken about the same course material. Because of this, there are high fixed costs and low variable costs. Once the course is developed, the course does not have to change or update its material. 

Fourth, the classes take up professors' time, which would be better spent doing research or teaching more advanced classes. 

Fifth, they take up a good portion of Wharton students' schedules. By allowing for online courses, they would allow for greater flexibility for Wharton students to take electives within the first few semesters of students' schedules at Penn. This would help students learn a more diverse array of knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few risks. 

Mainly, these are the first courses that Wharton students are introduced to at Penn, so if the courses are poorly executed online, then that could have a negative effect on Wharton's brand. Thus, ensuring that the recitation sections are well-developed and engaging is key.

Second, these classes may want to incorporate new companies or important new events. For example, FNCE101 (Macroeconomics) will often incorporate current macro events, and MGMT101 will often incorporate interesting case studies (Amazon). This means that some lectures will have to be adjusted (perhaps every 5 years) as new companies emerge. The current events piece can be addressed by adding seminar components to the recitation courses.

&amp;#x200B;

To minimize risk, this program can be rolled out to several classes based on professor consent. Metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of this program are test grades and Penn Course Review feedback.

If execution is good, test grades do not drop (or increase), and Penn Course Review feedback is positive, this program could be rolled out to the other Wharton fundamentals courses at Penn.",1585950449,1,0

Where do I go for my Robotics MS?,"Hi everyone!  I was recently admitted to different engineering Master's  programs for robotics.  I've narrowed it down to 4 programs, but am  finding the decision between them incredibly difficult.  For anyone who  studied engineering or robotics at one of these universities, or has any  experience with their robotics/ME/CS/EE programs, can you tell me about  any positives or negatives?  I plan on writing a Thesis and hope to get  a research assistantship to secure some funding wherever I go.  I am  also concerned about program flexibility, reputation for research and  job prospects, geographical reach of alumni network, and ease to move  onto a PhD.  The four programs are below, thanks for any input  whatsoever!

Columbia ME

Penn Robotics MS

Psychedelic Science Seminar on 2/4,"The[Penn Society for Psychedelic Science](https://PennPsychedelics.org) is hosting Ingmar Gorman and Elizabeth Nielson on February 24th @ 5 PM in Hall of Flags!   


&gt;Psychedelic experiences are known to be some of the most profoundly moving of one‚Äôs life, and researchers are finding early success with psychedelic-assisted therapy for the treatment of depression, addiction, and PTSD. Outside of a clinical setting--with peer groups, underground therapists, or in ceremonial settings--these experiences can range from intensely terrifying to profoundly positive. Yet, the average therapist has little training on how to help patients reduce the potential for harm and weave these experiences into the course of therapy, enhancing the potential for a beneficial outcome. In this talk, we present a way of shifting the paradigm in psychotherapy to include psychedelic experiences as potentially valuable in the quest for healing.

Freshman Transfer,"Hey all,

I know this is usually a chanceme type of post, but I figured it would be better to consult actual Penn students first. I'm currently a freshman at UCLA, and am seriously considering transferring. I applied to CAS for Econ and was denied. As far as high school stats, I had a 1460 SAT (750 r/W 690 M)and 4.73 W GPA and 3.98 UW GPA. For extracurriculars, I didn't have much other than 500 volunteer hours, being captain of the volleyball team and working for my parents' Menchie's Frozen Yogurt for marketing and fundraising. I ended up getting into, and choosing UCLA as a Business Economics major (which, to be honest, was mostly for prestige + being away from home).

Since I've gotten to UCLA, I've known that I would be okay staying here for the next four years, but I also knew that my opportunities could be much better at a school like UPenn. As someone interested in going into investment banking, I know that UCLA isn't a target school, and most of the target schools (out of undergrad, that is) are NYU, Cornell, UPenn, Columbia, etc. The only shot you really have at UCLA is if you're in a finance club or a frat, but even still you really have to scrape and grind for everything, since there are just less opportunities here. I'm not saying that it wouldn't be a grind at UPenn, however I also don't know if investment banking is necessarily what I want to do out of undergrad, and the extent of UCLA's opportunities in business/finance are pretty much accounting, consulting and investment banking. I would like to attend a university that offers a bit more in terms of opportunities within different fields. Additionally, the Biz Econ major is laughed at by pretty much everyone in it at UCLA, since nothing you learn is very applicable, the professors aren't great, and everyone is only in the major for the GPA that you need for investment banking recruiting (3.7 minimum, 3.8 preferred). Basically, I'm looking to transfer for the reasons of better career opportunities, professors that care about their course and students instead of their research, and a more fulfilling education that focuses on what I actually want to learn about and study.

Alright now that all of that boring stuff is out of the way, here's what I've done so far at UCLA:

* Bruin Hedge Fund: one of those finance clubs that I mentioned earlier, I joined as one of four freshmen accepted out of 150 applicants. So far I've worked on a stock pitch with my team within the club, gone through a 10 week training session learning about basic technical skills involved with investment banking (DCF, Precedent Transactions, Public Comps, LBOs, financial statement analysis, etc.). We're also planning to host a couple restructuring case competitions, and compete in some other ones hosted on campus. (This is my big extracurricular)
* Part time job at a food court (Lu Valle Commons): I work \~15 hours each week as a ""customer service representative"", and I should be getting promoted to a supervisor soon; basic food service job but I do have some authority and a leadership role at this point
* Undergraduate Business Society: I'm a general member (all you have to do to join is join the list-serve), but I've been involved with some of the programs they've offered, such as a business showcase and a career development showcase, both of which were actually somewhat selective application processes
* Intramural Volleyball: My stress reliever lol, just a fun way to stay involved with volleyball
* Floor Government Council: Basically just attend weekly meetings and vote on issues involving my residence floor/hall
* Volunteer Income Tax Assistance: I just joined this one, but it was also a competitive application process (I don't have the numbers yet), basically you learn how to file federal/state income taxes and help local low-income/elderly file their income taxes

Another potential extracurricular would be a private equity internship, I have a referral from someone in Bruin Hedge Fund and hopefully will get it; this would be in February.

Current GPA: 3.81 

* (A in Linguistics 1, A- in Math 31A {equivalent of calc AB}, A- in History 1A {western civilizations}
* This quarter, I'm taking History 1B, MGMT 1A {intro to accounting, taught within the Anderson school of management}, and Econ 2 {basic macroecon}, hopefully will maintain a similar GPA

As for letters of rec, I have one from the president of Bruin Hedge Fund (going to Morgan Stanley for investment banking), one from my history 1B professor (went to yale undergrad, stanford grad, not sure if this matters but worth mentioning I guess), and one from my MGMT 1A professor (I'm still wondering if the fact that it's taught at the MBA school would mean anything).

Also, I'm retaking the ACT in February, shooting for a 34 or above.

Sorry this post ended up being so long, and thank you to anyone that actually has read this far, but I figured it'd be better to put some actual detail into this post. I'm planning on applying to Wharton, but also still considering CAS.

tl;dr UCLA freshman Biz Econ major with a 1460 SAT and 4.73W/3.98UW, involved in a finance club, part-time job, volunteer tax club, business club, im volleyball and floor government, with a 3.81 GPA wanting to transfer to UPenn for better academic/career opportunities.",1579913296,1,0

Debate/MUN at Penn,"Hi all!

I'm currently a high school senior, but was accepted ED to Penn. I've really enjoyed MUN and debate, but my school only started it recently, and there aren't many in-country conferences and out of country ones are generally pretty pricey, so I'll have only done about 4 MUN related events by graduation. Given this, are there still MUN or debate clubs I could join at Penn? Intercol and many of the debate clubs seem quite competitive, but is there a way to help chair Penn run conferences or participate in less competitive MUN/debate? I'm hoping to major in IR, and I'd really enjoy being part of the international affairs association, but I can't tell how competitive it is.

Discussion on writing sem,"Shocker, not your usual post about writing sem on this page

What are peoples' thoughts on why writing sem is so infamously awful at Penn? As a class that's supposed to be central to the Penn undergraduate experience, you would expect them to put a lot of work into making it a really worthwhile experience, and it really isn't. And clearly it's not just a result of it being a course that satisfies distribution requirements, because I've had a lot of those classes be really high quality. It seems like it gets a fair amount of attention as far as the way the courses are conducted, with the involvement of the online peer review system, different course topics each year, lots of standardization amongst instructors on what's being taught. It's also not a result of having a bad English department necessarily, nor lack of prestige that would draw good instructors. As a bio major, a lot of the intro level classes I've taken have been the poorest in terms of instructor enthusiasm or lecturing capacity, but I even had a super kind and enthusiastic instructor (Lawrence Abbott) who you could tell really cared about the students, and yet I got nothing out of that class. Ok I got maybe a handful of minutes of good introspection about my own writing habits, but really not 1.0CU's worth.

I'm genuinely curious what other peoples' thoughts are about how and why it's ended up this way. 

Some theories that have crossed my mind: (note that I don't completely believe any of these)

* lack of sorting into different levels means that almost everyones needs are unmet - good writers are unchallenged, less-good writers fall through the cracks
* writing is inherently more difficult to teach than a lot of other subjects because it's not content or discussion driven? or that peoples' writing and thinking styles are inherently different, and that's hard to teach to
* nobody has a particular passion for teaching a universally required writing seminar that no one wants to be in
* people have complained about it to the extent that it has been deeply watered down
* Penn has more important things to care about I guess? Just seems like with the amount of resistance it gets, they'd do better",1579596752,1,0

Right now, I'm registered for 425, but the professor said MATH 425 will be curved so that 30% of the class gets A's... that sounds a bit hard for an upper level class. Now, I'm thinking about taking 241 instead, which has the same curve but less difficult material.

I believe given the situation, it is a no brainer to at least give students the option to take required courses pass/fail and still count towards our degree. What about all the students (and/or their family members) who will get sick? What about those in different time zones or with poor internet connection? What about the grade curves that will likely be messed up by dishonest students?

If other people want to boost their GPA fine, they should give us the option to carry on as normal too.

But they should at least give the option to pass/fail degree courses.

Why the Coronavirus pandemic is dangerous,"This post will not talk about Penn's policy of kicking students out. 

Same, I don't wanna argue about who should be responsible for that. China, Trump, CDC, WHO... we can believe in whatever narrative we like. 

As a Penn student who stayed in China during the outbreak since January, I would like to share some of my thoughts.

**R0**

&gt; ‚ÄòR0 predicts the number of people who can catch a given bug from a single infected person. Currently, the R0 for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, is estimated at about 2.2 (even up to 4), meaning a single infected person will infect about 2.2 others, on average. By comparison, the flu has an R0 of 1.3.¬†'

The number of infected will easily double in 2-3 days without proper quarantine measures. If there are 500 unknown virus carriers in NYC, there will be 5k by next week.

&amp;#x200B;

**Incubation**

&gt;In the resulting models, estimated median incubation time (IT) of COVID-19 was 5.1 days; mean IT was 5.5 days. For 97.5% of infected persons, symptoms appear by 11.5 days.

Compared with SARS in 2003, this virus is less fatal by the long incubation has made it a more dangerous disease. Virus carries can still infect others even without any symptoms. So don't laugh at or insult people wearing masks, especially those from East-Asia, where wearing a mask is an acceptable culture. At least they lower your risk of being infected more or less.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mortality Rate**

According to WHO by March 3rd: ‚Äú**Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died**. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.‚Äù  (Flu is around 0.1%)

However, the mortality rate of Covid-19 is complex, largely depending on the medical support level and the population's age group distribution. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Statistics by 3.13](https://preview.redd.it/fu639oe75km41.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97272d79e032eb7872cc791b328d3692833f630a)

Italy's healthcare system once was regarded, by WHO's ranking, as the 2nd best in the world after France. But now Italy has reached a crazy mortality rate of 7.1%.  It is the result when the number of infected cases exceeds the healthcare system capacity. 

Given sufficient and proper medical support, the mortality rate can be as low as 1%, such as South Korea or other China's provinces except Hubei (the initial outbreak province). On the other hand, once the cases exceed the current medical supply, the mortality rate can surge to 5% and above, such as Italy and Hubei province in China.

&amp;#x200B;

[It's a good graph, by missing something](https://preview.redd.it/rguea6ip5km41.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecac9b3c13e593f220e7f120b25efe5f68f93bab)

The above is a good graph by CDC, but I think it is missing one critical information, the difference in mortality rate for two curves.

[The mortality rate will surge without proper control measures](https://preview.redd.it/2b0lbnw06km41.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48c40e96f1cf9e79d4c0d590c4be7769740ae5d7)

**Self-isolation without medical support?**

There are some governments, maybe Trump's administration as well, are still regarding COVID-19 as a 'big' flu. They expect most patients to stay at home (even refusing to test them), until recovery or turning to severe. Take the UK for example, Boris asked UK citizens to self-quarantine 7 days before turning to professional help, even for those with symptoms. 

This idea is simply wrong.

Most media is also missing one critical question: what's the percentage turning to severe from mild, without proper medical support? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kep9xyaj6km41.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d6b829a8709d0b6f092c41c497eced3f8934fe9

Without proper medical support, oxygen, anti-virus doses, saline and etc, 20% of cases will turn into severe and then critical, of which 50% could eventually die. This means an up to 10% mortality rate. ***Severe cases will still destroy the existing healthcare system.***

&amp;#x200B;

**Beyond the Mortality Rate**

Maybe most young people are lucky enough to recover from COVID-19. But it is not the end of the Covid-19 story. According to clinical researches so far, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, will not only attack your lung but also your liver, kidney, even your Central Nervous System. To make things worse, the virus might damage the kidney and *testicular* tissue of male patients, causing partial or complete impaired fertility.

China‚Äòs hospitals and local authorities have already encouraged male patients to get fertility testing.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to Protect Yourself?**

You can find many helpful advice via google. So I don't bother to repeat them. You can check this link by WHO if you haven't learned much. 

[https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)

Note: It is quite controversial on whether healthy people should wear masks. There is no concrete evidence showing a healthy people can protect themselves by wearing a surgical mask (not N95, N95 does help). However, it is for sure that wearing a mask will protect others. Research revealed that the surgical mask can block 60%-95% droplets spread by a flu patient. 

Once again, this virus has a long incubation period so it's good to have asymptomatic people wearing masks. Please to discriminate them.

[Mega-thread] Penn &amp; COVID-19 Response,"A one-stop shop for discussion, news, and related threads. Wash your hands everyone!

[Latest communication from Penn:](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/announcements/penns-latest-update-coronavirus)

We are writing to keep you updated on new developments in our response to the global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). While there is a high level of uncertainty as the disease spreads around our country and the world, it is absolutely clear that we, along with all other universities, have a responsibility to institute new mitigation practices of social distancing to help stem that spread. These mitigation practices must prudently limit travel as well as gatherings of large groups and occasions involving extended amounts of time in close proximity. As a result, here are the actions that we are currently taking:

**We are prohibiting all future University-related travel, both domestic and international, at least until April 17, unless expressly approved by the Provost.**

* We also strongly discourage all members of the Penn community from any personal travel, which could result in quarantine upon your return. Anyone currently traveling on University-affiliated business will be able to return to campus.

**We are curtailing large University events, at least until April 17.**

* We strongly recommend that meetings or events of 100 people or more be cancelled or postponed. We also strongly recommend the use of teleconferencing, group chats, or live streaming as alternatives to in-person gatherings.  

* We strongly discourage all University meetings that include participants from other cities and countries, even if fewer than 100 people.

* Penn Admissions has cancelled all on-campus admitted student programs scheduled for April, including Quaker Days and Multicultural Scholars Previews. Our Admissions team will offer web-based and other innovative virtual programs to welcome admitted students and respond to questions. There will be more details about these revised plans in time for the announcement of admissions decisions later this month.

* Penn Medicine, due to the high level of caution associated with the health system, has prohibited all faculty, students, postdocs, and staff of both the Perelman School of Medicine and the University of Pennsylvania Health System from participating in large gatherings, including all conferences in the U.S. and abroad, as well as any Penn Medicine conferences that include participants from outside Penn.

**We are preparing to move classes online in order to prepare for all possible scenarios.**

* We are working with deans and faculty members to prepare for the likelihood of some (or possibly all) remote and virtual instruction after Spring Break. As the spread of the virus is fast-changing, we will update the community later this week with more definitive guidance.

**We have launched a [comprehensive website](https://coronavirus.upenn.edu/) with updated information for every member of the Penn community.**

We greatly appreciate your partnership in this important and urgent effort. We are committed to sustaining our core educational mission even in the face of this unexpected global health crisis, and we are confident that we can count on every member of our Penn community to work alongside us. We will continue to update you as more information emerges.

Now then, I'm a prospective student who's been accepted. I'll be touring soon, but I wanted to hear from people who've lived it. Penn advertises the College of Education as being one of the top in the country, but how does the TLL program stack up? With such a unique program it's hard to find comparables to contrast with. I'm mainly asking to quiet a niggling worry in the back of my mind that says this is just some sucker program to get people to pay into a degree that has little impact on future employment prospects in the museum field. It doesn't help that my cousin attended Drexel for a bachelor's and came out with heaps of co-op experience and volunteering hours at museums  and the zoo in Philadelphia and is struggling to find work in the field.

I had visited the campus on multiple occasions, participated in years of online, non-credit UPenn classes, and poured my heart and soul into my application. However, I am not ready to give up! I have submitted a Letter of Continued Interest to the admissions committee and am actively looking to take more steps to show UPenn my strong desire to attend. 

I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to get off the College of Arts and Sciences waitlist. For those accepted off the waitlist, what did you do different? At this point, I have run out of ideas to show the admissions committee how committed I am to becoming a Quaker. 

With any of your tips, I know I can make it off the waitlist! I apologize in advance if this is not the appropriate place to post this message.",1588322473,1,0

Fall semester hope,"Here‚Äôs my argument. Give me feedback! 


We‚Äôre almost certainly going to have an on-campus semester. Maybe we‚Äôll start in September or October once we have more medical supplies, but we‚Äôre going to start.  Chance is that many have had COVID and as soon as the country opens up, many many many more  will get it regardless if Penn is open or not. Doesn‚Äôt make sense to keep Penn closed when most will contract it regardless, especially when so many people in Philadelphia rely on Penn‚Äôs economic activity to stay afloat.

They‚Äôll take action to minimize the spread of this, but that‚Äôs mostly just for liability reasons. Most students will get it. Those who are at high risk of complications will be more cautious and will be given more resources to do so. The rest will probably get through this without many issues (especially if we wait a few more months for medical supplies to stock up).

I don‚Äôt know how people think that we‚Äôll be able to resist this virus for 12 more months until we have a vaccine. That‚Äôs ridiculous. It‚Äôs basically certain that mostly everyone will contract it. We‚Äôll have more resources to help people from getting seriously sick though. It spreads very easily and most Americans can not afford to stay inside for much longer. Getting sick in 2/3/4 months will look very different than getting sick right now. Much less serious.",1588208931,1,0

Fall Semester Speculation Thread,"After reading over Penn's response for what will happen in the fall, I am definitely think that we will have a mostly, if not entirely, online fall semester. My reasoning and thoughts on the subjects are as follows:

1. **Nothing will be normal again** until a vaccine is available for public use
2. There is no way that Covid-19 will be gone or ""less of a threat"" by August with states reopening and a s**econd wave of the virus is a certain possibility** 
3. In the words of Prof. Max Mintz , "" I see **no way Penn can ethically invite thousands of students** in uncertain states of health from all over the world to come to Penn in  late August. ""
4. While there may be some in-class learning, I think that they might **offer students an option of coming back to campus** **if they feel like they want to/need** to but they will still record all lectures and post them online as well as have online assignments, exams, ect...

Stanford v. Wharton,"I want to go into IB or be a corporate attorney. I've now been accepted to UPenn Wharton &amp; Stanford. Every time I think I‚Äôve made up my mind by picking one, I go down a path of regret thinking I‚Äôve made the wrong choice. 

I like Wharton because of the location and academic drive of the atmosphere. I want to be in a city and around others who want to go into business. I don‚Äôt like the fact that everything is on a curve and it‚Äôs almost impossible to pull a +3.7 GPA because of it. Also whenever people talk about prestige, I always hear HYPSM and this makes me second guess wanting to go to Wharton as the UPenn brand is not as global.

For Stanford, I don‚Äôt really like the paradise &amp; relaxed vibe but I still feel I could thrive. The only downside is that it‚Äôs not in a city and a lot of kids end up in the ‚ÄúStanford Bubble‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know much about their Econ department or what type of companies recruit there. It feels like choosing Stanford would give me more of an advantage on the west coast tech firms but I want to work in the East. Also, I don‚Äôt want my network to only be limited to finance as that seems to be the case for Wharton.
I would love any advice, just trying to make a good decision",1585531606,0,0

I am making a documentary about how the **COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting college students** across the country and would love to hear from as many voices as possible. So, if you feel comfortable filming yourself speaking about the issue, please reach out!

Some of the stories I wish to highlight include:

\- Seniors who are/were about to graduate

\- Freshmen/folks who just started a course of study

\- Grad students/PhD candidates

\- Folks in very hands-on majors, such as film production, dance, and other majors that are virtually impossible to adapt to distance learning

\- Students who have had to drop classes/significantly change their academic paths due to the crisis

\- Students who have attempted to/have gotten refunded for the semester

\- Students who are not eligible for stimulus packages/financial assistance

\- Students who have a hard time with online classes (can‚Äôt focus, poor wi-fi at home, no viable space at home, time zones, etc‚Ä¶)

But I do not wish to limit my search to just the above! If you have a story to tell, I want to hear it. Please message me directly if you are interested in being a part of this project. All filming and producing will, at least for now, be done remotely.

Many thanks, and stay at home,

I mean I understand that it is an ivy league school and all, so it attracts a lot of wealth from around the world but is there really not that many of us that grew up in the ""middle class"" of America or rural areas. What about my classmates who are on financial aid but aren't considered ""highly aided"" am I really in a minority of two extremes? I am just curious if this is just my observation. Likewise, most people I have met are from suburbs or cities what about all the kids growing up in underfunded and underdeveloped rural areas.

As a student in such category, having no previous ties to Penn and on considerable financial aid to make this degree feasible I found it really interesting in the fall when the DP published a dozen opinions going back and forth between FGLI students and legacies the opinion of the students that don't really fall into either category was never addressed.

Advanced registration CIS vs EE in light of potential virtual labs in Fall 2020,"As a rising sophomore deciding to major in either EE or CIS (in terms of relevant classes, I‚Äôm currently in cis121 and math240), if the Fall 2020 is going to be online, is it still worth it to take classes like ESE215 and ESE218 this Fall? I think in order to graduate with an EE degree on time I‚Äôm pretty much forced to take those 2 classes this Fall, but I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt be learning as much as I could‚Äôve and that they‚Äôll skip important information because I won‚Äôt be able to physically design and put together my own circuits and work and experiment with the devices (I don‚Äôt think they will be issuing lab kits for either class). I emailed the prof for 218 who is Deep Jariwala and he said that if this Fall is online, they‚Äôll most likely put up videos of devices being used and provide us with pre measured data to analyze. Firooz aflatouni for 215 hasn‚Äôt responded yet but I‚Äôm figuring I‚Äôll get a similar response. My rationale was that if I wasn‚Äôt gonna do those EE classes because it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it do it it virtually then I would take primarily CIS classes effectively preventing me from doing the EE degree in 4 years.",1587184947,1,0
"Phys 101, 150 , and the Chem Major","Hi guys,

So I'm currently a freshman premed thinking about going into a chemistry major. I originally had AP credit from physics c for Phys 150. However, knowing that medical schools don't take AP credit, I chose to take Phys 101 to complete some of the physics premed prerequisites. 

However, I noticed today that the chemistry major requires phys 150 credit. Technically, I have this credit from AP credit, however after reading the course description for phys 101 it says that by taking this class I ""surrender my phys 150 credit"", which I would need for my chem major.  Did I just take phys 101 for no reason? LMAo :(( Should I just take phys 101 P/F at this point knowing that I would still have to take 150?

HAPPY BUT ALSO TERRIFIED about returning to PENN (RANT/PERSONAL),"\*LONG RANT just had to get off chest sorry guys quarantine has been rough haha\*

i just heard back from the college office, and i got approved to return from my leave of absence! although it's not much since everything is remote right now, it means the world to me. i had applied back last fall, and they originally approved, but then ultimately decided to deny my request :( which made me extremely anxious and ruined my plans.

it's been about two years since getting into penn, and being stuck in the house all day during quarantine has made me think a lot about the time since then. although, tbh i have thought about my time at penn and what went wrong almost everyday since requesting to take a leave of absence way back in spring 19. as of now i'm set to resume classwork this summer (which unfortunately is online now :// but this shouldn't affect my ""return"" though). just the thought of being enrolled again and resuming classes terrifies me, with my mind immediately jumping to the worst case scenario which is me f\*cking up everything just like i did last year.

\*\*\*PREFACE\* i went to a very average public school (and by average i mean AVERAGE AVERAGE, not ivy average. as in, it's ranked in the bottom half of public schools in my state and around #20 out of 25 in my region) that was hardly rigorous in any field and definitely did not receive enough preparation for going to an elite uni. i was admittedly really lazy in hs as well as depressed, spending more times on mindless activities than homework or ecs. which isn't 100 percent my fault, as activities outside of sports at my school weren't big and major assignments were rarely assigned. i deadass completed at most two full length papers my entire high school career, submitted countless hw in late or completed right in class when it was due, etc. i did obviously partake enough to succeed relative to my school and eventually got into penn. but looking back, it really was me underachieving bc there was no point in working hard if i didn't have to\*\*

anyways, my freshman year was much less than ideal. after suffering a lackluster fall semester, i tried to redeem myself in the spring, but failed to do so. maybe it was my countless club rejections, or the overwhelming amount of work i put off to the last minute. the fact that i still had no idea what i wanted to study or was interested in didn't help at all. i felt extremely overwhelmed by the thoughts that nothing had gone to plan, and that i no longer had a plan that actually suited me. my classes were horrible, i was stuck in a toxic friendship, the clubs i was in did not suit me and stressed me out to the point i ghosted all of them. it's not because i didn't want to try. i don't know how many nights i spent until 4am with my laptop open trying to get started, but failing to complete my work. i didn't know what was wrong with me. all i could think about constantly was how much a failure i was, that i had no future and would end up miserable and unemployed and 100k in debt after graduating, and that i should've applied to better schools and penn was the worst choice i made in my life. it didn't help that my friends were in similar positions to me, and my self-esteem was solely tied to receiving attention from guys and putting myself in very dangerous situations. i stopped attending class, and it got so bad to the point that i requested a leave literally a week before finals. i couldn't even bring myself to finish the spring semester, it got so bad. i've never been so embarrassed, so ashamed in my life. my parents got me and moved me out, we fought because i didn't want to go back home, so i went back to philly. this all happened by may 2019. since then, things with my family have been better than ever. i lived in philly (just thru sublets) from may until december, when i moved back with my family. i've been seeing a therapist/psychiatrist for months, been diagnosed with anxiety, mild depression, and adjustment disorder, and was placed on a mild ssri. my mental health state has never been better, even during quarantine haha. 

so it's all worked out somewhat, but at the same time, not at all yet. as of now i'm set to return shortly, major in econ, go into business or the like, etc. part of me still thinks it's going to end badly again. i think it's partially because i feel like have no support. i feel like no matter how hard i try, i'll for some reason never achieve my goals or will end up unhappy in life. it seems like the majority of ppl at penn have their shit together (for the most part) and will go on to find success in their jobs and relationships, and a good portion of students will do just that. however, there's always the less fortunate, even at schools like penn. not everyone in the ivy league can succeed, even at hyp there will be unemployable graduates who amount to nothing in my life. i can't let that happen to me. i want to succeed, i NEED to succeed, and i know i CAN. but will i? part of me feels like there's a force in the universe, call it fate or bs, that is just out to get me and will stop at nothing to end me. call me crazy, but i just feel like my life will somehow just completely fall apart bc of bad luck or chance, and i'll spend the rest of my life wondering what went wrong.

i'm not sure what the purpose of this rant is. maybe to warn the future penn students that getting into the ivy league is just the start, as for many of us we still face an uphill battle in this world, even though many of us are admittedly more privileged than the average american. but even if we don't feel like it, each and all of us was admitted for a reason, and are equally deserving of our spots. my mental health took a massive dive when i started at penn, and never had before felt as stupid or a failure at life. so please take care of yourself and then maybe there's hope for us :)",1587069087,57,0

Tuition reduction,"Thoughts? Online classes don't seem to be able to replace the education we paid and will pay for.

Some perspective is needed on Pass / Fail,"When most people look back on the spring of 2020, they will be looking back on a time of serious pain, unrest, instability, loss, and fear.

When deciding whether or not to swap over to P/F, make that decision based on your capabilities and mental health right now. Do not make it based on what you think a hiring officer might think in the future.

When you are in interviews in the future, and it comes time for you to have the chance to ask your interviewer questions about the company, one of them should be:

&gt;""What did Company X do to protect your employees and customers during the pandemic? How did Company X ensure the continued safety and financial / health insurance security of your employees?""

Any company that tries to ding you for taking a class pass / fail or doesn't have a ready and satisfactory answer to the above should be avoided like the plague, so to speak.
