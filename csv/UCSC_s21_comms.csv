"I tutor for STAT-5 and honestly it's pretty professor dependent. Some professors go a lot harder than others. The content itself isn't too bad. The only math you need to know is precalc, there's absolutely no calculus. The worth the math can get is just notation that some students aren't familiar with and just repetitive things like calculating an average or factorials. Just do the homework and keep up with lectures and that's normally good enough.",1614903130,3,0

Ya you could change it. If you’re not planning on going to grad school and the B or C would lower your gpa then it’s fine to take the pass. Some major departments have limits on taking classes p/np so if this is a class for your major check if it’s allowed.

Breakspear!,1614894263,4,0
"A hairpin turn is colloquial English and can vary in definition. The general consensus of the the internet is that it's a curve that forces an object to turn 180° according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairpin_turn).  From point [A to B](https://ibb.co/1GjyRQG) on Big Moody, you're vehicle roughly turns 180°.

It is important to not only consider the radial distance **but also velocity**; these values share a relationship known as [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity).

[Per calculation](https://ibb.co/XWMWzZh), a car traveling a constant 65mph around Big Moody will have an angular velocity of 0.09786 radians per second. Likewise, a car taking turn 2 in Thunderhill would need to be traveling 18.344mph to produce the same angular velocity.

**Thunderhill is a race track and Big Moody is not.** If turn 2 was a public road with similar lane width I suppose 18mph would be a reasonable speed for the average person.",1614892181,1,0

[deleted],1614886625,1,0
"Oh I've actually taken the equivalent of all of these. CE12 is a breeze if you have any coding experience under your belt. The majority of that class's work is due to the labs, but the topics themselves are actually pretty intuitive if you're already versed in reading code. Logic is not difficult and once you wrap your head around it is incredibly intuitive and important. 

Ams20 is also not very hard, I would honestly say of all the beginning math classes 19B was straight up the hardest, while AMS20 was probably closer to the easiest. AMS10  and 23B were the easiest for me. Ams20 is SO little thinking. It's like basically a cook book but for math equations that you can recognize the form of. It gets somewhat confusing towards the end if your linear algebra is bad, but if it's decent enough it really shouldn't be a problem. 

Ce107 is actually a lot of work, and depending on how strong you are in math can be difficult. I would overall though not classify stats as a difficult course, but it's definitely time consuming. 

It is totally possible a spot in the 5b lab opens, I can't say for sure how they've been enacting them since covid started, but I'd imagine you'd be able to make it work, just shoot some emails and see what comes back.

If you have a decent work ethic this schedule is totally doable. I took AMS 20 with 23B and 5C. Wasn't that bad at all as long as started my assignments early. 

Also lmao fuck that guy for betting you'll drop. Way to fear monger a completely reasonable quarter for someone doing anything engineering lol. Don't let the lazy people of UCSC dictate what is and isn't a good course schedule. I'd be graduating in 5 years if I did that. Ultimately the only one who can size up your capabilities is yourself.",1614886526,1,0

" 

The colleges is kind of like hog warts-every campus tour guide 

Not really, lol. They just are residential halls, but multiple buildings groups into one residential college. Each has a core course (except Stevenson which has two), they all technically have a specific theme, but said themes don’t super matter and your core course just has to do with writing skills. I would choose based on location/dorm/dining hall. 

Stevenson is probably best with dining hall and room because if you get a second or third floor room, most of the time you have lofted ceilings which is really nice because it opens the room up. It is tucked behind cowell on the east of campus but quick walk to parking lot, gym, east field, the quarry, the library, and some main lecture halls. 

Next would probably be eight because it has some nice dorms, and a really pretty location. That dining hall is also pretty good with selections, but it is only really close to the media/art area, and then a slight walk to the library (at least mcHenry the main one). 

9/10 are the same, there’s like literally no difference. But they are really close to science hill (where many science/engineering classes are held), but unless you are planning on living there for multiple years, that closeness doesn’t really matter because you’ll probably end up in classes at classroom unit 1/2. They do have a nicer dining hall, but it’s usually packed because it has late night dining every day where every other dining hall closes at 8 at least one day.

Hope this helps! I was in cowell, and while I liked the location, the dorms have literally never been updated, and many of the rooms were built to be doubles that the forced into very tiny triples, and many of the lounges turned into quads

"Yea appeals are supposed to be new information. So if it’s just the same stuff on your original application, it doesn’t do anything. It’s supposed to be information of stuff that could help your admissions that happened from November to now. Also you could possibly just get in off the waitlist soon, and not have to do any of that. You also really are only supposed to do it for one school.

History is alright. Go Intensive History if you go that route. We focus on lot more on the Global South, particularly South America, than most universities. So don’t go into that unless that at least somewhat interests you.

Personally, I would recommend Philosophy and/or Anthropology. Anthropology has a lot of biological anthropology opportunities. The only issues are that Philosophy has a small faculty and Anthropology only has a BA. The Earth Sciences/ Anthropology combined major is also definitely a move but then you are getting more into STEM. Philosophy has a 5 yr combined BA/MA program with sufficient grades.

Also, I have no idea why he doesn't just allow us to take the quiz anytime that day. Hated that the most. 

His lectures are the worse thing I've seen at UCSC. He doesn't even draw on the slides themselves. Just reads off of them. Uses a monotone voice so I'm not engaged at all. Doesn't seem interested at all in teaching. The slides aren't even that clear and most of the time they're confusing. I wish I took it with someone else because I felt like I wasted my time.

She is not an ESA but I pretended she was one and no one questioned it; note that she's also a very quiet dog and does not bark but will whine. It was harder than I expected because I needed to prioritize her immediate needs. For example if she started whining while I was in class (for apparently no reason, I'd fed her, walked her and made she'd urinated and defected), I would need to leave to take her out because I didn't want her to distract my classmates. I needed to wake up earlier to make sure she got the walks she needed and felt reluctant to take the buses (loop and metro) in case they were too crowded for her to comfortably fit.

"I think you have a decent chance. A lot of people are put on the waitlist at UCSC because a lot of high GPA/high SAT score students apply to almost all of the UCs. Most likely, those students choose to attend one of the higher ranked UCs. So you'll most likely have to wait until all of those high GPA/high SAT students reject UCSC. 

When I first applied as a freshman to UCSC for Computer Science, I was waitlisted. I got my rejection email around June. My grades and SAT scores were worse than yours. So I decided to attend community college(cc) and was able to transfer in 2 years to UCSC as a Computer Science major and I managed to save a lot of money. I recommend going to cc so you save a lot of money, especially since next year will most likely also be online. Don't want to waste one of your dorm years online.

"The colleges is kind of like hog warts-every campus tour guide
Not really, lol. They just are residential halls, but multiple buildings groups into one residential college. Each has a core course (except Stevenson which has two), they all technically have a specific theme, but said themes don’t super matter and your core course just has to do with writing skills. I would choose based on location/dorm/dining hall. 
Stevenson is probably best with dining hall and room because if you get a second or third floor room, most of the time you have lofted ceilings which is really nice because it opens the room up. It is tucked behind cowell on the east of campus but quick walk to parking lot, gym, east field, the quarry, the library, and some main lecture halls. 
Next would probably be eight because it has some nice dorms, and a really pretty location. That dining hall is also pretty good with selections, but it is only really close to the media/art area, and then a slight walk to the library (at least mcHenry the main one). 
9/10 are the same, there’s like literally no difference. But they are really close to science hill (where many science/engineering classes are held), but unless you are planning on living there for multiple years, that closeness doesn’t really matter because you’ll probably end up in classes at classroom unit 1/2. They do have a nicer dining hall, but it’s usually packed because it has late night dining every day where every other dining hall closes at 8 at least one day. 

Hope this helps! I was in cowell, and while I liked the location, the dorms have literally never been updated, and many of the rooms were built to be doubles that the forced into very tiny triples, and many of the lounges turned into quads",1615954361,1,0

"Glad to hear you finished. Working as a firmware engineer can be a hit or miss depending on where and what system you are working on. Very hard to move into different fields later on although I did. Depending on the team, getting up to speed and the actual work can be pretty enjoyable, but if you get stuck with certain firmware teams, it can consume you and be hellish trying to figure out anything or get past bureaucracy within the company. Certain positions say firmware, but you end up doing more high level stuff and depending on the company, you could be doing some mundane and repetitive work. I was fortunate to work on some cool systems before I decided to move on,  but some ppl like that complacency and don’t move too far up. 

Other than that if you like C/C++ and reading thru a lot of different manuals/data sheets for most of the time, it’s def for you. There will be a lot of debugging and bug fixes and you need to have a solid understanding of the hardware and test tools like oscilloscopes for example.

"I've always had to work to have enough money to get by. Though, I already submitted my resignation, so I can focus on school work and hope to coast financially until I graduate in probably August.

"I took human physiology last summer and honestly it is a tough class. Here is a rundown of how much time I put into this class and I got an A: 

￼￼I spent about 20-30 hours a week on this class. 10-15 hours a week when we didn’t have problem sets and 30+ hours a week when we did. (Keep in mind during summer we had only problem sets and weekly quizzes) 

The lectures were about and hour and a half to two hours long
Section was an hour, 
Giulia’s office hours were an hour
And my TA Brian’s office hours were an hour, 
Weekly reading quizzes that were about 10-11 pages of chapter reading which took about 2 hours
so right there that’s (2+2+2+1+1+1= 9 hours) 

Then when we had the problem sets I would take about four hours each day to do it (Tuesday-Thursday = 12) 
Then I would do 2 study groups and that would be an additional 3 hours 
Then finalizing my answers was like 2-10 the night it’s due 

(9+ 15+ 8 = 32 hours) 

*we didn’t have MSI cause I took the class over the summer but definitely check that out if it’s available to you! 

Some tips that I have are turning the closed captions on while listening to the lecture because most of the time she will say the answer verbally to a problem set question. Also, after your problem set is graded compare it with a friends bc sometimes my TA would give my friends points and not me and I was able to fight for more points. If you don’t understand why you got something wrong check in with your TA because you don’t want to make the mistake again in the final. But I think my number one tip would be to get a study group so y’all can go over the material together and quiz each other.",1612741406,1,0
"what keeps me going in cs is that the major is pretty hard to get into -- that is, you have to be admitted into it from the beginning. someone at this school said ""this person could do cs"", and that kinda motivates me, you know?

and in terms of classes, i just appreciate that the challenges help in learning the concepts, if that makes sense. cse101 was really rough for me but at the end of it all i think it's one of my fave classes bc i feel like i learned so much from all the headaches i went through (thanks sesh).

for cse20 or really any class where you have to program, i've found it helpful to just close the code if you can't think of how to do something. what i do is i write down notes of different ways i want to implement something and look up stuff to make it happen and then in the morning i try and write it up. my code always ends up working that way and it takes me like 20 mins lol. :)",1612377797,2,0

This is my number 1 tip for class. If you can be given an integral and quickly see the technique, whether it be trig sub, ibp, integrating factors ect. then that will give you so much confidence. It was pure practice that allowed me to do that. YOU CAN DO IT!!! I took the class more than once. It's rough, I've been there. Once you get through it to the other math classes, you wont be tested so explicitly on each individual integration technique anymore. Keep going, you can do so much more than you think you can.

I know some people had some issues w/ housing this winter, it was approved - then denied and then reapproved on case by case basis. So, tbh I'm not expecting UCSC to tell us their full plans (including housing) for the 2021-2022 school year until probably August. 

I think, if I were you, I would still apply for housing just in case because it's easier to give up a housing spot than to try and get one.  I'm not sure how much the housing deposit is, but if it's reasonable then I would def put down a deposit just incase.

"Hey! Transfer student here, was in the same position. I'm currently on my last quarter here. And I'm a sociology major, so my experience might be different from yours. 
The quarter system moves *fast.* I wouldn't say that the classes are harder, or even that there is more workload than community college,  but you have to keep up because you have less time to complete readings etc. The nicest thing about the quarter system though is that if you have a shitty class it'll be over soon enough. I think honestly just good scheduling habits will be your best friend in adapting to the quarter system.
One thing i would definitely recommend is attending office hours, something that I never did in community college. I wish I would have taken advantage of this more in my time here because I never really did and I missed out on a lot of active engagement that I could have been having with my professors.

In terms of actually making friends; your classes, discord channels, and people you run into while out and about is the way to go. Some people are pretty starved for human interaction. Start up a conversation with the next person you stand near in your Covid test line or while waiting for dining hall food. 

When your classes start up, see if there is a discord channel you can use to start talking with other people. From there, organize outside and socially distanced activities such as a hike or bird watching.

"If I were you, I'd stay with your family. It's ridiculously expensive to rent here. There is no inventory and there was a fire that burned down a lot of people's homes, so there's more people in Santa Cruz than usual. 

Living on campus, if you even get a spot, is not that great. Yea, you're closer to the library and all that crap, but you can make friends off campus just as easily. You'll probably have to have a ton of roommates on or off campus. On campus is loud, it's restrictive, and it's actually more expensive. If you want to get out and explore Santa Cruz then don't live on campus. You will be stuck there. The bus system is horrible here and you could be spending a ton of your time just riding the bus if you live on campus and want to leave, and it doesn't run very late. If you live in the city, you can just walk everywhere. If you live off campus, you will still be spending all day on campus, believe me. You can't just go home in between classes. It would take way too long.

If you insist on moving here, then start looking at the end of the spring quarter. There will probably be more people looking to sublet or moving out for the summer. I found all my places on craigslist, but join the facebook housing group and I think UCSC has a site for students to find off campus housing. There are a lot of scams. Don't give anyone any money before you see the apartment. Don't give them your SSN, don't give them your financial information until you've seen the place. Look up the landlords, etc. I think you can find out who owns whatever home from the Santa Cruz website.",1617042021,1,0

"As a freshman/sophomore, I'd recommend living on campus for a few reasons:

1. Probably the most important (imo) is making friends. Transfers that move off campus sometimes have a hard time meeting others and making friends, making them feel a lil isolated. Living on campus allows you to make some friends (and maybe move off campus with them down the line)
2. Easy access to classes once they go back in person. Commuting from off campus isn't bad due to the buses, but it's still nice to be able to walk to class instead of commute.

Off campus can be cheaper or more expensive, depending on what you're looking for. My room is 1220 a month, but I'm on the base of campus in a single with my own bathroom. Finding a place can be difficult, but if you start looking a few month in advance (UCSC Housing registry, UCSC Housing FB, Craigslist etc), you'll have no problem.

The bill situation will definitely be new, but it's quite simple. Apartments will do it differently than houses that you rent. For apts (I'm assuming here), you'll pay your rent monthly and your water/gas/etc bill is included(?). If you are renting a home, the landlord may include utilities in the rent payment, or may make you pay those yourself.

In my case, I pay my rent, and then pay for wifi, PGE &amp; SCMU (gas, electricity and water) myself. It's as simple as calling and asking them to set you up and then you do some fancy autopayments and you're golden.

"I agree it is a daunting process. I would probably focus on just taking prereqs at this point and not worry about a postbacc as most of them are really expensive and honestly not that useful. Don't feel like you lost time dedicating your time to your major!!! If you graduated with a great GPA, honors, and cum laude you are already off to a great start. Honestly, admissions would rather read your application than the same stereotypical pre-med who does research, clinical shadowing, etc. Your background with PSYCH and ENVS is just as important!!!!! This is a great experience and I would most definitely include it on your application. It shows that you can excel in academics and are a well-rounded person who has other interests outside of medicine. I'm interested in emergency medicine at the moment but keeping an open mind. 

It seems like you are definitely wanting to pursue medicine and I'd say go for it! It is definitely possible. My classmates range in all different types of life experiences. It ranges from the med student who wanted to do this since they were 5 to the 40 year old who worked construction for 20 years to the Lawyer who wanted to change careers.

What other time in my life would I be able to spend 4 years living by the beach? There is more to life than whatever ""prestigious university"" means. I have classmates that are even from UC Davis and in my mind I'm like ""welp, we ended up at the same place for med school huh"". If you go to Santa Cruz with an open mind and don't compare yourself to other high school classmates or colleges you will have a blast. Spend as much outside, meet tons of people, go for a hike, go whale watching at West Cliff in August, go to the beach, meditate in the Redwoods.

However, unlike you, I studied PSYC &amp; ENVS and I have none of the pre-reqs completed. I graduated with a great GPA, honors in both majors, and cum laude, though!! I’ve been weighing if it’s worth it to try to take a post-baccalaureate course and complete pre-reqs, and eventually apply to med school. I’m basically feeling lost as I dedicated my college years to absolutely crushing my majors, loving it, and then not knowing what to do once I’ve graduated. 
I guess my questions are: how did you decide to commit yourself to med school, being that it wasn’t your original plan? Did you find your experience/degree/GPA at UCSC was helpful in applying to med schools (aka were you a competitive applicant because of UCSC)? How are you liking your 3rd year, and what are your plans for afterwards?

Thanks so much!! I really resonated w/ your post, and congratulations on your graduation, admission, and 3rd year!!! 😊

"no need to be so pessimistic/cynical about it, I wanted to see what people thought about the UC System (since there's a fuck ton bit of problems with how it's currently being run) since there's not much student representation on these issues. most of the UC decisions are made by regents who aren't even students, so many of these students are a bit frustrated with the administration of the school they go to. 

people want to see things improved/changed for the better, not just ""burned down"", maybe a reset/new beginning would help. would you rather just have the UC stay as it is where administrators get overpaid for doing little to no work? these issues are not unique to UCSC alone, many other grad students can't afford to live where they work at the other UCs as well. we shouldn't just give up and say ""wow these students are so clueless"" when everyone is trying to just learn and make the world a more liveable and better place.",1620232510,1,0

That is pretty much the same argument of our local NIMBY crowd, just close the door and everything will be groovy.  What if UC had adopted that policy a few years back?  That guy wouldn't even be here.  I'm sure he wouldn't have been arguing to reduce admissions back then, but now that he's one of the lucky ones screw everybody else.

"Bear in mind, I am the person who enjoys a very difficult course in which I learn a lot. I didn't care about my GPA as long as I was learning and passing the course. 

102 - Fremont. By far the hardest class I took at UCSC. Learned more than any other class I took at UCSC. I somehow now understand dynamic programming
 Didn't think that would happen
 Outstanding professor
144 - Nourozi. Took this course during the beginning of the pandemic. It was organized, had very well designed course materials, and professor Nourozi's lectures were top notch. Learned a lot about ML
12b- Sesh. This was my first real CS class and taught me how to study. Got a 0 on the first programming assignment, taught me that I can no longer procrastinate on assignments and gotta keep up with the work as it's assigned. Sesh's lectures were superb and course material rigerous and I learned an incredible amount.
120 - Litz. Professor Litz's lectures were well done, course material was fair and I actually enjoyed learning a little bit about hardware in this class (unlike 12b)
138 - Kuper. I really enjoyed this class. Learning about consensus and distributed systems is so crucial in today's day and age if you want to be a software engineer. I've heard that Professor Kuper is easier than Alvaro and I can attest to that. I personally didn't find 138 too difficult and enjoyed the team projects.
130- Alvaro. professor Alvaro is such a character. Super funny dude and very passionate. I enjoyed his course although the programming assignments were super difficult for me because I didn't know C. Nonetheless, glad I took it with him.

"I'm a grad student in the department and thus my opinion is a little skewed and biased.

UCSC EPS is a great place to get an Earth Science degree. It is one of the largest programs in the country, meaning it is easier to make alumni networking connections. It is also very esteemed, although granted that some of the early professors that gave it that status are now retired, but the younger professors are all amazing esteemed scientists. We have many opportunities for field experience, if that is of interest to you, and field courses are becoming more rare in the US earth science programs because of their expense.

Advice: 

* Try to get involved in professor's labs as early as you can. Take as many EART classes as you can freshman year and whichever profs/classes you enjoyed the most, reach out to those relevant research groups. The department is very welcoming of undergrad involvement.
* Get to know Jade Loftus (the undergrad advisor) very well and definitely be respectful of her time. She does an amazing job and will help you help yourself.
* go to GEODES events. They're organized by grads but are meant for anyone in the department
* when profs say to start working on final projects throughout the quarter, follow their advice. EART projects are often very large and leaving them until the end of the quarter will make you very stressed
* GIS courses and computer science knowledge are becoming more valuable in earth science for job prospects after undergrad
* apply for all the scholarships that are announced. You won't get them if you don't apply and the number of students that actually do apply is often lower than you would guess so the competition is not that bad :)",1620174905,3,0

"I've been to HSU Humboldt a lot to visit my bf and the 2 are definitely quite different in my opinion. Obviously I'm biased towards UCSC's campus haha but it's nestled right into the forest, while HSU Humboldt is more like a school with the forest nearby. UCSC has a better reputation in terms of prestige. If you were to pursue a wildlife related (wildlife, fisheries, etc.) degree, then HSU would likely be better. However, with Psychology I have heard that UCSC has a good Psych program. A big difference to me is the weather. HSU is a lot more ""gloomy"" and seasonal depression up there really hits from what I've heard :(. HSU is definitely a lot more isolated and far away from everything else as well. And from what I've been told, there's a lot less to do at Humboldt than there is to do at UCSC. Pretty much everything closes early there and the food variety is even less than in SC. Though, if you have a car and are willing to drive at least an 1+ hours away (from Humboldt), then you can find some even nicer nature spots. Meanwhile UCSC has plenty of forests and beaches nearby and don't have as many tourists as you would expect. The town/city in SC is a lot nicer than the town in Humboldt. Both UCSC and Humboldt have a weed reputation as you mentioned so I don't think that would really matter (though Humboldt weed is better and cheaper). IMO UCSC has more to do, is more accessible, has better weather, more minorities\*, better campus, and a nicer town.",1621304922,1,0

Baba dont worry! as long as you can understand some of the word you will be in a better spot than most ppl ... the only way i got through it without studying was BC i had a background of speaking it... after that learning to read and write was easy to pick up cuz you know what the word means... i think you will be fine... also side note try to join the iranian student union ppl in the club will be taking the class (im certain of it). best part of the farsi class was linking up with all the kids from the club during and after class!,1621300483,3,0

"I took the course with Mehran! Im a native speaker so i found it to be easy (although i came  in not knowing how to read and write the Persian alphabet). I would say that the workload will be easier than other language courses B/C Mehran is a very easy going professor... he wants to make sure you learn the language. That being said its still going to be a bit of a challenge since you will be learning a new language that uses an totally different alphabet which dont worry the first half of PERS 1 is dedicated to the learning of the alphabet....  

When i took the courses (fall 19 to spring 20) I had 2-3 exams (""non-cumulative"" technically but its a language class so you still need to learn the common vocab) and 2-3 writing prompts (short like 5-7 sentences) and one speaking assignment each quarter. he also called on students in class to have mini dialogues (in PERS 3 we used Breakout rooms... thx covid). ALSO when i took it he did have a retake policy for exams... not sure what it was exactly then--or now--but it was generous from my memory

so i guess enroll and worst case by week 9 you will know what your grade is looking like then you can decide to do P/NP",1621298919,5,0

"Thank you for all of this info! I'm from the rural south south I've grown used to radical conservatives.

The peaceful outdoorsy atmosphere in those towns sound amazing to me. I guess the hangups and dangers of living in the wilderness is part of the tradeoff. 

The NIH Post-bacc Research Program is technically the same as what the UC system calls a ""junior specialist""--basically a lower level science researcher.

Again I haven't taken it so I'm not sure what the workload will be like but I don't think she'd be the type to overburden students with tons of assignments, especially if it's a 5 week class. It is an upper division HAVC class so there will probably be some kind of paper or writing assignment but if you're really interested in the topic I'd say go for it, it will probably be a really cool class (: tbh as a HAVC major I'd enroll if I had the space.",1621295506,1,0
"Welcome and congratulations 😊

We've considered it as well (lived here since 2014), but never done so. For us, the main consideration was driving at night during occasional bad weather (heavy rain/fog) and risk tolerance to do so. Lots of people do this commute. Fire (with its corresponding power grid outages) continues to represent an issue into 2021, as it has in 2019/2020. And of course if you're living in a forest there's always random events such as treefalls.

Rush hour traffic can get bottlenecked, especially if an accident occurs. 

Culturally, San Lorenzo Valley towns (e.g., Felton, Boulder Creek, etc.) trend conservative, if that matters, but it may be gentrifying, so who knows. 

The air smells like perfume from the redwood trees. You may hear the train whistles from Roaring Camp. It can be a magical atmosphere. 

You might consider asking in /r/santacruz as well. Wishing you both a great time!

"Its possible yes but very difficult. I switched housing mid quarter because I hated my living situation, moved from merrill to cowell. I don't know the proper channels of requesting a move, there were a lot of steps but I wasn't a fan of the options or the waiting so I went my own way. I contacted the housing director of the college I wanted to live in, asked hey is there space bc my living situation is unhealthy for lot of reasons, they responded fast and was like hell yeah come thru just get permission from your current housing. 

My housing was pissed they were like why didnt you follow the steps/why didnt you talk to your RA first and move from there? I was like the place I want to move has space and said yes, and at first they were like sorry we cant let you go. So I made some shit up about how an RA cant fix it and how it was time sensitive and they replied saying okay fine. 

This wasn't my first time moving during a quarter but housing loves to put roadblocks unless theres a legit reason, so consider that. I moved from C9 to 10 a previous quarter bc my roommate was an actual bad person. Moving to the trailers looks like it will be very very difficult as its extremely limited (like 30-40 something trailers?) and I think low income gets priority, so idk if you'll get a spot.",1621294502,3,0
