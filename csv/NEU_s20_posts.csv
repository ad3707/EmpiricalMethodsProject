Shy prospective student advice,"Hi! I’m a hs senior that was just accepted to Nottheastern, with a big enough merit scholarship that it’s now both one of my top choices and financially viable. 

I probably would be ready to commit rn, except I’m a bit worried about being in the city and just the general college experience I guess. I’m very shy, possibly to the point of having social anxiety or some autism traits. For example I’ve stuck with my same group of friends throughout most of middle and high school without getting to know a lot of other ppl, I don’t enjoy parties/dances, never had a girlfriend, dislike the idea of drinking, you get the idea. 

Basically what I’m wondering is like how much does the school help out with social stuff versus just having to go find it on your own? Are people generally nice and willing to include someone that’s introverted? Will I be missing out on core parts of the experience and not really fit in with campus culture? Idk just any answers or advice anyone has would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!",1579847958,1,0

Question: does anyone have experience requesting accommodations for classes due to a chronic illness?,"Hey guys. Just shooting this out there to see if anyone had advice or experience with this. 

I’ve had a chronic illness since studying abroad on a dialogue a couple years ago. It’s gotten worse over time and I ended up having to take medical leave last year. 

I just tried to go back to finish this spring because I only need 3 classes. But I physically could not commit to making all my classes so I dropped them last week. most days I can’t be away from the bathroom for more than a couple hours. I’m still doing tests/procedures and trying new medications so it’s tough. I’m also financially independent which adds a whole other level of stress balancing work and classes. I’m taking some time off of work for now to focus on my health. If I don’t get better I may have to go on disability. 

Someone told me about WeCare and that maybe they could help with accommodations. I only have 3 classes left but one is a capstone, which Im told I have to do in person. My other two classes are advanced writing and intensive writing and I don’t believe online options are available. I’m a COMM major. 

Has anyone been able to request a directed study or other accommodation in this kind of special circumstance? I just want to have my degree. I was supposed to graduate last spring. I feel very discouraged about graduating now considering how long I’ve been sick. Does anyone have any guidance for me on who exactly to talk to for help in the university? I feel very lost.

So the last post was voting, and you ended up selecting the **plain black hat**, so that's the one we're going with. (The full-black one here: https://imgur.com/a/Z5iz7jn#DOc5L7p)


For an estimated 30 hats (based on the 36 votes for Black on the voting + some room for error), the price per hat will be **$15.36**.

**If you want to buy the hat, Venmo @Grffiin for $15.36 and send me a PM with your Venmo username**. This will make hat pickup easier, because I can have a list of all the reddit users who bought hats.

Order link is here for proof of estimated price: https://imgur.com/a/gWO04mC

I will be closing off the order on **Friday the 6th at 12pm**, and putting in the order at that time.

I've made 3 designs based on some feedback people had, and I've included their prices (I guessed around 20 people were gonna order hats, so prices might be higher/lower depending on how many people end up ordering)

The designs are here: https://imgur.com/a/Z5iz7jn

Please vote for **all the hats that you would buy, assuming that the price is accurate**. On Monday (3/2), I will cutoff voting and make a post about pricing information on whichever hat receives the most support.

Not sure what to do at this point,"Throwaway obviously because I am ashamed and embarrassed of myself LOL

So I’m a first-year student who went on a personal leave for this spring semester because I found out that my mom couldn’t really afford to send me to school, due to some financial crisis that’s happening with her (she and I don’t really talk about this sort of stuff with each other, so I’m not sure what it is exactly). I talked to my financial counselor and he told me it would only be possible for me to receive a bigger financial aid package so my mom can pay for college if my dad sends certain tax forms over to the school so that they can process it and we end up with a lower student bill. The only problem is, my dad is kinda out of the picture and was never willing to send his tax information no matter how often my family asked him to. 

As a result of all that, I decided not to move back home and stay in Boston instead because I felt like I’d be way happier here than living with my family at home, due to the fact that just being in my home town makes me feel really depressed and in the past my mom hasn’t exactly treated me well emotionally and mentally. 

I’m staying in an apartment near campus atm and am currently still looking for work. I do have some money saved up so I think I’ll be okay for a little while. My original plan was just to take this semester to work and figure out how I intend on going back to school for the summer terms so I don’t fall far behind my peers. I was going to try and improve my credit score, and then apply for loans without needing my mom as a co-signer (I didn’t get approved for any loans in the past because of my mom’s bad credit score most likely, and my own credit score was too new to apply by myself), but I figure that this is probably a good way to dig myself into that crippling college debt, so I’m not sure if this is how I wanna go about the situation, even if I’m planning on studying Comp Sci. I dont know if this could be another option, but I’ve read stories of people being financially independent to pay for college all by themselves, but I just have no clue how anyone does that and it sounds super difficult to do.

So now I feel like my only options are to leave Northeastern and transfer to a cheaper school that I feel like I might be miserable at, or just move back home and suffer...???? I can’t think about this whole thing with a clear head most of the time because it’s exacerbated my depression a ton and I just find it hard to believe that things will get better from here. I love this school a lot, I love all my friends, I love CS, but I really have no idea what I’m supposed to do anymore. 

any advice would be appreciated pls ;-;

Desperate prospective student here,"Hey Huskies! I've applied to the school of engineering for the Masters program(Electrical Engineering) at Northeastern and it's been in review for a few weeks now. 

I have a pretty low undergrad GPA(a 6.8/10) and a GRE of Q:170,V:158 and AWA:4. Honestly, I love the university regardless of their decision on my application. Not many universities have the kind of fundamental research that Northeastern has. But then again, my GPA sucks too bad.

I have a bunch of research projects with some of the most prestigious research institutes of my country. But all that said, the decision is quite binary unfortunately. 

So given the circumstances, can anyone predict my odds of getting in? And of course, knowing that Northeastern is one of the best universities there are, I realise the odds are quite low.

Anyway, whatever the decision, thanks a ton. And if I do get in, will definitely leave an update on this thread.

Now I just got caught by NUPD for vandalism (a hole in the wall) and when they came in they found some weed a well. So now I’m really screwed. What r the odds I get suspended or expelled? Both of these will be first time charges for vandalism and possession (providing that I can get out of my fire alarm charges).

Dear students who are not law students,"It is finals week in the law school, and, worse, for many of us it is our last ever finals week which makes it ridiculously stressful. There are signs all around the school warning that the law student areas are reserved for law students only during finals. Despite that, I have still had to drive three groups of you non-law-students out of our study rooms in the last three days. So either they've seriously relaxed the requirement that y'all know how to read since I attended undergrad here, or some of you are just complete assholes.  
  
We know you're not law students, you can't fool us. We see you coding and using calculators (two things that are 100% not part of any law student's toolkit, especially not during finals), or studying biology, or history of jazz or some shit. We tolerate your presence in our extremely limited study space throughout the rest of the year, so I don't think it's unfair for us to tell you to stay the fuck out for just one week per quarter.  
  
Oh, also, for a good number of us our finals don't actually finish until Saturday night, so just to be safe you should probably stay away until at least Sunday or Monday. Be warned that at least one of my classmates has threatened that the next undergrad she sees in our space will be yeeted into the nearest body of water. She's fully capable of it.

Re: Performance Clubs Struggle With Budget Costs,"Article:  [https://huntnewsnu.com/61743/front-1/performing-arts-groups-struggle-with-budget-cuts-blackman-cost/](https://huntnewsnu.com/61743/front-1/performing-arts-groups-struggle-with-budget-cuts-blackman-cost/) 

It has been clearly established that there is a funding issue for student orgs. My question is what action should be taken? With more student groups popping up, how does the university ensure that groups are properly funded?  

 According to the article, campus spaces such as Blackman Auditorium have gone up in price. Can the university feasibly lower these costs? Additionally, are clubs entitled to funding for things like t-shirts, photographers, and gifts? Should clubs with low attendance/involvement have their official standings reevaluated? Should the Student Activity Fee be raised? What can/should be done?  What are your thoughts?

Northeastern vs Georgia Tech for Neuroscience,"Hey everyone, I'm posting this in GT and NEU subreddits because I won't be able to attend admitted students days for either school due to corona which highkey sucks :(. But, I still need to make this decision soon and I can't decide what to go for. Northeastern would be almost 50k less over four years than Georgia Tech with my scholarship, and in this economy, I feel like I can't ignore the opportunity to have less debt to pay, less things to worry about. My parents are willing to pay but I'm not sure if they can pay all of Georgia Tech or even Northeastern; I'm guaranteeing some debt with either decision. I am planning on majoring in neuroscience and from there either 1) get a masters and go into artificial intelligence and machine learning OR 2) med school to be a psychiatrist or neurologist OR 3) get a phd in neuro. Georgia Tech would be awesome for artificial intelligence, but really expensive if I decide I wanna go to med school. But, Northeastern also has really good computer science and neuroscience classes. I also feel like the student atmospheres of both schools are pretty different since NEU is a northeast private school with lots of international students while GT is a southern state school with a bunch of engineers. Does anyone know what the atmosphere is like at both of these schools? I'm pretty open-minded, love having interesting people to party with, but I genuinely care about learning. Basically what I'm asking is, which school will give me the most bang for my buck? I know y'all are biased here, but could anyone help me make this really tough decision with some insight?",1584416173,1,0

WE GOT ONE BOYS!!!,"NEU gets its first case 


Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff:
 
Consistent with our ongoing efforts to provide up-to-date resources and information, we are writing to notify you that a Northeastern student living in off-campus housing in Boston has tested positive for COVID-19. In keeping with CDC protocols, this first test—conducted at a Boston-area hospital—will need to be verified by the CDC, which may take several days.
 
Please note: A presumptive case is based on a single positive test. A confirmed case requires CDC confirmation. 
 
This student, who has been in isolation since last Thursday, March 12, remains in isolation in an off-campus apartment. The Boston Public Health Commission is carefully reviewing the student’s movements since returning from Spring Break on Monday, March 9. This will allow the BPHC to contact individuals who may have been in direct contact with the infected student. It is very important that the student’s anonymity be maintained.
 
We realize that knowledge of this positive test will surely increase anxiety among the Northeastern community. This is understandable. A positive test result—presumptive or confirmed—underscores the need for the university to continue its swift and comprehensive response to the COVID-19 outbreak:
 
We are assisting students who are moving out of residence halls;
We have shifted to online instruction for all classes at all Northeastern campuses;
We have established a policy on remote work for all employees;
We continue to seek the best guidance from public health experts, including members of the Northeastern faculty;
The university is sanitizing all of its facilities and public spaces on a continuous basis.
 
One of the clearest guidelines from public health authorities, in the U.S. and around the world, is how a community responds to an outbreak can have direct impact on its duration and severity. By working together—and heeding the wealth of public health expertise that is available to us—we can take material steps to slow the spread of the virus.
 
As always, please consult our dedicated COVID-19 website for the latest information. We will communicate additional updates very soon.

Is it really fair that students take online exams and quizzes with, theoretically, the whole access of the internet at their disposal?

2. Allow meal swipes to be transferred to future semesters or refund swipes for seniors that will no longer use dining facilities.

3. Consider a prorate refund for classes where moving online is not conducive to the learning experience e.g. STEM courses with labs. Please also consider a prorate refund for other classes as well because most of your class curricula have not been designed for an online learning experience. The shift to online has degraded the quality of many courses.

(Such refunds have been implemented at many other schools here in Boston)

4. And most **importantly,** ask students, specially students involved in Greek life, to stop hosting private gatherings. Please consider appending a clause to the student code of conduct and enforcing these extensions by monitoring Facebook events and other social platforms. Maybe offering a reward to party/gathering whistle-blowers to ensure that we, students, primarily young people, that show little to no symptoms when infected do not propagate this terrible novel disease.

We shouldn't be paying for the facilities we aren't using. I calculated it for myself that even if I got 1/4 of all the housing and campus fees back (not even including tuition) its upwards of **$6500** back my family could be spending on food or cleaning supplies for us and my grandparents.

Reducing Campus Density - AKA Eviction Time,"
Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff:
 
You know how we said you all could stay on campus? Yeah fuck you nerds, pack your shit and get out by this Tuesday.

Yeah, we’ve been talking to health officials and the state government for weeks. Surely we had some indication that campus could be evacuated soon? Nope, we felt it would be appropriate to kick all 20,000 of you out with three days warning. Good luck booking a ticket back home or finding a place to stay. Fuck your continuity of campus life.

Oh and if you live on the other side of the world, good luck keeping up with your online classes. If you have to take an exam at 3 in the morning, so be it. Back in my day, we walked to school uphill both ways so you fuckers can figure some shit out.

Sincerely,

Your friends at Northeastern",1584217409,1,0

Northeastern/Boston Music Scene?,"Hi everyone,

I’m an admitted student to Northeastern University. Academics/sports/social scene aside, how is the music scene at NEU and the surrounding area?

In my hometown, I lead two rock bands and sing in multiple choirs. I used to review music online and I’m an avid record collector. I like everything from hip-hop to punk to psychedelic rock to experimental music etc.

Basically, I’m a giant music nerd. I want to go to a place where I could potentially join/found a musical group and get involved with the local music community. I know there’s a billion things going on in Boston, but is going Northeastern conducive to getting involved with the music scene?

Also, I’m not talking about the music majors Northeastern offers, or joining the marching band or something like that. I’m talking about the local/independent/underground music scene.

Please let me know! I’m happy to hear anybody’s opinions. Thanks in advance.",1585444442,2,0

I was recently admitted into NEU with the NU in program. I'm really grateful for my acceptance, but simultaneously disappointed that I didn't receive any merit or need based aid.

My professor is literally the worst and I don’t know what to do.,"Everyone in the class, even students with A’s complain about this guy. He straight up WONT answer questions. He just says “we covered that” and drops it and it is awful. He literally stops lectures early when people “run out of questions” and thats only because he wont answer or go over something more than once or twice.

He quizzes and tests us and gives us homework on topics we haven’t covered (only like 1 or 2 questions). Granted it is somewhere to be found, but he also says “dont study what we dont cover in class” so its super counter intuitive.

Hes honestly the worst teacher Ive ever had. He explains how our class is a chapter behind and lectured us for half of each class that we needed to catch up, when in reality he should have actually taught and realize that was on him. We finally caught up when we went online, he just gave us all the chapter 10 notes and picked up with a few review of then chapter. 

He doesnt account for people in other time zones too and doesnt record any of the online lectures, so if youre living in Hawaii, have fun waking up at 4am. 

Oh also, about the scaling, he claims (fyi hes a statistics teacher so this is total bull) that if he scales it will increase the grades of those with good grades, but lower everyone else’s. What!? Um... no...

Amount of Minors One Can Take?,"Is there a limit to the amount of minors you are allowed to take at Northeastern? (if you can somehow make it fit with your schedule)

I’m a media and screen studies/comm studies integrated major (this sounds more confusing than it is, but really, so many of the COMM and MSCR classes overlap that there’s no real categorical difference between the two. If not, I’d drop the comm in a heartbeat). I want to officially declare a music industry minor so I can be officially part of NU’s music department (I’ve already taken intro to music industry, plan on taking music in everyday life in the fall, and might be taking music recording 1 during summer 1 online, which would leave me with two more classes to go). In addition I really want to add some kind of writing or English minor (I already took fiction workshop, and would need three more classes to complete a writing minor). So that would be two entirely separate minors which seems somewhat doable to do, even though I’m definitely worried about fitting it all in. I’ll be a third year in the fall (gosh, I don’t know how that is the case already; I’m so not ready). But then looking at the classes I’ve already taken, I realize that both the Media Production and Film Production minors are simply natural extensions of my major and of the classes I’ve already taken and plan on taking. For film production, following the fall, I will have two more classes left, and for media production, I will have three! And the remaining classes are all classes that generally overlap with my major and classes I’d planned on taking anyway! So would it make sense to officially declare these as well, or is that super redundant and unnecessary? Is it even possible? Can I have three or four minors especially if two of them overlap? (There are other minors I’d consider taking if it were even remotely possible such as philosophy, poly sci, history, psychology, game design, entrepreneurship, or even theatre, but of course I’m out of my mind and none of that is even remotely possible!)",1586524359,1,0

Prepare for the worst and hope for the best,"Hey Everyone,

I know that everyone is focusing on finals, late term papers, and generally not ending up in the hospital. All that fun stuff aside, I want to encourage everyone to register to vote and apply for an absentee ballot. This may seem early and presumptive but this way you make sure you have all your stuff done in time and they can't say you did not get your ducks in a row fast enough. Wisconsin just had some shady activity around their local elections so don't let this happen to you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of people say that their vote doesn't matter. Thats cool and all but, if you spend 5 min to register for an absentee ballot all you have to do is color in a circle and put the ballot in the provided envelope and drop it in your mail box and your loss of time is negligible. This way, even if your vote doesn't matter, at least you didn't waste time and gas to go drive to your polling place, get hassled by campaign workers, stand in line, get stuck listening to someone preaching about a candidate you hate, having to say your name 8 times to the poll worker, vote, fight to get out of the parking lot, drive home, and then wait for results. With an absentee ballot it's just take ballot out of mail, vote, stick it in the envelope, put that envelope in the mail, and wait. Really you have nothing to lose.

&amp;#x200B;

Heres how to get started

register- [https://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote](https://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote)

Pass/Fail - what the administration does not want you to know,"I am a senator in the Northeastern Student Government Association (SGA). Recently I wrote legislation that called on the administration to expand the pass/policy to include all classes, and to extend the deadline to switch to pass/fail until after final grades are released. This legislation passed the student senate by a wide margin, and was sent to Aoun who proceeded to ignore it. When the student government attempted to reach out to the student body to inform them of the current policy and the legislation that we passed, we were blocked. The Office of student affairs prevented the student government from contacting the student body about this issue. The worst part is that the justification for why the policy won’t be changed is that not enough students have complained to the office of the provost. This is a bad faith argument because it ignores the fact that the entire purpose of the student government is to represent the student body and the concerns of students. 

In addition we were prevented from contacting the student body to inform them of who to contact if they wanted the policy changed. What you should know is that petitions are not going to accomplish anything. When we mentioned the existence of petitions, the provost office was not only completely unaware of them, but they also claimed that petitions were not evidence of the concerns of students. I am posting all of this because if you care whatsoever, we as students only have 4 DAYS LEFT to get the provost office to change the policy. My goal is to tell you what the administration does not want you to know. The person who will ultimately determine if the policy changes is James Bean. He is the provost and senior vice president of academic affairs. He is the one who has claimed to not heard any complaints from students. His email is jbean@northeastern.edu. If you care about this policy you should email him your concerns, as currently he does not believe that there is a problem at all. In addition (617)-373-4517 is the number of the “special assistant to the provost” so if you are concerned he may not read your email please feel free to call and state your concerns over the phone. There are a lot of students who are struggling right now and the administration does not plan to do anything about it. I beg all of you, please show them how desperately these changes are needed.

Indecisive and nervous prospective student in need of some advice.,"Hello, I understand there is a megathread for admitted students but my parents are both on my butt about this because other people in my grade are committing and I feel like it would get more visibility as a post. 


I am extremely nervous about picking my college right now between NEU/Rutgers and what major I should do if I choose NEU. If anyone could answer these questions I would be very grateful.


Note about finances. NEU is $49k per year and Rutgers is $30k per year. My family is middle to upper-middle class so while we will feel the extra $76k that NEU will tack on for us, we will not have to sell cars or anything of that nature.


* How much does having a business degree or major help with co-ops? My mother and I argue that I should do econ/poli-sci since I really enjoy politics and I’ve always wanted to go to school for it. My dad argues econ/business because it will help with co-op and after graduation. I’m doing econ either way because I really like the material but I’m not sure what to pair it with. I understand both sides of their arguments. Since I imagine econ and business majors enter the same field in terms of co-ops, would having the business school available to me really help my co-op in terms of finding strong paying ones, or would the benefits be minimal since I would already be doing econ?


* Does co-op generally mean a higher salary coming out of NEU (at least compared to a state school)? At Rutgers I would be doing a double major in Business Analytics and Econ, which has a starting salary of $68,000 on average. Northeastern doesn’t publish first job salary as far as I can tell but a federal gov website put NEU’s Business Administration degree at $60k. For me this seems counter intuitive given how much praise co-op has around here, although maybe it is meant more as a placement rate benefit than for the actual salary. I would like to get the most ROI on my college investment and if a school that is significantly cheaper offers a higher salary than I would have a hard time justifying NEU.


* I really WANT to go to NEU, and my parents are willing to finance me. That said, I don’t want to make them pay an extra 75k for me to get a near same return as Rutgers. I understand I am comparing two slightly different fields since my Rutgers degree will encapsulate Business Analytics which I will not be doing at NEU because I heard the MIS concentration is a little repetitive and not worth it. This could account for the income differential, comparing the Business Analytic major income to NEU's business degree in general could skew the comparison. I’m just trying to figure out if the benefits are enough for me to ask them to pay for NEU. I absolutely love cities, the Boston area, and the idea of co-op. But if it does little in the end for my salary, then I’m not sure. I understand that maybe I should not be so money driven but this is simply because NEU is a good bit more than Rutgers and I have to take that into account.

Thanks in advance!",1586458863,0,0
Hot Take: Northeastern RA's don't deserve compensation for the loss of their positions.,"This may or may not be an unpopular opinion on this subreddit, but it certainly would be if I posted it publicly on Facebook or twitter.  You may or may not have seen [the petition which asks for Northeastern to compensate RA's for the loss of their housing and food.](https://www.change.org/p/compensate-northeastern-resident-assistants-ras-displaced-by-covid-19-pandemic?source_location=topic_page) It's got almost 1000 signatures which isn't that much but its not that little either. I've seen a lot of friends and acquaintances sharing and posting about it on social media and the NU Facebook groups. I think this is pretty ridiculous. The RA position is not supposed to be a full time job, but it is supposed to help you out with expenses while away from home. The RA position is supposed to help students with food and rent when they are moving out of their home and into a city with a high cost of living. Many of these RA's are simply traveling back home where their parents are paying for rent and food. A lot of RA's that personally know have moved back in with their parent's are still sharing this petition. If any RA's, or students in general would become homeless due to this, then I think that is a different story. However, the vast majority of RA's do have a home to go back to. Also, I know for a fact Northeastern has been letting some RA's and international students stay in IV if they would not be able to travel home. If any RA's would literally become homeless due to this, then I believe that northeastern should allow them to remain in IV. However demanding a lump sum of cash for losing your RA position is crazy.

Prior knowledge of group theory is not assumed. Introduces  homomorphisms, subgroups, normal subgroups, quotient groups, and group  actions, illustrated with a variety of examples. Subsequent topics  include the class equation, simple groups, the Sylow theorems, and their  applications to the classification of finite simple groups. Discusses  classical matrix groups, with an emphasis on SU(2) and SO(3) as  fundamental examples, and introduces the notion of a Lie algebra.  Develops representation theory of finite groups and its correspondence  to the representation theory of compact Lie groups sketched, again using  SU(2) as an example. Students not meeting course prerequisites may seek  permission of instructor. ""

MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE YOUR DIRECT DEPOSIT INFORMATION or you will not get a refund for a while!!!,"Make sure you update your direct deposit information in MyNortheastern or you will get a check. I called NU today, they say checks could take while because of staffing during the pandemic and having to mail all the checks individually. They sent out this email on Monday and it is not a scam make sure you do this!!!! 

&gt;We write with an important request. We strongly encourage you to enroll in direct deposit by April 10, 2020. Enrolling in direct deposit will allow any payment from NU to be deposited to your U.S. bank and is the most efficient method of receiving funds. You may enroll in direct deposit or review your current direct deposit information by visiting [this link](https://neuforms3.neu.edu/lfserver/DirectDeposit.xfm).  
&gt;  
&gt;If you choose to receive a physical check in U.S currency instead, there may be significant delays in receiving your refund. If you would like to opt for a physical check, please visit myNortheastern to update your permanent address to the location where you wish to have the check mailed.  
&gt;  
&gt;We know students are understandably eager to hear more information on the timing and details of potential refunds. The university is actively working on these questions to ensure the refunds are accurate to each individual students’ account. Thank you for your patience, and we will send another update as soon as the details and logistics are confirmed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please refer to this [FAQ page](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/direct-deposit/) with any questions about direct deposit

The Injustice of ECE Capstone,"I'll keep things brief. Here are the facts:

\- Students are still expected to pay full price for Capstone 1 this summer.

\- We no longer have access to lab equipment due to campus being closed.

\- Team budgets have been reduced to $500 per team (about $100/person) and they wouldn't tell us what the old budget was.

\- Responses from faculty when concerns were raised on Zoom:

&gt;No ECE faculty are getting raises  
&gt;  
&gt;We'll pass this along as feedback to the department

Doubt it. Is there anything a student can do?  
It is disturbing to see the blatant conflicts of interest in broad daylight. Northeastern's trying to protect their wallet at the expense (literally) of students. Infuriating, I tell you!",1588635163,1,0
Why Campus will Reopen in the Fall,"Tl;dr: I have a feeling the campus will reopen in the Fall unless the government mandates campuses to stay closed. Northeastern literally cannot afford to stay closed.

After listening to Chegg’s earnings call, where one of their executives mentioned that schools will have a hard time staying alive if they don’t reopen, I decided to take a look at Northeastern’s [2019 financial statement](https://finance.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019-Financial-Statements.pdf) to get a better idea of where they’re at if tuition stops rolling in at the same level. I’m sure if campuses stay closed, many students will not take a(nother) full semester of online classes. I’m sure most of you have already seen that the school is [getting sued for $50m](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wcvb.com/amp/article/northeastern-university-sued-for-inferior-online-education/32361123) by outraged students. If students decide to take a leave of absence because the campus is closed, which I plan to do if we remain closed, that would be a full semester of reduced income from tuition (you can take up to a [year off](https://registrar.northeastern.edu/article/leaves-of-absence/) without being withdrawn from the school, though you’ll have to talk to your advisor about the financial aid implications if you have aid).


If we take a look at the 2019 Consolidated statement of Activities on page 4, you’ll see that nearly a billion dollars of the total $1.4B in operating revenue comes from tuition and fees. With a closed campus fees will likely be dropped and the amount of people paying tuition will drop as well. We may even see a reduction in tuition to make up for the drop in demand. I would guess sponsor support, totaling about $123m, would see a drop as well. All of these possibilities result in lost revenue and possibly lost jobs.

So let’s talk about cutting expenses. Operating expenses look relatively fixed, except for salary and benefits. There would have to be layoffs to make up for the lost revenue. 

I can’t estimate how many people will lose their jobs to cut spending, and I also can’t estimate how many students will skip a semester or if the tuition will be reduced. Everything is up in the air and this is mostly speculation.

That said, looking at Northeastern’s cash flow statement on page 5 tells us that they ended the year up around $100M in cash flow mostly thanks to financing activities for a total of around $338M in cash/cash equivalents for the full year. If their two largest positive operating cash flows, student-related revenues and sponsored programs, took a 25% hit for one semester and all else was constant then you’re looking at a $157M loss and that wouldn’t be acceptable, I imagine. That doubles to $313M if somehow the 25% loss was for the full year. Not to say we’d see such a steep fall off, but anything’s possible.

There may be error in my analysis and I hope someone smarter than me points them out. Based on all this, keeping the campus closed would be far too financially damaging and the cynical side of me thinks the administration would rather gamble public health and risk a campus-wise outbreak than have the university go under. Furthermore, if other schools are in the same boat (which I imagine many are) and they all decide to reopen then it’s much easier to not take the full blame because “most other schools opened up” if things go awry. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts and let me know that I’m wrong because I would honestly love to be wrong on this.",1588630330,1,0

Questions from a transfer student,"Hello,

I’m a prospective transfer student recently accepted to Northeastern, with the intent to major in International Affairs. 

I haven’t been able to get the most complete impressions of any of the schools I applied to due to the ongoing situation; all the tours/trips I had planned have obviously been cancelled.

So my big question is: what’s the school like? I know these threads might be a little annoying, but I'm trying to get comprehensive insight on this school and others from a lot of sources, Reddit among them.

To be more specific, here’s what I’m mainly looking for insight on:

* What’s the International Affairs program like? Is it difficult? Is there enough room for a solid work-life balance, or is it work-intensive? Are professors generally good, or bad?

* What’s campus social life like? Are activities mainly based around clubs, Greek life, or something else? Will I fit in if I don’t smoke/drink (speaking from experience at my current university, where I didn’t fit in based on that)?

* What’s the campus itself like? Is it modernized, or old (in terms of facilities, not actual age; I'm talking stuff like renovations)? Does it feel walkable and have the feeling of “home?” Does life feel active around it, or are things usually centered on the campus?

* What’s housing and food like? Are the dorms and dining options good, or would I be better-suited finding something off-campus?

Call President Aoun to Demand Compensation for Dining Workers and Residential Assistants!,"Hello, everyone! I am a member of Progressive Student Alliance—United Students Against Sweatshops Local 115. You may remember us from two months ago, when we started [a petition demanding Northeastern continue to pay dining workers](https://www.change.org/p/northeastern-university-continue-paying-northeastern-dining-hall-employees-for-the-next-30-days), or from about a month ago, when we started [a petition demanding Northeastern extend the pro-rated refund for room and board to RA student workers](https://www.change.org/p/compensate-northeastern-resident-assistants-ras-displaced-by-covid-19-pandemic). Unfortunately, Northeastern has refused to act on either of these issues. This is despite the fact that they received $11.6 million in the CARES Act, more than Harvard, MIT, Tufts, and Lesley, who have all agreed to give pay and/or medical benefits to laid-off dining workers. Northeastern has the money to pay dining workers and give RAs a refund, so their decision to refuse to do so is irresponsible and unacceptable.

Therefore, our national organization, United Students Against Sweatshops, has decided to do a call-in into President Aoun’s office to demand pay and medical benefits for dining workers, as well as a pro-rated refund for room and board for RA student workers! You can go to [USAS’ #StudentWorkerWednesdays page](https://usas.org/studentworkerwednesdays) for details about how to participate in this call-in. Please stand in solidarity with dining workers and residential assistants by calling President Aoun!",1589388860,1,0

Good books you've read over quarantine,"Hey everyone!

I thought it might be fun and distracting to make a list of good books that you're reading now or want to recommend. To be honest the gravity of this situation is finally sinking in and I am feeling quite sad about it. As a kid books were my preferred source of escapism and I am enjoying the free time by reading!

List any number of books you want, and maybe add a little note about what you liked. 

I'll go first:

1. The Art of Surveillance Capitalism- Shoshana Zuboff

(this is non fiction and quite dense but worth it. Good insight about privacy and technology)

2. The Souls of Black Folk - WEB Du Bois

 (*listen to the audiobook if you can!! This book is one of the most powerful pieces of literature I have ever read)

3. Sula - Toni Morrison

 (guys I was crying like a baby. Strongly recommend)

Housing Cancellation Deadline,"TL;DR The deadline to withdraw from fall housing is this Friday (May 15th). For those of us planning to go off-campus, this is a very hard decision to make due to financial hardships and the lack of concrete information regarding plans for the fall. Choosing to not withdraw from housing by Friday could potentially screw us out of thousands of dollars if we later cancel housing and our circumstance isn't deemed 'extenuating'. Please email/call housing and request a guarantee that students can cancel their housing after May 15th without accruing any fees.  

\---

It is unreasonable for Northeastern to expect us to withdraw from housing by Friday. 

Nobody knows what the state of the world is going to be in September. After the email from Aoun, we do not know what the housing conditions are going to be, either. We therefore have no way of knowing if campus housing is going to be safe, and have no way of making an informed decision right now. We should be able to opt out of campus housing once the university's plans regarding classes and housing are clarified without being held responsible for fees. 

I had emailed housing about extending the deadline in the past, and received this response: ""*Students can submit their cancellation petition as outlined on our website for consideration. We are generally understanding of cancellation petitions should students have extenuating circumstances and complete a petition*."" I don't know about you, but I don't find this to be at all reassuring. ""*Generally understanding*"" offers no guarantee, and there is no clarification on what counts as an ""*extenuating circumstance*"". Is feeling unsafe with their yet-to-be-announced decisions regarding housing an extenuating circumstance? What if the pandemic leaves me unable to afford campus housing, and I find a cheaper apartment off-campus? What if I get a co-op within 20 miles of Boston, but am able to work remotely and decide to stay at home? What if all my classes happen to be remote (since it was implied this may be an option) and I decide to take them from home?

I fully intend on moving off-campus and only applied to campus housing as a back-up. I do not want to sign a lease until I know for sure what the fall plans are, especially after losing my co-op and no longer knowing what I can afford. I know I'm not the only one in this situation, so I do not think it is unreasonable to demand housing be a bit more accommodating. All I'm asking for is assurance that I won't owe Northeastern thousands of dollars if I no longer need university housing for a reason they don't deem ""extenuating"", since right now, it is up to their discretion.

It is unreasonable to keep the policy the same while the world is in disarray. Please, if you are also facing this issue, or just want to be an additional voice for those of us that are, email housing and request that they be more lenient or at the very least more transparent with their cancellation policies due to COVID-19. Please remain respectful in your emails and/or calls. 

I know we're cutting it close here, but we were able to change the provost's mind about the Pass/Fail policy (at least somewhat), so maybe we can do this, too. Thanks for reading.",1589314066,1,0

"PSA: to both old, current, and new huskies CHECK THE FREAKING MEGATHREAD!","So let’s clear the air a little. There has been both negative and positive responses to all the new incoming freshman posting their questions as a separate post instead of in the megathread. So it’s time for a PSA. 

To incoming freshman/new huskies:
Y’all need to post in the megathread or at least check it before deeming your post as necessary. A lot of your questions have already been answered and further information has been given. People have put links and a lot of other helpful information in the megathread for you to look through and help you during these times. Honestly it is slightly annoying even to other incoming freshman because 1. Non-freshman get annoyed and it sadly affects the mood of the sub/their views of new huskies, 2. Other incoming freshman have posted in the megathread and have answered questions themselves at this point and you shouldn’t disregard what the rest of the incoming freshman are relying on. Like cmon! Majority of your questions are already answered! All you have to do is use the search bar to search up keywords or just look through the megathread because other questions that you haven’t thought of have already been answered and can be helpful! So plz, look/post in the megathread. 

To non-freshman/alumni/old &amp; current huskies:
Please look in the megathread and answer some questions. The reason why some of the kids are posting separate posts in the first place is because they’re not getting responses in the megathread (because it’s half dead. The only people who are left and still replying are the people who see notifications from time to time because they’re “subscribed” to the post by reddit, or its just the OP dutifully replying. Please remember the time during which you were a new incoming freshman who also had all the questions in the world (even though they were already answered at that point too). Remember how helpful the NEU subreddit was or could’ve been and help by checking the megathread from time to time and answer some god dang questions even if they’re slightly or even very repetitive. You getting annoyed and being rude to the incoming freshman is not helping anyone and isn’t gonna do anything. 

Let’s all try to make this subreddit a welcoming place for all NEU kids, even new huskies, and do our parts by answering some questions instead of just getting annoyed from our beds as we see repetitive posts. And new huskies plz plz plz use the megathread. It’s the first thing on the subreddit and says “MEGATHREAD-newly accepted student questions”

How to apply for Northeastern Covid-19 Financial Aid:,"Hi everyone, ever since the Cares Act was announced, I've been trying figure out how to get part of the $11.6 million given to Northeastern. Please note: Only half of the $11.6 million is guaranteed to go to students. That being said, Northeastern has set up donations to add additional funds that can be distributed.


At the time of this writing, it looks like the funds are request based. This makes a lot of sense because Northeastern does have a lot of wealthy students, so not everyone will need financial assistance during these rough economic times.


How to get $$$:


1) Fill out the form found here: https://neu.campuslabs.com/engage/submitter/form/start/394923


You have to login using your Northeastern credentials. I got this link from a wecare email, so feel free to send them an email if you don't trust the link I posted. They will send an automatic response that has this link.


2) Request the money you need in the short term and state what it'll be spent on. This reasoning and what you're going to spend it on is up to you. That being said, if you're like me, it's probably going to groceries. 


3) Wait. I have no clue how long it's going to take, but hope it takes less than 72 hours. 


FAQ:


1) Does this apply to graduate students or international students?: I have no clue. Does not hurt to apply, that being said, plan for the worst and hope for the best.


2) Where did you get the link from?: Reread the explanation. 


3) Does this apply to incoming freshmen?: No clue, but probably not.",1587507120,3,0

Classes? Co-ops?

\-How many classes should I take for my freshman year w/ co-ops in mind?

\-Is there a set cost for co-ops?

\-How can I pay off student loans using co-op salary?

Potential fall semester ideas,"I'm sure by this point, hearing all the news traveling around of colleges considering an online or postponed fall semester, many of us are freaking out. Of course, even if there is an in person semester, it would look drastically different than before. I was talking to some friends about potential ideas for an in person fall semester that I just wanted to share

* An optional online semester with reduced tuition- if online tuition were reduced, I believe a lot of students would opt for this option, and the people who wanted an in person option could still have it with a less dense class population
* Cancel big lectures above 30 students(or whatever number is appropriate) and make them only online
* Offer live streams of all classes- we all know that a good chunk of college kids skip classes and many students wouldn't attend class if there was a livestream option they could attend
* Split the class and alternate days they can attend in person and those ""off"" in person days can watch a live stream
* For exams, professors could book the bigger lecture halls(which wouldn't be being used if large lectures were cancelled), so that all the students in a class would be able to attend and they'd be well spaced out. 
* Another potential idea for exams is if a professor can book an extra room(unused class, Curry meeting rooms, etc) and have a TA proctor one of the sections
* Enforce max capacities at certain popular locations on campus- Snell, Curry, Marino, etc
* Fewer people in dorms- if there were an online semester with reduced tuition option, there would be fewer people on campus anyways

Of course, if the situation is still just as bad then and the country is still in lockdown, none of this is possible. But if the country at least begins to re-open by then, I truly believe it could be possible to have at least some form of an in person semester with cooperation from everyone involved(administration, faculty, students, parents).

Lmk your thoughts on these ideas- whether you agree, disagree, and whether you have any ideas of your own. If  a lot of people think some of these ideas could work, I'd like to share them with the administration.",1587403100,1,0

I noticed something about Graduate school here..,"In 2017, I earned a BS in engineering here at NEU, and at that time I noticed there were a lot of international students, but balanced well with domestic students.  They all were filthy rich for the reason you'd have to be to study abroad and pay full price unlike domestic in-state.

Fast forward 3 years, I applied to a MS in engineering program, almost instantly admitted.  I attended the virtual admitted students webinar and holy crapperoni, the program chair and student ambassadors, all from south Asia.  And the whole sidebar Zoom chat were names that started but never ended.  50% of the Q and A was talking about Visa sponsorship and international funding.

I laughed and left the room when the admissions rep said no duplicate grad level courses taken at NEU as an undergrad are transferable.  They sure cost the same though when I was an undergrad..

So my conclusion is that graduate studies in engineering here at NEU are supersaturated with people from a subcontinent of Asia, not that there's anything wrong with that, but I can barely understand or accept them olfactorily in the workplace

That's my rant.  There's a lack of diversity in graduate school.  I think i'll keep working in the private sector and slap on an MBA when it's sponsored.",1587394486,1,0

Should I Come here?,"I am scared. NEU has been my top choice for some time now but I am having some serious doubts. I have a pretty neat offer at my state school but I know that their CS program is shitty(shitty professors across the board, a lot of really bitter students, generally unhappy school vibes and like 10% female population within the program).

Still, I would graduate from that school debt free. I also got into their honors college which will put me in 20-40 people classrooms rather than 300 people lecture halls. I am poor lol so NEU gave me a pretty great aid package but still i would graduate 20k in debt (I am not factoring any co-op money into this).  

I know it is what you make it, any college will not be the make or break for my career but I want to know from you guys if it is worth it? Has your experience at NEU been valuable enough to pass up a debt free experience? 

It has been my top choice for the same reason why anybody else who gets in ends up attending: co-op and location. I live in southern suburbs and want to experience big city life. I want work experience before jumping into a career. I love the idea of combined majors (ill probably be requesting a major change if i commit). I also want to be surrounded by motivated people.

A dumb potential freshman,"Hi! I've been looking at NEU as a viable option, as it has the famous co op system. I know 2-3 co ops might mean I can look at 5 years of uni. I'm not really sure how the whole thing works at NEU, so I apologize if I come off as dumb or stupid: but how exactly does this whole co op thing work? Do I have to be an honors student to do co op (I'm not) ? Do I still pay tuition if I'm not at school during the 6 months (is this right?) at co op? What about dorms - do I still get to stay in them or am I kicked out during co ops? How does it happen in the first place? Am I forced to do it? Can I *not* do it? I mean of course, it does seem wise to actually go through the process. Does it affect my tuition? Am I still giving the uni 4 years worth of tuition or 5? 

I apologize again for the dumb-ness; I only got my FA from the uni a few days ago and just started looking at NEU as a real option.

Pass/Fail counterarguments??,"Ik It’s in the past and there has been quite a bit of posts regarding this but what is the rationale against extending the deadline? Or what would be a logical reason not to do it. 

The only thing I could maybe try to muster up was that they wanted to prevent the pass/fail from being a GPA booster. If a student was in a dire situation where they needed to use a pass fail, they had plenty of time to act on it, and therefore there is no reason to extend the deadline. Basically the outlook that the pass/fail is for students who need it rather than for students to cherry-pick which grades they want. 

But I feel like There’s only a limited amount of merit to that argument because what if a student encounters a dire situation within finals week that will affect how they will do on any exams/projects? It assumes students are only using pass/fails to prevent bad grades on their transcripts? Idk I’m not fond of the choice to not extend the deadline and I wish they made some sort of statement trying to justify their decision, however horrible it may be.",1587074140,8,0

PSA: There is no requirement to do *multiple* co-ops,"EDIT: Some programs require multiple co-ops. This does not apply to those programs.

For those of you unsure about your graduation plans and co-op cycles with this crisis, I feel like it’s important to underscore what NU’s experiential learning policy is:

You are required to fulfill **one** form of experiential learning prior to graduation. They can be from any of the following:

-	Co-op
-	Study abroad (including NUin)
-	Dialogue
-	Service learning course
-	Research (needs to have been approved for experiential learning credit by your advisor)

If you have already done one of these and your degree audit says you have fulfilled your experiential learning credit, then **you do not need to do any more co-ops etc**.
