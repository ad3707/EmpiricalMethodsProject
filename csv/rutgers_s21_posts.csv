"Important - If you want Rutgers buses to service Cook campus, please contact IP&amp;O","I posted recently that Rutgers has released their planned schedule for [Fall 2021 bus routes.](https://ipo.rutgers.edu/dots/buses-shuttle) 

These routes will not service Food Sciences, Biel Road, Henderson Apartments, or any of the stops after that which were usually serviced by the EE and F routes. I've contacted people at the transportation services, but they maintain that all planned bus stops are still in walking distance of the entire campus, and that this change won't be disruptive.

Please, if you want these stops to be serviced, contact the transportation services and let them know. They haven't reached out to the campus community proactively, but they may take it into consideration if we reach out to them about it. I think this is important to do, because these changes are unlikely to be just temporary. If Rutgers gets people used to making it to class with these routes (whether that means spending money on parking passes and gas, biking, etc.), they have no incentive to return service to these parts of campus for the next school year. It is highly likely that these temporary routes will become permanent.",1617025336,1,0

I prepared a large yellow envelope with updated transcripts, improved SAT scores, an updated resume, as well as a short letter with my strong desire for them to change their decision.

A few weeks went by and I received a phone call from the admissions office. (Originally I was denied entrance to RBS) The admissions person informed me that they were impressed by my letter and wanted to offer a spot in SAS. I happily accepted and then a year later I transferred into RBS.

The accountability mindset actually has limits.,"Okay bros, listen up. . . I know Jordan B. Peterson is something of a dad-bod for us all, and personal responsibility is a WONDERFUL thing for us all to hold. But. . . It's not the end all be all, and it should not be considered an end in an of itself. . . .It should be wielded as any other item in your ethics / psychological toolbox : A tool. 

Also, you can't ""personal responsibility"" your way out of every situation and It's getting overused as a cudgel to smash criticisms of authority figures. 

Let's do a little game theory, shall we? 100 players, you are the only one taking responsibility for his actions. The other 99 decide to blame somebody else. Among the 100 players, those who have been successfully blamed or have taken responsibility for their failures are executed. You failed and you blamed yourself, so you lost. Well, what is the problem here? Were you just not working hard enough? No, that was the game. The tasks in this game were not made to be done, they were made to make sure you fail. So, you not blaming somebody else in this situation was actually against your interest. 

Do you understand what I am saying? Let me break it down : An organization can actually fail you.

Here is a less game-y example, a toxic environment. 

Imagine you're in a student organization and the members aren't interested in working or doing anything, but they REALLY want eboard positions. You are responsible and ambitious and you also make all of the other members EXTREMELY self-conscious and insecure. 

So what do you do? Do you blame yourself for your inability to lead them? Well, that's what I did for awhile and then I realized : These people didn't want a leader who was better than them, and so they actively undermined me. 

They factionized, started drama, did things behind my back, and that is one of the reasons the Rutgers Real Estate Society failed.

You realize holding others accountable? Isn't just blaming other people for your failures. 

I want to let you guys know? There is going to be a time where your oath to personal responsibility is going to put you into a cognitive trap where you are literally torturing yourself because you weren't charismatic enough to get somebody to do what you asked.

Or you weren't smart enough to pass the test here or there.

Look, the point here? You don't have to take all of it, hold yourself accountable. Yes. But don't try to shoot down everyone else for holding others accountable. 

Also, I'm not gonna lie. . . Ya'll are reading the same damn book. I read the same damn book, and your talk about ""personal responsibility"" during this day and age is getting preachy and annoying. 

Update your manuals.",1611634928,1,0

PSA: RU-Newark Computer Science Majors who minor in math : DO NOT FUCKING TAKE LINEAR ALGEBRA ON THE NEWARK CAMPUS.,"***Backstory :*** 

*tl;dr The higher math classes are built for math majors in mind and prepare math majors, math minors do not have the same kinds of mental blocks and pathways of understanding. It's like : Coding and the essence of computing are augmented by Math, but Coding and the essence of computing do not necessarily augment Math understanding. If you are taking a major in Computer Science and don't want to read this text lengthy backstory, go down to the Value section.* 

So, last semester I learned a lot about the values of professors and 'hard work'. 

Long story short, I failed Linear Algebra. 

I got very emotional about it, and the internet was about as sympathetic as you could expect.

However, one of the reasons I got so riled up about this was the sheer laziness and incompetence my professor. 

It turns out, I'm not the only one who was doing badly in that class, and it's not really hard to see why. 

The professor did not teach us, we taught ourselves. He just judged us on our quizzes and tests.

Now, why is this his fault ? Well, it's like this. . . If you're going to be in the role of professor and tell students to read the book? You should at least have lectures, key points that explain the story of the functions, theorems, etc, when they get used to speed the process up.

We would read 3-4 sections per week with a quiz at the end and each sections homework would have about 30-60 questions each.

Needless to say, I never had enough time. 

The TA's at New Brunswick had opinions : ""Oh you aren't mathematically mature enough"" , ""Oh you werent' ready for this class"", ""Oh you just didn't study efficiently enough."" 

I paid over 1000 dollars to enroll in that class and followed the Newark curriculum. If they don't want to teach their students mathematical maturity, maybe they should stop stressing how important it is outside of classes? No seriously, for something that gets brought up so much in extra hours? It shocks me how professors NEVER touch this subject and how intellectually-dishonest the practice of demanding something you won't teach your students and shaming them for not nurturing them with the means of acquiring it. 

But don't worry, I don't intend to do nothing but complain : I read a few books on how to succeed in Math, needless to say I see what methods do not work and work in studying.

But you've read this far, so now here is the value for you.

***Value -*** 

***Take Linear Algebra at NJIT or Essex County :*** 

The NJIT programme has a curated set of problems that emphasize key-problems that will build understanding in the subject at hand. 

The class is a cross-section with 6 professors you have access to at ALL times for office hours. 

Furthermore, Rutgers Newark will have you going up to chapter 9 of its book which was stability and complex Eigen vectors.

NJIT only consists of 7 chapters. 

But if you need any more reasons to avoid RU-N for Linear Algebra? And Math isn't your strong suit? 

Leonardo Marazzi : [https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2540213](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2540213) 

I forgot the other guy's name, but he is even worse than Marazzi. 

If you take this class at Essex County, this class will be much easier. I have had several people swear by the lack of difficulty in Essex County.

But if you still aren't convinced and want to take it at RU-Newark anyway? 

Read this first PLEASE : [https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU) 

if you don't want to read that, drop it and cross register at NJIT, the math department head will allow it.

If you are a CS Major and a Math Minor and still aren't convinced? Well dude, you have all the tools you have all the warnings, and if you blow it you can't say you weren't warned.",1611608645,1,0

Rutgers Graduation Ceremony üèÜ,,1614897043,1,0
Chance a hopeful freshman,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi! I will be applying to Rutgers in 2023 and I currently reside in NYC so any alumni or people currently attending can give me a good perspective on the competitiveness of Rutgers SAS.

SAT: Took a practice SAT on Khan Academy, took algebra 1 in 8th and Geometry in 9th, I got a 1210. After some studying I project it to be maybe around 1400-ish.

GPA: 96/100 which if I am not mistaken equates to a 3.9. I plan to take honors courses and AP classes, 2 AP classes for each year from now on as well as having honors classes for all other subjects which are weighted higher so I project my weighted GPA to be around 4.1 if I am lucky, of course, and maybe for my AP classes half will be 4 or 5.

EC's: Right now, I am taking a business elective. I am a mentor to Earth Science students. Organizer of a club. Looking to run for student government and possible high level position in my clubs. Looking to possibly gain internships for businesses.

LOR: I believe most of my teachers will have good marks for me because my Earth Science teacher really appreciates my work mentoring students, my guidance counselor emails me a lot about how I am doing very well since I also help her with a lot of stuff. I do mentor a lot of students that need trouble through discord or zoom.

Essay: I am overall very good at essays and will be submitting an essay.",1614892277,1,0

Class Transfers - Not Audited Appropriately,"I have taken a class from an accredited community college that Rutgers works with.

Somehow Rutgers is not giving me credit for a class elective for Web Development  623:321

I doubt a 1-semester class would outweigh a 2-year degree + classes for Web development at Rutgers. 

My guidance counselor refused to contact the auditing department and keeps telling me "" I will learn more here than I ever will have in any other place"" over and over again. Even though the syllabus is the same for the classes. This seems like the system is against me as all info is pass through my counselor and I can't do anything about this.

Treating Self-Injury through Research Study,"Thank you to the moderators of r/rutgers for allowing me to post here!

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). Eligible participants should be staying/living within 60 minutes travel distance of Manhattan (New York, NY, USA) to participate. The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and six sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from your own home‚Äìno in-person visits are required.

Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

The researchers on this team have no conflicts of interest to declare. All study procedures have been approved by the Institutional Review Board for New York State Psychiatric Institute.

Some details about confidentiality and the use of your personal information:

*If you consent to participate in this research, your personal information will be kept confidential and will not be released without your written permission except as described in this section or as required by law. Your name or other identifying information will not be made known if the results of this study are published for scientific purposes.*

*To make your personal research results not be identifiable with you if they are used for publication in the scientific literature and presentation at scientific meetings, we will remove all your identifying information, including name and date of birth.*

*Questionnaire answers and data collected during the task may be used in future studies, and if shared with other investigators, information that identifies the scan, questionnaire responses, or task data with you will be removed before hand. There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality from such data sharing, but this is extremely low as only de-identified data from this study may be shared.*

*Clinical records, including your name and other personal identifying information, and research data will be kept in secure storage at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Information in paper format will be kept in locked files. Electronic data will be protected by a firewall (programming that makes it virtually impossible to access the data from outside the New York State Psychiatric Institute) and by restricting access within the New York State Psychiatric Institute through use of a password known only to authorized personnel. If information is transmitted electronically, it will be encrypted so that your identifying information remains confidential.*

*Records will be available to research staff, and to Federal, State, and Institutional regulatory personnel (who may review records as part of routine audits). Your information will also be available to other authorized individuals, including those at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. There are also legal advocacy organizations that have the authority under New York State law to have access to otherwise confidential subject records, although they cannot disclose this information without your consent.*

And in exchange, we‚Äôll give you the premium version of the app for free. It‚Äôs that simple. Just email us on the App Store page or you could message me here on reddit.

So a little more background here- I actually built B4Grad with the intention of making school simple to organize. I always felt like every professor in my program had a different style of doing things, and I thought an agenda wasn‚Äôt good enough of a tool.

I hope that B4Grad can serve as a good solution to that problem for some of you. Let me know if it has.

Transport at RU New Brunswick,"I am a prospective freshman at RU New Brunswick. I am going to major in biology with the intention of going to medical school after. I am aware that Rutgers offers many on and off-campus research opportunities. Because of this, I planned on bringing a car to campus. But recently I have been advised that parking at Rutgers can get pretty expensive. Is this true? and if so, is it worth bringing a car to campus as a freshman?",1614713084,1,0
I feel stagnant and it sucks,"I know this probably is not the place to post this but I saw a lot of similar posts so I decided why not. I really just need to let this out I don't think any advice in the world is really gonna change things.

I am currently a final semester senior and I really feel stagnant. Like my life just feels stuck in this rut where nothing is changing or going anywhere and everything just feels robotic. At Rutgers before the coronavirus, I have had A LOT of ups and downs and my time here can definitely be seen as a roller coaster. One moment I have the best moment of my college life and the next I get stressed or anxious over some social situation or the next midterm or something. But looking at it now, I am not even mad about that roller coaster period. I enjoyed how dynamic everything in college was and how quickly situations could change. Life was really just so much more interesting. I miss randomly joining some club or trying out for some frat just because I just felt like it and I saw their thing at the Livi Student Center. Or something like how one day I was feeling like shit and I met up some friend randomly at Alex and we just went to tango classes together and I felt great afterwards. Idk there was just something spontaneous about everything and now that is just gone. 

Like sure I had bright spots and extremely dark moments in the past but now everything is just gray. And I feel like this grayness is somehow worse than even the worst moments I had in the past. Nowadays I just force myself to attend online lectures and do the assignments and sometimes (partially cause I don't really like my major that much) I don't even do that and there are 1 or 2 classes I am so behind in and just stopped caring about. I spend almost all of my time on my room now watching Netflix or playing ps5 by myself when before I could just randomly hit up a list of friends and see which one of them was free and we would do something interesting. I used to think that this stagnance was cause by me just living in my parents house but this December I moved off campus to New Brunswick and the stagnance still remains. It now just feels like I just changed my room at my parents place to my room in New Brunswick but otherwise my routine has stayed mostly the same. 

And I would not say I'm completely lonely but nowadays I only hang out with a very select group of friends (Covid precautions and just that I'm closest to these people) that I could count on my hands and I have not met anyone new in ages. I basically now just see the same few faces all the time, do the same things all the time, and just go about my day waiting for it to end. Everything in my life has become this boring routine and nothing interesting has gone on. Even just going to lecture back in the day at Tillett or the academic building just had a feel to it that if I had it today would automatically make my day 10x more interesting. Hell even the girl I like and one of the very few people I see I have now seen so much and nothing is moving forward at all, although not really backwards either (stagnating here too) that I'm kinda getting bored and losing feelings for her too. Add to that the fact that I'm still scared of what job I'm gonna have after I graduate and life just sucks. 

And ngl, I don't even want to start working and leave college and be an adult, especially if adulting is like this which is what I have heard. I am not really into the profession that I've studied for and I feel like this stagnance will just continue and get bigger with my job and when I'm an adult. How can I possibly make new friends and meet so many people my age randomly the way I would at Rutgers? I have always heard that's a major struggle after college, especially separating new friends with linkedin connection types. Wouldn't my life just get more routine and boring? I just wanna go back to what Rutgers was like my freshman-junior years which sucks because of course that is impossible. 

I get it it's stupid and probably not worth posting here and I def sound like a whiny child but it's just something I'd been feeling for a while now.",1614711582,1,0

I transferred to the business school and degree navigator shows that I don't have any pre-business requirements covered.,"During my time at SAS, I did many classes, including calc 151 and CS 111. On the degree navigator for pre-business, it says that these courses do not satisfy the requirements of calc 135 and computer applications for business ( *01:198:170* ).   


What is conflicting to me is what the transfer form says:  
 The six required pre-business courses are:  
 ‚Ä¢ 01:640:135 Calculus I for Life and Social Sciences or ***01:640:151 Calculus I for Math/Physics***  
 ‚Ä¢ 01:220:102 Introduction to Microeconomics

 ‚Ä¢ 01:960:285 Introductory Statistics for Business or 01:960:401 Basic Stats for Research  
 ‚Ä¢ 33:010:272 Introduction to Financial Accounting (not open to first year students)

Has anyone done a data analysis of how lottery numbers distribute?,"So, to clarity I myself am in no way mathematically capable to pull this off. 

But I have my theories on how lottery numbers are sent out (RaNdOmiZeD). 

1. Students with higher tuitions get better numbers 

2. Upperclassmen are given lower numbers while lower class men don‚Äôt have seniority so housing can never be fully transparent 

3. How different majors get have numbers that peak at certain ranges

The Conclusion to the NJPIRG/Targum Investigations,"Good afternoon. I'm here to present to the public the second and what I hope is the last investigative report on NJPIRG/Targum in relation to University Policy 10.3.3.  


I broke my promise of having this report finished and released by the end of winter break due to unforeseen personal commitments and more information to comb through. Then spring semester hit (lol) and I, as many of us have, got overwhelmed with schoolwork. Obtaining source documents, vetting leads, and following up on NJPIRG stuff took longer than I had anticipated. Writing this report was much more difficult than the NJPIRG report given the sensitive nature of the Targum and the need to avoid any appearances of me encouraging the dissolution of the paper; accusations that were leveled at the first report. 

Let me make it very clear from the start: this report makes no comment on the \*necessity\* of the Targum paper. The focus of the report is to only examine the Targum's relationship and usage of Policy 10.3.3. There is a lot more material out there that could be written on the Targum but was not included since it was not strongly related to the focus of the report. 

There are 8 sections to this [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lAlGkPqCqwXY21EKGwWbt6luvzNLCaoMZwxQAHV6fPM/edit?usp=sharing). 

1. Preface
2. Non-Compliance to University Policy
3. Referendum Practices and Oversight Issues
4. Referendum Voting Results (2019)
5. Refund vs Negative Check-off
6. The Finances
7. Reforms
8. Final Conclusions

For the best viewing experience, please look at it on a computer. Formatting and pictures are super wonky on mobile. I know, the report is 10 pages but I think this one is much more easier to read than the first one flow-wise. 

The final conclusions that I reached are nearly identical to the ones I made in the NJPIRG report: reforms to Policy 10.3.3 are long overdue and urgently needed. If left untouched, existing controversies surrounding referendum operations will only continue to fuel animosity towards the organizations in question. Strengthened oversight and updated referendum operation provisions would protect students from unchecked spending by outside organizations while ensuring accountability in regards to where student funding is going. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please, share this with as many people you know via other platforms. As an anonymous individual, there is only so much I can do while maintaining my anonymity for my own protection. 

Once again, I would like to thank everyone for their time and support. I will now take your questions, comments, and concerns.

Rutgers seems to have incurred the wrath of the Hindu community,"This is just an information post to bring awareness to this issue which seems to be more serious than I initially gave it credit for (as someone who passively pays attention to broader Rutgers news). Of course though Twitter and social media does have this ability to make things seem much more dire than they are.

Background-- Prof at Rutgers Newark, Audrey Trushke, has been accused (and over a long time now) of anti-Hindu sentiment/academic work and for various reasons it's reached a peak over the last few days. I'm not going to judge whether or not that is true as I have no right or stake in this, but her work and Rutgers Newark's public response which both expresses support for her and support for Hindu students (seen as not enough) has angered both right-wing Hindu Nationalist groups and non right-wing general religious groups (though there seems to be much more fervor in the former). The hashtag #/RacistRutgers was even moderately trending on Twitter the other day and people are still using it. The Tweets are wild. Many from big accounts in the Hindu-Indian community across the political spectrum.

Anyway... just figured I'd drop this here where it seems relevant. So that if it was to reach a bigger level you all aren't surprised. It's a big deal with some even trying to get India's government to publicly condemn and blacklist Rutgers for Indian students (though I don't think that is a remote possibility, so). But regardless of the international implications, given New Jersey's massive Indian and Hindu population there is great weight to this situation regardless.

I also got an email saying I was invited into the Honors program/college for SAS, but no information on whether there was something special I had to do to accept. Is that just an automatic thing? Or is there something else I have to do as well. 

I also wasn't able to activate my NetID yet because it wasn't accepting my RUID and I don't know my SSN so I have to ask my folks later.

Unable to Fulfill SAS WCr/WCd in Same Class,"Supposed to graduate in May, but I think the RU screw finally caught up with me. Looking through Degree Navigator today I saw that I have an SAS core requirement left unfulfilled which was very strange. However, after reading the obscure notes within the requirement I realized my mistake. A class that I am taking this semester is supposed to fulfill the WCr and WCd requirement, however according to DN you cannot fulfill both with the same class which leaves me with an incomplete requirement even after the completion of the semester. A little pissed to say the least. Every advisor I've spoken to has said ""Ok... so just take &lt;class I am taking this semester&gt; and you'll be all good"". At the same time, I wish I checked earlier since they send so many emails to seniors saying ""cHeCk DeGrEe NaViGaToR"" but I thought it was a glitch or it just needed to update.

"Tips site for Rutgers students (finding major, social life, specific major-related)?","Hey everyone! I'm a rising junior who's lurked a ton on this subreddit and I've been seeing some really great advice from graduating seniors. I've been building websites recently and thought it'd be really great to have a website specifically for any Rutgers student to give advice based on their experiences- Ex: senior on why they chose a major and tips for it, sophomore on how to make friends, junior on navigating internships, freshman on balancing online school.

As an ex-Undecided who's switched my major over five times I would've loved to look at advice from people on how they chose their major. With this, people can post blog-style stories and tips.

Reddit is an awesome place and there's a ton of great advice here but it can be hard to find specific advice sorted by category. This site would be an easy place to search for all sorts of advice which would be incredibly helpful for incoming freshmen and a great way for seniors to share their experiences and paths, and be a great way to give back to the community by sharing tips you have without worrying about spamming the reddit feed and interrupting useful questions. Course Reddit would still be super helpful, especially for asking questions rather than volunteering tips.

It'd be sign up with scarlet mail but anonymous and you could choose what you say. Ex: Sophomore Psych major, why I chose Psych. 

Thinking of calling it The LX in memory of our departed, beautiful, tuition-granting, drunken-AC-dripping bus, but definitely don't want to launch if it's a stupid idea. Lemme know what you think! I can definitely launch it by end of week and check it out if it seems like a cool idea.

Sorry for long post.

**tldr:** **website for Rutgers tips to help incoming freshmen and anyone else. Unlike reddit, would be blog style experiences and guides that can be saved and searched by category.**

Some Parting Thoughts From a Recent (very) Alumni:,"As somebody who has just walked across the virtual Zoom stage, I'm honestly filled with a bunch of mixed emotions. Up until last night, I had never fully grappled with the idea that my academic career was coming to a close. I feel that many, especially during this pandemic and through virtual learning, have been trying to focus on our degrees and classes in a manner that distracts us from ever having to acknowledge the fact that we're actively missing out on so much along the way to the finish line. 

I have personally never posted on this sub, but I have been passively observing the comments of others over the prior months and years. As a sophomore year transfer student, my time at RU (physically) was brief, but important. While I too used, my immersion into academic work as a pseudo-distraction, it's equally important that we use the time we have now to reflect thoughtfully, and express how we genuinely feel for the sake of others, as well as for our own mental well-being, now that our journey has come to an abrupt end.

So, I have decided to share some of my ""lessons"", to hopefully encourage those who will have an opportunity to physically engage with RU in the near future, to make the most of their oh so limited time. 

1. **Focus on your Social Life:** Your classes are priority #1, and there's no denying that. Ultimately, we're at RU to prepare us for the next stage of our life, meaning that our performance in the classroom certainly matters. However, focusing on your school work too heavily, will leave you isolated. Trust me. As somebody who just graduated *Summa Cum Laude*, my biggest regret was constantly making excuses as to why I *only* had time for my school work. Yes, my GPA probably helped me to get interviews with various companies, and ultimately land a job, but you know what? 99% of my talks with recruiters revolved around explaining my experiences; internships, extracurriculars, meaningful collegiate endeavors, etc. Your grades definitely matter, but for most jobs and occupations, they aren't what will land you a job. Join clubs, club sport teams, build genuine relationships with professors, go out on that Thursday night. In the end, it is what your time at RU is all about. Focus on the entire pie rather than just that single slice.  Like me, you'll regret leaving here if you don't embrace everything RU has to offer, even if it means you have to dig to find it.
2. **Do the Things that Make you ""Uncomfortable"":** It's really easy in college to become entrenched within a routine. wake up, quick breakfast, wait at the bus stop for 20 minutes, stand squished next to 500 other students while on the bus, find your class building, sit in lecture, repeat steps 2 &amp; 3 about 3 more times, get lunch at some point, eventually make it back to your dorm/apartment, have dinner (maybe?), rinse and repeat. There's comfort in routine and repetitiveness. The monotony doesn't seem so bad when it's leading to ""success"", right? But if you're getting A's on exams when operating in this manner, are your genuinely leading a successful life? Similarly to how GDP isn't a strong indicator of a country's success for the sake of serving each and every individual properly, receiving A's on your transcript doesn't mean that you're doing what's best for yourself, with regards to all facets of life. So, get ""comfortable being uncomfortable"". Do the things you aren't sure will fit into your schedule...trust me, they will. Humans, and especially college students are constantly forced to adapt to unexpected circumstance, which means that it's not a matter of ""if you have the time"", but *will you* make the time. This obviously relates back to my first point, but your social life and extracurriculars shouldn't be perceived as ""extra"", instead they are essential, in the same way spontaneity and flexibility are when cultivating a meaningful college experience.  
3. **Take a Deep Breath &amp; Enjoy the Micro-Interactions:** As students, we are systematically programmed to constantly operate with chronic foresight. This means always looking ahead, rarely enjoying the current moment, and certainly not reflecting on the past. However, with each new respective phase of life, I find myself idealizing the future, yearning for the past, and never enjoying the present. The problem with this is inevitably, our present becomes our past, whether we want it to or not. And, what will stand out above all else, are the random and seemingly obsolete past moments. Sitting at a dining hall table with a few friends, that time a buddy made you spit out your drink with a hilarious comment that then becomes an inside joke, a couple of mental screenshots from that ""crazy night"" last weekend, heck, even walking along College Ave on a spring afternoon. Our ""memories"" only exist, because whether we're aware of it our not, they represent something valuable, and often, they're unsuspecting. So enjoy these moments, no matter how insignificant they might seem, before they become memories. 

To the rest of my class of '21 graduates, I know this was a less than ideal way to wrap up our time at RU, but be thankful for some of the times, memories, and friendships that you did make, because it's better to have experienced some joy along this journey, than to leave with nothing at all.

Aresty RA Position,"Hello,

I am wondering if anyone else has not heard back from any of their Aresty project applications. I feel like it's probably a rejection at this point, but with them extending the deadline I felt like I might have had some hope. Someone I talked to just got an interview offer this weekend, so that's why I feel like there may be a slim chance. I emailed all of my professors for my project like 2-3 times each and I have not received any responses. It would be nice to at least receive a response from them just to know the status of my application. Is anyone else in the same position or know how else I can contact the professors",1621219353,1,0

Farewell,"As I sit here writing this I am overcome with so many emotions. Firstly, I am incredibly grateful. I am grateful for my family especially my parents for believing in me and supporting me for my entire life. I am grateful to my 5 wonderful closest friends who have helped me more than they will ever know over the past four years and to all the other friends I've made along the way who I've come to know and love here. I am also grateful for the professors I had who made learning exciting and helped me find my way when I was lost.

I am incredibly frustratingly disappointed as well. No one is to blame for COVID. Sometimes shit happens. But in the past 15 months, there has been a tremendous catastrophic failure or outright lack of leadership at every level. I learned this year as an Org. officer that leadership is hard. It is about making the right decision at the right time and understanding that no matter what path you choose you will not be able to please everyone. However, the one rule that you must follow is to be empathetic and shape your decisions around what the people affected most would want. You definitely cannot be self-serving in any way whatsoever. That is exactly what that shitshow of a commencement today and every decision surrounding graduation from the University Administration has been: self-serving. At every turn, they have decided to be low-effort, lazy, and self-aggrandizing for achieving the most basic and simple of tasks. The Chairman of the Board of Governors, mere seconds after dedicating the occasion to us, the graduates, goes on a minutes-long speech about all the things President Holloway has accomplished since coming to Rutgers. Last I checked, President Holloway is not the one graduating. In fact, most if not all graduates have been at longer and dedicated more to this University than he has. The commencement speaker was a shocking surprise. For a 2-time U.S. Poet Laureate, I expected sage words to inspire us in our future endeavors. Instead, we got an exhaustive honestly depressing diatribe on the history of racial injustice in America. As a history major, I understand the importance of what she said about historical blindness and amnesia. A graduation ceremony was not the platform to speak on such things and just shows her own blindness to the meaning of the occasion. The biggest takeaway I got from her speech is that life sucks and ""nature is indifferent"" to you. Is that really the message you want to give to a class of graduates that have suffered and struggled more than any other class in decades? Her speech was a personal reflection on her own struggles and feelings rather than a celebration and parting words to the graduates. Ultimately, her speech was about her and not about us. Unsurprisingly, the speech I connected to the most and felt was the least self-serving was the one given by a fellow student, RUSA President Nick LaBelle. It is truly sad when the mention of a lobster is the most uplifting part of a graduation ceremony (All Praise to Lord Snipp).

Much has been taken from us but that is not what we should be focusing on today. Today is a day of celebration. Congratulations to all 2021 graduates! I have to disagree with Ms. Trethewey. My nature is not indifferent. Despite the challenges ahead for all of us, I can't help but be incredibly hopeful for what's to come. My nature drives and compels me to work towards being a part of a brighter future.

I will be staying at Rutgers for one more year for Grad school so this isn't really farewell yet for me just goodbye for now. The classes of 2020, 2021, and every class that has suffered over these last 15 months deserves better.  But the only way we'll be able to make it better is if we become better and do it ourselves. Congratulations again and good luck to you all.

Sincerely,

A 2021 Rutgers Graduate

natasha trethewey was not good,"idk i feel like commencement this year was just so underwhelming and bad. i understand that there wasn't too much time to plan an in-person one so with that issue aside, the least they could've done was gotten a cool speaker. between holloway, her, and nick labelle, it's sad to say that an actual student nick labelle literally had the best/most relatable speech. she was just talking about her parents and racism and stuff (and these are definitely important topics that should be discussed), but frankly i do not know or care about her family and it simply is not relevant on our graduation day. hardly anything she said pertains to us, and she was just so boring. i can't believe we went from having people like obama, queen latifah (@newark), and anita hill (@camden) to this boring presentation. also no hate to natasha i guess, this was just such a disappointing event. anyone feel similar?",1621205118,1,0

Alpha Kappa Delta Phi are FAKE (Asian greek life),"Their recent class just crossed and I want to warn them and everyone of what they are joining.

These sisters are all for clout. The pictures, the videos, the comments, the relationships are all fake. I used to be good friends with a couple of the sisters and contemplated on joining in the past but as semesters passed and I learned more about the sisters, it became clear to me their motive. They don't care about the rushes, the relationships, or each other. I would hear all this drama of how they do not like each other and how they would shame one another behind their backs. 

Recently a sister got kicked out of the sorority for being associated with a PI brother who was accused of SA. The sisters made a public statement condoning the sister and the brother's actions, saying how it was unacceptable. Shortly after, another PI brother was accused of SA on their chapter IG (now taken down) on one of their posts (actually on the post they addressed the 1st brothers SA), and the sister that is associated with him is currently president of Alpha Kappa Delta Phi.

Questions about Newark to NB transfers and the Animal Sciences degree at NB,"So I'm a first-gen college student and this has been rough. I dropped out of HS years ago so my entry into college has been a little rough. I got accepted into Newark this spring but long story short I am trying to study to either become a Zoologist or perhaps a Vet, something along those lines. Although I can major in Biology at Newark I saw there is an Animal Sciences major at SEBS and I think it would be FAR better since my interest is animals (mostly mammalian).   
Transfer:  
I currently have 16 credits, rounding out the semester with a 3.5+ GPA, and will take another 8 in the summer, as I have been told by counselors that I will need 24 credits to do a school-to-school transfer to NB. My question is, how and when can I start the process of doing the transfer? I won't have my 24 credits until the end of the summer session and I don't want to apply too late. Can I start the transfer now with the ""promise"" of keeping my GPA and that I will complete these classes? (I am signed up already) Furthermore, is it a guaranteed acceptance since it's Rutgers to Rutgers so long as I have the GPA? Anyone else do this? Side note the commute alone would be halved if I go to NB once classes go back to in-person.  
If you transferred from Newark to NB for a science degree, do you think there was any difference in the classes/equipment? Some of my friends have told me to just finish my first 2 years (and core classes) at Newark and transfer later when the classes start to focus beyond the basic biology/chem etc. 

  
Honors classes:  
I also have a question about Honor classes, as I saw you basically applied after your first semester but I will be attending (hopefully) SEBS in the fall and by then I will be a Sophomore, so I don't know how that works out. I also saw there were some required classes you needed to take as a freshman. If anyone can explain to me how this all works I'd appreciate it.  


Animal Sciences Major:  
Finally, if anyone took (or is taking) this major I'd really like to talk to you about what you thought of it. What career did you end up in after your Bachelor's? How would you describe the degree? Was it what you thought it would be like? Do you feel it gave you the right tools for the career of your choice? If your interest was zoology like mine, then I'd love to hear more about that too.   


I literally just jumped in headfirst into this whole thing because I have been dragging my feet for too long, with no help and no idea what I'm doing, hoping if I keep my head up and get good grades everything will work out lol. I'm more than willing to put in the effort and work, that doesn't phase me, I just really want to be as informed as possible so I can get the best out of my education (hello debt) and not miss out on anything or make costly mistakes.",1617945409,1,0
I got the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone would find this useful, but I want to share my experience with the vaccine. I‚Äôve been asked why I chose to get it, and my reasons are...

1.) It is a one shot and done vaccine, that way I don‚Äôt have to wait another month for my second dose.
2.) The efficacy is still really good for preventing moderate illness. Also, there is a 100% efficacy from preventing severe illness (like the other vaccines).

Getting the shot didn‚Äôt take long at all, as I got it from a vaccine ‚Äúsuper-center.‚Äù Waited for about 15 minutes afterward, then left.

Later that night, I did develop a fever of 101 degrees, along with chills. The fever and chills receded the next day. My arm wasn‚Äôt terribly sore, about as much as any other vaccine.

My brothers did have worse side-effects, with a slightly higher fever, chills, body aches, and drowsiness. They did have the side-effects for the entirety of the day. 

All in all, the side-effects do suck, but once it‚Äôs done, that is all. Hopefully someone can find this helpful if they are considering getting the J&amp;J vaccine.",1617944708,1,0
Make me like/dislike Rutgers NB,"Hello! I hope your day is going swell. If you couldn‚Äôt tell based on the title, I‚Äôm a confused HS senior lol.

I live near the New Brunswick Campus. Everyone at school would say bad things about Rutgers and how it was a ‚Äúbad school‚Äù because it was trendy to do so. Literally everyone else in my life praises Rutgers because of their rankings.

I‚Äôm not a person who completely believes in trends or rankings. By the looks of it, I am probably going to commit to RU-NB: SAS as a premed student.

I tried to do my own research but it‚Äôs one thing to see stuff online and another to actually be enrolled in the college.

What are some pros about the school? What are the cons? (This question can pertain to academics but also the establishment itself and the facilities)",1617943145,1,0

Controversial but I just need to say it.,"I‚Äôm in the major of Human Resource Management. There are some great professors in this department, but there are a lot of terrible ones, truly truly terrible. Maybe others here in HRM can agree, many professors are in the profession of weeding out in this major. But HR majors are going into a field where they will be relied on to protect employees and workers and often times, I feel, we are being taught by people who shouldn‚Äôt be in the careers they are teaching classes on. One person in particular I want to talk about was a professor who teaches various classes on HRM and labor studies and leads Internships in HR. She was extremely difficult to learn from. Everything was opinion based with her and she was extremely biased with students. She graded all of her students based on how well she liked them or even by their race (in my opinion). There were many international students in the specific class Of hers I took in 2019. She would split the entire class into groups and had us all sit together, the international students formed into a group together, I‚Äôm not sure if that was on the professors accord or if they just decided to be a group, but they were all in one group. My group sat behind them. The professor would randomly ask groups questions as we went on in class and she often picked on the international student group. They had trouble coming up with fast answers because of the language barrier, and she used this to make fun of them. She would tap her foot, Roll her eyes, and make remarks about how well or unwell they were paying attention in her opinion. The only reason they took a while to answer most times was because she would call on them randomly out of nowhere, more than most other groups. She even yelled at one of them once because the student was talking to the person next to them, because they didn‚Äôt understand something the professor said,I presume, and was trying to get help with translation. I worked with this group once on an assignment we were doing in class, they were really nice and were doing better than I was in class, some of them were just seemingly extremely uncomfortable in the class because of how awful the professor was to them. It was just odd. And a lot of the other students chimed in with the professor to make fun of these students, some of the girls in the gross cliche-like group I was stuck in would make comments like ‚Äúomg if they can‚Äôt speak English why did they come here‚Äù as if the students couldn‚Äôt hear her. It was more than just calling on them to catch them off guard, when they did their big end of the semester presentation, they did it really well, but they had to take extra time when it came to public speaking because it was a bit harder for them. The professor timed us and wouldn‚Äôt let us go over a specific time limit, and she made fun of them the entire time they attempted to give their presentation. She sneered at them and snickered. Her facial expressions were purely hateful. When I got up to do my part of my groups presentation, she gave me similar looks when I stumbled on my words and sweated with anxiety, this only made me do worse on my presenting. I can‚Äôt imagine someone like this being in charge of so much in the departments of HRM and Labor studies. This is not the type of person who should be teaching people how to train and develop future employees for any company. I know nobody wants to pay attention to it, but rate my professor is pretty accurate in telling how a professor truly is.",1617928596,1,0

Complaint on Professor: Daijiro Okada,"I am taking Intermediate Microeconomics. I am 2 weeks into this class and I already feel overwhelmed. I've been through my share of terrible professors (esp the ones in the chemistry department) and so far I have not encountered any like Okada.

His lectures are long, confusing, boring, and mostly...  COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT to the graded assignments, which include the obnoxiously 25 OEQ homework, the weekly 45 minute quiz, and the god knows how long WEEKEND test since it hasn't released yet. Like seriously... since when do professors literally not cover a portion of content you're tested on in massive amounts? Even Organic Chemistry prepared you better.

Not to mention, the fuckin study plan. I myself am a math person but I don't know how to cope with this work load or how to learn anything since he is literally so off-the-boat. I am so stressed out thinking about what a semester with him might entail.

His lectures are completely online, his office hours don't work for me, his explanation and teaching style is useless, and he never is able to cover the scope of complexity our graded questions require. There is so much content his lecture itself does not cover.

And I think this alone could be grounds to file a formal complaint on him. I'm not sure what to do. There's no one to consult for help or feeling that it'll improve since it genuinely gets more insane by the week. I am considering dropping but I am worried about taking a W and getting less credits done for the semester; but this man genuinely strikes me as psychotic. He outsourced his entire course to an Online Textbook and does literally nothing... why does he sit so high on a pedestal?

Does it get better? Should I drop out? I have a GPA to guard for medical school.",1612422530,0,0
The MOST Underrated Food Joints Near Campus by a (slightly less cynical) Senior Foodie,"Hey guys! You might remember me from yesterday when I pissed the living daylights out of this subreddit by exclaiming hersey on subreddit darlings RUHungry and Krispy Pizza. Now that I have gotten all that negativity out of my system, I have decided to broker peace negotiations by recommending some overlooked food spots near campus!

Obviously I can't exactly call any spots on Easton as ""underrated"" as everyone walks by them on a semi regular basis. Therefore, I have decided to split this list up into two sections: walking distance and driving distance. For the driving options, I decided to keep my radius at North Brunswick above Route 1, Somerset, Piscataway, and Southwest Edison aka a max 10 min drive. Here it goes!

**Walking Distance**-

**Scarlet 158**(*Louis St*): 
This might seem like a cop out to some of the upperclassmen but we gotta keep the love going for the underclassmen. Basically a few years ago, there was a post that went viral talking about how the owner wanted to Rutgers Students to share the word about their restaurant. From there spawned a massive trend of students taking selfies eating at the place and sharing it to social media (something I also partook in). That being said, this place is still pretty unknown to those who don't know about that trend and has some extensively high quality options, ranging from a killer Chai latte, to the ""Scarlet California"" egg dish, to their cheesesteaks. They also started selling authentic Mexican food there and while I have not tried it, I'd trust it. 

**Cambo Box**(*George Street*):
Why do I never hear about this place? Not everything is super authentic, but everything is super tasty and a great primer on Cambodian Cuisine. Did I mention it was fucking delicious? If you need somewhere to start, I'd pick the lemongrass steak rice box.

**Caribbean Cafe**(*Bayard Street*): 
Super affordable, super warm and homey atmosphere, and a great place to get absolutely massive portions for cheap. They got a lunch special that they usually run into dinner that loads you up with rice, beans, side salad, and a meat. For meat I'm usually rotating between Pernil and Pollo Guisado.

**La Ponce√±a**(*Joyce Kilmer Ave*):
Definitely on the edge of being able to walk there, although the exercise will be necessary for the amount you will eat. With Puerto Rican food, I'm a simple man: I see pernil, I eat pernil.

**Driving Distance**-

**Fusion Mexican Restaurant**(*North Brunswick*):
I'll be honest, there's about 10 or so restaurants that go neck and neck with this in NB and they all deserve our money. If anything, this whole congressional district of NJ is really a hotbed for solid Hispanic cuisine altogether. No particular favorite here, although Carne Asada anything is usually a good bet for those trying to wean themselves off of Chipotle and Tacoria. Support your local small businesses!

**USA Fried Chicken**(*New Brunswick*):
Just a quick warning for all y'all folks here that this absolute UNIT of a shop is in a not so fun part of NB, so definitely pull up with numbers and revel in the most mouth watering, crispy, juicy fried chicken you've had in central NJ. Yes, you will feel like a vegetable after eating here. No, there were no vegetables in your meal.

**Thai Lanna**(*Somerset*):
First of all, RIP THAI NOODLE! Definitely the worst tragedy of the pandemic alongside Neubies imo. That being said, Thai Lanna will do a great job of filling the void (even if you have to drive). Their Red Curry is super flavorful, and I also love their Pad Gra Pow. Honorable mention to Pad Thai Restaurant in Highland Park which is almost as good.

**China Star**(*Highland Park*):
There's ""meditating in the Himalayas"" finesse Chinese cuisine, and then there's ""shotgunning 3 nattys with the boys"" takeout Chinese. China Star is the latter, and it does a damn good job at it. They are the epitome of MIN-MAXING their value proposition with MIN cost and MAX MSG, the perfect combo of every takeout Chinese place. They got a family pack, which feeds 4 for like $20. Get that and profit my fellow college students. 

**Happy Lamb Hot Pot (Formerly Little Sheep)**(*Edison*):
This is hands down the best hot pot you can get around campus. That being said, it seems to have changed management recently, although the reviews have continued to be positive. There's always deals running around that place, and I highly recommend y'all avail them! Just be careful about indoor dining.

**Delhi Garden**(*Edison*):
I lived in India for four years of my adolescence. When I say this shit tastes like some authentic roadside dhaba, I fucking mean it. It tastes like someone pissed aids into it and then mixed the butter chicken with their bare fucking hands. Except they haven't so I won't be on the toilet for a week straight (just one bad night of masala lol). Literally get anything from here it'll slap. For the adventurous ones may I suggest trying Fresh Lime Soda, it's a bit of an acquired taste but it's salty, sweet, tangy, and refreshing all in one! They also got new york style platters (like halal guys) which they make with chicken and paneer Tikka. Dare I say it, the folks go head to head with New York Halal carts in taste. Do NOT miss this, if you go to one place on this list go here. There's massive wait times for a reason. 

My days here are limited and I'm gonna miss the shit out of this place. Before I leave I have a favor to ask: does anyone know any good authentic and affordable Italian food around here? I been looking and I have a car so I'm happy to drive around. Thanks for hearing me out, I hope y'all like these places!",1612421501,171,1

The MOST Overrated Food Spots On/Near Campus by a (Very Cynical) Senior Foodie :),"Hey y'all shoutout u/inochimaru for such a wonderful and extensive list of great food spots at Rutgers. I've feeling really combative lately and thought why not spread some hate for some places that I think make absolutely mid food!

*Dislcaimer*: The best way to figure out whether my list is facts is if you try these places. Support your small businesses during COVID-19!

**RU Hungry**: The absolute KING of overrated cuisine. It's been on TV, but half the pizzerias on Easton make cheaper, fresher, and tastier fat sandwiches. Neubies used to be my go to but they permanently closed :(. Instead, I recommend Gio's! Also if you have a car, go to Hoagie Haven in Princeton for an ""Ivy League Fat Sandwich"" that you can even enjoy sober!

**Krispy Pizza**: What does everyone see in this place? The pizza is flavorless and tastes like cardboard, I'd rather eat at a chain like Domino's. I urge y'all to take the time to walk to easton and go to Daniel's for some absolutely elite Margherita or Vodka slices. PJ's is decent too, and Gio's is an absolute unit when you're trashed on a Saturday night.

**Tacoria**: I'm sorry sororities, but this ain't it chief. Their tacos are instagrammable but their quality of ingredients is meh at best and it's super overpriced for what you're getting (slightly better Chipotle). I'd rather get a $5 box from taco bell, and I highly recommend literally any of the authentic Mexican places around New Brunswick. If you got a car, absolutely take the time to do the 20 minute drive to Taqueria Maria in Monroe. 

**Surreal Creamery**: Why the fuck do I have to pay $8 for stale cereal and flavorless ice cream that makes me look like the cookie monster? I will admit that their bubble tea is decent (Although Gong Cha is considerably better) and that the ice cream looks really pretty, but please go to Thomas Sweets for some really diabetes, artery clogging dessert (their fudge is underrated). 

**Mamouns**: Someone called Halal Guys ""basic bitch halal"", and that made me spiral into an uncontrollable rage during my 3 hour long 8:40am class on a Wednesday. Tbh Halal Guys has annoyed the shit out of me with their constant price raises but at the same time it's still leagues better (and still cheaper) than Mamouns. Mamouns is the real basic bitch halal with flavorless meat, stale pita, and an absolutely garbage hot sauce. If you want something a bit more authentic, I recommend Efes or Evelyn's on Easton.

**Dashen**: Sorry guys, I love how homemade it tastes but it's so fucking overpriced man. If I'm eating food that tastes homemade I'm paying like $12 tops. I wish there was other Ethiopian cuisine around here and I'm open to suggestions!

**Redd's**: Never been here, just wanted to put them on blast for constantly violating COVID-19  restrictions. Fuck the business, and fuck the people who go here.

**Hansel n Griddle**: Yet another place that just gets traffic because it's a big name with a big sign. I can literally make their entire menu better at home. Just go to Scarlet 158 or Fritz's.

Please give the above places some business (even if I won't) and argue with me in the comments! I will continue to update this list.

Edit: Loving the arguments, this was way more controversial than I could ever imagine! Just a clarification, when I talk about fast food (Taco Bell, Domino's) I tend to crave that separate to ""real food"", which I consider the above options to all be. So when I say that I'd rather eat taco bell, I'm not directly comparing the quality of it to tacoria cuz I don't eat Taco Bell in place of it (I don't even eat much fast food lol)

Someone planned to take my idle housing spot but got yelled by roommates and VERVE didnt do anything? Am i crazy?," Currently not in America but have to pay rent for **VERVE** housing

While last week a girl went there to sign the lease and take a visit in house but got yelled by girls there, threatened her if she live in there they would give cold shoulders and not allow she to use any space here... Actually a threaten happened in renting housing since they **enjoy my idle space** and god knows what they doing there! (I never met roommates and contacted with them, basically strangers not haters)

And VERVE just didn't do anything even not willing to change room saying there's no free spot?? I saw so many people subleting their housing on VERVE, it's actually a lier. They keep lying to several calls by the girl. When I went there and said I know groups of people didn't live in there, they suddenly changed and said ""ok we will change a room for you"" which happened on five days later and that girl didn't want to take my housing anymore (very reasonable choice, and the girl is very nice)

How they just letting those girls roommates in housing actually threaten newcomer?? And I really stuck at my lease, it's so hard to find someone else finding housing in Feb... I don't know what to say to those **liers** and what to do for rent fee in next months....",1612322338,9,0

The Best Food Spots On/Near Campus From a Senior Foodie,"Foodies, freshman, transfers, hell upper classmen too,  gather 'round for a world tour adventure of in my experience, what is the best food places near Rutgers in my 4 years here. An unusual post but hopefully really useful when you get tired of the dining hall, going on a date, or just love food like me. I hope you appreciate it and lets get started!

**Halal:** *Crown Fish &amp; Chicken Halal.* You cant get food like this where im from so take my opinion lightly, but this place is way better than Halal Guys and their fried chicken is tasty too.   
**Recommended Dish:** Lamb and Chicken Rice Platter. 

**Vegan:** *Veganized*. Prices are a little high but if youre looking for a great vegan restaurant, this is it. **Recommended Dish:** Deluxe Burger, Crispy Fries, and Blueberry Soda

**Japanese:** *Edo &amp; Ramen Nagomi*. Edo is a hidden gem with an anime influenced interior. They have japanese sides and huge rice bowls loaded with toppings like fried crab and Katsu Chicken. Its got a great vibe and is pretty consistent.   
**Recommended Dish:** Fat cup and Edo Fries.   
Ramen Nagomi is the best spot near campus for quality ramen. Its a tiny spot and its BYOB too.   
**Recommended Dish:** Burnt Garlic Tonkatsu and Kakuni Don. 

**Viet:** *Indochine and Baguette Delite*. Indochine is a student favorite for pho right on george street. Not much else to say here.   
**Recommended Dish:** Beef Pho and Viet Iced Coffee.   
Baguette Delite is a delicious Bahn Mi Shop. Their chicken is super tender and the bread is perfect.   
**Recommended Dish:** Chicken Bahn Mi

**American:** *Diesel &amp; Duke, Wings Over Rutgers, Destination Dogs*. Diesel is easily the best burger spot and everyone would agree. One of the best burgers I've ever had.   
**Recommended Dish:** SPBB with Cajun Fries.   
Wings over easily has some of the crispiest wings and they always come through.   
**Recommended Dish:** Sweet Chile Boneless Wings and Waffle fries.   
Destination Dogs is a restaurant and bar that serves a variety of gourmet hotdogs from kangaroo to alligator meat. Its cultural takes on each dog is amazing and super delicious. Instagram worthy plates.   
**Recommended Dish:** Elotes Real and Deviled Eggs

**Latin/Mexican:** *La Catrina and Esquina Latina.* La Catrina is the best authentic Mexican you can get around here. their prices are fair and the restaurant interior is a culture bomb. If you crave tacos this is the spot.   
**Recommended Dish:** Bistec Quesadilla or Pollo Tacos  
Esquina Latina is a bar and restaurant that is known for having music performances and room for dancing. Its super fun and the food is pretty decent too.   
**Recommended Dish:** Croquetas or Yuca Fries

**Bubble Tea:** *Gong Cha, Truly Yogurt, Noodle Gourmet.* I discovered boba at Rutgers and it changed my life. Gong Cha is the most authentic and it tastes great.   
**Recommended Drink:** Brown Sugar with Pearls,   
Truly yogurt isn't very authentic but they are delicious and have a great selection of flavors you might not have tried.   
**Recommended Drink:** Hazelnut Milk Tea with Pearls  
Noodle Gourmet has about 100 different drink combination you could make and they all taste great.   
**Recommended Drink:** Dream Taro Slush or ""Mi Amor""

**Indian:** *Desi Tasty Grill*. Prior to Rutgers I was very skeptical of indian food because of the unfamiliar aromas however I tried it on a whim and fell in love with this place. A true hole in the wall authentic indian spot.   
**Recommended Dish:** Butter Chicken With Garlic Naan

**Pizza:** *Krispy, PJs, Daniels.* Krispy pizza is super conveneintly located spot, this is my go to for a quick filling lunch. You can smell their pizza from meters away and it never dissapoints. A very cheesy slice with high quality ingrediants.   
**Recommended Slice:** Chicken Vodka or Pesto, &amp; Cheese Fries

**Chinese:** *Noodle Gourmet.* Now before you all devour me, I havent had great chinese in my years here but this spot is the most decent. A true last resort for cravings.   
**Recommended Dish:** Udon

**Korean:** *KBG.* KBG is just about the only Korean place near camous and its pretty good. They have Korean bowls and fried chicken as well. Perfect place for trying Korean food if you havent.   
**Recommended Dish:** Bulgogi Bowl and Truffle Fries

**Honorable Mentions:** Chai Chenak, Freshii, Old Man Rafferty's, Fritz, Surreal Creamery, and Honeygrow. 

I hope you all liked this list/recommendations and enjoy your time at Rutgers. Sometimes going out by yourself or with friends and enjoying time away from the books can seriously do wonders for your mental health. I can also make a post on worst spots to eat if you want! Cheers",1612309598,302,4

CS213 Software Methodology partner fiasco...,"I‚Äôm a sophomore in CS213, and I have the first CS213 assignment due at 11:00 PM today.

Also, I‚Äôm not a great programmer either, and seeing all these new requirements, especially compared to earlier classes, makes my spine tingle. My partner said he got the code from a friend who took the course previously, which is obviously cheating, even if variable names or stuff ends up changed. I knew it was wrong but I didn‚Äôt want to call him out for it or burn any bridges too quickly, so I hesitantly agreed. I genuinely want to learn and don‚Äôt want to end up submitting unoriginal code and be on the potential end of bad consequences. Even if this assignment is only worth 4% of the total grade distribution (which is completely fine if I skip entirely), I would feel really guilty if I submitted something unoriginal, regardless of if I get away with it or not.

\- Having to sit through lectures where the class should really not even be taught in person in the first place?  
\- Other campus bullshit.

\-(also, there's like a billion frats not even adhering to pandemic policy, so do you REALLY wanna be around that right now?)  


Okay, maybe not the best reasoning, but here's my working theory:  While yeah, the pandemic sucks, and it's hard on us, online learning in itself is arguably easier than in person for most classes (if you're in math right now I'm sorry.)  You can work at your own pace, and cut out the normal 3+ hours of lectures you'd normally get for a class if it's async.  In the same capacity, maybe we've also kinda let ourselves go in the sense that some people can't keep up discipline without having to go in physical lectures.  


I'm not trying to say 'i'm better than you or whatever,"" but, genuinely, my first semester at Rutgers as a transfer and I got a 4.0, something I've never done before, all online.  I'm proud of myself, but during the beginning it was really rough.  I had no motivation to do any work, but I suggest anyone struggling, set a routine.  Say ""i'll work through 2 sets of classwork for the week on tuesday, 2 on wednesday, and 1 thursday, and the rest of the week, I have off.""  That's my current schedule.  Of course, tailor that to your situation, but setting a constant schedule and saying ""i cant do whatever till shit gets done"" really helps motivate me to do stuff when it's infinitely hard.  


anyway, that's my hot take, please offer feedback, and obligatory go rutgers",1613600111,1,0
Rutgers Deferral(Please respond)," 

Hi Everyone,

I am sad to say that I was deferred from Rutgers NB(SAS, SOE, RBS). I received this decision right on the early action deadline, Feb 15, and all of my friends who got their decision on the deadline were also deferred. This was a shock since we all are instate and all have stats that should be good enough for Rutgers. I was just wondering, is it possible that the admissions committee ran out of time to evaluate early application candidates , and just deferred us to regular decision, and if so, does getting deferred hurt my chances of getting in. Also if anyone else was deferred in the past, when did you receive your admission decision? Rutgers is one of my top choice colleges so any help in the matter would be appreciated.",1613599415,1,0

I do the bare minimum on my hws after putting it to the last minute, probably going to somewhat wing my midterms, etc. Knowing that I can watch my lectures any time I want and the fact that I have a GPA cushion is tbh making me do less work than ever.

I don‚Äôt understand how I am not eligible for EOF? Help?,"I got accepted into Rutgers college of arts and sciences for the Camden and Newark campus and I am currently waiting on a Brunswick response. So far, camden and Newark have given me ‚ÄúNot eligible for EOF‚Äù statuses. I am a dependent student and only child who‚Äôs single mother gross income is less than 7,000. She has no additional assets. She also receives untaxable social security disability benefits less than 11,000. I receive free and reduced school lunch. 

On the website for the EOF eligibility, it says ‚ÄúCandidates may be withdrawn from EOF consideration if they do not demonstrate educational disadvantage‚Äù. I understand that I got honor roll and Principals list throughout my high school career, but I don‚Äôt understand how that makes me not educationally disadvantaged and ineligible for EOF..I just worked really hard.! I don‚Äôt see how me getting good grades during school a fair judgement on my eligibility.! Has anyone else qualified with high grades?

Should I contact them and ask what the problem is? Or, were my grades my downfall for qualifying?",1614056768,8,0
