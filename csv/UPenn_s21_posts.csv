University of Pennsylvania plans in-person fall semester,"I'm on staff at UPenn and we got this email around 10 AM.

&gt;Throughout the pandemic, protecting the health and safety of Penn faculty, staff and students and pivoting to the least restrictive ways of supporting our core educational, research, and clinical missions have been our primary considerations. This past year we were able to move with extraordinary speed to establish a virtual learning environment that was accessible and effective in delivering world-class instruction, and then in developing protocols, such as the Student Campus Compact, that allowed the safe return to some on-campus operations. 

 

&gt;Now, as we look forward to the fall semester, we want to share our current thinking so that students, families, faculty and staff can begin to make plans. With the widespread distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine now underway, with projections of more ample supply in the several months ahead, and with the many safeguards we have been able to establish on campus, at this time we expect to be able to return to an in-person teaching, research and residential environment for the fall of 2021. This will include the return to campus of staff who have been working remotely during the pandemic.  

 

&gt;Specific details regarding the fall semester are still being developed and will be shared with students, faculty, staff and parents in the coming weeks. It will be necessary to remain vigilant and flexible in our planning, as the pandemic could take unpredictable turns. But we are committed to a return to operations, to in-person research, and to an in-person living and learning experience for our students.  

 

&gt;We are enormously grateful for the commitment and sacrifices that have been made by faculty and staff in seeing us through the most difficult days of the pandemic. During this time, we have learned a tremendous amount about the use of technology for the delivery of instruction. That knowledge makes possible complete access to course material for all students, including those who, for whatever reason, may not be able to be present on campus in the fall. 

 

&gt;We are thrilled to be able to bring our academic community back together to continue our critically important missions of research, teaching, learning and patient care. While this has been a challenging time, it has also been an inspiring time of discovery and innovation. There is no greater example of this than the groundbreaking work of Penn faculty members Drew Weissman and Katalin Karikó, which has proved instrumental in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, making possible a return to normalcy in our lives. We look forward to the fall with anticipation and hope for the next great discoveries to come out of Penn’s labs and new opportunities to learn, connect and grow here in Philadelphia.",1615910442,1,0

Problems with OHQ,"I’m not sure if this happens to anyone else, but I’ve been consistently skipped over in the OHQ queue because TAs say that they wait in my waiting room but I don’t let them in so they move on to the next person. 

The problem is, I haven’t been receiving the notification that anyone is trying to enter my room. 

What I’m doing:
1. Give the TA the invitation link to my personal meeting room.
2. I open up my personal meeting room and wait in it (the waiting room setting is enabled).
3. I often minimize the Zoom window and work on other stuff on my laptop while I’m waiting for the TA to join (they are helping other students).
4. After waiting for an upwards of a couple hours, I get a notification from OHQ saying I’ve been skipped because I didn’t let the TA into my room. (But I was never notified that I had someone in my waiting room).

Is the problem really that I minimize the Zoom window? Do I have to keep the Zoom window open the entire time?

STAT433 with MATH502 and 508?,"hi all, I'll be a junior next semester and I'm planning on taking math502 and 508. I'm also considering STAT433 alongside this combo, but am unsure whether I should add this, as I've heard 502 and 508 are extremely difficult, and the general advice regarding 502/508 is to keep your schedule light. I understand that stochastic processes are no joke, so I'm worried the addition of this class will tip me over the edge in terms of workload, as I've heard 502/508 each require upwards of 15 hours a week for the homework. for context, my proof writing skills are, I believe, up to par, as I'm currently taking math314 and math314, and am finding it relatively easy. 

my question then is, for those who have taken 502/508 (or any other abstract algebra/real analysis class) how was your experience with the classes? if you took them concurrently, did you find them manageable? would you have had time for another particularly difficult class? which one of them was harder? even if you've taken one of them, was the pace of the course manageable? as I've heard (advanced analysis in particular) that these courses move extremely quickly, so falling behind is a death sentence

also, for those who have had mark low for stat430 or any other class, how is he? is he good at explaining concepts during his lectures? are his homework assignments particularly challenging? and for those who have taken stat433 with other professors, how was your experience? does this course provide a solid foundation for non-measure theoretic stochastic processes? I'm looking to take the either math546 or the stat930-931 sequence my senior year, and would love to hear any insight people had towards stat433.

\- the obvious partying and lack of physical distancing. going into other people's dorm rooms and holding gatherings is NOT ALLOWED. it's not that hard to just meet outside, is it? this is just so exhausting to have to keep talking about, but it has to keep being said for these individuals to feel even an iota of shame for their actions.

So much for spring stay,"***rant*** 

It's a serious mood seeing half of Class of '23 go to Puerto Rico for vacation, posting pics/ig stories with a lot of people (I'm talking like 20+) with no masks, and thinking its okay. Obviously, no one is practicing social distancing guidelines, people are obviously still drinking though there arent bars and you cant drink openly and I doubt people are complying with the island wide curfew. To think that these people can't handle missing out on one spring break is absolutely disgusting to me, not only is Puerto Rico suffering as a result of COVID but the fact that they just tried to reopen schools and parents and children are terrified, most of their population is low income, and it is a literally category 4 hotspot made me shocked at how much students don't care. Literally some of these people will become public servants, or lawyers, or business owners, yet their putting the lives of those in Puerto Rico at risk, not to mention if one of them got Covid on the island (bc you dont need a test to come back to the mainland) and spread it to the Philadelphia community. I'm a pre-health student and I'm just so shocked at the crap I see during every break, knowing that my peers can be so self-centered to put the lives of others in danger. I understand that business on the island is important to the economy of PR, but seeing ig stories of crowds of college kids without masks makes me furious.",1615502329,1,0

I am part of the University of Pennsylvania Occupational Medicine Residency program and we are conducting an online study trying to learn more about COVID-19 PPE availability and perceptions and burnout. We are an IRB approved study and are not collecting any personally identifying information. We are trying to include feedback from many different groups within the medical community so we can better understand PPE availability nationwide as well as how this is impacting healthcare professionals and things like burnout.

If you work in healthcare and have a few minutes to help, please take our survey. If you don’t work in healthcare but know somebody who does, please feel free to share this study with them. We are hoping the results from this study can lead to improvements in future policies.

Automatically display PennOpennPass on Android home screen,"Here is an overly complicated tutorial on how to set up you android home screen to automatically display your most recent PennOpenPass pass:

1. Make sure that the phone which you're using is receiving text messages whenever you get a new pass. You need to add your phone number on PennOpenPass, and maybe sign up for text reminders.
2. Go to the Play Store and download SMS Forwarder. Set up a filter in it as follows (leave all other settings in their default state):
   1. `Email or phone number`: Set this to any **gmail** address you have access to. We're going to be sending messages to it every time you get a new PennOpenPass pass, so choose an address where that won't bother you. Feel free to make a new email just for this, it takes like 2 minutes. For the sake of this tutorial, let's say you choose the email `name@example.com`
   2. `From who`: Set this to `+12672230163`. This is the number PennOpenPass uses to send notifications.
   3. `Rule for text`: Set this to `You have a`
   4. `Email subject`: Set this to `[SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass`
3. Fill out a PennOpenPass symptom check. You can do this even if you already completed one today. If we've set up everything correctly, you should receive an email with the subject `[SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass` which contains a link to your new pass.
4. Create a Rebrandly account and create a link. We're going to set this link up to always forward to the link of your most recent pass. It doesn't matter what you set the destination to for now, just put google.com or something. You can set the link address to whatever you want, for the sake of this tutorial let's say you call the link `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`
5. Create a Zapier account and create a new Zap, which should be set up as follows:
   1. In the `Gmail` option: `Trigger: New Email Matching Search in Gmail`, with the search set to `subject:([SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass)`. Make sure the email account you're using is the same one you're using with SMS Forwarder.
   2. In the `Formatter by Zapier` option: `Action: Text`, set to `Extract URL` from `Body Plain` (the body of the email)
   3. In the `Rebrandly` option: `Action: Update Branded Link in Rebrandly`, with the `Destination URL` set to the URL extracted in the previous step, and the `Link` set to the custom link you made earlier, in this case `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`.
6. Download Widgery and create a new widget, whose `Web Address` is the custom link you made, `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`. You may also want to change some other settings, like turning on `When clicking on widget this will refresh the image` and `Image the same size as the widget` under `Advanced Settings`. Add the widget to your home screen (how you do this varies by device).

And we're done. If everything is working properly, every time you fill out a symptom check and get a new PennOpenPass pass, it will automatically be displayed inside the widget on your home screen (you will need to tap on the widget once to refresh it). I've only just set this up myself, so there may be some bugs to resolve, but it seems to be working pretty well.

If PennOpennPass just supported sending email alerts instead of text, or sending text alerts to VOIP numbers like Google Voice, then all of step 2 could have been avoided.",1611465470,1,0

FYI on COVID related mod stuff,"Hi everyone. So, with people coming back on campus and Penn’s policies around quiet periods etc, the subreddit has been the place for a lot of discussion around COVID-related topics. Unfortunately, comment sections and posts are becoming more and more heated. In fact, we’ve had to ban more users in the past two weeks than we have in the entire prior year. 

  
Going forward, we want to remind members of our general stance towards comments and posts and outline our general process around deciding what content is appropriate vs. not appropriate for the subreddit.  


1. **Please remember to be respectful.** Calling people “lame”, “losers”, “narcs” etc or wishing ill will upon them is not the way to engage in respectful discussion with others. Those comments will be hit with a removal. Repeated comments of that nature will be hit with a ban. \[This falls directly under rule #1 of the subreddit. Unfortunately, this has also been the rule that has been violated the most as of late.\]
2. **Don’t engage with the troll.** For users that have a repeated history of engaging in spreading misinformation (e.g. “covid isn’t a big deal” “students won’t get complications” “it’s just a party bro”, etc), don’t engage with them. Just point it out to the mods and we’ll see if a ban is warranted. Ways to spot a troll: usually the #1 indicator is that they have no real history of going here. Other ways = them continuing to spout misinformation despite individuals attempting to convince them otherwise. Please use the report button if you suspect someone is a troll. \[This more or less falls under rules #1 and #5\].
3. **Don’t post identifying information.** In line with reddit policy around doxxing, please refrain from posting information about addresses, locations, etc. For the individuals who are posting about parties happening, **PLEASE** approach penn about it first ([https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_6R4DIR9Pm2ziKsl](https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6R4DIR9Pm2ziKsl) or talk to your GA/RA). If you do feel a burning desire to post, think about redacting specific identifying information. If someone could figure it out with a couple of google searches and having a few mutual friends with the people of interest, that information should probably be shared with penn instead of the internet.
4. **Do engage in discussion with those who have genuine questions about covid.** The #1 thing I’ve seen in my MPH program is that change in people's attitudes really does happen at the individual level. If you see someone asking whether something is true or not related to covid, engage respectfully with them in the comments if you believe they’re asking in good faith. Remember, all of you are a part of a community of thousands of individuals working at Penn. It is **everyone’s** responsibility to be on board with covid guidelines so we can protect those who are most vulnerable. Accordingly, do y’alls best to convert those who are doubtful, but also recognize when a discussion is not grounded in good-faith and should probably be left alone.",1611358870,1,0

Got into Wharton as an external transfer. Any advice appreciated from current transfers/Wharton students!!,"Hi everyone! So Penn Transfer decisions came out today and I actually cannot believe I got in. Wharton was my *dream* school when I was in high school, and of course I got rejected and it crushed me. Anyway, I ended up going to my state school (big 10 school, think Penn State, Wisconsin, etc) as a finance major, and while I was at home the whole year, I actually ended up really enjoying it and making a bunch of friends. I was so certain that I wouldn't get in that I was fully expecting to go back in the fall, and I was actually hoping for a rejection from Penn just so I wouldn't have to worry about transferring, but I just don't feel the happiness I thought I would because I'm so nervous about it. 

My main concerns are the price (I would have to pay full tuition &amp; board - \~80k compared to my state school which is like 20k, but my parents are willing to fund it) and the social scene. Is it a lot more difficult to make friends considering there aren't many Wharton transfers? Do you think that the price of Wharton is justified?

Honestly, I feel like I can't say no to Wharton (and I know I don't sound too excited, but trust me, it was my dream school), but I'm just super worried that I'll end up regretting transferring if I don't have a good time. 

ANY advice would be much appreciated, I don't have much time to make a decision and would love to hear about your experiences at Penn. Thank you!!

Confusion regarding the billing schedule,"Confusion regarding the billing schedule

&amp;#x200B;

Hi guys. I'm an incoming freshman in the class of '25 and I had some questions regarding paying my bill every semester according to the billing schedule(without the Penn Payment Plan).

So, let's say my net cost per semester is $10k(tuition,fees,room and board after aid). In the fall '21 semester, a bill is sent every month from July to November, so five months. Now,, according to regular billing, do I have to:

a) pay the $10K when my first bill is due(end of July) and any balance that is outstanding will be counted as late payments, with the bills in the following months showing any additonal costs incurred?

b) pay the $10k uniformly every month, so $2K per month for the five months,

c) some other system(not involving the Penn Payment Plan, just the regular billing schedule)?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.",1620155742,1,0

Is this a scam?,"I'm an incoming freshman to Penn, specifically Wharton. I recently received an email (to my email acct I had affiliated with my Penn admissions portal and WISR) by a Professor within Penn offering a research opportunity. Being a HS senior with no job/research experience I was quick to accept. I made sure the person emailing me was real before replying (their email had the (@)wharton.upenn.edu and was on the UPenn page). The Professor in question also said that it would be a paid position (relevant later on). He sent a 'task' which was to compile a basic excel spreadsheet with info about his research. Pretty straightforward and was alright. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I received an email saying he had a second task. Within this task was the following: "" purchase two $250 prepaid physical Cards from any of the listed retail outlets near you"". This sounded like an obvious scam to me, since prepaid cards are almost always part of some scam. He claims the $500 is needed for an online survey service that I enlist to. Additionally, he claims that this payment is urgent and should've done within 1-2 days. Minutes later I receive another email with a check in my name from a well-known bank for the $500 to buy these cards, the weekly 'stipend' that was agreed upon, and some leftover (bonus?). I was then instructed to deposit this check via mobile checking and to buy these cards. I'm left very confused by all this. On the one hand, this seems like a very elaborate scam, with me depositing a check that might bounce and buying these physical prepaid cards before it does. On the other hand, the Professor, by all accounts, seems to be a real person and is communicating with me using his own Penn-affiliated email. What do I do? Has anyone had this happen to them before?

 I will link some pictures from the emails as well as the check in question.

Housing Advice!,"i'm currently deciding between two options with one seeming a lot more riskier than the other. 

OPTION 1: I could live in a furnished apt  (the radian) with three other people that I don't know so well but are my year at Penn and end up paying around $1100 each month which would come up to $13200 for the whole year, which is quite pricey on a financial aid package that only gives me 14K for housing and dining. It would be a secure building and still feel super safe as well and be close to a bunch of places. 

OPTION 2:  Live in a decently safe street on Pine with a few seniors and also a few other people I don't know too well, but this wouldn't be a lease but rather an academic year-long sublet ( a freshman subletting their off campus housing) , which sort of scares me because I don't want to end up in some weird sort of leasing situation since the others will be moving out and I don't want to be responsible for furniture or rent after the subletting period. This option would be 10,800 for twelve months which is a whole lot cheaper, but I definitely don't want to get stuck in a weird situation where I would need to worry about someone else's furniture, etc that they left behind!

Both wouldn't be a long term option for my whole time at Penn and I don't know if it's worth it to live in a nicer place with more amenities versus taking the cheaper option and saving a few thousand bucks to put towards something else! Any help would be greatly appreciated!",1619057484,1,0

Sometimes I feel too poor to go to school here.,"Sophomore here, right now in the middle of searching for somewhere to live for the fall. I receive full aid from Penn but always have to choose between comfort and ease versus price. For instance, part of me wants to live alone or with one other person but I can't afford 1000+ rent with utilities and anything below is hard to find or puts me walking home late at night in an unsafe position. My parents want me to be safe and I do too, but man is it hard to feel like I can really thrive here. It feels like I always have to compromise on everything. Do I choose to stay in Greek life and risk not having enough of an emergency fund, but lose out on friends? Do I not work full time during the summer to save up enough so I can actually have spare money through the year? Do I live alone as opposed to jumping through hoops to live with others?

Summer Internship,"I'm honestly so lost on how to get internships. I'm Penn '25, majoring in math/cs. When I got in, I was happy but now I'm just so fucking stressed.

So instead I managed to find some informal research w a prof, but I don't know how that will turn out/if it will even be resume worthy. A lot of people have been saying I need to make a project, but I really fucking hate making independent projects. I'd rather be in a structured program like research/internship or be studying coursework. But it seems like its not possible to get an internship without a project, so it's something I'm gonna have to do.

I couldnt even make USAMO (fucking 3 points off). My only work experience is teaching middle schoolers at a learning center. Like how the fuck is anyone gonna hire me off this?

But tech isn't what I want to do long term. Its just for 2022.

how do I make completely new friends oops,"Hi! I'm admitted in the class of 2025 ED (very excited for the next four years). 

I'm not sure if I'm socially inept compared to others (I don't think so???), but when I've been reaching out to other incoming freshmen, it all feels kinda absurd and algorithmic sometimes - as if the entire conversation can be carried out by a bot if I just instructed them to 1. act very hyper + excited  2. bring up the same repetitive topics like intended major, boba trips, food, music, tv shows.  which i understand can be very interesting to some people but at the same time i feel really tired of having the same conversations on these random topics over and over and over again yknow? at the end of the conversation, i always feel as distant and strange as before we ever had it :(

I don't know if anyone else feels the same way, but at least to me it feels like everyone else is super outgoing and is totally thriving, so maybe I'm really just a big introvert?? but i do like talking to people so i don't know :(

I can't tell if 1. more ppl experience this sort of disillusionment 2. i just haven't found ppl i like yet 3. im doing this to myself by following the algorithm (but at the same time what else do you talk to about to strangers) 4. this is only an online problem and will go away in person

Is Penn worth significantly large loans as pre med?,"Hey guys, 

I'm still super shocked I got accepted into Penn as a premed, but I also got accepted to other, cheaper schools. I was wondering what edge Penn provides materially when compared to the other schools, and if you guys think it's worth significant (100k) loans.  Here are my options (Penn, UW, Texas A&amp;M)

**Penn:**  
Pros:  
\- obviously a top school  
\- much easier to switch majors  
\- excellent biology department  
ranked T20 in the US, T20 in the world by US News  
\- well known pre-med with great opportunities and a top medical school on campus  
\- huge feeder at a lot of top medical schools  
\- excellent STEM research university, relatively large university that doesn't function as a LAC or psuedo-LAC (i.e. Dartmouth/Brown) , but can also provide a strong liberal arts education. (personal preference)  
\- Philly is a nice city w/ a lot of history

Cons:  
\- super far from home  
\- more imposter syndrome  
\- massive loans (100k/4 years)  
\- grade deflation

**UW Seattle:**  
Pros:  
\- still one of the best STEM research universities in the world (ranked t10 globally by US News, T20 by ARWU etc.)  
\- Seattle! I love the city, and UW's location seems perfect  
\- still one of the best biology departments in the world  
(T10 in the world according to ARWU, T20 in the US and World according to US News)  
\- I kinda liked the feel of campus a lot, felt really welcoming when I visited  
\- well known pre-med with great opportunities and a top medical school for shadowing opps/research  
\- still has good placement in med schools  
\- close to home  
\- manageable loans (total: 20k)  
\- such a nice campus

Cons:  
\- rain  
\- grade deflation  
\- seasonal depression  
\- hard to switch majors, much larger  
\- less emphasis on non STEM, less chance of a broad liberal arts education  
\- area around the UW is ... sketchy  
\- loans are loans, and 20k isn't negligible, also won't really get any help for paying for med school

**Texas A&amp;M:**  
**Pros:**  
possibly much less grade deflation (because UW and Penn are known for that)  
free ride w/ aid + scholarships, more funds for med school  
**Cons:**  
weather (too fucking hot)  
far from home  
weaker med school acceptances at top med schools than others  
worse Ranked school (66 US News, 85 WSJ, 197 in world by Times \~120 on average)  
weaker for bio major (62 in the US (US News), 174 in the world (ARWU))  
going there doesn't really excite me the way Penn and UW do tbh  
not very liberal friendly  
very meh location

I know Penn is an ivy, but since UW has very reputable STEM and biology departments, I'm not sure if Penn is necessarily worth nearly 100k more. Any advice and insight to Penn's advantages would be helpful.",1617926143,1,0

STEM rigor at penn,"Hey everyone! I’m super lucky to have been admitted as an M&amp;T student for the class of ‘25, but I can’t shake the feeling that I don’t belong. The M&amp;Ts I’ve talked to all seem  to be set on business and Wharton. I haven’t talked to anyone who had SEAS as their second choice instead of Wharton. It’s really important to me that I get to spend a lot of time focusing on the STEM topics I love while in undergrad, including doing undergrad research in engineering.

My interests are in computational and synthetic biology. The three other schools I’m considering have very strong programs in stem (mit Stanford and caltech), and at all of them I’d be pursuing a double major in bioE and CS. Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem possible at penn because that would mean triple majoring. I heard M&amp;T has flexible curriculum and I wouldn’t be opposed to staying an extra semester and taking a heavy course load, but a CS major still doesn’t seem feasible (correct me if I’m wrong). I’m thinking if I come here I’ll drop the CS major for a CS minor and concentrate in systems and synthetic biology. I know that penn has an incredibly strong bioE program (I looked at the curriculum, professors, and rankings and have come to the conclusion that all four of these schools have bioE departments that are comparable for my interests and that I would be very happy at). 

The main trade-off seems to be on the CS front. There are concentrations in bioE that are more on the computational side, but I really love CS in general and don’t want to limit my studies to its application to biology. I LOVE science and engineering. At caltech I’d be taking 12 terms of physics. Both caltech and mit have super rigorous science cores. That sounds SO FUN! At penn, I place out of almost every entry level science class. I wouldn’t take any physics classes at all.

I do want to go into biotech entrepreneurship, and so M&amp;T seems like the obvious best choice on paper (especially because I could submatriculate into a Wharton mba), but others in my life have told me though that Stanford’s “startup culture” is a good compromise between the extreme rigor of mit/caltech and the business education at penn.

Other reasons I’m hesitant about M&amp;T are that it’s far from home (I live in California) and moving across the country to a city where I don’t know anyone is scary. Also, the culture at penn seems very competitive — I’ve been reading some of the past threads where people asked about M&amp;T and kept seeing comments about the prospective students “not being able to handle it.” I can’t shake the feeling that if I had asked this same question before getting in that current penn students would think I couldn’t make it at M&amp;T. Now that I’ve been admitted, everyone is telling me that I can 100% handle it, but admissions offices aren’t perfect and I don’t want to blindly trust their instincts on my application that probably only got a 15 minute review.

I made a deal with myself to be 100% honest in my applications (so that I didn’t end up somewhere where I wasn’t a good fit), and I put in my application that I tend to thrive in collaborative environments. Obviously, I was admitted anyways. While I’m a competitive person and really enjoy hustling and giving my all to my endeavors (I assume that’s how I even got in), I’m also a 17 year old kid who loves her family and s/o on the west coast and is genuinely nervous about making the wrong choice and this transition in general. Will the penn community be supportive? It seems from this sub that being vulnerable and asking for help is viewed as weak, but this is Reddit and probably is not be fully representative.

I guess I just want to know if you guys think I’d fit in at penn and M&amp;T, and if you think that I’d learn less in stem here than I would at other schools.

Four other kind of side questions:

1. How is LGBT support? I know this is a college and will be pretty liberal, but are most students accepting? I just wanna live my life without issues lol
2. How conservative is campus? As a moderate who leans pretty far left socially and decently far right economically, am I going to get shut down for voicing conservative opinions?
3. I was apparently invited to JWS which means doing research in Wharton I think (idk much about it) — will participating in this program make it harder for me to do stem research? Should I enroll in the program? 
4. Also for JWS, it says you live in a dorm with other people in the program. I also hear all the M&amp;Ts live together? If I enroll in JWS and M&amp;T where do I live lol

Any help is very welcome, especially from anyone who turned down the schools I’m considering for M&amp;T. Feel free to pm me. Thank you so so much for reading all of this, and I really appreciate you guys hearing me out on this.",1617900341,1,0
Should I join UPENN MS EE?,"I received an admit from UPENN MS in EE and would like to follow the information and decision systems track. Course list: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bzlx9JXhaLJzU_L-y7i89flVexT98b2L/view?usp=drivesdk

I am interested in robotics and ai with a focus in healthcare robotics and autonomous cars. ( I have done projects in both)

I have certain questions I am hoping this community can help answer

1. How is the information and decision systems specialisation? Is the course list up to date? 

2. I am interested in Robotics, particularly controls and image. Are the companies around UPenn to apply for in these fields? 

3. I want to work at the grasp labs but saw names of very few ESE department students (particularly MS in ee or se) mentioned under professors who are affiliated to grasp lab. Is belonging to a different major a disadvantage (as it is meant for mainly robotics ms and phd)?

4.  Can I switch majors from Ms EE to Ms robotics after 1 sem? I heard switching majors in possible/easy in UPenn...

5.  If you had to choose between Ms ECE in UCSD, intelligent systems, robotics and control and Ms EE UPenn (hopefully information and decision systems), which would you choose? In terms of job opportunities, profs and courses for robotics and ai.

6. Which electives should I take to strengthen my robotics profile

7. There was a sudden decline in the ranking for UPenn EE in qs world ranking by subject. Similar drop is not visible in CS or MEAM. Do you have any idea why? Did professors leave?",1617898935,1,0

Need to decide b/w UPenn ROBO and JHU ROBO,"Hi Penn robotics enthusiasts!

I am planning to pursue masters in robotics and have admits from UPenn ROBO (Grasp labs) and John Hopkins ROBO (LCSR lab). I am very confused at the moment as to where I should go. Here are my findings so far on both fronts, please share your insights with regards to UPenn:

1. **Orientation**: UPenn (GRASP labs) and JHU (LCSR labs) are both research inclined, with an option to pursue a thesis. This appeals to me. While I am not yet decided on whether to go for phd in future, I wanna keep the option open.
2. **Area of Interest**: From what I have heard, Upenn is more into control/perception side, whereas JHU is more into medical robotics.I myself am more inclined towards perception and AI ( I have no experience in medical robotics).To put things in perspective, I will probably be following the[Specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/academics/masters-degree-program/curriculum-information/specialization-in-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/) track in UPennvsPerception and Cognitive Systems/General Robotics track at JHU (Ref: [https://lcsr.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-2021-Robotics-Advising-Manual-1.28.2021.pdf](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-2021-Robotics-Advising-Manual-1.28.2021.pdf)).Coursework wise, imho UPenn looks better/more involved in the areas I am interested in. There is more faculty in these areas at UPenn too. Does JHU do well in those areas as well? (even though it is famous for its medical robotics?). Or is UPenn hands down better here?
3. **Job prospect**: Can the two programs be equally placed in terms of job prospects?
4. **Funding**: As for funding, JHU has offered me a 50% tuition assistance + health insurance for the duration of my full-time study there. So, overall JHU's tuition for me will be about 49k dollars. UPenn has not offered any funding, so tuition will be about 80k dollars (including health insurance).This is a pretty big difference, and I am funding my education via loans, so JHU looks very appealing here. I can probably get TA/RA from second sem onwards at both places.
5. **living expenses**:  There is no stellar difference here I think? though Baltimore is probably cheaper than Philadelphia.

Basically, my interest is warring with my finances!

Is it worth it to spend so much to go to UPenn? Conversely, Is it a bad idea to choose JHU given my lack of interest in medical robotics?  
Hoping for you all to shed some light! Specifically, if folks from robotics could list out the pros of joining the program given my specific condition, it would be really helpful.",1617897504,1,0

Junior Transfer [Questions],"Hello r/UPenn

I am a current Freshmen at Arizona State, and after considering my field of interest (Finance - Global Macro), it became evident that transferring into UPenn (CAS Economics) as a Junior would be conducive towards reaching my aims, as ASU does not offer the resources/research to enter the field. As a result, there are two questions lingering on the top of my mind:

1. How common are Junior transfers? Based on data provided on their site, Sophomore transfers are preferred, but would it be exceptionally difficult to transfer in as a Junior? I have a competitive application, with numerous start-ups, professional internships (albeit at entry level), and clubs to list, in addition to a 4.33/4.33 GPA -- However, it still seems to be random, and impossible to be admitted.
2. Given that my interest is in transferring into Economics (CAS), would numerous Finance internships be appropriate? It has been difficult in finding research-related experiences to Economics/International Trade, and as a result, there are none to list.

What is Penn like?,"Hey, I hope everything is having a lovely day! I am applying as a transfer student, entering as a junior hopefully graduating in 2023 with a BA in Sociology and Health &amp; Societies. I have a few questions to ask regarding academics and social life.

* What is Penn's social life like particularly for transfer students? I am a first generation, BIPOC, and LGBTQ+, is there any support groups for BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and first generation students?
* Is the environment at Penn cut-throat?
* How difficulty it is academically for students studying Sociology and Health &amp; Societies? Do you have any tips for Sociology students, especially for those who want to get into grad school or don't know what to do in life?

Small things you like about penn :),"Have been feeling really depressed over the past few weeks just laying in bed. I really like my friends and what I've been learning so far, but sometimes I just find it hard to get out of bed and keep grinding towards my goals. The end seems so far in the future and I feel really sucked into the imposter syndrome/duck syndrome environment of Penn. Just wanted to ask if you guys have any small things you like about Penn, whether that's the Bio pond or a certain food truck or even just a random part of campus. I want to be more grateful for where I am and also want to start enjoying the small things that bring happiness. Thank you!!",1617665518,1,0

Depressed About Going to SEAS,"I, u/ayang015, volunteer as tribute to preserve this delicious pasta for future use. To the OP, I really do hope you feel better but come on, this is pretty fucking funny right? Hopefully you can look back on this in future years and get a chuckle out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, I'm a junior in SEAS.

How do I shake myself of the depression everyday that I'm not going to Wharton.

People who go to places like Wharton or Huntsman, command respect. Everyone on campus literally praises those kids like saints. Me? I'm a fucking commoner. Going to Penn is supposed to be pretty big, but SEAS just doesnt have the same respect as Wharton.

How do I not get depressed about this? Literally like 20 feet down locust walk away is Wharton, a world class institue with brilliant minds surrounding every corner. But SEAS? Yeah, everyone is smart here, but I mean it is not even close to what Wharton has. I feel like I'm wasting my talents coming here rather than being around geniuses. I'm not even going to M&amp;T, which is the only part of SEAS at the Wharton level.

But to top it off, SEAS charges the same amount as Wharton. So not only do I have the guilt of going to an inferior school, but I also don't even go to the best Penn. Penn State is better, and everyday I wish I chose that instead. I don't have the burden of making my parents pay fucking 300k to go to college.

And with that 300k, is SEAS any better than Coursera? Nope. No employer gives a shit. For both faang and quant trading, Upenn would have a negligbile, if any, benefit over Coursera. It really only matters for stuff like IB. To be honest, you could even make the case that University of Arizona Phoenix Online is better than 300k. But for SEAS? Wharton is better in a landslide.

So basically, I'm getting fucked on both sides. Fucked by Wharton, fucked by Coursera.

I don't go a single day without thinking about selling out. I feel like such a fucking disappointment, I have such huge expectations from the money I'm spending while simultaneously failing to meet expectations by not going to Wharton. What kind of fucking life is this. For the next 4 years I'm going to have to grind my fucking ass off every goddamn day for the slim hope that I can become a code monkey at AWS after graduating and finally, finally get to the same level as the fucking godly Wharton kids. But until then, the expectations and workload will keep piling on me, and I'm just going to be wallowing in depression and suicidal ideations.

Where do I go from here? I don't know what to do with myself.",1617659735,1,0
Astor Apartment,"Hi, I’m doing my apartment hunting and so far I’m considering the Astor apartment located on 39th street. But it seems like no floor plans or anything can be found online. The staff from UCA is also very irresponsible and can’t provide detailed info about the units. Can anyone who has lived or currently living in this apartment share some info about this apartment?
1. Which unit did you stay? Which side are the windows in this units facing?

Depressed about Going to Penn,"For reference, I'm a senior in high school who EDed here (math/cs).

How do I shake myself of the depression everyday that I'm going to Penn.

People who go to places like Princeton or MIT, command respect. Everyone in my town literally praises those kids like saints. Me? I'm a fucking commoner. Going to Penn is supposed to be pretty big, but it just doesnt have the same respect as HYPSM.

How do I not get depressed about this? Literally like 20 miles away is Princeton, a world class institue with brilliant minds surrounding every corner. But Penn? Yeah, everyone is smart here, but I mean it is not even close to what Princeton has. I feel like I'm wasting my talents coming here rather than being around geniuses. I'm not even going to Wharton, which is the only part of Penn at the Princeton level.

But to top it off, Penn charges the same amount as Princeton. So not only do I have the guilt of going to an inferior school, but I also don't even go to the best Penn. Penn State is better, and everyday I wish I chose that instead. I don't have the burden of making my parents pay fucking 300k to go to college. 

And with that 300k, is UPenn any better than Penn State? Nope. No employer gives a shit. For both faang and quant trading, UPenn would have a negligbile, if any, benefit over Penn State. It really only matters for stuff like IB. To be honest, you could even make the case that Penn State is better than 300k for princeton. But for Penn? Penn state is better in a landslide. 

So basically, I'm getting fucked on both sides. Fucked by Princeton, fucked by Penn State.

I don't go a single day without thinking about suicide. I feel like such a fucking disappointment, I have such huge expectations from the money I'm spending while simultaneously failing to meet expectations by not going to HYPSM. What kind of fucking life is this. For the next 4 years I'm going to have to grind my fucking ass off every goddamn day for the slim hope that I can become a quant trader at Jane Street after graduating and finally, finally get to the same level as the fucking godly HYPSM kids. But until then, the expectations and workload will keep piling on me, and I'm just going to be wallowing in depression and suicidal ideations.

"Forming a Non-Republican, Pro-history Conservative Society here.... like the Yale Tories","Yale has the ""Yale Tory Party"" which is separate (and quite distinct) from its Yale College Republicans. I am very interested in reaching out to the Tories to establish a sister-chapter at Penn for the reasonable man or woman- one that is not affiliated with the College Republicans and allies itself more with history and science more than gossip and media driven politics. This would be the first such society here at Penn and I hope it acts as a non-exclusive, intellectual, social gathering more than anything else. Plus, heard the Roaring 20's are going to start next year so might as well plan ahead for that!  

Now, for better or for worse, I am a STEM major and I have very few scholarly contacts in history, economics, political science, classics, area studies, bepp, etc. which I feel will be the departments worth reaching out to more than say sociology.

PROGRESS: Penn COVID-19 Transparency Petition,"Hello all!

Before I begin, I apologize for the delay. This week has been really busy. **I need help running this, so please reach out if you are interested.** Some of what you may do is spread awareness, gather students' concerns, lobby student government and Penn, and attend meetings with Penn officials like the one I had last week.

I met with two of Penn's COVID-19 communication officials: Emily Patterson, owner of [@COVIDPenn](https://twitter.com/COVIDPenn) on Twitter, and Mary Kate Coghlan, Director of Communications for Student Wellness. Both were receptive to many ideas and questions I offered. **This is the first of several meetings we plan on having. We are looking for students from across campus and the university to join in our discussions. Please reach out to me if you are interested.** These future meetings will provide updates on what we discussed previously will be detailed as well as a venue for students to have a seat at the table regarding Penn's COVID-19 policy.

A decent amount of progress was made, as detailed below. However, we must make sure that Penn follows through with this progress as well as advocate for more progress. The following is a condensed version of what was discussed. For more information, please go see [the full document of meeting outcomes and findings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yqJFbBVVTzne0LVQxH6fzUq6jktzy6ot/view?usp=sharing).

**COVID-19 Dashboard**

* Weekly updates may soon come with the data stratified by day instead of just by week.
* Distribution of on/off-campus cases and charts of the seven-day average may become available soon.
* We will continue pressing for daily updates of the dashboard.

**Communication**

* An FAQ section has been added in the comments and full document with answers to common questions by students including what happens at tier levels, how tier levels are activated, contact information, and more.

**Red Pass**

* UPenn follows the 14-day quarantine policy of Philadelphia.
* Red Pass will tell you when to get tested, usually in 7 days after being exposed to someone positive with COVID-19.

**Residential Advisors**

* Concerns were forwarded to the administration. I don't think those I met with were in the position to do much regarding RAs.
* Residential advisors may be heard most if they seek the help of student government.

**The Future**

* Regular meetings with Ms. Patterson and Ms. Coghlan will be scheduled to give students a seat at the table.
* If you would like to join in these meetings, please email Aden Yacobi at [ayacobi@sas.upenn.edu](mailto:ayacobi@sas.upenn.edu) or message [@TransparentPenn](https://twitter.com/TransparentPenn).
* Also reach out if you would like to join in spreading awareness, gathering concerns, and lobbying staff. We need help!",1613452551,1,0
How other schools are responding,"Sharing an email I got today from Rice University's crisis management team, regarding the winter storm in Houston + its consequences on the COVID situation. I transferred out from Rice a few years ago because I hated it there, but I think they've been doing a phenomenal job handing these unprecedented situations. Would love to hear what other institutions are doing + have a discussion on what Penn can learn from these institutions

&gt;COVID-19 Response Weekly Update: Feb. 15, 2021  
&gt;  
&gt;Dear colleagues,  
&gt;  
&gt;Well, today was a day that none of us expected.  It was supposed to be the day that some of us returned to the classroom in person.  Instead, we have now canceled both in-person and online classes for both Monday and Tuesday due to power outages and internet unreliability.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then this morning came a call from Harris County Public Health.  They had power outages and had vaccine supplies that had to get into people’s arms by mid-afternoon or they would go bad.  They wanted to know if we could inoculate 800 people by using our own personnel who are authorized to vaccinate and whether we wanted the doses.  We said yes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Within an hour we set up the vaccination site in the East Gym of Tudor Fieldhouse and staffed it with personnel.  Given the limited supply, limited time (four hours to distribute before the vaccine expired) and dangerous road conditions, we offered the vaccine only to those we knew were on campus today – on-campus undergrads and essential personnel taking care of our people and the campus during this weather emergency.  Over the course of four hours, we inoculated 800 people, but unfortunately had to turn away many hundreds more.

...then the email goes on to explain how to get tested and check if you are eligible for priority vaccines.",1613446144,2,0

SIGN THIS DINING PLAN PETITION RIGHT NOW PLS,"No way is this happening - please for the love of god sign this petition to remove the 2nd year ""dining experience"" requirement.

Hot take: Forcing a Sophomore Dining Plan has its pros,"Why? Dining halls are social hubs. Because a single class year is forced to be on a dining plan, dining halls are pretty much all freshmen (and now, sophomores), and you’ll keep seeing the same people in your year—often, people you know. My closest friends and I actually met at a dining hall freshmen year, and I’ve heard similar stories from other people as well. Looking back, if it wasn’t for dining halls, I might not have expanded my social circle that much—having a unified dining plan makes it way easier/commonplace to meet up with friends in dining halls.

Dining halls are super underrated for socializing—you can bump into people you haven’t seen in a while, and sit to eat with them and catch up. You might even meet new friend groups, meeting people that your friends are sitting with. Though the food is objectively crappy beyond hell, you can bond over how crappy it is; keeping in touch with acquaintances and friends is all the worthwhile imho. I’m in no way a fan of dining hall food (had a freshman -15 lmfao), but just wanted to point out the missed opportunity for socializing.",1613426204,1,0

CIS160 Bible,"Howdy, I completed CIS160 last sem and, at the recommendation of the TAs, compiled a cheat sheet for the final. The class is a brutal piece of work, so I made my cheat sheet as comprehensive as possible. So as to make the class easier for anyone who'd benefit, I'm linking here the cheat sheet I put together. The cheatsheet includes every definition, theorem, and proof completed in last Fall's iteration of CIS160 with Rajiv that I deemed potentially relevant to the final (including everything proved from lectures and recitations and most things proved in the homework). This took MANY long hours of LaTex, which is to say I was half-dead type-setting it, so it is by no means error-free. Still, concepts and general proofs may prove useful to some. Final disclaimer, the collection of proofs prolly won't get you through any kind of assessment if you don't understand them, so it's better used as an inspiration for a proof method than an all-knowing answer sheet.

[PB] Covid Test Speedrun,"Woke up ready for my biweekly Covid test speedrun today and was feeling it - the trick is to go at 7:00 AM when no one is there to interfere. Started my timer right after the guy at the front told me I could go in. I sprinted to the counter closest to me and smashed my PennCard on there before doing a lateral lunge to the #1 desk.

Up until now I had been collecting spit and I had exactly 2mL in my mouth at this point. ""Hohn Thmith, May fif,"" I yelled before grabbing a handful of vials, alcohol wipes, and the entire printer to save time as I ran over to station #10. I uncapped the vial and hurled my salivary juices into it while I used my toes to rip open the alcohol wipe. I ran towards the nurse and started reeling my arm back, before pitching my vial, label, and the entire printer from earlier to her at 60mph once I got to the 6 ft. mark. I  made sure to take the entire hand sanitizer bottle as I ran towards the exit, as public health&gt;&gt;speedrunning.

Office of Student Conduct Advice,"On my first math 114 quiz last friday I used a calculator on one part of the question to simplify an integral into a decimal. I went through all of the steps on my own to find the antiderivative and only used the calculator to plug in the upper and lower bounds. Although it was clearly stated in the syllabus and at the top of the quiz that calculators were not allowed, I did this because the question asked for a numerical answer and that you might not be able to give a decimal answer without a calculator. I misinterpreted this as permission to use a calculator on the last step of the integral instead of just plugging in the bounds and simplifying.

Now I have a 0% on this quiz and cannot replace it with the redo, which means that my final grade potential is lowered 7%. I emailed the professor and explained my mistake as I did in this post, but he is sticking with his initial punishment. He said that I could request to open a case to the office of student conduct, but I am afraid that if I do, they with side with the professor and then have it put on my final record.

* Penn sucks cause Wharton kids shit on kids from the other schools
* Penn sucks cause if you're not in Wharton, you'll always be overshadowed
* Penn sucks cause everyone's a snake and only makes friends for connections
* Penn sucks cause everyone's hyper-competitive and depressed

i made a few good friends last year but they were all seniors so they graduated and when covid hit i just felt so alone. i had no one to talk to other than my parents for the longest time and i again just focused on getting good grades. even now when people are back on campus i walk around locust and i dont see any familiar faces. i feel like such a loner since i literally have no friends and all the other people in my year already have their friend groups. like how do u even meet new people as a senior??its so weird that i'm technically still a college student but i have no college friends.

idk if its just me but i just want to speed up time and graduate so i can go to another city and meet new people. freshman year i used to go out literally every single day and hangout with friends but i feel like over time people have just drifted so much and I dont belong to any ""social group"" and I'm just so lost.

Addressing Penn Marriage Pact Data Privacy Concerns,"Hey everyone! We have heard that there are some concerns about the Marriage Pact, and so we’d like to take the opportunity to clear these things up. With the ways data has been mishandled online by different companies in the past, it’s totally fair to be skeptical, and we spent some time looking into these things too before we decided to do it. We definitely appreciate the people who’ve brought this up; we really want to clear the air around this stuff and address your concerns as best as we can.

First off, we really are a team of excited Penn students—we’re working together with the students from Stanford who started the project (it’s been running for 4 years there!) to bring it to Penn. We figured it’s a chance to make the kind of connection we’re all missing right now.

The questionnaire does ask about some sensitive things. Here’s why: the idea behind the Penn Marriage Pact is to find your best backup plan—like the person you could marry if you’re both 30 and still single. And when you look at what matters in really long-term relationships (say 50 years-long), it isn’t what music you listen to or what your favorite ice cream flavor is. It’s really your core values and the things that matter to you deep down. So in order to find that person who’s a practical choice, we use Marriage Pact’s specially-designed questions to ask about those things.

Because there are sensitive questions involved, privacy is also super important, so we’ve worked hard to design it into the system anywhere and everywhere we can. **Nobody on the launch team has access to any response data (whether from Penn or the Stanford kids who are helping us here).** And the matching is run purely via algorithm, so nobody looks at individual answers (we will only get summary statistics to make sure the matching worked). During matching, the algorithm even uses unique IDs for each person so it’s anonymous as to anyone’s name or contact info.

The data isn’t stored on anyone’s laptop or anyone’s google account. We use Typeform for the questionnaire, which outlines its security [here](https://help.typeform.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029259552-Security-at-Typeform), and Mailchimp to send the emails and they outline their security [here](https://mailchimp.com/about/security/). We’re setting up the algorithm to run on Amazon Web Services, which many other organizations use to house their data (US/Pacific Northwest; [AWS Data Privacy](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/) ), so nobody will see or handle any sensitive personal data on their laptops to do the matching.

Finally, we included the Data Principles &amp; Practices document because we mean it. These days, you’ll hardly find anyone clearly stating “Your privacy is not for sale”—but those sections were really important to us. **Neither we nor Marriage Pact make any money from operating and we certainly do not sell anyone’s data.** In addition, it's worth noting that schools like Stanford, UVM,  Columbia, and more have participated in this without any data privacy issues. 

It’s always your decision to participate! You can opt-out at any time, and we honor all deletion requests—just shoot us an email at **penn@marriagepact.com**, and we’ll delete all your records (just make sure you’re emailing from the Penn email you used to sign up).

Hope this helps—genuinely, it’s been amazing to see how excited the Penn community has been about it (over 1500 signed up in the first two days), and we want to make a safe and comfortable matching experience for all!",1614820737,67,2

Looking for input on SEAS masters programs (CGGT preferably),"Hi all,  


As the title says, I am currently a working professional that is also enrolled in the Penn XSD 1 year  program. I love this school, the faculty, the city, and am very interested in potentially pursuing a masters if I can get the test scores for it! (but hopefully the grad certificate helps too lol)  


Does anyone in this subreddit have experience with either the CGGT program or the CIS/MCIT programs? I currently work as a virtual and augmented reality developer in the main line and am really interested in complementing my work experience with with a program that can allow me to focus on improving my coding proficiency in C#/C++/Python and things like AI/ML development for game engine development/IOT based data retrieval. Would this be an acceptable program for this specialty?  


Any info, warnings, best classes, or people to reach out to would be appreciated!

Question about Wharton LBW,"Hey everyone! I’m a rising senior looking to apply to Wharton LBW. I have two siblings, both of which attended LBW (one who actually attends penn), and I’m wondering, does LBW actually teach anything?

What I mean is LBW just another program used to milk out money from kids? I’m genuinely interested in the field of finance and business, and taking these courses seems like an opportunity I wouldn’t want to miss out on. But, if it’s like other programs (like Cornell) that just seeks money and doesn’t even have faculty teaching, I’d rather utilize my summer more productively. 

I’m not looking to attend a summer program to “increase” my chances of getting into penn, or any school for that matter. But, I really want to attend a program that will give me an actual taste of what I will experience at an actual undergrad business school. I think that if I applied (even though I’m applying towards the end of the final deadline), I stand a fair chance of getting into LBW considering my stats and ECs were both slightly better than my siblings. 

If it means anything I’m most likely leaning towards first choice penn or NYU next year.",1614797997,3,0

The Penn Marriage Pact is a data privacy DISASTER,"I commented this information on another post about the Marriage Pact, but I’m also posting it for increased visibility. Everyone should hear this information before deciding to participate.

The link to this was emailed to the entire Sophomore class with the disclaimer “And don't worry, your responses are completely confidential.” There is also a disclaimer on the front page of the website that responses are confidential. This is blatantly false and a correction should be issued as soon as possible.

In their “Data Principles and Practices” document they do not go nearly far enough to make me comfortable with the way our data is being stored and used. They call the outlined information an “informal policy” (aka in no way binding). While they say they will never sell information, it could still be accessed by anyone who works for them, and this policy could always be broken (many other companies have made this promise and later broken it). About how long they hold onto your data, they say “In general, we store information until it’s no longer needed to run the Marriage Pact.” This is an extremely vague policy which pretty much permits them to indefinitely hold onto the data. There also does not seem to be any option to have your data deleted. They say you can withdraw your request to be matched, but nothing about where your data goes. 

We don’t know WHO gets to view and access the data. It is mentioned that 4 Penn students “helped” to bring the Marriage Pact to Penn. Can they see our responses? 

We don’t know where the data is stored or if it is encrypted. Is it in an excel spreadsheet on someone’s computer? If so, is that computer password-protected? Is the document also password-protected?  Is the data encrypted? Is it in the cloud? We don’t know, so you should assume the worst, which is that someone who steals this person’s laptop, or perhaps gains access to their Google Drive account, will know how much you like kinky sex on a scale from 1 to 7, your political opinions, and more, and is free to tell the world about it. Even if the people running the website have good intentions, they most likely are storing the data in a location that is not properly secured, which puts respondents at risk. A lot of damage has been done with less information than what you are volunteering here.

The people who run Marriage Pact are collecting highly sensitive information about thousands of students and are not telling us anywhere close to enough about what they plan to do with it. 

Just be aware before filling it out that you’re giving highly personal information to people (whose identities are unknown!) who are under no legal obligation to keep it private.",1614787324,107,4

MCIT versus MSE in CIS--not sure which one is the right fit for me,"Apologies in advance if this isn't the right place to ask a question like this!

I was hoping I could get some advice regarding the [MCIT](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/master-of-computer-and-information-technology/) and [MSE in CIS](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/mse-in-cis/) programs at Penn. My problem is that, even after reading about both programs in depth, I have no idea which one I should be applying to. Here are some quick facts to give you context about my academic profile:

* B.S. with majors in astrophysics, physics and math with a 3.814 cumulative GPA, graduating this spring.
* I've taken two CS classes: a Python-based intro to data programming and a 1-credit MATLAB survey course that essentially taught me nothing more than what I already knew from my physics lab courses.
* 3 years of research experience in astronomy. Python is a tool that I use daily but almost exclusively in data-science contexts. I would never claim to know as much as a CS major.

Now, here's my dilemma: the MSE program says that ""\[a\]pplicants...should have strong undergraduate training in mathematics and computer science; prior coursework should include areas such as operating systems, programming languages, data structures, discrete mathematics, linear algebra, algorithms and theory,"" later saying that ""\[c\]andidates who do not have an undergraduate major in computer science should consider applying to the MCIT program."" Okay, that doesn't really sound like me. No CS major and the only class I've taken out of those listed above is linear algebra.

So, I checked out the MCIT page (linked above) and found some contradictory information. This program says that ""\[d\]ue to the goals and nature of the MCIT program, it is strictly for applicants with **limited** or **no past experience** in computer science. Candidates with an undergraduate major in Computer Science or **closely related fields**, should consider applying to the MSE program instead."" Well, this doesn't sound exactly like me *either*. I have *some* experience in CS and I will graduate with an undergraduate major in a closely related field (math).

I'd prefer not to bother admissions with a long email as they're likely very busy at the moment, so I'll annoy you guys first. Any advice?",1614364732,5,0

Graduate Admissions Process Question,"Hi Quakers,

I’m a prospective graduate student who was admitted into a masters program in SEAS not too long ago. When I applied, my GPA was at a certain point but after last semester it went down a few hundredths. In short, I was completely overwhelmed last semester and two of the six credited classes I was taking handily kicked my ass (got a C and a D).

All that being said:
- My workload is way more manageable this semester and I’m in a better place mentally. I fully anticipate raising my GPA to higher than the one I applied with.
-  I go to a top ranked engineering school that’s notoriously difficult (the professor of the class I earned a D in even admitted that the final exam was “brutal”, go figure)
- Barring my untimely death or other health emergency, I expect to graduate with my BS this May.

So my question is, will the office of admissions rescind my offer because of the poor grade or do they really just care about maintaining/raising GPA and finishing your degree? Would it be appropriate or necessary to reach out to them and tell them about it? Thanks for taking the time to read this.",1615473311,1,0

Best things about SAS Economics at UPenn?,"Hi there! I’m not a UPenn student (not yet, but hopefully I will be one day) but I’m wondering if anyone can share some of the best things about Economics at UPenn in and out of the classroom?

For example, what are some of your favorite courses and professors, what extracurricular there are centered toward Econ students, and what activities you’d recommend trying? Doesn’t have to be about future job prospects by the way. 

Any concerns and complaints are appreciated too! 

Thank you in advance! :)",1615415267,1,0

Student Campus Compact - Penn being unfair,"Prefacing this, I know that COVID is a really serious issue - I have several relatives who’ve caught it and one passed away. I understand and have really made sure I stick by COVID guidelines and that Penn’s campus compact panel has a huge responsibility on their hands.

That being said, I’ve personally been affected extremely harshly by the panel for something completely circumstantial and unrelated to me. Just wanted to know if there’s anyone else who’s had this experience.",1615398648,1,0
Picking up a half credit,"Does anyone have any recommendations for half credits that begin after break? From the Wharton website I can only see some non-stat Wharton half credits, but I am interested in any half credits in engineering/CAS as well. Pointers to where/how to find information on the courses would be appreciated as well!

Commencement for class 2021,"Today we got a mail regarding the commencement ceremony being hybrid. And the mail is very disappointing. It says only few seniors of class 2021 would be able to the event directly amd professional and graduate students won't. Are graduate and professional students are just here for the university to take advantage of. 
I'm an international graduate student of class 2021, I have been barely been on campus since I came here in August 2019. This Graduation ceremony is a big aspect of my life not just me but for many other students. And being virtual is crazy after us leaving our home country and flying all the way here to struggle and study on top of this pandemic happened.
I understand the university is following safety procedures. We can understand it canceled the ceremony last year since everything is abrupt but now I bet there is more flexibility in making good decisions now with decreasing trends of cases and availability of vaccine (Afterall we have penn medicine). It's no excuse to say commencement will not be held as usual. After all it's a huge and reputed university with brilliant minds, is it impossible to find out a way.

All this while students are silent but te university keeps on disappointing us. The university sucked all the money for nothing, we haven't received on campus education nor received any benefits of it. Taking away this important aspect of a students life due to incapablity of making a good plan is the worst. Lol huge political and public events are made to happen, is the university filled with great scholars that behind?

How could university make such decisions without considering the opinions of the students. It shows how the university craving on power. 

Overall it is very disappointing. I bet there should be a way, there is always a way. Is there anything we students can do? I wish we can make it happen.",1615387507,1,0

Penn GSE SMART Program?,"Hey all - I’m interested in learning more candidly about GSE’s Statistics, Measurement, Assessment, and Research Technology master’s program. From what I’ve gathered in speaking w the department and department website it’s a small program.

Are there any current students and/or program alum that can give me some more info on this? Some questions I have are 
- Are the classes heavily statistical based? I’m a person without much math/quantitative academic background but I wouldn’t say I’m horrible at it. 
- how are the instructors?
- what’s the culture like? 

Thank you in advance!",1615337328,1,0
Graduate school of education - financial aid questions,"Hello,


I was admitted into a graduate program in Penn’s Graduate School of Education. My admissions letter states I was offered no need based financial aid (which to my understanding would come in the form of departmental grants).

I thought I could appeal my financial aid decision (I’m an independent student and my 2020 income was probably $6,000 in total as I’m coming straight from undergrad). But, I have been going back and forth via email with someone from penn GSE financial aid and haven’t been able to get a clear explanation as to whether an appeal is possible. I can’t find any information for graduate student financial aid appeals or grant funding (besides assistantships, which are great but don’t make a dent) and I’m feeling kind of defeated. I have student loan debt from my in state public undergraduate degree and while I was expecting to take out loans for my masters, I wasn’t planning for it to be 70,000 for a year long masters program.

Does anyone have any experience with financial aid for graduate school? Or any insight you could provide?",1615335635,1,0
