Returning textbooks,"Hi yall

It looks like the library is not automatically renewing textbooks anymore, and I am hesitant to send a email to renew my book. I've had these books for almost a year now since they kept automatically getting renewed because of covid. These book are for a core class, and I think it might be beneficial for people who are taking the class this quarter if I decided to return it. However, I am residing outside campus, and I would rather not visit campus if I happen to be asymptomatic. Campus seems like a closed environment with the constant testing happening, and I think its unethical for me to step foot in campus right now.

Even if I got tested for covid the day before visiting campus, I feel like there's a chance of me getting it on my way to campus.

Maybe I'm overreacting, but I want to take the highest precaution possible to insure we don't end up like sdsu.",1600890558,1,0

Too Late Or Not To Switch?,"I've really been seriously considering community college in the last few weeks, but am stuck on whether to jump ship to CC or not. For context, I was admitted to UCSD as a undeclared freshman (first choice Computer Science) and picked the school because it had a better name than the other UC's/CSU's that I was admitted to. However, since classes are online anyways with tuition+fees still remaining at $15,400 (whereas CC costs $1,500), and since it seems unlikely that I will get CS because UCSD CSE is tightening admissions to only 55 students, would it be reasonable to start at CC? The only thing holding me back is the fear that I won't get in anywhere good for CS/I might lose credits in transferring if I stay at my local CC. And if I do choose to start at UCSD, what paths should I take if I don't succeed in the CSE lottery?",1600886467,1,0

My engineering math scores:

Sem 1 Math: 98/100

Sem 2 Math: 75/100

Sem 3 Math: 98/100

Sem 4 Math: 100/100

2 Internships. First one in Python/MySQL, Shell. The second was research analyst role and required Data Scraping, Cleaning, Visualization and Robotic Process Automation (RPA UiPath). **Got a full-time offer from this internship.** 

I plan to do one more Internship in December.

So that's 3 in total.

Working on an AI project with a startup. This AI startup has a cell in my college and I'm on its core team. It was originally founded by an Indian professor at MIT. The startup will be providing certificate on successful completion of the project. We are working with doctors to get some insights into our approach. So it's not a research per se, but close maybe?

Implementing already published research papers. So I guess these could work as research projects?

Participated in an AI Hackathon.

The Student Health Clinic here is pretty awesome,"I use SHIP insurance, and I just wanted to let everyone know that student health is actually a really good, convenient place to go to get full checkups, vaccinations, blood work, and even birth control.

I got an IUD implant and a pap smear all here! In the past they also helped me with the flu, ankle sprains, sleep issues, getting new glasses, the flu shot, nutritional help, and a nearly life threatening infection. They also had a scheduled follow up after I was sent to an ER for a panic attack, just to make sure I was OK, and sent me to CAPS. 

Making appointments is easier than you expect, and my recommendation is if you think something is wrong, just make an appointment, and most likely they'll also help you with like 3 other things you didn't even realize you needed to get done (like shots and/or checkups of other kinds). COVID does change things, so don't go if it's absolutely frivolous, but as long as you make an appointment and get covid tested things should be OK

Adderall Usage,"Hello all,

Even though the discussion about drug abuse mainly focuses on opiates, there is a very real adderall epidemic on college campuses throughout the US. Just out of curiosity, is that problem really all that present at UCSD? I mean, we are a major STEM university, so I would expect so, but I haven't met anyone who has taken it. Do any of you guys have experience with it? If so, what happened and how did it pan out? Are there resources on campus for helping those who are struggling with it?

Lastly, I feel obliged to say this: I have never taken adderall and I don't suggest anyone ever does unless a doctor prescribes it. My understanding is that it is an addictive drug and that it can mess you up. I know the pressure is high, but the pursuit of money can only go so far without being detrimental.

Possible Major Change - Need Advice,"I'm currently a Math-CS major but recently I've been obsessed with fish keeping and now am considering changing my major to marine bio.

On the contrary, I really love fish, caring for them, and learning about them. I know that either or path would be interesting enough for me to love my career but idk lol.

Although I can pursue both I'd rather focus on one or the other. Thoughts from marine bio and CS people?

"Need advice, VAC probably won't answer by deadline","Hi! asking this here because I probably won‚Äôt hear a response from virtual advising by the drop without a W deadline tomorrow, just want to know what you‚Äôd do in my situation.

I‚Äôm in my fourth year here and I‚Äôm a Spanish lit major. One of the requirements is to take 8 Spanish literature courses. This quarter I‚Äôm taking my first 2. I think I signed up for too many classes this quarter and I‚Äôm already not doing well in one of these literature courses. I've been having a lot of personal problems, and just haven't been doing the readings, I keep bombing assignments and quizzes.

I looked at the Spanish lit course offerings for this year and there‚Äôll be just enough offered in winter/spring so I could meet that requirement of 8 classes and graduate this year. 

My only worry is that one of them might be canceled for whatever reason and I‚Äôd be screwed. I don't think they offer Spanish literature courses in summer so I'd have to wait until next year to take the one class I'd need. 

Should I drop the class now without a W? Or should I just try really hard to catch up and see where I am before the drop with a W deadline on nov 13th?

I have heard that warren is the best for engineers, but tbh I don't know if being in a college full of engineers is gonna be the best thing for me. I considered revelle because I REALLY like science, and it seems like a science heavy college, but all I hear is bad things about it lol. 

Besides these, I honestly have no idea how to rank the colleges. Ideally I would be able to get ap credits for some of my classes, but its not a big deal if I can't. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!",1603909653,1,0

Textbooks??,"Hello, I'm an incoming first-year at UCSD and I have 4 textbooks that are required for the classes that I will be taking this fall.

Or would the professors provide us with the books now that everything is online? Or do I have to buy everything, new or used, just so that I can get through one course?

I do have the link to the google sheets with some of the textbooks, but it only has one of the four textbooks that is required for my class.

Just focus on the now and stop worrying.,"People on this thread really need to stop asking whether or not the 2020-2021 academic year will be remote.

In conclusion these resources are not a Statics book or Statics notes. These are great skills to add to your resume. 

These skills distinguish you from a green/fresh engineer to an engineering graduate with some sense of what goes on in industry...

You can put that you took Statics, Dynamics, strength of materials, hydraulics etc...but in reality having PM or Six Sigma on your resume makes you a stronger candidate...

Same goes with having Solidworks, inventor and drawing creating on your resume. Knowing how to extrude on a program is the simple part. Understanding the technical language of GD&amp;T makes you an asset. You can communicate with a fabrication shop/machinist and bring revenue to the company.

I welcome anyone to challenge what I am saying...a jack of all trades engineer is more of an asset then an engineer that just does Statics problems from a book.

We all know that ""required textbook"" is a tad subjective. In some classes, the required reading is legitimately required. In other classes, it isn't. Maybe you got your own copy through a friend, you might be going with an older edition, etc.

The fact that you're already signed up for Redshelf is annoying. It should be an opt-in system, that you have to consciously choose to go in.

how are y'all getting through the week,"I know that there have been a ton of these posts, but I'm honestly at the end of my rope. I feel like I'm in school 24 hours, 7 days a week. Canvas notifications have become the bane of my existence, or lack thereof. Yet I also feel like I'm not even in school because nothing feels real and I still can't grasp learning like this.

My physio prof expects us to learn the material for the upcoming week over the weekend, complete practice problems Monday, homework by Wednesday morning, and a quiz on Friday, all while trying to keep up with other classes. We just had our first quiz and it was an absolute trainwreck. Even when I'm doing work for one class I am petrified that I've forgotten some assignment deep in the recesses of Canvas. I know TAs/IAs and profs are doing their absolute best given the circumstances, but I have to wonder if they understand the strain put on us to learn like this and keep up with every assignment, quiz, paper, etc. Where is the empathy?

And yes, I do understand that writing this post on Reddit is wasting time that I should be allotting towards my work, but my brain feels broken. My spirit feels broken. Not a day goes by that I don't feel overwhelming dread just to take a step forward. Crying is the norm, but I can't even set time aside for that anymore. I go to lectures on time, I take notes, I work day in and day out, I eat right, I exercise, what am I missing? I'm not usually a down or pessimistic person, I've never felt so depressed and empty before. Sorry for adding another vent to the mix but I'm desperate for any advice to feel even a little bit alive.",1602884842,1,0

Is it normal to forget most of what you learn as an Economics major?,"Hi there! Prospective Transfer student for Fall 2021 here. 

I‚Äôm currently studying mathematics and economics and am planning to major in the math/econ major at UCSD. I am a good student and do pretty well in my classes. I have a 3.92 gpa, but I feel like a complete numbskull. I can‚Äôt seem to retain all of the information I pick up from my economics courses for long amounts of time. I barely remember things from my general ed classes from freshman year, which is fine. However, economics is kinda a big deal for me because it‚Äôs my major. 

On the other hand, Mathematics is less of a struggle for me to remember and keep up with because I use a lot of the same knowledge in every course (this keeps my math skills sharp).

To be honest though, I‚Äôm just really scared because I feel like I have to remember everything for my job someday. 

If there are any econ or econ/math majors out there, could you please enlighten me on how bad the struggle ahead will be in my upper-division courses? 

Important Note: I want to work in finance after graduation.",1602830105,1,0

I plan to do one more Internship in December.

So that's 3 in total.

Working on an AI research project with a startup. This AI startup has a cell in my college and I'm on its core team. It was originally founded by an Indian professor at MIT. The startup will be providing certificate on successful completion of the project. We are working with doctors to get some insights into our approach. So it's not a research per se, but close maybe?

Implementing already published research papers. So I guess these could work as  projects?

Math18 Professors + advice. SOS,"Okay so i looked into CAPE and all to see which professor is the best for math18. These are my options: 

- Obviously, professor Xu Hang is the best and CAPE seems to agree with that. Since most people seem to like this person, his class has a waitlist already (bigger than the 10% that would hopefully get in from the WL).

- Professor Justin Roberts is an option too. I read that he‚Äôs good, but not the best. His class has a waitlist too but much smaller and I‚Äôd actually have a chance of getting into the class since i‚Äôd be #3 on the waitlist. 

- There‚Äôs also two other professors as options?? Those are professor Pooja Agarwal and professor Andrew Zucker. I couldn‚Äôt find anything on CAPE regarding them, so i‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôre visiting professors?? (or just new ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). Has anyone taken a class with these professors already? Idk if they taught Fall2020, so the CAPE results aren‚Äôt in yet. 

If anyone could give my any insight or  advice on what to do next, that would be great!! 

I really wanna take Xu‚Äôs class, but obviously I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the safest choice since i‚Äôm not even sure i could get into the class.

My gripe with FAO (long rant),"This happened about a year ago when I was readmitted to UCSD. For some reason, my financial aid was not coming in. I did everything on time and didn't miss the deadline. When I went into the office to ask what was going on, the woman at the office was looking at her computer all upset. I really needed to get financial aid by 5:00pm that day (the other times I emailed or called, they said I would receive it so I trusted them and didn't bother) or all my classes would be dropped. 

She stared at her computer for a while then asked, ""Why do you need $50,000?"". 

""What? I just need what financial aid normally gives out"".

""Then why does it say that you were trying to take out $50,000?""

""What? What are you talking about?""

""So you don't need this \*clicks on her computer\*, and this \*click\* , and this. \*click\*""

""Can I get it by today? Or all my classes are going to get dropped.""

""Well, you should've came in earlier. It says you were trying to get $50,000 and we can't do that. The deadline to pay without your classes getting dropped is by 5:00pm today.""

""I can't afford it if I can't get financial aid. Can I get it sometime this week?""

""No it's a first come first serve basis and students who turn in the financial aid form late might not get any, it's not guaranteed. Why did you turn it in so late? What were you trying to do?"" 

This was all with a bad attitude as if I intentionally hacked the system to get $50,000 or something. It was so out there that I didn't even address the $50,000. I had no idea what she was talking about.

""All I wanted was financial aid like all the other students get. There must've been a mistake, can I get an extension to pay for the quarter? I don't have that kind of money right now.""

""Nope. No extensions. You'll have to attend next quarter"".

I was speechless. I had a rush of adrenaline because I felt so screwed. I mean I just got readmitted and moved back to California, got housing in SD and moved my life entirely for this, and I didn't have the money.

""So if I don't have the money within 30 minutes, I can't keep the classes I already enrolled in?""

""NOPE. I have to see other students""

I just said thank you and left. I thought it was over for me, I wasn't even mad because I was preoccupied with thinking about everything else and how fucked I am. It took a while for it to settle in and understand what was really going on. The classes were supposed to drop at 12:00AM the next day, so I was thinking about manually dropping everything so I can get waitlisted at least for the courses I need. Lo and behold, 12:00AM came and no classes were dropped. I had the extension to pay. Like wtf. I was literally about to drop all my classes. I don't remember exactly what else she said to me, but I clearly remember she was accusing or implying that I had something to do with the $50,000 or whatever that ""I was trying to get"". I had no idea what she was talking about. I went to the FAO every single day for a week until the financial aid finally came in and I could attend school again. Next thing I know, all my credit/debit cards were blocked and the bank couldn't tell me why. I had to call some special line to talk to higher ups. Wouldn't be surprised if she reported me or something. I had absolutely no idea what was going on. But why would she even lie about me not getting an extension? That's what really pisses me off. So there's my personal issue with FAO. Something triggered my PTSD from that lol. Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR:** Financial aid office counselor accused me of trying to fraud $50,000 and told me all my classes would be dropped and I would likely have to attend next quarter, when that was totally not the case. I hate FAO to this day.",1607237767,1,0

More Effective Way of Reaching the Academic Senate?,"I was thinking that the official academic senate email is probably read by underpaid interns or administrative assistance.

In particular, the EPC is the subcommittee that shot down the P/NP proposal before it even made it to senate. If one of the following professors are in your department or if you've taken a class with them, it might be a good idea to reach out to them personally.

"Math 183, what do you think the professor does all day?","So I'm not a student in that class, but I did some research on Reddit to see what all the talk was about. And Jesus! Sorry if you are in that class. All of you guys have the right to complain, send the department emails, and etc. Not to make it any worse, but you guys are paying tens of thousands of dollars for that bull crap. The one where she is at a party recording a lecture was actually pretty hilarious.

Anyway, I wonder what she does all day. She obviously does everything with minimal effort, and even reuses material for MATH 183, when the material is for a completely different lower-division course. She obviously doesn't spend too much time, and spends even less time trying to hide what she is doing. So I wonder, what does a professor do all day? I mean its your job. If someone asks her, ""What do you do?"", the response is probably, ""I'm a professor"". Does she spend all of her time maybe working on her other courses? I'm genuinely confused how someone like that can be a professor at UCSD (I know not tenure but still). It seems like she's way too busy and has way more important things to do than do her job.... at UCSD at least. Maybe she has something like a family emergency this quarter? Or found something she is really passionate about other than her job?

"The ""UC Socially Dead"" stereotype definitely has truth to it but I think that worked out really well for me.","I am saying this as a senior. UCSD is a lot of things, but a party school it is not. The school is still social enough that I got the best of both worlds.

Anyone who thinks UCSD is actually socially dead probably didn't spend enough time on campus. Most of us have friends, and other than this year's freshmen, most of us went to at least a handful of parties last year. These parties probably weren't as wild as the ones at SDSU can get, and they probably didn't happen as frequently, but they existed.

I have never been *that* social, but I've always been social enough that I'd be doing at least something fun with my friends every weekend, save midterms and finals week. We might've gone to a party, we might've hiked Rose Canyon, we might've just sat around and talked, etc. Those were good times.

In freshman year, this girl on my floor really wanted to study on a Friday night, but we made her come to a party with us. She made $100 at that party on a bet that she could do a backflip. I kind of want to say her name because she's come so far, but I won't.

If I'd been at a ""party school,"" I feel like one of two things would have happened. I would have either felt really lonely for not wanting to party as much as others OR I would have started to party so much it would have been unhealthy.

So in retrospect, I feel like I got the best of both worlds here at UCSD.",1607145627,28,0

I think UCSD might be taking in too many students.,"This post might get downvoted to the earth's inner core. Here are my reasons why I think UCSD might be taking in too many students:

Number one, it's already so difficult to get major classes and adding new students makes it even more difficult. I'm a senior, and even I have needed to get in off the waitlist for some required classes. Many underclassmen with later appointment times just can't make it in.

Number two, more spots means less competition, making it easier to get in. This is apparent in some of the new freshmen I met last year (19-20). I had to take some of my final GEs where I met some freshmen, and it felt to me like the new freshman class had included less studious/competitive students.

I AM NOT SAYING LESS COMPETITIVE STUDENTS ARE DUMBER THAN MORE COMPETITIVE STUDENTS ARE. In fact, I'm sure many students who didn't even get into UCSD are much smarter than I am, and will be much more successful than I will be after we graduate. The thing is, what makes you competitive on paper, often translates into what kind of a student you will be in a college classroom. And if you're in a class with a bunch of cut-throat competitive students, you're going to have a different experience compared to if you'd been in a class in which no one studies more than half an hour a day.

UC Riverside is a school with very intelligent people. And it's a great school. I'm sure a lot of research that's done there is beyond what my brain could comprehend. That said, the overall student body at UCR is different from the overall student body at UCSD. I've visited some friends there, and it's a lot more laid back. Let me put it this way. UCR is not a ""socially dead"" school at all.

The question ultimately is this. Does UCSD want its overall student body to stay very competitive and studious? If it does, then I think it is admitting too many students.

But if UCSD wants to turn more into a school like UCR, (which would be totally understandable), then it's going in the right direction.

Not to mention, more students means more tuition money. More students also means more food being bought on campus, books bought at the bookstore, even more scantrons purchased from the downstairs Goody's market.

PSA to UCSD students from the Academic Senate,"Recently a [meme](/r/UCSD/comments/k6oche/click_here_to_go_to_a_prefilled_out_email_for/) was shared to our subreddit outlining a dismissive and disrespectful act that, often, many UCSD students are guilty of.

Please do not demand greater P/NP grade options. This is not the proper way to take classes at the University of California's original and flagship campus. Sucking it up and taking the C- are all proper and acceptable ways to deal with it. Whining about ""COVID-related difficulties"", on the other hand, is not.

As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's name. We feel that P/NP cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with San Diego.

While it may be acceptable to have all other UC campuses offer P/NP due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known campus, and we therefore request that you cease requesting P/NP options this quarter. Thank you.

I think I‚Äôm trying,"My freshman year at UCSD, was probably one of the worst experiences so far to date in my life, I ignored every single flag that told me I probably should seek mental help. I was in a verbally abusive relationship that ended poorly,I had a death in the family, and that tore what was left of my family apart. Even through all of that was still able to pass my courses, I found my very first best friend. I made connections with people that got me through that really low place and move forward. The end of that winter quarter the pandemic had started, and I wasn‚Äôt very negative about it at first. Then I started to realize when I am alone, like really alone, my mind eats at itself. I would venture outside to seek help again, but feel myself being dragged back into my chair to stare at a screen that tells me I‚Äôm either passing or failing, not in classes, at life. I wasn‚Äôt living, just existing.This quarter reminds me so much of my first quarter at college. Alone. Though I know now I am not alone. I choose to be alone. I choose to put in effort or not, I have mental blocks now and then, but I know I am capable of more if I try. I know everyone is capable of so much more when they are surrounded by those they love and trust, by those they choose to be around and help them get through the social construct of college and higher education. I don‚Äôt know what really the point of this post is, but mainly I just wanted to let y‚Äôall know that I see your posts, I read them. I am trying to convince myself I am more than just my grades this quarter, that this world won‚Äôt judge me for not doing more, not doing or being better at certain things. One of my professors this quarter will probably always be my favorite because I know she has been through what is imposter syndrome, something I thought I would never have or experience. So, I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I am trying and I want you guys to try too, it doesn‚Äôt have to get better, you just have to keep going, because good things come to those who seek them, ask for help, tell your parents you love them but you know you aren‚Äôt feeling loved. Today is December 4th, there will be worse days to come and much better days as well. I know you all are capable of finding motivation to look forward to both of those scenarios and come out the other side with a better understanding of who you are and where you have come from.

Basically I made a recent post about how my dropped class came back to webreg. I contacted my prof, VAC, and registrar office. And basically my answer was that there was a two step process. One was confirming i‚Äôm aware of the result of dropping with a W, and the other one is confirming i‚Äôm dropping the class. However, I didn‚Äôt know about that, i just confirmed the first one and thought that was dropping. I want to say it‚Äôs my fault, but not because this is the first time i‚Äôm dropping a class and was confused with why they put confirming in the first place and didn‚Äôt even tell me there is another step to it. I now have an F in that class and there is just no way i can make it up.

But the worst part is that nobody cared. I reached out to my professor telling him the issue and he basically told me that there‚Äôs nothing he can do, and he‚Äôs sorry i had to drop the class and enjoy my break. My VAC told me there‚Äôs nothing they can do, and i should talk to my professor about catching up. The registrar office told me to contact VAC bc nothing they can do, and see my options.

Can a bio major/bio grad student please explain their take on the future of the covid vaccine?,"One of the nice things about UCSD is how many biologists are always around you. Literally if you‚Äôre at Geisel, PC, or even on the bus, at least 10 biologists are normally around you at any given time.

Well I‚Äôm not on campus, so this sub is the next best thing.

I did apply for the bio department, but apparently they don‚Äôt accept people with 1.3 GPAs. Come to think of it, I don‚Äôt know why UCSD took me at all. They must have mixed up my name with another poor soul who ended up at SDSU. Just kidding lol.

**In all seriousness, can someone who understands virology/immunology explain their take on the timeline of the vaccine please?**

Here‚Äôs my understanding. The Pfizer vaccine might get emergency approval as early as December. They‚Äôll start by giving it to front-line workers. From January-March, they‚Äôll start giving it to others. The United States might have herd immunity by May. If the effectiveness rates are as high as they‚Äôre claimed to be (90%, 95%, etc.), then it will be very unlikely for anyone to get covid after most people are vaccinated. Number one, you‚Äôd have to be in the minority of people for whom the vaccine is not effective. Number two you‚Äôd have to come in contact with another person in that same minority. Covid outbreaks happen when many people gather in the same area indoors, breathing the same air. All it takes is one person to be covid positive in that environment, and it spreads like wildfire. If most people in that indoor environment are vaccinated, then an outbreak is very unlikely. Even if one or two people at the party happen to be covid positive, the chances of other people being immunized and not immune are very slim. Plus, new treatments like Regeneron have the green light for covid patients for whom the vaccine does not work.

Some questions I have include the following.

1) Does ‚Äúemergency approval‚Äù change anything as far as effectiveness is concerned? Once again, I‚Äôm not a biologist, but ‚Äúemergency approval‚Äù sounds rushed.

2) Even though campus probably won‚Äôt re-open soon, when might other things (libraries, coffee shops, movie theaters, etc.) re-open?",1606249424,1,0

International student problem,"Earlier this quarter, I was enrolled in 3 courses, one of them being cse152a, a retake course that I previously earned a D on. The professor had explained that he is teaching the material of 2 graduate level courses in this quarter to have us learn more, but with me that is a problem. I took this course the first time around as an interest and quickly discovered that I am not good at the subject, like, at all. I just wanted a C or a B on the retake and call it a learning experience. But as this quarter progressed I found out that may not be the case, as I am very lost on the material and really don't see myself getting a grade higher than a F, which not only defeats the purpose of the retake, and will restrict me from trying this again. 

So, I dropped the class, big mistake.

In context, I had done similar thing in the past (sophmore year to be exact) where I dropped one course from a 3 course quarter, which was fine since I had 4 courses both on fall and spring that year. But this time, I forgot about the SEVP stuff, and I dropped the class without asking the international office about it. I had already submitted a request of RCL as the email informing me of the situation came in, and is planning to talk to a counselor tomorrow, and I am currently freaking out.

UCSD is being unfair to transfer students,"I am a senior &amp; I am a transfer student (I transferred Fall 2019). I feel like UCSD is being unfair to us. There have been a lot of labs wherein they do not like to have seniors as their research assistants and they prefer sophomores &amp; juniors. How can a transfer student be able to find a lab they can work for? Our first year at UCSD (as a junior) is pretty much dedicated to acclimatizing to the new school. Most of us came from community college and we have semesters. It's a new change for us to be in quarter system when we are used to being in a semester system.  We do not know much about the school yet, it is like we were freshmen but only with more experience. And of course, some of us would need 2 research requirements and would like to fulfill them as being research assistants. Some of us would also like to go to Grad School and we wanna make sure we also have a good CV to present. I feel like the priority is being given only to students who started UCSD as a freshmen instead of a transfer student. 

All I am saying is, I feel like UCSD is not giving a shit about the transfer students. (For the love of Sun God, all transfer students are scattered all over campus. They took away The Village and gave it to freshmen). I remember how nice it was to live with other Transfer students in the same community. But now look at us. We are all scattered just so the new 7th college would get their own little neighborhood. To be honest The Village was the one of the best thing that happened to transfer students, but now it's all gone. 

Back to my actual concern. It is just annoying looking at labs wherein on their website it says: ""We prefer sophomores &amp; juniors."" Like that is just some kind of bullshit. DO THEY EXPECT US TO APPLY FOR LABS BEFORE WE EVEN TRANSFER? Like can we not get situated to the new environment first before we apply for labs? I am not complaining because I cannot find a lab to work for. I already found a lab I can work for. All I am saying is that UCSD must consider the struggles of transfer students too. It's just so unfair for a lab to pick a sophomore or a junior over a senior (who needed research credit to graduate).  Those sophomores and juniors have like 1-2 years left at UCSD. Why not prioritize the seniors (who are transfers) when it comes to these things. 

All I can see is that if you are a student who started UCSD as a freshmen, you have better chances of putting a lot of great things on your CV for grad school but if you are a transfer student you just have to go fuck yourself.

I apologize for the rant. I feel like someone needs to say these things.",1606204389,1,0

Next quarter probably won‚Äôt be any different. Maybe I should start getting those easy electives out of the way.,"I‚Äôm not speaking from the angle of whether next quarter will be virtual or in-person.

I‚Äôm talking about the amount of stress and the unfair expectations from the school. On one hand, I get it. If you‚Äôre taking combinatorics, that‚Äôs not an easy class, and you shouldn‚Äôt expect an easy passing grade just because the class is virtual.

At the same time, professors are giving so much unnecessary homework, lectures are unbelievably dense, classes are way harder than they would otherwise have been, and you can‚Äôt even take P/NP grades.

This has been difficult all the while this Fall. I hate to be gloomy, but there‚Äôs no reason for Winter to be different. I don‚Äôt think professors are going to have an epiphany and say ‚Äúoh I just realized something! Giving students so much work is causing problems. I should give less!!‚Äù

I have two ‚Äúfun‚Äù electives to take, and I think I can take them whenever I want to. I‚Äôve thought about waiting to take them in summer, IF there‚Äôs a potential in-person option.

Will summer classes be held in-person this summer, requiring all enrolled students to attend? Of course not, but I‚Äôm still crossing my fingers on the off-chance that enough people are vaccinated, and there‚Äôs an in-person option. By ‚Äúin-person option,‚Äù I mean class is live-streamed/recorded for people who don‚Äôt come, but students who are vaccinated have the option to show up in person.

I might also take those electives next quarter, so that I can take a breather. And spring is going to be the final stretch to bring it home (I‚Äôm a fifth-year senior).

Your venting is valid.,"Please don't tell me I have a final that can improve my grade. Don't tell me I have a few more weeks. I know. I'm still trying but everything is demotivating. I was my high school valedictorian and a competitive gymnast. I know how to study. I know how to plan my time. I know how to work hard. I worked hard to earn a scholarship to this school and I will continue to set high goals for myself and work towards them. But right now that's all I'm doing and I can feel myself crushed under the weight of my classes. 

I feel like I'm losing control of everything. I came into this quarter with high expectations for myself even so far as to taking two honors courses as a first year and I'm afraid I can't reach them. All of the clubs and organizations I'm in are remote and despite me applying and obtaining an officer position in one of them, sometimes it is just difficult to get out of bed to show up to a meeting. I even applied for research this quarter. (I was rejected.) Along with that, I have to put in extra hours to take care of my grandpa during the pandemic and most of my family income relies on our nail salon which are not a reliable business nowadays. 

Today I wanted a head start on my math homework and got one of my answers wrong and I just shut down. I couldn't even maintain a perfect grade in my homework category. It's just all so demotivating and even when I told myself there would be another quiz, another test, another homework assignment, etc. I just  can not. The week of my chemistry quiz, my dog died and as much as I tried to shift my focus away from it, I just couldn't bring myself to. 

For everyone telling me that I sound defeatist or that I should be able to stay motivated by just looking forward to the future, please... it's not that easy for me. I went to almost every office hours, arranged study groups online, organized club events, etc. I'm really trying my best here. I don't know if it's just because I'm not smart enough but I'm struggling so much here. There were times while I was driving that I was tempted to just crash into something so that I can finally get some rest. 

TLDR: I'm really trying everything I can here yet I'm barely getting by this quarter. This is one of the few spaces I can anonymously vent and I'm sure that goes the same for many other students on this sub forum as well. This was a hard quarter. I just want to feel like someone is listening to me even if they aren't so, please, validate other students on this forum whenever they are venting or just talking about how stressed they are. Be kind. We really need that, especially now.",1606181282,1,0

Is it any realistic hope for summer session to be in-person?,"I hope I'm not posting too much on this sub. If you get tired of seeing my posts, please let me know and I won't post more than once a day here.

I'm a senior who's really sad that my last year of undergrad is being spent this way. For everyone in the Class of 2022 and younger, you guys are really really lucky. You'll probably never take another ""normal"" day on campus for granted again. You'll be back when it's safe, and you'll know what it feels like not to have that option.

On a smaller scale, this is almost like having spent time in prison and counting your blessings after being released. No matter what happens, you'll never take freedom from granted again after you know what it feels like for freedom to be taken away from you.

What hurts me the most is how I never got to say goodbye. In senior year of high school, my friends and I had ""senioritis,"" we did all this stupid shit, we knew where we'd be going for college, and all we needed to do was hold onto a GPA high enough not to be rescinded. When we turned 18, we'd call ourselves in sick, and we went to the beach so many times that the attendance office told us we couldn't graduate if we kept those shenanigans up.

On one instance, my dad called at midnight asking where I was. I said ""I'm in an Airbnb with my girlfriend in Alpine."" My dad said ""I should've known.""

Senior year, you know it's your last year, and you've been sprinting for so long that you can finally take a cool down lap.

Unfortunately with the current situation, we can't do anything like that. It's not realistic for people to be back on campus by Winter or Spring.

BUT maybe there's a chance for Summer. If the vaccines are available and widespread by summer, I can save a class or two to take then, and I can get some semblance of a final quarter in summer session. It won't be the same, but at least it will be something.

But who knows? Maybe that's not possible either.

Public voting is open for the Torrey Pines Fire Station design,"The Torrey Pines Fire Station (SDFD Station 52) will be located along North Torrey Pines Road, near the Genesee Ave. intersection and [just north](https://goo.gl/maps/1C2Zxp7ghsuuV51o8) of UCSD's Northview Tennis Courts. The land has already been sold to the City, and construction is slated to begin in 2021. However, it appears that there's a **[public input component](https://www.sandiego.gov/cip/projectinfo/UCSDFirestation)**, with voting currently regarding four potential designs for the fire station. I figured UCSD students would be interested in making sure their voices are also included in this discussion, so I thought I'd share the link here (I personally have no horse in this race, I'm an alumnus who moved away two years ago). The voting period ends on January 8, 2021.

I've also included some thoughts on the four proposals; I'm curious to hear what you guys think. I am not an architect or landscape architect, just an enthusiast.

[Proposal A](https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/torrey_pines_new_a.pdf): This is a great option. For me, it's between this one and Proposal C. My initial reaction was that the area surrounding that part of campus/the Gliderport isn't as rustic as the renderings suggest. The first few slides suggest a design that would be more at home in Santa Cruz than La Jolla. But the design itself is thoughtful; it's simple, pretty, and wouldn't look bad in the North Point area by any means. It's also the most compact version by far. The parking lot is well-screened and the building angles are very reminiscent of other nearby constructions, like the Sanford Consortium and Rady School. I like it.

[Proposal B](https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/torrey_pines_new_b.pdf): Making something this inoffensive means you're also making something completely devoid of personality. This building doesn't reflect the Torrey Pines area's character at all, in my opinion, and is the kind of cookie-cutter institutional architecture that is plaguing the entire American Southwest. And why is it so big? Redeeming features: nice lighting fixtures and staircase. It's probably going to win, but I personally hate it. 

[Proposal C](https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/community_drawings-c.pdf): Once you get past the terrible PowerPoint, this is actually a beautiful design. It's a low-slung building from the important viewing angles, but there's enough visual interest and the materials are nicely chosen. I like how the parking is screened from both North Point Lane and from North Torrey Pines Rd. travelers, and it follows the RIMAC Annex and Sanford buildings' model nicely. I'm going to end up voting for this one or Proposal A, but this one feels like the architect knows North Point better. I also love that patio canopy and the plant choices. Downside: it's huge. Overall a great design.

[Proposal D](https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/community_drawings-d.pdf): This is an abomination. What is that palette? It looks like it was colored by a 7-year-old. The massing is objectively awful and the materials are weirdly reflective. If this actually gets built, I hope we collectively burn it to the ground.

(You can kinda think of it as Jeopardy with teams - if you did something like San Diego Academic League in high school, that's even closer to what it's like)

Quizbowl is super well-adapted to being online, so our team is still hosting and attending online tournaments aplenty. We send multiple teams to tournaments, so you will be able to play official matches this year even if you're a total novice. In fact, we have an intercollegiate tournament for *new players only* coming up on January 10th! We're also hosting twice-weekly practices during the quarter, starting on Monday 1/4.

I maxxed out credits?! 259 units?!,"Trying not to panic, and the VAC isn't open :-) 

TL;DR: When I finish as a transfer at UCSD, I'll somehow end up with 259 credits, and the only source I found on how many credits the ""maximum"" number a student can have is 200. Does anyone the details of this limitation?

I was innocently filling out the quarter-by-quarter planning sheet on my double-major form (I'm a transfer, one quarter deep in this swamp) and it doesn't look too bad-- I won't ever need to go beyond 16 units in a quarter, and I only need 16 units over my summer break. I'm passionate about both majors and would really love the opportunities offered by being a major in both (uncapped, social science) divisions.

I came in maxxing out the number of transfer credits, which should in theory put me at 105 credits coming in, but the academic history tab on TritonLink weighs out this transfer credit to 123 credits. It's from a California Community College, idk if that affects it, whatever. So then I have 20 credits from AP. I took one UCSD class over the summer, then four classes this fall. That puts me at 163 credits so far, and then 6 more quarters (5 regular quarters plus one full summer quarter) of 16 units equals 96 credits, means I will graduate with 259 credits. Let me break it down so it isn't a chunk of text:

123 (transfer credit)

\+ 20 (AP credit)

\+ 20 (UCSD credits so far)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

163 credits

\+96 (more credits I'll be getting to graduate)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

259 credits

&amp;#x200B;

The maximum unit limitation looks like it may be for students who've been at UCSD for longer, and now they set a quarter cap instead? Honestly, I've just been feeling pretty alone doing this whole transfer thing and my brain has been looking for the ""See?! They're going to know it was a mistake to have accepted you"" evidence since I got my acceptance letter, so anytime I turn paperwork in, I worry that it won't be perfect. If anyone knows anything on this, it'd be much appreciated. Thanks so much and stay safe out there, Tritons!",1609302430,1,0

What are your thoughts on non-prescription Adderall use at UCSD?,"Please do not dox anyone or talk about where to get Adderall. The point of this post is that I genuinely want to hear your *thoughts* on drugs like Adderall, based on your experience at UCSD.

When I say ""Adderall,"" I am referring to non-prescription use.

As a fifth year senior, I have never used Adderall, but not out of virtue. I genuinely never felt like I needed to take it. My major, internships, and workload were all manageable for me without needing the help of Adderall. I drink two or three cups of coffee everyday, and that has always been enough for me.

I also have had kind of a drinking problem, and Adderall + alcohol can be a really fatal combination.

The only time I really considered taking Adderall was in freshman year, since I was struggling in a BILD class (the one you'd place into if you got a 4 on the AP bio test). It was so hard for me to read the Campbell Bio book, and lectures were really hard for me to keep up with. I decided that if I needed to take Adderall for an *intro* course, then I was probably in the wrong department. I barely passed that class and switched majors to international business. From then on, I was no longer testing my cognitive limits enough to even consider taking Adderall.

Maybe I could've stuck around and tried to make BILD work without Adderall, but I have no regrets on that front. This is a discussion for another time.

Opinion on my new roommate?,"My roommate recently moved in and because of his behaviour I am contemplating moving out. Please tell me if I am in my own head or if there's something odd going on. I am not trying to be rude but due to his behaviour I truly do not believe he is a UCSD student as he lacks intellectual behaviour and is extremely ghetto (like Compton/Detroit ghetto)

- On the first day of meeting one another, when I used a dish apparently that was his (may or may not have been considering we have enough dishes to serve the Queen and all her guest) he had a thousand yard stare and said ""don't ever do that sh** again""

- He has left the kitchen in a state (unwashed dishes, bar top covered in food, freeze, stains, etc.)

- He is open about his drug use, as far as I know it's just pot but considering his behaviour it may be other wise. He has given me the impression he is doing something much harder, perhaps meth or crack. He has shown tweeking like behaviour with the thousand yard stares, randomly screening at the top of his lungs ""OOH, EE, AHH F*CK,"" and much more. What I thought was possibly tourettes was debunked by his behaviour of randomly forgetting things, saying sentences that had not proper meaning, abnormal stareing behaviour, his lack of sleep for long periods of time and much more. 

- last night he randomly grabbed the remote from me in a very aggressive way without saying a single word and just turned the TV down (it was already at a state of whisper) then goes to his room without saying a word and starts screaming while bumping base to hood rat rap. 

- finally, I wake up this morning and the power chord to the shared telivision has gone missing. The telivision belongs to the other roommate and not the troublesome one that just moved in.

I honestly fear living with this dude as our rooms don't have locks on them, and our food is in a shared fridge. I honestly feel unsafe and extremely uncomfortable.

[Lowbrow] The best thing about the Apple Watch is not having to take my phone out for Duo Mobile's 2-step verification.,"I'm not here to plug the Apple Watch. In fact, I find some of its features to be really useless and misleading. It thought I was standing for 12 hours yesterday, and believe me, I was too lazy to even sit up for most of the day.

The one thing about the Apple Watch that totally kicks ass is the fact that I can ""approve"" logins on Duo Mobile without having to take my phone out. The watch vibrates on my wrist, and I click ""approve.""

BEFORE I got the Apple Watch, if I wanted to log into my UCSD email, then to Canvas, then to MyTritonLink, Duo Mobile would make me take out my phone three different times to confirm each login - even if all three of those logins were within two minutes.

I know that is the epitome of first world problems, but it was kind of annoying.

The Apple Watch has completely eradicated that first world problem.

Speaking of features, the sleep monitor is also bizarrely accurate. If I wake up late at night to use the bathroom, and go back to sleep, it picks up on that. So I've always assumed the sleep reports (REM, deep sleep, etc.) are relatively accurate too.

I'm not in any of the STEM departments at UCSD, so I wouldn't know very much about how beneficial the features are compared to other products on the market, but being from Cupertino, I know way too many software engineers, and I know multiple Apple employees who work on UI for the Apple Watch, which were produced by UCSD. That's relevant here... I guess.

Freshman Caught Cheating UCSD- Advice,"

Hello, 

So this semester quite a few students at UCSD taking math have been caught cheating. I wanted to know what happens if your a FRESHMAN and you get caught cheating using Chegg. I already know the type of info Chegg gives such as- IP address, they flag your account and question, and Etc from the different threads. The professor sent a email saying tht he already filled a report to the AI office about cheating on the final exam (to everyone in the class). I believe and there handling the cheaters and cases.

I mostly wanted to hear from other students what exactly happens to you? If it‚Äôs ur first time getting caught, what are some common consequences. 
How long do you have to wait to receive a email from your university about academic dishonesty.

This question is directed at upper class men who have been caught/ or have info.",1608329125,2,0
Advice on having to relocate to less diverse parts of the country?,"I‚Äôm posting this here because UCSD is a really diverse place. People from so many different places go to this school. I‚Äôve met people from all kinds of religions, countries, states, etc. And we‚Äôre accustomed to seeing diversity.

I think that says something about San Diego too. La Jolla/University City are mostly white upper-middle class communities, and San Diego has leaned Republican until recently, but this is not a white farm town in Alabama. A white guy with a Persian girlfriend wouldn‚Äôt be puzzling for anyone to see in San Diego. In other areas, that would be really confusing.

There are other parts of the country which are not so diverse. I‚Äôm not saying people in those areas are necessarily hateful, but diversity can be very surprising and foreign. I wouldn‚Äôt want to move into an area like that.

I‚Äôve been on road trips to areas where people get stared at for looking different. Again, that doesn‚Äôt mean they hate you, but they‚Äôll think you‚Äôre foreign because they‚Äôre not used to seeing people who look like you.

Everyone in San Diego is accustomed to seeing diversity. I don‚Äôt think anyone would be surprised to see a hijab, a yarmulke, or someone on the phone speaking a different language. Diversity is not an abstract concept for anyone who lives in San Diego.

As a senior, I am looking for jobs in other areas. San Diego is not the only place in the world that‚Äôs diverse, but there are areas that are not.

Do you have any advice? Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking all this lol",1608329074,8,0

Either you keep living under your parents‚Äô roof OR you find a job that pays you a sustainable wage. For most of us, those are the only two options we have. It‚Äôs no secret that the job market is a competitive place and finding a job is so fucking difficult.

Who‚Äôs fault is this I don‚Äôt know, but that‚Äôs not relevant here.

The demoralizingly transparent thing about LinkedIn is that it tells you how many other people have applied for the same job. I‚Äôm not saying this to demean myself, nor out of imposter syndrome, but I really am not all that distinguished from other applicants. I am not a neurosurgeon or one of Google‚Äôs founding software engineers. I cannot expect to be hired anywhere I send my resume.

What would you think of a building on campus where students go to take short naps?,"I know this sounds absurd, but hear me out.

If you have a dorm, you probably wouldn‚Äôt need to use this. You also probably wouldn‚Äôt need it if you get all your sleep at night.

But I know some people - both insanely busy students and NCAA athletes, who rely on a nap during the day in order to get REM sleep. Medical students especially do this a lot.

Many people take naps in their apartment, but I‚Äôve also seen some people napping in their car, because maybe they live too far away. This ‚Äúsleep library‚Äù would give you a place on campus to take a nap.

NBA players have road games that end at 10PM in different time zones, flights early the next morning, and practice everyday they‚Äôre not playing. So they don‚Äôt have time for 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep at night. It‚Äôs very common for NBA players to develop the routine of taking a nap during the day.

You‚Äôre probably not an NBA player, but there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôre just as busy as one, and so you might use this service if it existed. Once again, if you lived in a dorm, you‚Äôd have a dorm to sleep in at any time of day, but most people who aren‚Äôt freshmen do not have that option.

This ‚Äúsleep library‚Äù would be a place that you could check into when you get sleepy, it would be dark, the AC would be running, and you‚Äôd give them your ID. They‚Äôd give you a bedsheet, pillow, and blanket. You‚Äôd quietly make your bed and take a nap for an hour. At the end of that hour, someone would come and wake you up, so you‚Äôd throw your sheets in a big laundry basket, take your stuff, and carry on with the day.

Maybe they could even go by a ‚Äúcredit‚Äù system. Everyone gets a free 3 hours of sleep library credit, and after you use that up, you have to pay for more credits. That would keep this place from always filling up with the same people.

I would‚Äôve said they could keep it open all night too, in case your roommates are getting loud, but then too many people would use it on the regular.

Maybe they could even have multiple places on campus for something like this.

The only issue might be noise. Some people snore really loudly, which is ok, but I can see that being a problem in a room that people are trying to sleep in. I don‚Äôt think anyone wants to wear noise cancelling headphones to sleep, and I don‚Äôt know if any other kind of noise-cancelling technology exists to cancel out noise in the same room.

And of course, certain behaviors in the sleep library would get you banned.",1608273493,39,0

Math makes me cry,"This is a venting post fyi... 

Just finished taking my math 3c final, got a 67%. grade went down from a b+ to a b- :( still the final project left to grade which I know I did not get an A on for sure... Hahhhhh I'm supposed to take math 10a 10b and 11 for my major but how the hell am I supposed to pass those classes if I can't even do well in pre calc. This sucks because I did well in the other classes I'm taking and I was happy with my grades until now. I have to tell my parents my math grade too, should I just lie? Why do I suck at math? Can't really change majors or else I'll get the wooping of a life time plus there's nothing else I'm interested in. My GPA, hurts just thinking about it. Why do I feel like a failure? I also have to take the physics 1 and 2 series like how am I supposed to do that if I cant even do precalc. I don't feel smart enough to be a biology major and online classes are so hard for me, I learn better in person where I can work through things with classmates and professors near by. I feel like an imposter, how did I even get into this school.

How do you read a textbook well?,"One of the reasons I left the bio major back in freshman year was that I didn‚Äôt have the time or appetite to read those long ass fucking chapters from the Campbell Biology 10th edition (lol the eighth and ninth were literally the same and much cheaper). And my professors were the kind who made sure you‚Äôd struggle if you didn‚Äôt read.

Having to leave a capped major was kind of sad at first, but in the grand scheme of things, it was for the better. The textbook thing is still an issue.

If I needed to read a chapter from the textbook, I would sit there and read every word from beginning to end, all 40 pages. It would take 3-4 hours. I know that can‚Äôt possibly be the right way to do it.

For anybody thats had him as their TA, on average, how difficult has his grading been on the Final Papers? For anybody who's taken the course in general, how hard have your TA's graded you compared to your first reading journals? Note that this quarter (due to it being online), the only actual graded things that we've had are the first reading journal and the Final Paper. The other things are graded for completion and effort.

TBT to last year.,"I saw another post like this but Fall 2019 finals were in a different world. You stayed up late to study. When the clock hit midnight, they came around Geisel to scan your IDs and make sure you‚Äôre a real UCSD student.

Audrey‚Äôs must‚Äôve been swimming in cash from all those kids studying late at Geisel and buying their food.

And even sadder, we‚Äôre creeping up on a calendar year since our last in-person classes. Pretty soon, the jaw-dropping email Khosla sent us about how Spring quarter would be all virtual WILL REACH ITS ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY.

And ten minutes before the test, you‚Äôd SPRINT somewhere to buy a scantron. The cashier would look at you like ‚Äúthis motherfucker is running late‚Äù and would say ‚Äúgood luck on your final!‚Äù

Your UCSD grades don't define you,"As alumni I've been in your position. UCSD was the hardest thing I've ever done and made me doubt if I was ever a good student. The stress, the exams every three weeks, the hyper competitive bullshit, the ""weeder classes""  designed to weed you out from certain paths. As a graduate student currently, I know the challenges of being a student in a pandemic. I know teaching yourself from a video lecture is extremely difficult. Not to mention, everyone having to be isolated. 

But you are so much stronger than you think. The grades you get during your undergraduate career don't define who you really are. It doesn't define your work ethic or how smart you are. Whoever taught you that your worth was based on a score or a letter was wrong. If you need to just survive the next four, five years, you do it. If you need to just survive day by day, do it. Your grades don't reflect how smart, innovative, ambitious and awesome you are. I know GPA is an important requirement for grad school and med school. But one thing I've learned is that it's not your time at UCSD that will define the rest of your life path. It's not about the Ws you needed to take to survive. It's about how you course corrected and came back from it. I don't know who needs to hear this but you deserve to be kind to yourself. You're going through school at an extremely difficult university during one of the most challenging times in recent history. You deserve to forgive yourself for failed exams or quizzes or the Ws you needed to take to mentally just get through. You can come back from any failures or mistakes. Be kind to yourself. You deserve to take care of yourself physically and mentally too. Please seek out help sooner rather than later. You are so much more than a transcript or numbers on a page. And I'm so proud of you.
