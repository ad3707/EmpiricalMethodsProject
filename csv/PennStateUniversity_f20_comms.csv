"Interviewing is absolutely a skill that comes more easily with practice and giving yourself a chance to think about the type of questions asked is a great step, so give yourself credit for that! My guess is, as an on-campus position, those interviewing are used to having people in with a wide range of experience both with jobs and interviews. 
As for your question about the situation-style prompts, consider why you don’t tend to have group conflict. Are you someone who finds it easy to reach a compromise? Do you like to come up with a plan before starting to work to avoid those issues that may arise later on? It can seem unnatural to sell yourself, but these types of questions are a great chance to emphasize your strengths. Even asking friends or family for some ideas can help (and it can be a great confidence boost too!)
Really, every interview you go on is great practice and preparation for the next. I know I’ve seen some mixed reviews about the career center, but in my interactions I’ve found them to be helpful and full of great resources. I’d really encourage taking advantage of what they offer (including mock interviews!) as you apply to positions in the future. 
You’ve got this!",1604155447,1,0

I don't even know how to really answer this because I've never really had any group conflicts. I overthink too much and I just start stuttering and pausing because I don't know how to answer it.

"Readyboost is only worth using when you have small amounts of ram. In your current case you do, but the speed of your ram after using readyboost is based on the read/write speeds of the usb drive. So if you used it in a usb3.0 port (usually blue on the usb port) and had a really nice flash drive it could be useful. But ram will always be the better option. 

If you have larger amounts of ram readyboost isn't really worth it.",1604150140,1,0

"My guess is that your ram is holding you back from your programs not running smooth. Since the minimum requirements for running windows is 4gbs of ram, most of that is used by the system and you really only get like 1-2 maybe for actually programs. So switching between excel and PowerPoint is really taxing when you don't have much ram to ""split the load"". 


I would still highly recommend getting the SSD and putting windows on it. (IT desk might be able to help if you don't know how), but it saves so much time and your system feels snappy and fast. It's one of the things I recommend older computers that you dont want to upgrade to make it faster.",1604149671,1,0
"I don’t know what the Learning Assistant position is, but I’ve been on many interview committees for my job. Remember that they called you for an interview because there was something they liked about your application (assuming they didn’t call everyone in, which is unlikely!) Before you go, think about your strengths and how you’ve handled conflicts, both with people and projects. Since you haven’t had a job before, you can consider how you have worked on group projects, collaborated with others on a team, or managed a busy schedule. We often framed questions as “Tell me about a time when...” and I’m sure there are a bunch of lists like that floating around the internet!

I used to be a pretty nervous person when going on my own interviews and would often count myself out the moment I was asked a question I didn’t 100% know how to answer. I then had someone remind me that ultimately, the people on the other side want you to do well and want you to be a good match. Now that I’ve been the interviewer, I definitely know that to be true-it always made my job easier to have competent, confident candidates in front of me- so do your prep work beforehand and remind yourself why you’re a great (not perfect!) fit for the position. Good luck!",1604149196,1,0

"It's how the US has become unfortunately.  It's US vs. THEM in everything anymore and I don't understand it.

I'm going to keep the politics out of it and just talk about...football.

Ohio State vs. Penn State.  A major rivalry exists as I'm sure you all know.  When I worked at the library and it was before opening time, we'd get people parking at the Nittany Parking Deck and they'd wander down to the library and sometimes they'd want a bathroom.  They probably had dads like mine who'd insist on driving four hours without a restroom visit and I hated that so much.  If you're in my car, we stop no less than every two hours at most!  I digress.

I'd open the door to let them know we're closed but I'd ask what they needed.  If it were directions, I'd happily tell them and even ask if they wanted a paper map and send them on their way.  If it were the restroom, I'd allow them in, escort them there, stand outside and let them do their thing.

I never commented on their clothing colors or that they were from Ohio or Michigan or wherever and that was because I felt that as an employee, but also as a local that I should try to welcome the people and treat them as a guest.  They without exception were grateful and I hope that they got a good first impression of being at Penn State.

So many people here would be hostile towards them and it doesn't seem right.  It's a game!  Yes, I cheer for PSU of course, but I love to see a good competitive game where the players are working hard and the people are being entertained.  There's just too much hostility anymore.",1604113353,1,0

"Taking it right now asynchronously. I personally skim the book and skip around the lecture videos. My section has a quiz every week, a lab most weeks (very easy points, literally garenteed a 100%), and 2 midterms plus a final.

Labs are very easy, I study for the quizzes by doing practice problems in the book, and the exams require a moderate understanding of material to do very well on. I would say the class is an easy B-, and if you put your right foot forward you should get an A.

"The law firm hired former U.S. attorney general Richard Thornburgh, former FBI supervisory special agent and former state prosecutor James Clemente, and Dr. Fred Berlin, a treating physician, psychiatrist, psychologist and expert in sexual disorders and pedophilia at The Johns Hopkins Hospital and School of Medicine. The report, titled ""The Rush To Injustice Regarding Joe Paterno,"" was provided to ESPN ahead of its release on the condition ESPN not divulge its contents publicly until Sunday morning.

""The lack of factual support for the [Freeh report's] inaccurate and unfounded findings related to Mr. Paterno and its numerous process-oriented deficiencies call into question the credibility of the entire report,"" Thornburgh writes. ""In my opinion, the Freeh report is seriously flawed, both with respect to the process of [its] investigation and its findings related to Mr. Paterno ... There was just a rush to injustice.""

• No evidence exists that Paterno concealed critical information about Sandusky.
• Paterno, ""based on a review of all available evidence, including discussions with attorneys representing Curley, Schultz and Spanier made no attempt to hide any information, hinder or impede any investigation or limit the number of people who were informed of"" one the key incidents in the Sandusky scandal. In that 2001 incident, then-assistant coach Mike McQueary witnessed the assault of a boy in the shower by Sandusky and told Paterno about it the next day.
• No evidence exists that a desire to avoid bad publicity ever motivated Paterno.
• That the Freeh report ""ignored decades of expert research and analysis of the appropriate way to understand and investigate a child sexual victimization case. Consequently, the Freeh report missed a tremendous opportunity to educate the public regarding the behavior of 'nice-guy' acquaintance child molesters.""
• Freeh's investigators ""produced a report that fit their expectations despite contrary evidence or a more reasonable interpretation.""
• The report was ""oversold to the public, and Penn State officials, the NCAA and other bodies detrimentally relied upon it. The limitations of the investigation, which were numerous and defining, were not adequately explained or understood.""
• Sandusky was an exceptionally effective manipulator and deceiver ... One of the most respected child sexual victimization experts in the world has concluded that Joe Paterno, like many others, did not recognize Jerry Sandusky as a child molester after the 2001 incident.""
• Freeh investigators' access to vital documents and critical witnesses was severely limited. ""These limitations, which were understated or ignored in the report, call into question the legitimacy of the entire report.""
• The Freeh report is ""uniformly biased"" against Paterno, and its authors ""ascribe motives to people they never met or interviewed and interpret ambiguous documents with a clarity and decisiveness that is impossible to justify.""
• One major flaw in the Freeh report is that it does not follow a typical standard of courtroom examinations and independent investigations -- the consideration of a person's lifetime record of ""moral conduct and altruism."" It treats Paterno's long life ""as if it were irrelevant to the case.""

"Discredited by whom? Did they throw out all court cases, fines and charges against those involved? They did not. Did PSU receieve the nearly $4 million in legal fees back after the investigation was discredited? They did not.

All Ive read was that the Paterno Family hired their own personal investigator to go after Freeh who “had kept email contact with the NCAA through the investigation process and that was referred to as a conflict of interest because of PSU forfeiting their previous 11 seasons under Paterno, and Paterno’s wins/titles as a coach.”

So they cared more about tarnishing Joes and the football teams reputation than they did about children being raped while in their young football programs is what I took away from all that. It certainly doesn’t make what happened less extreme or make it go by the wayside because of a single investigative bias by Freeh.

“In November 2011, Jerry Sandusky was arrested and charged with sexually abusing eight boys — including one in a shower on campus a decade before, an incident witnessed by a young graduate assistant who informed legendary coach Joe Paterno and two campus administrators, none of whom contacted authorities. Within days, Penn State’s trustees had fired Paterno. In the ensuing 12 months, Paterno died, Sandusky was convicted, a university-commissioned investigation led by former FBI director Louis Freeh concluded Paterno and three administrators covered up for Sandusky, and prosecutors brought cover-up-related charges against the three administrators.”

I don't have any advice on instructors since I chose to do the 2-2 program (that might be something worth looking at too, if it comes to that). 

Remember during the first two years, they purposely fail you (just my opinion). So you have to study your ass off for every single exams, especially the ones that require C's or higher (PHYS 211, 212, MATH 140, 141, 250/251, CHEM 110, EMCH 211, 212, 213). But once you declare the major, everything will go smoothly. Make sure you talk to your advisor regularly to see what kind of options you have.

Just replied with a similar answer. I won’t consider giving them a dime until I’m making good money with no loans left. They nickel and dime you for four years and have the balls to call and ask for donations once you get your piece of paper. A lot of the blame falls on the government for not addressing the student loan crisis we have but it doesn’t make me want to give the university any more money than I have to already,1608339257,9,0
"I definitely agree with this. I graduated in 2012 and I love Penn State and thoroughly enjoyed my time there, but there is no way in hell I'm donating them a penny.

I never planned on donating anyway. They took enough of my money these past 4 years and I wouldn’t even consider it until my loans are paid off.

Your story and words are truly awe-inspiring. You have so much courage and I commend you for spreading a positive message during these difficult times. The way you have turned your life around for the better means it's never too late to change.

Although not really academically struggling (I've barely gotten by a few times, but classes haven't been a main source of my unhappiness), I've felt pretty down about being socially inept. There are many times where my self-confidence completely drains itself easily, whether by intimidation, feeling dumb and in the presence of others my age who are much more smarter than me. I lacked the education and skills of learning many things growing up, so I am easily influenced of not feeling normal. It's also affected my social ability to make friends which ended up making me feel lonely and spiraling into an even lower point.

That has been my biggest weakness, and although I'm learning to not compare myself to others too much, I strive to learn new things everyday, even if its the most basic things I never experienced. This, to me, has been a long and ongoing battle and still gets me down from time to time. Some days worse than others.

"Ugh, sorry to hear that so many of you are having this experience with professors. I promise you that not all professors are indifferent to the work they're asking you to do. Both my partner and I are faculty and we're hyper-aware of the kind of pressure many of our students after under because we're feeling it too! We're having to do tons more tasks that just weren't necessary we we taught in person, plus we're supervising our child and my sister's children during the days we don't teach because they're doing remote schooling. That's *definitely* not ideal working conditions! So I assume my students are as frazzled as I am, and really try to be as easy on them as possible, while still delivering a quality education. Sigh. It really is rough on a lot of us (students and faculty alike!). 

What makes me most sad about all the comments are the ones suggesting that professors don't care about students' mental health. That's maybe true for a very few professors, but I can tell you that the professors I know care *deeply*. I lie awake at night worrying about my students and how they're handling things. However, I think that in an effort not to feel like they're shortchanging students in class, some profs might be confusing teaching with busy work. It's an easy mistake if you're not used to teaching remotely or hybrid.

I wish I had an answer--a way to call your professor's attention to the level of stress the workload is causing, but I just don't. Complaining about that is like pissing into the wind, I know. But do know that there are professors who are advocating for you behind the scenes--lots of them! I'm one and I know many more. Hopefully we can make a change for all of you. Hang in there.

this gotta be a joke,1602025804,3,0
"when I took that class the quizzes weren’t bad at all, i think i went through her notes/lectures or whatever and studied the guide she gave out. as far as i remember she also gave out practice tests? i’m not entirely sure. i also didn’t ever feel like i did that well on the programming part of the exam (not sure if she’s still doing that this semester) but they must’ve gave a bunch of partial credit.",1602025775,1,0
"Of course! Motivation and discipline is tough, especially at that age, and especially with that major. The worst part is, with academics, you cant really force yourself, or anyone else, to put the effort in if they don't want to. You have to be passionate about what you're doing. Best thing I can think of is try to remind him why he chose Comp Sci in the first place. Try to focus on what he wants to do and why, and how he'll get there, and look past the speed bumps. And be there for him. You have no idea just how much relief my dad just ATTEMPTING to be understanding was after I confessed. Their unconditional love got me through it more than anything.

So once I got home, I kind of just took a couple of weeks to get my life back together and get back into the right headspace. I got set up in my old room, and there was some admin stuff that I needed to take care of like disenrolling from the upcoming semester. After a few days, it started getting easier to talk to my family. Once you admit you messed up and own it, it gets easier to talk about it.

It still stung though at times. I got low again after a friend's wedding. One of my best Friends had just graduated, and got married to his highschool sweetheart, who was starting her Ph.D. And though it was fun, the whole night was just a huge reminder of my failings, and it was tough to get through.

My mom actually called the school at one point, to see if there's anything that could be done about the mountain of F's I got. Unfortunately there wasn't. They said had I actually gone to the school and told them about my problems before my last semester ended, they could've done a retroactive withdrawal and I could've gotten a lot of bad grades expunged, but as it was, the grades were posted in my transcript, and it would take damn-near an act of congress to get them removed.

Also, once you're no longer a full time student, the student loans start billing, and that was tough. 2010 wasn't that far removed from the nadir of the Great Recession, and NO ONE was hiring. I put in applications \*everywhere\*, but there were no jobs. I got turned down for a part-time Wal-Mart job.

Luckily, my creditors were sympathetic, and put my loans into forbearance. Not ideal, because they still collect interest, but also took the pressure of a looming bankruptcy off of my shoulders.

Eventually I remembered my time at ROTC, and decided to give enlistment a try. Went to the recruiter, scored really well on the ASVAB test, and by an incredible stroke of luck, I was selected to be an Avionics Technician, I didn't even know what that was at the time, but I grew to love working with aircraft and electronics. After getting some discipline knocked into me during basic training, I went to and excelled at Technical School, and discovered my passion, and got to start paying my debts off. I started dating a good friend and got married not long after.

My enlistment contract expired this past June, and I decided I didn't want to just work on Avionics systems, I want to design them. And so I got in touch with the registrar, got approved for an academic renewal, and reenrolled in Electrical Engineering.

Overall, time off isn't the worst thing. If it allows you to regroup and get back into the right mindset, it'll definitely help, especially if he's suffering from burnout. One semester will not kill you. I've been out of the game for 10 years, and while it really REALLY sucks trying to reteach yourself high school algebra while taking a college-level physics class, I'm far more motivated now than I was then, and I'm pulling better grades now than I ever did back then.

"Well, I just reread your contributions to this thread and I'll admit I confused you for some of the other people who do seem like they are bullying kids. My bad.

And yes, doctors, lawyers, or whoever else that work like slaves so much that they do not get to enjoy vacations or time off broadly have shit jobs and should actively seek change. Especially skilled employees who can demand better. Frankly, I think you are being disingenuous describing the work world in that way. Plenty of doctors and lawyers spend their spring breaks at resorts in the Caribbean and define set periods of personal time during work weeks. 

You need to revisit the statistics. People working 9-5 is a thing of the past, but if you look at statistics the average American works less than a 9-5, not more. According to the link below [1] the average American works 1781 hours a year. Of course, this is aggregate data, so that is not representative of the average full-time employee, but it is representative of the average worker. The very definition of full-time skews the working hours data, so it cannot be representative of the labor market. Further, if you look at the data [2] of US working hours over time it clearly has a negative slope with local aberrations. So, don't assume an aberration, especially like a pandemic, is the trend.

According to the BLS [3], about 8% of workers report bringing some work home and although the data is dated within its range they report no growth in bringing work home over time. More recent data [4] from UC and the Atlanta fed peg a four-fold increase in working time at home, from 5% to 20%, due to the pandemic. 

Lastly [4], Stanford reports that workers who do work from home record less productivity, which implies improved work-life quality. I know that is true for me.

Instead of scheduling next week during class time, we opted for this Thursday from 11am-11pm. guess who was to go to class, then work, and then come back home and take an exam at 10pm at night.

"You can essentially throw out bad grades on gen Ed’s. Bumping up to a 2.5 should be pretty easy.

On the other hand, I may sound like a dick but I’d recommend sticking from any frats with a 2.1. If you’re looking to get an engineering diploma, you’ve got to get that gpa up. And even if you pass, most companies will only take degrees with over a 3.0 gpa.",1609354441,1,0
"Yeah, I got an a on 211 and a master's in ee and that course was the hardest thing I ever took. Hell, some friends and I joked that they could probably take it, having taken a master's course in every topic and there was still doubt. 

It was the only course I got below a b in at Penn State. I only passed because of the 13% curve bringing me to a c since my initial final grade was either a 28 or a 32.

"Try to take MATH 250 with Handzy if you can. If that means taking another course over the summer, I would do it. Handzy is definitely one of the best professors that I (and many others) have had, at least in our underclassman years.

PHYS 211/212 are pretty infamously poor experiences at UP, so taking them somewhere else (branch campus, community college equivalent) would be a better experience for sure.

I haven't taken these courses over the summer specifically, but I took EMCH 212, MATH 230, and CMPSC 201 all online one summer, and it was ok.",1609353715,1,0

"I'm planning on taking 250, phys 212, and a Cas class. I failed physics 211 this semester by literally 1% so I'd really like to put as much focus into 212 as possible. I need to pass 211 in the spring and then 212 during the summer or I'll  have to start pushing multiple classes back which I'd rather not do. From what I heard I think I should be alright in 250, I enjoyed the DE portion of Calc 2 this past semester, but I'm an old fart coming back to college after not having physics in like 10 yrs so I need to devote more time to it than other classes.",1609352476,1,0
"I took MATH 251 over the summer through UP. The only difference between this and 250 is that 251 also covers PDEs, whereas 250 does not. I thought it was very well taught through Dr. Handzy, who was one of my favorite profs here. Although it may look tempting to go through community colleges for cheaper tuition, they do not accept your grade, so if you think you can do well (which taking only one summer course helps you to focus only on that subject), I do recommend you take 250 through the university. Not sure if it’s online or not though, which may factor into your decision.

Edit: Penn State does not accept letter grades through cc’s, but do accept transferred credits (to my knowledge)",1609352141,1,0

"Took 212 over the summer from Ocean County Community College. Super easy and online, my prof didn’t even make us buy a lab kit, we just had virtual interactive labs. I would highly recommend this, even over Bucks (my boyfriend took it from there and had to buy the kit and it seemed to be harder and more work). Ultimately your choice as both are accepted as transfer credits to the university, but I can’t plug OCCC enough!

Edit to add that I took Phys 212 at main campus first and had to drop it. Save yourself the trouble and take it somewhere else, especially if you struggle with physics. I was good at mechanics, but not electricity and magnetism, and I wish I would’ve taken something else and just planned Phys 212 for the summer from the start. Good luck!",1609351175,1,0

I'm an international student too! I'm premed so it's different but I also got into UMass with a 10K scholarship offer!

I didn't get told to take summer classes, however, so I can't be of use with that. LEAP is mainly a friend-making opportunity with other students who will be in the same year as you but I highly doubt those friendships will stay.
