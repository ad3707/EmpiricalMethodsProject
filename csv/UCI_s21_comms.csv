"I was a poli sci major in CC but transferred into as a Social Policy major because I genuinely fear being jobless after graduation because a poli sci degree is a major law school pipeline.

"This is the perfect time for those of your reading: If you are planning to get a job , going to grad or professional school after graduating, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE take the time to get to know at least 1 professor well enough to ask them to write you a proper letter of recommendation!

For sure, but I can guarantee you it will pay off when you are a senior in need for a letter (or 3!).

OP - here is my recommendation, think of a class that is relevant to your internship in which you did well, asked a few questions and/or attended office hours. Think about how that class prepared you for that job. Now, write that professor telling them about your need for a reference and describe why you think they are the right person to talk about you, how their class inspired/helped/prepared you. Then say you understand they might not know you well enough and thus, will make yourself available if they want to chat with you over Zoom to get to know you a bit better.

"When I asked them about that funny enough they said their websites are not up to date. I called ACC directly each time and spoke with leasing.

I was shocked just how hard it was to get the 1b, since I never got an offer and the summer was rolling around I kept calling them and checking up to see if people had moved out etc and there was availability and they told me repeatedly no. It took me three times just to take over someone‚Äôs lease (hadn‚Äôt even moved in) just because others were quick to message the people. One time literally I messaged 15 min after the post and someone already beat me to it.

"Everyone's talked about basically everything else so I can talk a bit about Notre Dame.

I've been to Notre Dame a few times and my sister went there as well. It's a pretty campus, rather large, and also in a really rural area. Not the most progressive area, given that it's a Catholic university. Asian restaurants are farther out. It's definitely a more white majority area but people I've talked to are really nice and helpful if you need it. From what my sister told me, you can leave your wallet somewhere, leave your bike unlocked, and no one will steal them. 

It's really cold during the Fall, Winter, Spring, snows a lot too. 

It's a bit humid during the summer though (but so is UCI on the hotter summer days) from what I can remember but I mostly visited during the other seasons. 

All of this is from 4+ years ago so times may've changed over the past few years. 

Berekely is relatively cold too? A nice campus and you can visit a range of areas with their transportation system up there which is also pretty straightforward. They are a pretty progressive campus. There will be people who are a bit elitist though because they go there but not always. The people I still talk to who attend Berekley are down to earth and really chill. But I would say that can be said for any campus, a few stuck-up students with a few down to earth and anyone else on the spectrum.",1611447213,4,0

"My 2 cents...

Note: I have visted Rice, WUSTL, UNC, UCI, and UCLA (but not Berkley or Notre Dame)

UNC Chapel Hill and Notre Dame are in small small towns. Notre Dame can get very cold as well, UNC can get cold, but not a months long blanket of snow like Notre Dame. However, they do offer the ""traditional"" American college experience - fraternaties, american football, etc. However you can get that at UCLA and Berkley. 

WUSTL is a great school but in one of the most crime ridden places in the US (think about that...). 

Rice isn't terrible. Located in the heart of the US's 4th largest city it's close to a lot. But Texas has horrible public transportation and is humid and hot as the depths of hell for half the year. 

UCLA is near a bunch a ""glamourous"" spots - I took classes there for a bit and I would regualrly go to Beverly Hills and Malibu. But once you get past the name, it's very congested, expensive, and at times dirty. 

While I haven't been to Berkley, I know it's close to SF and has good public transportation (which is really hard to find in the US). 

If you want to experence what I consider the *real* Southern California (aka not Hollywood), Irvine has it. All the best parts of SoCal - weather, mountains, beaches, etc - without \*most\* the bad - insanly bad traffic, crime, etc.",1611445986,7,0

"Hey sorry for the late response! I will group your questions together on this one

The class sizes are quite large this is definitely the case. They do get smaller as you go but lower division classes can be huge. What I can offer is advice on solving this problem. GO TO OFFICE HOURS! Even if you don‚Äôt have a question. You are basically getting ‚Äúfree‚Äù tutoring from the person who writes the tests. Also discussions are basically smaller lecture where they will do example problems and review. Here I would suggest that you either ask questions or understand the material well enough to where you could ask questions and save them for office hours. 

IMO your first two years are primarily a function of two things: the first is how well you‚Äôre able to adapt to the reality of the quarter system (minimize procrastination, optimize your time, seek help as soon as you need it) and the second is your prior education ie. what classes you took in HS, how well your high school prepared you for things like math chem and physics.

The next two years (I‚Äôm a junior FYI) are much easier in terms of curves but I found that the workload is still pretty significant. It‚Äôs also possible that by now people just get used to the quarter system so it doesn‚Äôt feel so bad. Also it‚Äôs remote so ymmv. Either way, most graduating seniors I talk to find years 3&amp;4 easier. 

In terms of gpa, everyone sees different results so I can‚Äôt tell you if it‚Äôs difficult or easy. Tbh I‚Äôm not an expert in this area since my gpa is less than a 3.5 lol. I would say a 3.5 is achievable for most over the course of 4 years. But like I said there‚Äôs too many factors to say if it‚Äôll be super difficult. From what I remember the average GPA in engineering is ~2.9-3.1 so that should give you some insight.",1617998563,1,0

You are given pain killers and antibiotics as well. I was told to only use the pain killers I was prescribed only if stuff like Advil wasn't enough. I ended up not using any of them. Yeah, it hurts and the first day is especially annoying because you can't eat solids and you're not done bleeding, but after that the pain was manageable. Make sure you take your antibiotics as prescribed though.

I was pretty much fine after about a week, I'd say. I hope you have minimal pain and a speedy recovery.",1617997874,1,0

"I kinda should have mentioned this in my comment too, but it is possible that you can get denied to switch into CS. 

I could think of some scenarios like not being able to get into ICS for, say, until the end of your second year, failing ICS courses multiple times, or forcing yourself to get into CS not because of your interest but because of others like parents. 
(Note that you are also a undeclared student who has to declare a major until the end of your second year. You can't apply to CS in your junior/senior year)

You can apply to other CS majors -- Software Engineering has a similar pre-reqs and similar curriculum, CSE, etc. But talk to an ICS counselor before to find which part was weak in your application to switch into CS. Or they might say it is not possible. I actually don't know much about ""after being rejected"" part, so...

Some people take ICS 31 (and other core courses) in the Spring, so unless you're taking it at the end of your second year (or already completed more than 90 units at UCI), it would be fine. Of course you would be a little behind everyone else, but if you [followed the sample 4 year schedule for CS](http://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofcomputerscience/computerscience_bs/#sampleprogramtext), probably you should have taken classes like ICS 6B, MATH 2A-2B series which will make you not too far behind of others. You can also take Summer courses at UCI to catch up if you want (or possible 20 units workload). I can't say for sure, but I see it possible to finsih wthin 4 year even if you feel behind.

Idk specifically about the volume of cases for all ICS majors, but other ICS majors are easier to switch than directly into CS. But CS is also the major most people will recognize (also can't be sure, but generally.) For difficulty, CSE requires physics class which could be a plus or a minus for people, and Data Sci requires some stats classes as well. But most CS majors have similar lower division requirements which should be fine.

If CC is not an option, probably summer courses would be your best bet, also note that we have ICS 31 credit-by-exam which you can complete by self-studying python a little. Also the Undeclared Department reserves some seat for U/U students, so the process could be easier than others (but of course, ICS 31 is notoriously hard to get in.)",1617990632,1,1

"so the UCI owned options are much cheaper, but generally have fewer amenities. the 3 ACC options for grad students (VDC/VDCN/puerta) have fitness centers, dishwashers, ac, a pool, and laundry in unit (puerta i don't think has laundry or a pool.) They're also all furnished so if you don't want to deal with buying furniture, it's basically included in your rent. vdc and vdcn are the furthest away from main campus.

personally i've lived in verano and palo verde so a quick rundown- electric, water, tv &amp; internet, and parking are all included in the rent. Neither of them have AC or dishwashers. You can put a portable AC in but no central air. each little apartment block has a laundry room, not in unit but they're generally clean and i haven't had trouble with availability of machines. maintenance is pretty responsive with fixing things. 

The only undergrads allowed in VP and PV are older students and students with families so it's not really a loud party atmosphere, although there are always people walking around. They're both across from the gym and a quick walk to the grocery store. campus village is also an option for grad students and it's closer to the center of campus.

for floorplans, they're all listed online. verano has a section that's a lot newer than the rest and personally i think the newer apartments are much nicer than the old ones - bigger windows, higher ceilings, just feels more open and updated. some of the old verano units feel subterranean and cramped to me (they're from the 70s/80s) but it depends on the layout. floorplans K-N are new VP, the smallest cheapest ones are the oldest. all VP units have patios or balconies. PV is all newer buildings, no patios/balconies, a bunch of different layouts (you won't get a studio, too in demand.) I never really hear my next door neighbors even though they have a kid, but you can definitely hear people above you.

"Have you considered location? Irvine is very much suburbia but it's close to the beach and Disney land. If you like an urban lifestyle, consider Berkeley as it's a train ride to Oakland and San Francisco. 
Courses are important but opportunities such as research, clubs, and local internships will far outweigh your GPA when it comes to making you a competitive candidate for industry or grad school. If you're interested, take a look online to see what kind of undergrad research opportunities there are at each campus. Look at the local companies related to your major. Find some clubs you might be interested in. Then weigh the differences.",1617985675,1,0

"Hey OP,

I live in Palo Verde right now in a one-bedroom. 

First off, if you don't need a two-bedroom apartment, save yourself the cash and get a one-bedroom or studio.

Secondly, for the price, the housing is very very reasonable and is very convenient with proximity to campus.

However, the only major drawback I have experienced is that Palo Verde (not sure about other housing) has very poor sound proofing. I can hear my neighbors from all around me at all hours of the day and night. And it is not that my neighbors are doing anything in particular, but the problem is that even someone walking above me creates a vibration that I can feel in my apartment. We all have different tolerance levels of discomfort, but the noise level has gotten so bad for me, that I am moving off campus in June after my lease ends. 

I'm not saying this to worry you. Like I said, we all have different tolerance levels. For me, I need a quiet, peaceful place to study, especially late at night. It's been difficult, because my neighbors tend to make the most noise between 9PM and midnight. The leasing office personnel are wonderful, but have been unable to help. In reality, it is just that the apartment complex has poor sound insulation and there's not much you can do about it.

So, as long as you are okay with the potential noise level, Palo Verde is great housing at an affordable price compared to off-campus in Irvine.",1617985150,1,0

Even if you do complete your pre reqs for Business Admin you are not guaranteed you will get into the major still (as I said before, it is extremely competitive) so your advisor will likely have you also complete pre reqs for another major as a back up for Business Admin if you do not want to stay in sociology.

If you are not planning to go for higher education such as a masters/phd I would recommend against going to UCSD in this case. If you take a look at the coursework and their general economics program the courses they teach are heavy in theoretics and teach a scarce amount of actual applicable skills that you could use right after graduating. Merage on the other hand teaches applicable finance/marketing/accounting skills that have utility in internships or potential career avenues that you may go down right off the bat. UCI's business administration outreach in the job market (in America) is also much wider than UCSD's at this point.

However, it is true in general that UCSD still holds a large amount of prestige over UCI outside of America such as in Asia and similar, where the general rankings and level of prestige have not yet been updated. If you're considering going back to your home country then in this case I would actually have UCSD as a viable choice. Many outside country employers hold university name and prestige to a much higher factor than American employers, and UCSD is still much more recognizable internationally and is probably a better magnet.",1620211415,6,0

"Hi there. First and foremost, don't ever think that there's something ""wrong with you"". That isn't true. I'm sorry to hear about what you're feeling, but I know what that's like, just like other students here and now do too. 

Taking care of your mental health, especially these days, is very important. The first place I would recommend, like another commenter has already mentioned, is UCI's counseling center. 

In fall quarter of this school year, I struggled a lot with anxiety. Much of it had been due to academics at the time, but also because I chose to move back on campus where I was alone and had no one to really interact with. Away from friends, from family, it didn't help what I was feeling. For that reason, I decided I would benefit from seeking professional help, so I went to the counseling center. It completely changed things around.

Given that is my experience, do take it with a grain of salt, since everyone at the end of the day is different. There are many resources that the center has remotely now, and it's just finding what works best for you. 

Its a process, and it may take time, but don't be too hard on yourself. Sending much love to you, friend.",1620197151,4,0

I can't remember the amount of loans (sub an unsub) the school offered me. Assuming you are either an on campus student, you will probably receive around the same amount (maybe 1 or 2k less). But if you are off campus you will receive around 2-4k less in grants. If you are living at home you will receive nothing in grants i believe.

"I was a TA for Guerra in fall.  He uses Respondus with a webcam.

I would like to mention though:  Guerra has been nominated for Lecturer of the Year(again).  I think this is is 4th or 5th year out of the last 10 being nominated for the award.  His lectures and class are exceptionally well structured.  If you goal is to learn physics, I cannot recommend a better professor for the 7 series.

When I was in undergrad I had Dollar for a physics class during spring 2020.  He tried to do a ""flipped"" classroom, where he posted extra lectures which he expected people to watch ahead of time, but then usually spent the entire lecture time lecturing as well.  Since the class was on a subtopic in physics I was interested in, I liked the extra lecture content, but I know others in the class just felt like they had trouble keeping up just watching the lectures, much less doing all the homework sets.  Maybe Dollar has toned back, spring 2020 was the 1st quarter of pandemic for everyone.",1614890475,9,0

"Just to add to what everyone else is saying, it is vitally important to not put too much emphasis on ""wasting"" a few years.

Do you remember what you did when you were 8-11? Probably not. Was it important? Of course! Was it so important that you'd beat yourself up every single day of your life for making mistakes during it? I sure hope not.

For some reason, college is different. People act like it needs to be perfect. We have (assumedly) over 60ish years of life if we're lucky. Some people get around 100.

3 years is nothing. Hell, TEN years is nothing.

I know, you spent money. I know, you spent time, emotional energy, investments, etc.

I know. I get it.

But if you always think of it as wasted time instead of development and understanding yourself and learning what you want (or in this case, don't want), you'll always beat yourself up, and that leads to nothing but trouble.

Those people you see around you who have it all figured out really don't. Many many many MANY of us are struggling. I haven't told anyone except for one or two people.

Don't you think if you had immediately left your degree, you and your family would be saying ""Wow, I should have stayed in the degree, at least then I'd have made it further and really determined if I liked it"". The grass is always greener on the other side - but more accurately, it can be greenest where you water it.

If it's anything like 51LB it'll take up a good part of your week and that's bad if you have 4-5 other classes to focus on lol and if you don't do the lab right the first time you'll want to revise to get full credit which will take up more time (save your tokens for this). Then for the final there's like 5 different things you have to do, all online. It's insanity.

And yeah, I have a chill TA so he'll let us turn in things slightly late like if it's a couple hours past 11:59pm without having to trade in a token for a late pass.

For the final portion of 51LB there's:

3 Lab techniques

Safety component

Mastery project

Knowledge check

"Hello, I'm also a second year who was a chem major but switched out of it right after fall quarter. I was undeclared then switched to my current major, math, which was one the stupidest choices I made in my academic career. I'm currently in the same shoes as you as I also have no idea what I want to do in life and thought that it was too late for me too. The only reason I switched to math was basically the same reason why you picked chem. But for me, I found that I want to try international studies and might take the jump.

What I'm trying to say is that you're not alone in this situation and really consider on making that jump as well since you might actually find something you want to do im the future. Since you're trying not to take extra years of schooling, you should try taking summer classes or maybe even take up more units than you usually do.

It might be good to get these classes out of the way now, so I recommend feeling them out during the 2-week drop period and seeing how they grade you (respondus? open note exams? heavy on assignments instead?) and then make a decision :) For me, my 7E prof tested us on lecture problems 100% only so we didn‚Äôt exactly learn anything if we weren‚Äôt interested to, my math 3A prof gave us days to do our midterms open-note, my chem 1c professor chose not to proctor exams which eased stress on everyone having respondus problems, and my major course was the same as chem.

I cant say how King is conducting her 51C class because I only took Lab, so idk how difficult it could be. But I did well with VDW, and his explanations were clear and easy to follow, and the tests were straight forward. I do however love kings Notes. Her notes are a god tier.

"Yeah it's probably possible to do it in 4. I took 5 for physics/math but I know people who have done it in 4. For yours, it's gonna be tough but not impossible.

A little piece of advice for negotiating in the UC system: a strong transcript will get you a lot. Having really strong first quarter grades with a light course load will get you a lot more negotiating power than taking a lot of classes first quarter and only doing OK. I had a really good first two quarters which gave the school a lot of confidence in me, so they greenlit a ton of exceptions for me as a result when I declared my second major. 

And lastly, if you can afford it, there's no shame in a fifth year. It's not like high school: most physics majors I know took a fifth year and it doesn't affect your job or grad school prospects (unless there's an unexpected pandemic at the end of your fourth year like me lol).

"physics/math double here. Double majoring is highly variable depending on the majors, the school(s) they're housed in, and the students themselves. 

Adding a second major is a lot like transferring to that major. I believe both majors you're interested in are in the school of engineering? Double majoring in that case is A LOT easier to manage if they're both in the same school: it means you probably only have to talk to one academic advisor to handle issues for both majors.

The strategy for double majoring is to try to take as few classes as possible. If I recall correctly, the computer engineering and aerospace majors have a lot of overlap, so your schedule will be pretty much no different to a single major for the first two, maybe even three years(?). I would check this tho, but the more overlap, the better. 

Where things get tricky is the upper-division courses. All majors have to take upper-division core classes and upper division elective classes. Sometimes with double majors, the school will count your upper division core classes for one major as the elective classes for the other, and vice versa. This kind of comes down to the school you're in, but in general schools like to encourage double majors so a lot of exceptions can be made. This will take a little bit of ingenuity on your part because you'll often have to argue your case to an academic advisor as, but it's worth it to cut down on course load. 

Here's how I would tackle it if I were you. Start at UCI with one engineering major, see how college treats you, and honestly take your first quarter easy and get used to the college lifestyle. Start with a solid foundation and just stretch your legs and explore. For me, first year was the hardest and I'm glad I took it easy and didn't overwhelm myself. If you feel that you can handle a little more challenge, then in Winter quarter of freshman year talk to an academic advisor in engineering about adding a second major. They'll work with you to cut your classes to a minimum, and try to build a 4 (or maybe even 5) year plan that won't be too overwhelming. Then declare your second major in spring quarter. 

If I may ask, are you already accepted into a major/school of engineering?

Feel free to ask any more questions, I've been around UCI for a while lol.",1617043388,2,0

"4th year CS major here! 

Start your projects/programs early. The day it's assigned if possible or even work ahead if you happen to finish early and your professor has the next assignment ready. Work bit by bit each day on your project and split this strategy among your courses. 

Rank which course you think is the hardest and go down the chain. Apply the first tip to this. Allocate time based off your perceived difficulty. You find that class A is giving you a hard time? Did you start early? If yes, finish your work for your easiest courses first then spend the remaining time (or as much as you want) in the day to continue studying/working on that class. 

Do everything in parts. Code wise, the more specific the intention the easier it will be too implement and you'll find yourself making huge progress doing this compared to going on blind and finding yourself not knowing how to start. 

I usually have a to do list of what I want to accomplish at the end of each day for each class. This usually helps with everything I said earlier and also gives you motivation to check off those items through out the day. I usually write it on a sticky note and stick it on my monitor so I can never not see it lol. 

Office hours is the best resource for confusion, clarification, or help. 

But most importantly, remember to eat, sleep, hydrate, and TAKE BREAKS. A healthy body and mind will carry you through your work.

"I lived in AV for two years and didn't buy a meal plan. I think most people in AV don't really get meal plans, since it's kind of expensive and also the closest dining hall (Brandywine) is definitely a far walk. The only other dining hall is even farther, pretty much on the complete opposite side of campus from AV. I guess if you stay around the main campus a lot then it wouldn't be too bad, but I personally think it's just inconvenient for someone living in AV. 

I personally just cooked food at the dorm, or at least warmed up some frozen food or something if I was in a rush. My house in AV had two refrigerator/freezer units, one unit that was just entirely a freezer, two microwaves, three sinks, and two stoves, along with a bunch of electric outlets, so there's definitely enough space and resources to cook stuff.",1621294393,2,0

"If I knew what I knew now, I would get a laptop with **Linux**.

* Steam supports a lot of games on it.
* Most applications are cross-platform.
* Google Docs/Sheets is better than Microsoft Word/Excel.
* Not only prepares you for what you can expect in your career, but you can use this Linux experience to stand out in your applications to internships or entry-level positions.

Back in the day I was extremely productive with my 500$ 8lb 17"" Windows XP laptop (so much screen real estate), but I know some delicate people who liked to torture themselves trying to program on a 0.5lb 13"" laptop. Eventually ended up dual-booting so I could do research in Linux. I kept my games a desktop PC that I built, because the laptop was too slow.

Here's a couple laptops that come to mind:

* [500$, 17"" with Windows](https://smile.amazon.com/ASUS-VivoBook-Backlight-Premium-Windows/dp/B08V1NQ8S9)
* [689$, Customizable 14"" with Ubuntu](https://junocomputers.com/us/product/nyx-v2/)

Or just use a cheap old Windows laptop and dual-boot it with Linux until you figure out what exactly you want. The CS dept has a nice computer lab with all the software you need too, if you're worried about incompatibilities.",1621280089,5,0
