"Remember that 2 out of 3 people in triples have to be top bunk looool.

Pros of top bunk: 

-you have more privacy and you have an easier time not making eye contact with your roommate when they change

-no one will sit on your bed. It will always be clean. (Sometimes when people drink, they throw up. I know people who throw up in top bunk and it gets all over bottom bunk. You won‚Äôt have to worry about that anymore)

Cons of top bunk

-hard to get out of bed

-hard to make your bed

-heat rises. It might get hot up there.

-sometimes you can‚Äôt even sit fully up in your bed because the ceilings are too low.


If you want, you could tell your roommate ‚Äúsince we both want bottom bunk, we should switch 1/2 way through winter so both of us equally get the bottom bunk‚Äù

"I was in a loft bunk and a top bunk during my dorm days. The worst part about top/loft bunks is that it's harder to get yourself to get out of bed, whereas with the bottom bunk that problem is greatly mitigated. This may differ from room to room, but with the top bunk its generally closer to the top light in the middle of the room, so if your roommates start sleeping later into the night, it may be harder to go to sleep with it on (unless you put up a curtain or something). If it's hard to get out of bed usually, I'd go for the bottom bunk.

Then again, it is nice having your own personal space up top in the top/loft bunk (especially the loft bunk cause you don't have to deal with the bottom person making noise/moving the bed).",1568338719,1,0

The longer answer is that the people at the club are divided into a bunch of different groups, each doing their own thing.  A lot of these groups are D&amp;D campaigns.

Anyways, if you're interested in D&amp;D, there are quite a few of these groups that were open to new players.  They've already started, but membership is expected to drop off within the first few weeks, so it shouldn't be too hard to find one that's looking for another member.  Again, if that's what you're interested in.

If not, there are still a bunch of other things to do.  The club provides a selection of board games for you and a few other people to play.  There are also groups co sistently playing other gsmes, including card games like Magic: the Gathering.",1571461820,1,0

Individual departments sometimes offer ceremoneies and the hours you sit just for those (where people actually walk across the stage to their name being read) were not really worth it if you ask me.  It's just not practical beyond a certain class size. 
 And I'm sure they have outgrown where ever they were doing it, and got tired of hearing complaints from people who could only get a small number of tickets per graduate.  I know that's a chronic problem amidst a number of UCs and heard complaints last year about ticket limits for Santa Cruz too.  Not sure why this person is so concerned about these changes, but it becomes a necessity as the graduating class grows in size.  They are victims of their own success in attracting students.  I'm sorry it's not what this person wants, but these changes are not the same as ""losing the chance to commence properly""",1571453696,1,0

"I think it‚Äôs generally pretty easy to make friends with other transfers in the building.

People aren‚Äôt as friendly or extroverted after the first couple of weeks. You can still make friends but I think it just becomes a lot harder.

"**Perpetual stew**

A perpetual stew, also known as hunter's pot or hunter's stew, is a pot into which whatever one can find is placed and cooked. The pot is never or rarely emptied all the way, and ingredients and liquid are replenished as necessary. The concept is often a common element in descriptions of medieval inns. Foods prepared in a perpetual stew have been described as being flavorful due to the manner in which the foodstuffs blend together, in which the flavor may improve with age.

In the trenches, many young froshlings were scattered about the common area, desperately seeking a crumb of Cogenic power, none was spared. Upon a twelve hour reign, the final descent down Science mountain revealed the bridge of the loyal Kresgans was ever blackened in the dark shame of Pacificus Gassius Electrus. Thy Knights of Redwood and the Oaken people struck an alliance to rule the 14th realm of Redwood, this peace shall remain everlasting, rendering their superior civil efforts in highest regard amongst the chancellor.

"5.4M sounds like a lot, but it‚Äôs extremely small peanuts in comparison to the massive university budget, which numbers in the billions and can be found online. It‚Äôs not anywhere near the case that the university will start going into the red if they pay grads a living wage but don‚Äôt raise tuition. Admins are squirreling away enormous sums of money, giving themselves raises, and building a brand new event center, aka the building that is only used when admins throw parties for themselves with university money one day a quarter.

https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/university-house-event-center.html

&lt;b&gt; The money is already there. Grad students are not getting it because we are &lt;i&gt;viewed by admins as cheap, disposable labor, the cost of which should be minimized.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; UCSC admins have said this, within the hearing range of graduate students. This is frequently justified with a widespread conventional belief that the worse grad students are paid, the faster we will try to graduate, so &lt;b&gt;they deliberately pay us as little as possible &lt;i&gt;with the express goal of making us so miserable we want to leave ASAP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.

This is in no way a ‚Äúthis is all they can afford to pay us‚Äù problem. The money is there and they underpay us on purpose.

Ultimately, exactly where they pull the money from is also not our problem to solve, because much like AFSCME, if they can‚Äôt afford to fairly compensate employees for their work, they should not have employees, because employees cannot be reasonably expected to work for wages that they cannot live on.

However there are plenty of viable sources besides raising tuition, starting with shit like the articles above, the fact that the university gets a generous cut of every NIH/NSF/etc research grant without lifting a finger (which by itself could solve the COLA for every grad being paid by grant), administrative ‚Äúhousing stipends‚Äù which they get in addition to their 300k paychecks, and perhaps even renting the empty 1.5 million dollar chancellor‚Äôs house on campus that the chancellor does not live in.

That‚Äôs only off the top of my head, and without examing the budget in detail. If the university expressed that their ability to pay was the primary concern and was willing to open a dialogue, I am sure we could negotiate plenty of sources.",1576711750,1,0

"This is part of the reason why the ask is specifically around a cost of living adjustment rather than a higher monthly wage. Maybe they can't ""change the pay scale"" per se, but they absolutely can find ways to directly provide graduate students a higher income on a monthly basis.

For example, I got a $1500 ""Housing Grant"" my first month here to help pay the cost of moving out and settling in. That same structure could be used to pay a monthly ""Housing Grant"" (Or ""COLA"") to make it affordable to keep living here.
