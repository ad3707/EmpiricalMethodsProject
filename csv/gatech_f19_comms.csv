"Honestly I think the research is worth keeping. Most classes (especially easy ones) still have midterms and probably a final, so the A isn’t a given in those. Research at least has a pretty steady self paced work load and an almost guaranteed A.

The idea is that you would build a prototype of an idea you submit in the beginning, but a lot of people don’t actually finish the prototype in one semester. You decide what your deliverables will be, and as long as you communicate with your mentor you should get an A.

As far as traditional classes go, intro to modern physics (PHYS 2213) was one of the easiest classes I took. Didn’t go to lectures, didn’t have homework, each of the three exams and final exactly matched the practice tests. I did hear the professor this semester was a lot harder, so it might not be the same walk in the park.

"So this really depends on the kind of company that you're interviewing for.

For BigN and unicorns:

1. Read Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI). This book includes a lot of info on what you should do during an interview and a basic review of data structures. You can find a PDF on the same site where you got your pirated textbooks.
2. Practice coding questions on Leetcode (easys and mediums are usually the kind that show up during interviews). Don't look at the answer or the hints until after you've at least *tried* the problem. Once you've done a couple dozen, start timing yourself to simulate a real interview environment.

For other companies:

Usually small tech companies or non-tech companies will have a more ""informal"" technical interview process. They might ask algorithms questions, or they might ask you the in and outs of various frameworks and languages on your resume, or how you did your side projects. For these kinds of questions, in addition to practicing leetcode, review what you've done on your resume and be comfortable talking about it.

**There is no shame in practicing for technical interviews**

Grinding leetcode questions and reading CTCI does *not* make you a ""hack"" or a ""charlatan"" as others might say, it's a normal and accepted part of the CS interview process.

I did it, my friends who work at BigN companies did it, Google *literally* recommends that you do this. It's totally normal (and for the record, my friends and I are doing fine in the tech industry, even though we needed to practice for our interviews).

Source: Work at BigN company, do interviews for BigN company, have friends who work at BigN companies, have friends who do interviews for BigN companies, have friends/co-workers who do university recruiting for BigN companies.

"OP, your thread got hijacked so nobody answered your Q, and I’m sorry about that.

By your flair I guess you’re a sophomore, so congrats on the interview! The questions companies ask vary a lot - some are totally non technical, while others like G or FB can ask some real tough ones. I’m guessing you’re applying for a Freshman/Sophomore program if you’re going for one of those though, so it’ll be a bit more manageable.

1332 is great to know DS/A, but the implementation really isn’t that important for interviews. Try to focus on the usage (I.e. Big O time for each, where they’re appropriate, etc.) The only implementation based questions you’d probably get would be linked list based ones (such as write an algo to detect a cycle in a linked list).

I would say your best bet since it’s close is to try grinding some leetcode easy questions (and maybe a couple mediums if you have time to spare). These questions are most indicative of interviews. When In the interview, don’t get obsessed by optimizations, first just write something that works! Then optimize. If it’s non technical, remember the STAR method!

"What helps me with this is that most people’s “first” isn’t really a logical conscious decision where they deem one person worthy, rather it’s a result of sharing a lifetime experiences or like a romantic connection that doesn’t actually reflect on you as a person. I mean, do you have someone as your first and they’re not reciprocating? More likely you haven’t found that person to mutually invest in. It’s a two way street. I don’t have anyone in my life either like that and it gets to me at times, but I also don’t put myself out there or make myself vulnerable. And in a weird way that makes me feel better, because I know it’s out there for me somewhere if I was willing to try. Truth is we aren’t really all that different, we choose to separate ourselves over meaningless shit because there are only so many hours in a day and so much emotional energy to give.

&gt;Drivers of LSVs and golf carts must obey all traffic regulations or be subject to ticketing by the Georgia Tech Police Department. LSVs must not be driven on high-speed streets (above 35 mph), and golf carts must not be driven on streets with speed limits above 25 mph. For example, a golf cart cannot be driven on North Avenue — where the speed limit is 35 mph — but an LSV can. Other streets on which golf carts are prohibited, but LSVs are allowed, include:

&gt;Marietta Street - 30 mph  
Tech Pkwy - 30 mph  
Northside Drive - 35 mph  
10th Street - 35 mph  
Spring Street - 35 mph

Based on that specific vehicle having a LSV license plate, I suppose it would be legal to drive on North Ave in this case and shouldn't be on the sidewalk.",1568322138,1,0

I have to disagree with you there. I transferred from a much easier school into Tech, and I learned much better in the low stress environment.

You constantly want yourself to be this perfect you, someone who is seen as stellar by everyone. You’re afraid of failure. You feel like you fail once and your life is over. Believe me, I’m feeling it right now. However, there are ways to help. 

I’ve started to just try and slowly work on changing the way I think about things. Sure, I’m up studying for a midterm last minute - rather than saying “I can’t believe I’m such an idiot for doing this,” I’m saying that it’s a character builder and I’m showing why I belong at GT. 

I’ve started to let things go. Lower my standards on the world and other people because no one would have lived up to mine before. I’m trying to enjoy video games more now, I used to only get frustrated when I played, now if I get smacked I try and learn and appreciate someone else’s skill. 

You just need to make small goals for yourself. Slowly work towards being better, making a giant leap forward isn’t going to work. 

Believe me, it gets better. I’ve been working on it for a little over a week now and it’s slowly getting better. I’m not lying to myself anymore and I’m making sure I’m doing what’s best for me, not what I think society would want me to do.

"As someone who bikes on campus, I can’t speak for everyone who does this. But I can say that there are certain spots where it feels safer to bike on the sidewalks than to bike in the lane itself. A lot of this has to do with cars and reckless driving. I personally will ride on the sidewalks rather than certain streets like 10th just because of how dangerous they are for riding bikes.

Furthermore, try to keep in mind that if you as a pedestrian get hit by a bike, you’ll have some injuries but most likely will survive. If someone on a bike gets hit by a car, the injuries are more severe, and death is far more likely. Civil disobedience may be saving a cyclist’s life. So next time don’t think of a cyclist on the sidewalk as an asshole. Think of them as someone who values their life more than adhering to that one law, especially when it puts their life at risk.

Do I agree with riding on sidewalks around campus? No, but I understand the thoughts that led to that decision.",1569380137,1,0

"This argument is fallacious and overblown - I'll try to spend some time below to explain why.

1. All grad students go through a research ethics class to prevent research that could be of ethical concern. Facial recognition tracking isn't really okay under those guidelines.

2. The research that is being done is specifically being done for systems improvements, and the professor/lab are not using the cameras directly, nor is there any kind of mesh network actually existing - they get video from the GTPD which has been approved by the IRB. They are able to create an evaluation testbed that mimics a edge computing network topology that could be based on the real world camera network that already exists at GT. 

3. The research being done has no application with humans at all. The basis is offloading computational decisions that could be done in the cloud or locally to closeby nodes with limited computational resources for applications that may require low latency, and showing how that could be better than a current system. So, since that information eventually has to make it's way back to cars after operations have been done to data, it really has no place working with people or facial recognition at all.",1572537097,1,0

"I think there are a LOT of options in the NPO world, and you can pursue the ones that interest you and make a solid career out of it, whether that is business management, finance, data mining/management, or volunteer/people management.   

I didn't have any internships, per se, but, I worked at the Ferst Center here at Tech when I was a student. I unfortunately hadn't thought through a career path (that's a story for another day), but working at Ferst is how I kind of fell into the non-profit world.  I also served as an officer for a student org, and our staff advisor said to me one day, when we were discussing the club's activities, ""Have you ever thought about event planning? You seem to enjoy that aspect of things."" I had never even considered it, and I guess naively didn't even know Event Planner was a ""real job"" but that conversation opened my eyes... and that is the path I followed.

I worked at a small performing arts non profit for about a year, doing administrative stuff and helped on the weekends when the org rented space for kids' parties. That wasn't entirely my cup of tea (performing arts, that is) but my next stepping stone at a community organization was my sweet spot. I took on a similar role there, starting as administrative support, and thought it would be maybe for a year or two... and it turned into 10 years.  I had several different roles while I was there, each a bit different from the others, which gave me a really great perspective on how all the various pieces of an organization work together.

I started out supporting one small fundraising arm within the org, then moved on to a position supporting the Associate Exec Director, where I also managed the room rental &amp; reservations for the building and supported youth engagement &amp; philanthropy. After a couple years of that, the org re-shuffled and I moved back to the annual campaign side where I helped plan &amp; run the annual telethon and managed the entire direct mail fundraising campaign among other things. A good deal of my work was communicating with event volunteers, running reports, and logistical support for the campaign &amp; the events I managed.

My last two years with the organization I was the Special Events Manager, and handled all of the larger fundraising &amp; community events, this time working from the marketing side, and that was really what I enjoyed most. I got to plan and execute ""parties with a purpose"" as I liked to call them. I worked with our marketing director, a peer on the fundraising side, and the event chairs/committee for each event. We had about 6 - 8 events per year that I worked on, so I always had something in the works... catering &amp; other vendors to coordinate, venue/site visits, lining up guest speakers, and of course messaging/branding for each event.

Failing isn’t necessarily the only issue. There are lots of things where the school could be technically easier and still be experienced as more difficult.

What I have seen is complaining about posts stating that Tech isn't serious about addressing mental health issues because exams are still hard (or something to that effect).  Tech, as an Institution, used to be proud of having a graduation rate well below 70%.  You had professors bragging openly about the low pass rate in their classes.  I'm not saying this to say ""it was so much harder when I was in school"".  I'm saying this to say yeah, it's hard.  I'm sure it's still hard.

If I take these classes next semester and later decide to switch to ME, I would have to take MATH 2552, CS 1371, ME 1770, and ME 2202 during Fall 2020.

How doable is this schedule and would the Fall 2020 semester be okay? Any advice s greatly appreciated!",1572534089,1,0

There are plenty of students who *don't* feel helpless and who *don't* think some professor is a dick.

The reasoning is outlined below:

1. All PhD students are required to take ethics in research classes and studies. That would clearly be an unethical application, and not allowed by the school in the first place. 

2. The mesh network that has been theorized is just an idea. Theres no actual implementation of the system he talked about, theres just a bunch of cameras that have already been there. The research uses some of the captures of some select video to test the systems based hypothesis if there was computing on board.

3. All of the research application that is there is just proof of concept for an application for cars and latency sensitive applications. The whole point of the research is to show need computation outside of the cloud. Some applications of the research include autonomous car controls processing and heads up displays on cars.

"OP, mom of 3 here....one just graduated Tech...the other 2 at separate colleges out of state.  A few observations from my perspective of hearing from 3 colleges at one time: All colleges are worried about this right now -- from LACs to Tech institutes.  Kids are arriving at college under greater stress and feeling it more while there.  2nd, some colleges do better at telling their student body what is going on. Of the 3 colleges, Tech is the only one that sends out notes of grief and sadness over these events. Is that better or worse to talk about it openly? I honestly don't know...it might make it seem more common than it is and make others feel hopeless. I'm undecided on this.  Finally, colleges are all trying to decide what to do. Almost all colleges have (in some cases) dramatically increased their mental health counselors...I would very much like to hear what additional improvements would help.",1572529183,1,0
"Facial recognition on video taken at every street corner is disturbing. Car jackings and muggings on a college campus is disturbing. Getting society to deeply discuss the balance between privacy and security, that's disturbingly difficult.

On the one hand, technology like plate readers and facial recognition probably do allow GTPD to better monitor campus with a smaller force. It would be interesting to hear details of how they have used and are planning to use the plate readers, but I know they may not want to share that.

On the other hand, we all lose a little bit of privacy as a result. I think the main arguments are 'what if all that data is made public' (i.e., what if a police dataset is leaked online) and 'what if all that data is leveraged against people who have not comitted a crime?'. The FBI has done some pretty shady things at times - what would thier reaction to the civil rights movement be today? What would they do with license plate and facial tracking? 

I know it's a touchy topic, but I'd love to hear more about the safeguards on the plate reader data that @GTPD gathers. Is it kept local, or shared nationally? Is there an audit process to make sure the use is justified? Has seeing which vehicles drive through campus helped GTPD keep us safer, or just useful for finding expired license plates?

If we, here, can't have a meaningful discussion about this, who can? What do you think?",1572529150,1,0

"I think the point is being missed here, OP isn’t arguing about weather or not tech is getting harder or easier or staying the same, they’re saying to stop talking about how much harder it used to be on posts where students are struggling and reaching out for help or are very stressed etc. 

It may well be that Tech is harder to fail at than it used to be (or harder in general etc) and it may even be that that’s worth talking about! However, maybe it’s not best thing to throw it constantly in the face of students who are really pushing themselves and are on the limit. Even if you feel what they need is a push or a reality check, it may not be the time or place to do that on a reddit post where they’re already not feeling very positive. 

I personally don’t feel like tech has been that hard for me, I have a 4.0 and I haven’t felt like I need to eat breathe and sleep classes to do it either. However my dad, who went to tech, loves to joke about how much harder it was for him (although he knows who’s smarter). The points he raises though are usually stories of professors just failing students for no good reason, or giving a horribly unrepresentative exam and just failing half the class when they don’t get it. These things have more or less gone away which may be good, or you may argue they’re important real life lessons. 

Either way, the message here is - when someone at tech reaches out on this reddit to express their difficulties and stress etc, don’t tell them how easy their life is. That’s not helpful in anyway, if you’re a smart tech student you should know there’s good and bad ways to communicate ideas, that’s a horrible one.",1572527595,1,0

"Interesting, they reported ""student names, ethnicity, Georgia Tech ID numbers, Georgia Tech e-mail addresses, and GPAs"" but not course enrollments. Did the spreadsheet include any other data not in their official list?

It seems very suspicious that they would be using this type of data for targeting students for a ""lunch and learn event with one of our corporate partners who provide internships/coops/employment opportunities to our students"". I wonder if someone could make a case for discrimination.

On the other hand, if they weren't using those attributes then there was no reason for them to have a file with those attributes. That is indicative of a systemic problem! FERPA information should all be behind a tightly controlled interface and not just sitting around on spreadsheets. Then, if you need a list of names and emails, you can run a query that only returns names and emails. If you need a list of names and emails of students above some GPA threshold, then you can run such a query without returning the individual GPAs. Some people will have a legitimate need to run more in-depth queries but there should be clear warnings against running queries for more data than is required. This is how it is done in industries with data protection laws (e.g. HIPAA). Data access is logged, and the logs are routinely audited.

"&gt;very little distinction between what is offered online vs on campus.

I actually strongly disagree with this statement. There are a ton of very interesting special topic courses (CS 8803) that are offered every semester than OMSCS students can't take. For example, CS8803 Biomedical Modeling, Deep Learning for Text Data, Systems for Machine Learning, etc.

The other thing that OMSCS students miss out on is professor-student interaction. The 8803 class I took last semester had 20 students; all of us basically knew the professor super well by the end of the course. In fact, I'm now working with the professor to publish my final project at a conference. While this might be possible for OMSCS students to do, it's probably fair to say it's unlikely and most professors are less willing to advise / mentor someone who's remote as opposed to someone who's on campus.",1577750639,1,0

* BME is really cool. LIKE REALLY COOL. But you can only really get paid for that cool stuff if you get a grad degree/phD (or you go into med school). Otherwise, you're kinda relegating yourself to consulting/lab technician or some kinda other supporting character for that cool stuff.
* If you are a BME/CS undergrad, the software engineers you will try to interview for will always ask why you chose BME. There are few/no exciting industry opportunities for a BME/CS undergrad (they are all of Ph. D bioinformatics students), so you'd primarily wanna look for undergraduate research opportunities from universities (primarily geared to kids who've made up their minds about grad school) or something that focuses primarily on one or the other degree.
* If you are considering grad school, read this book. It is old, but still depressingly accurate about the situation in grad school these days. https://www.amazon.com/Getting-What-You-Came-Students/dp/0374524777 
* I've heard stories about a lot of the interdisciplinary bio/cs folks still getting recruited away by google/netflix after grad school.

I agree, it's harder to find research opportunities online, but most master's degrees aren't research based anyway. The fact that online doesn't have it doesn't mean it's lesser experience, it's just tailored for people who want to go to industry afterwards. 

&gt;Career Opportunities

"OUA will not recalculate your GPA. The number is not what's important. Your grades in the classes are important, as well as what courses you took versus what was available to you at your school.

They want to see that you've taken the most challenging courses available to you and done well in them. GPA calculations are only done once the class is set, and then it is for data and USG (University System of Georgia) compliance purposes.

Keep in mind though that most students who apply are academically qualified, so your entire applications is considered, not only your grades. That said, competitive students will generally have an A average, unweighted (read: mostly A's). You never know, hopefully you've spent time on your application. Submit it, and whatever happens will happen. Perfunctory qualifier: your acceptance or rejection to a school isn't a reflection on you. The GT application process is very competitive.

Plus the fact that many are also working full time. 

On campus attendance being low isn't a way of showing prestige, it's just logistics. Plenty of fully capable students get denied from on campus. There's just no reason to deny capable people from OMSCS because it scales better.

Like I said, conference record isn't everything. Anyone who follows the selection process in any sport knows this. On top of that, you should be comparing GT to other bubble teams, not FSU or ND. But since you brought them up, I will do the comparison for you, since you clearly haven't.

I don't follow volleyball much, so I don't know the whole picture. But just looking purely at results, GT clearly has the best resume of the 4.

"A very similar situation happened to me a few years ago. I petitioned for a retroactive withdrawl and was approved, but it required proof that I was receiving sustained treatment for depression, a number of doctors notes, and I believe an essay. I also worked closely with my academic advisor on a plan for returning to school. Academic dismissal probably feels like the end of the world to you right now. It was extremely isolating to me, and I also wanted to get back to school as soon as I could and pretend like nothing had happened. However, I would think long and hard about whether rushing back to school is the best move for you. It takes a number of failed semesters to get to this point, so academic dismissal tells you that there are chronic problems with your academic performance. Through therapy and self-reflection I realized that I needed to give myself a break from the stress of school to let myself heal, so I worked at some low-stress jobs for a year and worked on my mental health. I also needed to figure out how to be a good student again, so I took classes at Perimeter to build study habits. After all this I re-applied and returned to Tech. While it hasn’t been easy, I just graduated this semester with honors. The break was invaluable to me and without it I don’t think I would have succeeded returning right to school.
