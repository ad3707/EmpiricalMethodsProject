"**Nothing to hide argument**

The nothing to hide argument states that government surveillance programs do not threaten privacy unless they uncover illegal activities, and that if they do uncover illegal activities, the person committing these activities does not have the right to keep them private.

A person who favors this argument may state ""I've got nothing to hide"" and therefore does not express opposition to government surveillance. An individual using this argument may say that a person should not worry about government or surveillance if they've got ""nothing to hide.""The motto ""If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear"" has been used in the closed-circuit television program practiced in the United Kingdom.

"From a high school Valedictorian who struggled immensely in college with academics, physical and mental health, and yes failing a class for the first time, I can tell you that the worst thing you can do to yourself is give up. I tend to take on a very defeatist attitude when I am failing at something, and I have made the mistake of doing so with certain classes. Taking on that ‘Im a failure, whats the point’ mentality only serves to further lower your self esteem, confidence in your intellect, and it sets you up to feel very negatively about subject matter you may need to retake. Its an awful move for your mental health and motivation. PLEASE try to fight through the end of the semester. Even if you fail, trying until the very end preserves some sense that you stayed true to you by really trying, and then you can leave that failure behind honestly knowing you did what you could. 

P.S. Im about to take Orgo for the 3rd time this summer. The first time I was completely defeated by the third exam, obviously failed the course. The second time I tried harder and kept trying to the end. I earned a D, which is not enough to move on to Orgo 2. BUT I felt better knowing I tried and I DID improve. Dont get me wrong, it was a tough pill to swallow that my better wasnt good enough, but going into the summer session I am determined to conquer this course as opposed to already beating myself up.

"I'm a chemical engineering student here so I can give you some pretty good info! Long comment tho, you can PM me later for more questions.

1. A common misconception is ""chemical engineering is similar to chemistry"". So yeah,  the major-specific courses might actually not overlap too much. For us chemE's, we have to take things like mass/heat transfer, thermodynamics, separation processes that actually don't have too much to do with chemical reactions and the like. There are also things like kinetics and organic chemistry that DO overlap however. But chemical engineering is more focused on applications-based stuff in the long run.
2. If you genuinely like chemistry and math, going a purely chemistry route might be more enjoyable for you academic-wise. You wouldn't want to be stuck doing something that you don't like, right? Alternatively, you can go for a bachelor's in chemistry and a master's in chemE or vice versa. I've seen people do either. And if you navigate your career options wisely, you might find that chemE's have a larger selection of jobs since they might be able to apply for jobs that ask for a chemistry major, but a chemistry major applying to a chemical engineering might have a slight disadvantage due to the lack of applied engineering knowledge. Don't let this discourage you. When I was applying for internships, a LOT of them say ""chemistry OR chemical engineering preferred"".
3. More on careers: Some options for both chemistry and chemE majors might include but are not limited to: Biochemistry/biotech, pharma R&amp;D (prob need a master's for this), food science, materials and packaging science, cosmetics, consumer goods. J&amp;J is nearby Rutgers and great for your first internship/job but it's pretty competitive. Some things limited to chemE's might include but are not limited to: Process engineering, petroleum engineering (expecting the bubble to burst in the next twenty years tho, not a fan of this), quality engineering. I don't know the more specific jobs for chemistry majors.
4. The engineering program is a bit difficult, yes. You got the classic weedout classes like calc 2 (personally, calc 3 was more difficult for me) and organic chemistry (for chemE's). Personally, I don't think it was impossible, but certainly a 3.5 in engineering would be a more difficult to obtain than a 3.5 in chemistry. That being said, a lot of entry level engineering jobs require only a basic minimum of 3.0 GPA.
5. But let's specifically talk about the c*hemical engineering* department and not *engineering as a whole*. Maybe I'm biased, but the chemE department is better in quite a few things than other engineering departments. For one, our class size tends to float around 70-80 people as opposed to several hundreds in ECE or mechE. It means it's easier to make connections with professors! Hara and Chiew for thermodynamics, for example, exams are hard but they are great and the majority of the people in the class get B's and above. In fact, a lot of professors make the average the cutoff for a B or B+ (while a lot of other professors in other departments might make the average a C or C+). And for all chemE classes, the threshold for a passing grade is pretty decent so if you stay on top of things you won't really fear about failing classes.
6. I'm not sure about transferring tbh, you might need to meet up with an academic advisor or a dean to get approval to transfer. The process might be a little tricky so it's better to ask faculty working in the department you want to transfer to.
7. Last few, more random but nonetheless important notes: Research opportunities! There's a lot in both chemistry and the chemical engineering department. I'm doing undergrad research right now and it's a lot of fun; Rutgers is after all an amazing research institution. If you're looking for internship opportunities, professors in both chemistry and chemE departments have great connections and they can give you some pretty great career advice. And the career fair is great too (I'm not sure if it'll happen this fall due to the coronavirus... rip).

Imma stop here since it's getting pretty long. But again, feel free to PM me if you'd like more info. I do like my major a lot.

Edit: Ah, one more thing about ""Starting salary"". There's a lot to take into account here. Chemistry majors tend to go back to grad school if they want a higher pay. A lot of them might start out with being a lab technician as a first job which isn't exactly glamorous, hence the lower pay. On the other hand, a lot of process or chemical engineering jobs are in unattractive locations, or perhaps in the city where things are crazy expensive, so that's the downside of that major.

It’s gonna be okay. Don’t stress yourself out too much. Yes you should get in touch with an advisor and your professors and explain them your situation. Also if you go the P/F option your GPA won’t be affected in any way meaning if you take P/F for all classes you really won’t have a GPA. If you take P/F for some classes and do good in other classes then you can choose to only have grades displayed for them. But yep, it’s your freshmen year I’d say take it easy.

"You really need to love chem and find a passion that goes beyond enjoying it in hs (not saying you don't have that already).

I ended up taking Orgo Lab for chem majors, physics, physics lab, calc 3, orgo 2, and two English classes at the same time. Needless to say it, was a disaster. The suggested course list for chem majors is a ridiculous sequence. At the end of the day, it kept getting harder and harder and I had so many mental breakdowns because my heart wasn't in it.
I wanted to let you know what it might entail, but there ARE positives. There are really amazing research opportunities, some really interesting and rewarding courses, and constant sympathy from your friends (lol). You can do so many things with a chem degree, from being a chem teacher to being a lab researcher -- it's very employable. If your heart is really in chem, go for it.

I wish I spent more time looking at other possibilities instead of jumping straight into CS freshman year like you did. Don't be like me, try stuff out. You still have sophomore year to help you decide.

If that doesn't work, some of my friends are kinda indifferent to CS and kinda consider it a means to an end. It'll be lovely to get a job that you are passionate about and don't have to force yourself to do, but for a lot of college students and graduates, I think they are in the same situation of having their passions not really line up with their major/job. 

Thats ok though. We have a ton of time to figure it out even after graduation and career changes are super common as people figure out what they want to do. Getting a CS major doesn't lock you into a computer science career as you can make a career change down the road. On the bright side, having a high paying CS job out of college gives you a lot more flexibility to explore your interests and passions outside of the workplace. Keep exploring until you find something you love or like better, but as long as you can tolerate it and don't hate the subject, CS is fine.

that might have been a shitty answer lol but I think it's pragmatic",1587610694,3,0

"I am an hc student and I would say it is worth it. You don't actually get to many benefits from an academic standpoint. The honors classes can sometimes be harder or easier depending on your professor and the class. The extra requirements are annoying too. 

The main benefit is the community imo. The HC helps you meet a ton of people and network as they host a lot of group events which are pretty cool. A big part of college is finding your group of people and living in a dorm with wildly diverse people who also share a similar academic drive guarantees that you find that group that suits you. I met so many people and stay in contact with them even after leaving the hc. 

While the purpose of college is to get a good education, your well being and happiness are just as important. Having a good group of friends to rely on, party with, and study with makes dealing with the stress and work load so much easier. Ofc you can find this group through other means but living in the hc makes it very easy to.

"I’ll be getting paid until my scheduled hours until the end of the semester or when my work study limit is hit, whichever comes first. I go to the newark campus so idk if it’s different but we got an email that said this. 


Following guidance from the Office of Postsecondary Education regarding Federal Work Study (FWS) payments for disaster-affected students, all current FWS students with remaining funding should be paid for their regularly scheduled hours at their regular pay rate through the last day of class for the spring 2020 semester, which is May 4, 2020.  Federal Work Study students should be paid whether or not they are actually able to report to work. The Federal Work Study awards are an important part of the overall financial aid package. Students can also strategize with their departmental supervisors to work remotely.

From the first sentence alone (mentioning office of post secondary education) it makes it seems like all work study students should continue getting paid regardless if they’re working from home or not. Ask your supervisor or if you’re able to get in touch with the financial aid office.",1585454320,1,0

"Hi! I’m a senior at Mason Gross majoring in graphic design. Here’s some things that stood out to me from my experience:

1. CLASSES: You get a lot of solid training in different areas of graphic design (typography, app design, web design, Infographics, branding, portfolio) and you also get to learn different technical skills from other studio electives (I took video editing, screen printing, animation, digital and film photography, and illustration classes). I HIGHLY recommended learning keyboard shortcuts once you get more experienced because it makes your work process a lot quicker and more efficient. Studio classes (especially senior thesis) are very demanding and you only really get good at the stuff they’re teaching when you spend time with the projects tho (see point 3). 

2. COLLEGE PORTFOLIO BUILDING: have around 15 pieces in it and *make sure you have around 2/3 of that portfolio be design work!* I didn’t have much access to any design software during senior year so my portfolio was mostly illustration/painting. I applied early action, ended up getting waitlisted and then accepted a month later. 

3. TIME MANAGEMENT: Studios are very demanding, and a lot of them require you to be on-site to complete assignments. I don’t recommend procrastinating until the night before to do your work because the quality of your work won’t be as good and also because all-nighters take a toll on your health. Setting aside a few hours everyday to do projects helps with balancing your workload, but it also greatly improves the quality of your work. It also gives you enough time for a social life :)

4. PROFESSIONAL (INTERNSHIPS, PORTFOLIO): Find EVERY opportunity while in college (and now) to practice your design skills because it really pays off when getting internships. And NETWORK. Mason Gross requires 4 credits worth of internship credit to graduate (full-time summer, 2 semesters part-time). A lot of my friends weren’t able to land an internship until junior/senior year. The only reason I was able to get 3 internships before graduating was because of connections and taking every opportunity to do design work outside of class (I.e. freelance work, student work internship, taking up a leadership position doing graphics for a student organization). 

Good luck to her and hope this helps! PM me if you have any questions :)",1585452539,1,0
Hi not to sound off rude or anything but it seems like you are planning on going to a CC from Rutgers? Why? Because most students transfer from a CC to Rutgers. You said you wanna apply to med school but applying from a community college won’t really work out in your favor. Just keep that in mind. I really haven’t heard anyone getting into a med school from CC. You need to talk to an advisor ASAP,1585452483,1,0

"Realistically most people I know take it either during/after junior year. A lot take it after graduation. There’s this rush to take it so that you don’t have to take a gap year, but most people still end up taking at least one gap year. Only 40% of people even get in during a given cycle.

Honestly no clue. I’ve wondered the same because that one has a ton of prereqs that the SAS one does not.,1585447628,1,0
"Okay so there are two (kinda 3) kinds of biochem here. 

SEBS Intro - With Dr. Murphy. Kinda a joke of a class.

SAS Intro - With Deis. This is more or less a real biochem class, harder than Murphy, enough for non-majors, will better prepare you for the MCAT.

These two above are interchangeable. They are typically equivalent and if your major requires intro to biochem you can take either. These are 300 level. 

Then there’s Biochem 1 &amp; 2, (401,402 I believe) with Peter Kahn. This is a two semester biochem for majors. This does not have any other prereqs that the intro classes don’t have. But it’s two semesters, only offered on season, and also much more in depth. This has a lab component as well. Also if you take these two, you’re one class away from a biochem minor. 

Lastly, I HIGHLY discourage taking the MCAT that summer.",1585447597,1,0

"I just went ahead and heavily added to one of my old comments. I apologize in advance for the short novel lol. (*on the plus side I have a more detailed answer if anyone asks again lol.*) I'm going to attempt to answer everything but if I miss anything, feel free to ask more questions. 

Campus life is fairly diverse, I'm sure you'll find your niche if you attend in the Fall. there are many programs held throughout the yeat to keep you engaged/invested in the community. Dance Marathon and Beat On the Banks to name two.

Community Service opportunities exist within a multitude of clubs (*ie:* *building projects with Engineers Without Borders*) but there is one to highlight here. Scarlet Day of Service, university-wide event, sign up with your friends and get sent out to do some community service for the day. Ya get a free t-shirt too! I haven't done it myself yet unfortunately but hopefully, someone else can break it down. 

I also, unfortunately, don't have experience with Study Abroad but I want to say there are maybe 5-6 different programs? I think Hong Kong is one of them, but it just goes to say, the opportunities exist if you seek them out.

Tutoring is fairly fleshed out from our Writing Centers to Math/Science tutoring. With groups for specific classes led by students who passed with an A. Most if not all classes will have a TA that will be willing to host office hours and I haven't had any issues going directly to a professor's office hours either (*at least not yet*). So help is near as needed. There are plenty of services offered by Rutgers aside from tutoring. things like academic coaching, career advising/resume critique, and CAPS, which is a free counseling service offered to students. 

Ah, meal plans, they may or may not be the bane of your existence as a frosh, as you are required to choose the 210 plan. Plans are meal swipes, one swipe equals one meal, where your swipe is worth different amounts at different times and places. They range from 50 up to 285 per semester. Many students have difficultly spending them and are often left with a lot (*which means wasted money*). But it's doable, you just have to stay on top of them. 

Housing as an entity is great. Plenty of choices to fit what kind of environment you want around you at university. As a process on the other hand? Absolute garbage. It's done via a lottery and seniority point system. Lottery numbers are assigned randomly but the lower the number, the earlier you pick. But seniority points (it's what it sounds like) trumps lotto. More seniority points mean access to the more luxury on-campus housing. (*You'll learn more as you progress through your years/choose to attend*).

5 (*4 depending on how you look at it*) campuses. Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass. Cook/Douglass is pretty much treated as one campus.

**Busch:** Purely academic, quiet vibe. But the best (*or so I’m told*) equipped gym. Good food selection, alright dining hall.

**Livingston:** Mixed academic and urban city vibe. Rutgers Movie Theater is on this campus as well as frozen yogurt. Solid food selection and supposedly the best dining hall (*personally indifferent*). It also has the best (*imo*) food options that aren't the dining hall. Henry's Diner, Kilmer's Market, Rock Cafe, and Sbarros. All options that accept a meal swipe. Personally, ⁠I enjoy Livingston. nice aesthetic and gets quiet on the weekends (*although that may be every campus (besides College Ave))*

**College Ave:** Biggest urban city presence. This is where the parties happen and where Greek Life resides. Take that for what you will. Solid food choice, (*with the ease of access to off-campus food options*), arguably the worst dining hall (*again so I’m told*). Home to the infamous Fat Sandwich and a direct line to NYC via the NB Train Station.

**Cook/Douglass:** The most natural and open spaces. This is where I guess liberal arts (*if that is the right term*) and environmental studies reside. The farthest campus from everything. But this is where you’ll find theatre. Good food choices, this is where you would get the organic and fresh food options. Good dining hall as well (*personally haven’t been tho*).

Rutgers is a big overall university. Something like 50-60k students. So the social scene has many possibilities. Its’ size can be daunting with the buses and all but manageable. Take that for what you will, it depends on who you are as a person. I personally don’t like it that much but hindsight is a b\*\*\*h I guess.

Let's see... take Jeff Bender's Theater Appreciation. Fairly easy A and it fulfills SAS Core requirements.

Also if you’re taking Expository Writing, keep on top of those papers, retaking this class f\*\*\*ing sucks (*I would know firsthand, unfortunately*).

In terms of Cognitive Science, it's a fairly new program, offered as a major for... I want to say 2-3 years? But I'm pursuing a degree in Cognitive Science as well, I recently switched but here's what I can tell you. Rutgers is luckily one of the founding places for Cognitive Science so research opportunities are there. Most of the classes will put you on the Busch/College Ave Campuses. The program is fairly dense, offering 5 different tracks to choose/focus within but it doesn't mean you won't get a taste of everything so to speak. As you know, it's interdisciplinary so there's a lot of possible material but good overlap. You'll start with Intro to Cog Sci and expand from there with your choice of classes. There is an established Cognitive Science Club as well!

As a side note, there are 300+ clubs offered here so, I'm sure you'll find something that suits your interests.

The most notable cons are probably the size (*depending on the type of person you are*) and the problems that come with it (*buses*). As well as how often administration messes up. That's why we have what's dubbed the RU Screw (*it's not too bad/far-reaching most of the time in my current experiences*). 

So don't get me wrong, cons exist despite me not listing many but I feel it's all personal options so I leave it at that.

**Personal Tips**

**1.** Keep clean, maybe set cleaning schedules. Make sure to invest in a vacuum. Try talking to new people in your dorm. Be considerate, yes you have your own space but there are people all around, keep noise levels to a reasonable level.

**2.** Ration your swipes well. Actually use them and try not to fall into the habit of ordering out just because you can. Swipe food to take home to use swipes if need be (*if you do plan on going back every so often*) 

**2a.** Go to the gym if you can. Those Freshman 15 will creep up on ya if you're not careful. Especially now that you're in charge of what and when you eat. (*They definitely did for me lol)*.

**3.** Watch the rash purchases. You are in control of your money even more now that you’re alone at college. (*no secondary check so to speak*). Buy it if you need it, and yes, it's fine to spend some to go out to eat with friends but don’t blow your budget. Again, you’re paying for the meal plan, use it and go out to eat only sparingly.

**4.** Don’t party too early. Wait until you have your schedules down and know what your classes require time/work-wise. On a similar note, avoid drinking too much, know your limits and travel with a solid group. Then again I don’t speak from experience, these are just general thoughts.

In the end, build good habits, find your passions, and set your priorities straight. If you stumble, it’s alright, it won’t be the end of the world and things will work out. Have fun, build a solid social circle and work the system as best as you can.",1585447340,1,0

Maybe you'll have someone follow you and ask for money which is a common tactic to overpower you and take your wallet, or have creepy guys follow girls around.

Townies though, they're a different story.  My fraternity had a party, in a house no less than a block away from the student center, and literally 2 dozen of them tried to fight us and get in.  I even had a knife pulled on me by one of them.  Through my major and social circles I know a lot of RUPD and NBPD cops, they have more cases than you would think of local residents sexually assaulting college age girls and physically assaulting or mugging students.  It's a sick concept but these guys who look young but are still too old to be in college prey on girls at bars and parties and try to go back with them.  Seen it firsthand and I've read and written case write ups on them.

New Brunswick is literally one of the most dangerous cities in Jersey though, don't pretend that it's not.

I’m also on the exec of my sorority so it gives me great leadership skills (good for your resume to show how you problem solve or how you created something unique for your chapter) and the opportunity to give back to an organization I dearly love. 

Rutgers panhellenic sororities are very VERY involved in philanthropy work which their respective charities but also Dance Marathon. You get to see first hand the impact the money you raise has on them, and although you can participate in it alone or in a small group, doing it with your sisters allows you to have much more fundraising opportunities and get partners with a child from Embrace Kids through the RU4Kids program. Volunteering always looks good on resumes. 

It’s also just really nice having events planned for your social calendar, and easily knowing where parties are/having mixers, because the nights you do want to go out, it’s helpful. Although you should know, sorority life isn’t all drinking like frats can be. We have required study hours every week and volunteer hours every semester so I believe it’s really helped me become a well rounded person. 

I’m able to manage working 20 hours a week, being on the exec of my sorority and on the exec of another club, academics, and sorority life well.

If you're interested in the legalities here, yes, her lecture notes are copyrighted and she owns the exclusive copyright. (This applies only to the slide notes since they are a tangible medium.) The university does not own the copyright, even though lecture notes seem like they should be ""works for hire"". This is actually something known as the teacher exception. The copyright is also owned automatically; there is no need to register the copyright or to put some copyright notice on the work like ""(C) Professor Guadagni"".

Students' handwritten notes *do* infringe upon that copyright and are what is called a derivative work. However, this clearly falls under fair use, and so it's perfectly legal. The same goes for taking photos of the notes. The mere act of taking the photo and the photo itself are *also* fair use infringements of the copyright.

What you *can't* do is distribute and publish the photos since they are an exact copy of the copyrighted work. It's actually unclear whether distributing and publishing your handwritten notes would be a copyright violation. To say that it is violation is similar to saying that Cliffs Notes is a violation since they are summaries of copyrighted novels, or that Chegg and Course Hero commit violations by publishing and selling student notes. I do not personally know of any case of a student losing a copyright lawsuit for publishing their notes.

Sure it's disrespectful, but calling that out actually takes more time out of class, and makes other students respect the teacher less, because as the other person said, it comes off very ""respec mah authouritay!""

A lot of students have to teach themseves and don't get much out of lectures. Not a judge on you as a professor or any others, just a fact with our stupidly short-attention-span generation.

Solution-wise, I think a Professor should pick; ban phones, but don't count attendance, or count attendance and accept that 200 people in a lecture hall don't have the same abilities when it comes to paying attention.

Hi. I aced Chem 1 by watching YouTube videos by Tyler DeWitt and Organic Chemistry Tutor. If you are having a hard time definitely watch their videos and study past exams as well. Get an ACS study guide go over that and review notes before class along with office hours. It’s ok if you did bad. Just don’t give up. I failed one of my Chem exams as well but I still aced the class because I worked hard and didn’t give up. Just know that if you are premed or predental you’ll be taking higher level classes like Orgo and Biochem etc as well. So work on your study habits and review as much as you can after class. Good luck.,1582254438,1,0

"freshman year.  I walk out of the shower in a towel back toward my dorm room.  the girl I am hooking up with, who lives on another campus, pops her head out of my neighbor's dorm (another attractive female) and asks me straight up: ""do you want to have sex with us?""

"&gt; Now I agree you will never get all the dormers to become commuters, but  if you build more parking many will become commuters, again because of  what you said is the main point, cost 

You have got the commuter side of my argument but have misinterpreted this to be for all students including dormers. 

For dormers, its about distance and time and having more parking space will  incentivize people who would have to drive 2 hours one way to make the switch.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; because these people cannot afford to live on campus.  

This is also not true, most commuter can afford to live in dorms, off campus housing, etc. They chose not do bcas it is cost effective to commutive. FYI a significant portion of commuters have stayed on campus for their first year.

The reason I am asking you to talk to a professor of econ is because they might explain why your prediction and understanding is wrong. A prof can explain it in a better way, but you are wrong in your correlation bcas you are not factoring the stickiness(inflexibility) the location of a student has on their decision. 

***I can unequivocally say more parking is not going to significant increase the amount of commuters.*** If more people from new brusnwisck, south brunswick, any brunswick, Edison, and other close by town get accepted then only will the commuters number increase. If Rutgers accepted students more students that live far away then commuter levels will decrease.

All we want is more parking spaces to park comfortably. TBH IDC if 10-20 years down the line more 70% of the student become a commuters or dormers. That is a problem or opportunity for that administration or dean to deal with it. 

We can also say that a significant portion will just be online students,maybe AI driven cars will be so cheap to use that parking will become an outdated concept?

What I do know for a problem that might occur 10-20 years down the line is no reason for commuters to suffer, from not having 200 or so more parking spaces. Especially from an institution making millions of dollars of this.",1582252147,1,0

"You dont usually declare a major until at least 2nd year, possibly later (unless you're in pharmacy or engineering etc.)

There is no pre-med major. You can major in whatever you want. Including art. There is a pre-med track, which has courses like chem, bio, physics, calc, etc. Which all pre-meds need to take.

If you major in say, chemistry, you get a lot of the track courses out of the way because they're required for your major. If you major in art, you'll have some extra coursework. But its not crazy - I knew someone who majored in philosophy and someone in economics, with a pre-med track.

Switching majors is done at the click of a button (at least when I was an undergrad. And I'm sure it hasn't changed). I switched a few times.

Not that you asked my opinion on this, but I cant tell you how many of my own students I've seen doing pre-med for other reasons (parental pressure usually) and not because they enjoyed it. It doesnt work out well. Take time in your 1st year to explore your options. Take a course you like, a pre med course, etc. See where it leads. You need electives anyways. I knew nothing of what I wanted to do before I started college. Just be open-minded and remember you're the one who will have to wake up every single day and live your life, no one else.

"It’s easy to switch within the same school because you don’t declare until usually end of sophomore year. However it’s difficult to switch to a different school because you need to meet their requirements.
