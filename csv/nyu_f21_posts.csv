Is there a space on campus where I can work privately from?,"
Hii!! I’m stuck in a weird situation;
I need to take a class that’s from 6-9, but I  have a problem. 

I have a (remote) internship on Tuesday from 9-5. I live far away (1.5 hour commute typically - coming in from Queens) and there is no way I can make it to campus for my class on time.

I’m thinking, since my internship is remote, is there a place on campus where I can reserve a room or something privately just for myself? 

The only thing is - my internship has me on zoom all day and I am going to be hearing/saying private client information (it’s at a mental health clinic) so I would need to guarantee that the rooms are 100% private. Is there any possibility of This? 😬

Having Trouble Connecting To The WiFi? Read This!,"## Having an NYU Wi-Fi issue? Here are some tips to help get you connected.

There have been many posts on this subreddit about wireless issues at NYU. Many of the issues being reported are caused by **attempting to connect with an expired password**. You may need to ""forget"" or remove the **nyu** network, restart your device, then[ reconnect to SSID **nyu**](http://www.nyu.edu/servicelink/keyword/NYURoamConnect) with your NetID and updated password, then trust the security certificate, if prompted.[ See detailed instructions](http://www.nyu.edu/servicelink/KB0019242).

**Note**: Connecting to NYU WiFi requires a wireless device that supports 802.1x authentication (WPA2 Enterprise); those that do not will not be able to connect to NYU WiFi.

**Android Devices require additional steps; please see below:**

Tap **Menu**, then **Settings**, then select **Wireless &amp; networks**. Make sure the box next to **Wi-Fi** is checked.

1. Tap **Wi-Fi Settings**, and scroll to the bottom of the list of available networks. Tap **Add Wi-Fi Network**, then enter the following:

* Network SSID: **nyu** (all lowercase)
* Security: select **802.1x Enterprise**
* EAP Method: select **PEAP**
* Phase 2 Authentication: select **MSCHAPV2**
* Identity: enter your [NYU NetID](http://www.nyu.edu/servicelink/041206117184250)
* Anonymous Identity: leave this field blank
* Wireless Password: enter your NetID password
* If asked for a domain to connect, enter **nyu.edu**

1. Tap **Save**. Your device will cache your NetID and password. You will not need to enter them again until you change your NetID password. If this is your first time connecting, or if it is near the beginning of a new calendar year, you may be prompted to accept a new security certificate. If this happens, tap **Accept**.

**Note**: If you complete the above steps but are unable to connect, repeat all of the steps, but in step 2 type [**nyu-legacy** ](http://www.nyu.edu/servicelink/KB0014744)as the Network SSID instead of **nyu**.

If you are still unable to connect, please contact the NYU IT Service desk. See below for details:

Is a CAS to Tisch transfer realistic as a working sophomore?,"**This is not an admissions question.** I am currently trying to go back to NYU after being gone for about four years.

I studied Politics but had a change of heart and would like to transfer to  the Dramatic Writing program at Tisch

  
Let's say I'm accepted for readmission, and everything is dandy. I work remotely (although it is full time) and my position isn't crazy demanding.

* We   don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what   they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the   best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's  admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the   anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's   applications",1633348813,1,0

Any Advice for Making Friends and Dating? (Mainly Making Friends),"I used to have pretty crippling social anxiety (it has definitely improved) but I feel like no one I meet in my classes is interested in speaking with me for more than 3 mins let alone hanging out outside of class. I am putting myself out there much more than I did in past years so I am glad I improved in that regard but everyone seems to brush me off or ignore me if I text them asking to hang out. I am hoping clubs start meeting in person more because I made some friends from clubs before Covid hit (open to suggestions for fun and social clubs). I would like to improve my social and dating life so any suggestions would be appreciated.  I am completely new to dating and I have tried apps (only got matches with bots and girls advertising OF), and I know my pics were bad but I am not very photogenic. I also feel like me being black makes me unattractive to a lot of the women here (mainly asian and white women), especially because I am nerdy, quiet, introverted and was always told I ""acted white"" when I was younger. Anyway, I am open to any suggestions or criticism to help me get a diverse friend group and maybe start dating.

"Calling NYU Student Journalists, Reporters, and/or Anyone Interested in Writing News, Essays, Reviews, and more!","Hi everyone! 

After over a year of operating virtually, NYU Local has resumed in-person meetings, events, etc. (only where it's safe and in compliance with NYU's Covid guidelines, of course!) To be honest, as I'm sure y'all can guess, publishing over the pandemic was not easy for us. As many of our longtime staff writers and editors graduated, and the rest of us struggled with burnout, social isolation, juggling schoolwork with...everything else, and remaining invested in on-campus affairs while (in most cases) being in other parts of the city, country, or world; our ability to publish content was impacted and, though being in-person is certainly helping us get things going again, we're still looking to expand our team!

Currently, we're accepting applications from NYU students with an interest in anything from city and on-campus reporting, to concert/movie reviews, to personal essays--pretty much anything that affects students, or that they--AKA you!--are interested in writing and/or reading about. 

We also want to stress that joining Local as a staff writer does present the opportunity of, depending on your interest and experience level, being promoted to a **staff editing** position via an internal application process this semester or next. The application form for staff writers can be found and filled out [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdllYyjSEw8_tb75Q16dYIRBQ_DW2EHXczthLmNAoVTNNgaqQ/viewform). 

Additionally, for anyone interested in contributing to Local, but not ready to commit to a staff writing position, we accept pitches and pieces from contributing writers, which you can find out more about [here](https://nyulocal.com/contribute-to-nyu-local-da138e59ed42).

Thanks so much for taking the time to read--hope to see some of you on the blog!",1632425477,1,0

Would it be worth staying at NYU?,"Hey guys, I'm currently a sophomore at Tandon, though I took this semester off to figure things out. My first year at NYU was extremely rough and I was very depressed, and I want to transfer to my local university in my hometown. I also want to change majors to do Pre-Med. My mom wants me to stay at NYU because of the opportunity and the financial aid I received, but I feel like if I stay at NYU I will continue to be depressed and be extremely broke (even with financial aid I can barely afford living in NY and the expenses that come with it). I couldn't even pay the dorm reservation fee for this semester, and last year I struggled to pay for food. I'm vegetarian as well so the dining hall doesn't have a lot I can eat. NYU is way too expensive, and I am grateful for my financial aid but I just don't feel like I belong at NYU. I made no friends, and the city felt like a place I'd rather visit than live in. I don't know what to do and if I should stay or leave... Would Pre-Med be worth even doing at NYU, or would it be better to do it at my local uni? I feel so terrible because I want to give this up, but I was feeling like this since the start of attending NYU last year. I've been so overwhelmed with this and worry about it everyday. Is it worth staying at NYU? What opportunities could I be missing out on—as a whole, and as a Pre-Med student? I was going to try studying abroad, but I don't mind if I can't do that. I really need advice ;-; Another thing to note is that my local uni isn't a top school or anything, especially when compared to NYU, but I feel like if I can get my education and living expenses cheaper then I should try. Would I be stupid to leave NYU...?",1632190011,1,0

&amp;#x200B;

I heard from a professor I'm close to that NYU's administration is planning on deleting NYU Classes sometime later this semester. This professor helped NYU with designing Brightspace and works with the IT team quite closely so I'm assuming this is true. Does anyone know how to download zoom lectures from NYU Classes?

I'm also interested to hear what you guys think about this?

I hope they send an email about this to students because obviously the vast majority NYU lectures from these past three semesters have been through zoom and, even though I don't reference these lectures often, it is nice to think that I could go back and watch them when I need to.",1634512403,1,0

Housing advice for spring admit,"
Hey everyone. I’ll be starting at NYU as a freshman in the spring, and our housing portal will be opening by the end of this week. I had heard from other spring admits that NYU was planning on placing most (if not all) of the spring admits in the same residential halls, and that some had heard from their advisors that it would most likely be UHall. I was pretty glad to hear this because I feel like it would be easier to make friends this way (as we are all going to be new together) and so that we would be staying in the same hall as others who would be at NYU for the summer semester. I was wondering if anyone on here had any experience with housing as a spring admit, and if it was true that they try to house us all together. 

Having heard this a while ago, I didn’t really do much research on the specifics of any of the freshman residence halls, because I figured I’d just get whatever they gave to all of us and that we wouldn’t get much say anyways. However I have also heard that we could still give our preferences for which hall we’d like to be in on the housing portal, and I just feel super unprepared (having never toured the school officially) and overwhelmed with having to decide. If anyone could give any advice or recommendations on which dorms are great/horrible for freshman I would really appreciate it. I’ll be in LS and am a pretty social person (kinda nervous about making friends as a spring admit so I liked the idea of having all the spring admits together), and since I’ll be staying in NYC over the summer it would probs be nice to have a dorm with decent AC. UHall seemed nice but my only issue was that is was further from WSP/the NYU area than some of the other residence halls, and I couldn’t really tell if it has a social community or not. Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated.",1634256735,1,0

My first question: where do I apply? I've heard that courant is better for theoretical studies but Im looking to pursue the applied area. 

My second question: which is less competitive for a student looking to apply? as a CS major I was under the idea that the CAS CS is easier to be admitted into but someone pointed out that it doesn't really matter.   

My third question: Which school is better in terms of career opportunities like internships? I saw someone on here say the CAS career fairs were atrocious compared to Tandon. Can a CS student from either school clarify this?

Free Mock Interview Simulator,"Over the past few months I’ve been trying to build a mock interview simulator ([www.preparo.net](http://www.preparo.net/)).

It tries to mimic an interview being done virtually.

The reason I built it is when I was preparing for my graduate interviews in tech companies I absolutely fumbled my way through the first ten interviews before I finally actually got a job and I put a lot of it down to being quite stressed and filled with nerves because I just wasn't properly prepared for it.

I lost out on a significant amount of time working and salaries due to not being good at interviews. I wanted to fix that by building an online interview prep system.

I’ve loaded in over 20,000 random interview questions from industry experts and you can select to do interviews by competency, behavioural or randomly. You can also load in your own questions you anticipate might come up.

**It’s totally free all I ask for is feedback and suggestions!**

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We   don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what   they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the   best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's  admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the   anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's   applications",1635163222,1,0

Hey From NZ! A Research Query - On Privacy,"Hello everyone.

I'm an undergraduate University student based in Auckland, New Zealand. I'm currently undertaking research in the intersecting areas of Law, Software, Information Security, Privacy, Data, and Digitial Identity management - to discover problems linked to exposure of personal information and personal privacy.

In particular, I'm keen to hear your experiences around controlling your privacy online, as well as the management and protection of your personal information, data, and identities/accounts. I'm eager to look at these problems through a behavioural lens and dive into how we can mitigate privacy exposure via changes in human behaviour (rather than merely tweaking settings across services you use or switching to alternative software platforms).

Ultimately, this may eventuate to the creation of a platform that helps you learn about privacy and security best practices and create a tailored, fine-tuned privacy behaviour framework to meet your privacy goals (i.e. to create privacy-centric habits that endure). However, the format and content of the platform are TBD as this research exercise will quantify the areas of development/curriculum we should prioritise. As a part of this research, I'm keen to hear the perspectives on the following questions from fellow students (and I guess fellow colleagues!) in the NYU community:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is your personal privacy (in online and offline life) something you regularly think about ? If so, why?
2. Have you considered the potential risks associated with apathy towards the management of your privacy?
3. What is the biggest problem you've experienced while managing your privacy?
4. Why/why would you not consider yourself a privacy-conscious individual?
5. How do you currently manage your personal privacy risk? (or why aren't you?)
6. Do you regularly check in on the exposure of your personal information online? (or why you don't)
7. Are you aware of the extent of the exposure of your personal information online?
8. What are the highest friction (most difficult) steps you've taken towards the management of your privacy? And, what are the highest friction steps you want to take in the future?
9. What actions do you plan to do in the future to mitigate exposure of your personal information online?
10. Do you feel personally confident to assess and mitigate exposure of your personal information online? Or, would you prefer to be assisted in the assessment and mitigation process?

&amp;#x200B;

If you're keen to chat about this, feel free to connect to tell your experiences. Please reach out via PM, and we can talk; or, feel free to comment on your experiences below. Also, let me know if you know anyone else who may be keen to answer these research questions or help out with the platform's development.

Thank you so much!

Mobile App to meet Friends at NYU,"Good day all,

For the past 3 years, I, and a few other NYU students, have been working tirelessly on an app to connect NYU Community members across all schools and campuses. We know as students ourselves, it’s hard to meet compatible people.

To achieve this, we’ve developed a unique algorithm to connect students and alumni based on compatibility factors – not just your major and school. We strive to match similar students for networking, friendships, and outings, making it easier for students to forge instant and meaningful connections. Fortunately, our work is nearly finished, and we plan to launch it by **the end of this week** in both the App and Google Play Store.

Right now, we’re testing the app, working out bugs, and soliciting opinions from our target audience – NYU community members. If you’re interested in testing it out yourself and providing feedback, please PM us with your NYU email, first name, last name/initial, and if you have an Iphone or android. We will send you a link via email to access the beta version.

Have a great week!

"[Megathread] Prospective Students, Applications, and Admissions","Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We   don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what   they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the   best
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html)
* NYU's  admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the   anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's   applications",1637586011,1,0

Quant. econ/econometrics -- Also liked the course selection for this and I originally applied as an econ major to other schools before getting accepted to NYU so I feel like this would be the concentration that could get me the most econ background but my concern is that it seems to be 23 required credits versus 12?? Also a lottt of math but that is what econ is lol

Business econ and finance/data science -- Business econ seemed to be more manageable and I feel like I could take a lot more cool econ electives and it might be good paired with finance or data science

Uhhh statistics??? Idk about this one but I guess I could switch out any of the ones above with statistics but tbh I am not leaning towards this one haha 

TLDR; which concentrations are easier and which would be manageable/go well together",1640837049,1,0

Freshman Dorm Requests,"Hello! I’m going to be a freshman at NYU next year and I’m already doing research into the dorms. I’ve basically figured out my top 3 choices: Lipton, Brittany, founders

Since all these dorms have variability as to whether you’ll get a double, triple, or suite, I was wondering if there’s a way to request which one you get? I’d really..really prefer a double so I only have to share a bathroom with one other person…lol 

Also, is there a way to request which floor you live on? Obviously being higher up is preferable because better view! 

Also, which dorm out of my top 3 have the best view in your opinion?

"Question for Stern Students about Business, Tech and Entrepreneurship Program vs Core Business Major","I'm a high school senior applying ED 2 in a couple of days, and I had a question.

When I'm applying to Stern, it asks me to select a program of interest and I can either select BTE, BPE, or Business with Core Concentration. I'm really interested in BTE and it's definitely my first choice, but I also know that they only accept 30-50 people into the program each year. 

Because of that, I wanted to know if when I'm applying to NYU Stern, am I directly applying to the one program (BTE/BSE/Core), or am I applying to Stern as a whole? i.e. am I applying for the 30-50 spots in BTE or the \~600 spots at Stern?

Is it easy to network w/ BPE?,Got accepted into BPE but I’m thinking of transferring out of the program and just doing a business w/ core concentration (thinking of concentrating in business econ or stats?) because the two semesters of study abroad seem a bit daunting esp since I heard recruiting starts spring of sophomore year (and my entire sophomore year would be study abroad). Also heard that the curriculum in general is a bit too broad and that staying in clubs all 4 years could be a boost. Anyone have experience w networking in BPE and if it’s manageable? I’m perfectly fine w just doing a business degree by the way haha and the more I look into it the more interesting the concentrations sound and I’d still def be open to studying abroad but probably just for one semester.,1640804710,1,0

"Class of 2026, ED II - IMA at Tisch vs Individualized Study at Gallatin + Financial aid?","Hey y'all, 

I'm planning to apply EDII but I'm spread between two majors—IMA offered at Tisch and the individualized study at Gallatin. To give you a little context, I'm an international student currently on a gap year but I finished my high school in the U.S. My intentions are to pursue the interdisciplinary fields of art, science, and technology with also an emphasis on liberal arts. 

Generally speaking, I tend to be interested in learning about the ""unknown"" in which Gallatin could be very flexible, but on the other hand, the IMA major seems like a perfect combination of creativity and Computer Science.

**Here's my rationale**: If I applied to IMA it might be easier to transfer to Gallatin later if Tisch's curriculum was too restrictive, however, I also heard that Gallatin is more generous with fin. aid for international students... Conversely, though, I found this [article](https://nyunews.com/news/2021/11/15/nyu-meets-applicants-financial-need/) saying that NYU is ""meeting all demonstrated needs"" since the batch of Class of 2025 for all students. 

In other words, the key factor is the flexibility of curriculum to potentially pursue a ""blend of majors in CS, film, art, and liberal arts"" + getting good fin. aid. In my opinion, I could gain a lot from Gallatin both as an artist and a student but deep down, I think I'm pretty much set on IMA, however, I'm scared of not having a strong enough portfolio, whatsoever, plus the limited capacity makes it really competitive.

Any current students with some advice? Really, any advice or suggestions are heavily appreciated! 

TLDR: International student seeking fin. aid spread between IMA, Tisch, and Gallatin for the EDII round. My intentions are to pursue the interdisciplinary fields of art, science, and technology with also an emphasis on liberal arts. Worried that Gallatin would be too restrictive about taking classes outside of school but also that Tisch won't be flexible enough. Any advice from current students?",1640775225,1,0

NYU should really make the CS curriculum more rigorous,"For context, I'm a freshman CS major at CAS. When I was looking through the degree requirements, I noticed that we only need calc 1 and discrete to graduate with a CS degree, while for Tandon you would need calc 1+2, discrete math, and probability. While that is an improvement, I got curious so I looked up the degree requirements for CS of other top colleges, and almost all of them had math requirements up to calc 3, linear algebra, discrete math, probability, and for some colleges even combinatorics. I feel like a lack of math requirements prohibits more advanced topics from being fully understood. I plan on taking these courses anyways, but I feel like much could be done by adding these courses to the requirements to have students be better prepared for theoretical interview questions.",1640748516,1,0

"This may be helpful to prospective students, or you want to watch me cope with failure. Either way, here you go.","Hello prospective students, it seems NYU just received their first batch of students for the class of 2026 in their first early decisions round. I was one of those hopeful students, but I was denied. I will be honest; I am extremely hurt and partially salty- I don't even think I had a chance of being admitted compared to everyone else. Which is why today I will provide you my very own 'Why NYU?' essay so you know exactly *what not* to write about. Without further ado, here you go:

------------ (Essay Start)

    My interest in the development of video games has always stuck with me throughout my life. Naturally, it wasn’t long before I was searching for opportunities in post-secondary education in this area of study. As video game design is a relatively new idea for many traditional universities, there were few schools that had a viable program majoring in it. After weeks of searching, my future was looking uncertain until I came across NYU. My first experience of ever seeing NYU in action was the passionate students in the Tisch School of Art’s Game Center program that were showcasing their group projects. Their faces showed an indescribable glow while they were presenting their skill and creativity in the form of a playable game.

    The NYU game center program provides a variety of courses on the many different aspects of game development. It will allow me the privilege to study alongside talented students and accomplished professors who have considerable experience in the game industry. With many student projects and company internship opportunities, I will also gain the necessary real-world experience in the collaborative nature of the game industry. In addition, I will be able to take cross-school minors in computer science and be exposed to other schools NYU has to offer, and explore more of my interests.

    NYU is conveniently located in New York which allows for an abundance of hands-on experiences; studying there entitles me to be in the heart of the NYC games community, being surrounded by freelance workers, small studios, AAA companies, and the many fun and educational event hostings revolving around games.

Aside from my intended major, I deeply connect with the mission of NYU. As stated by Tisch’s Dean, Allyson Green, “Tisch School of the Arts is a place to thrive and feel that you belong”. NYU certainly has an impeccably diverse student and faculty body no other place can offer, but it also has an environment where diversity can come together, grow intellectually, and express freely: attempting to achieve equity, inclusion, and diversity in and outside the classroom.

NYU is the sole university that will allow me to devote my all to my passion while also contributing to my campus ‘without walls!’ community. Given the chance, I am excited to join NYU Tisch to study game development and expand the bounds of the game industry.",1639816991,1,0

not a big fan of NYU,"(I’m asking strangers for help because it’s almost impossible to make friends at NYU so y’all are my friends now) 

I’m from Texas. I took two gap years because I didn’t want to leave home, but I just finished my fall semester of freshman year. I wanted to go to NYU for a long time but one day something just clicked and I was over it. I was so angry and depressed the entire time. I hate Manhattan. It’s SO disgusting, it’s loud, it’s expensive. I caught covid after the first month but I didn’t even go anywhere but class and back to my room. I know you can get it anywhere but I was mad because I thought I was doing everything right. I gained like 20 pounds from stress eating. My physical health was bad too, I was always congested, exhausted, or nauseous. I can’t think of anything that I actually liked about NYU. Now that I’m home for winter break, I’m dreading going back for spring.

Also, this is minor, but everyone in my classes always dressed nicely and all I ever wore was old sweatpants &amp; shirts. It’s all I could afford and it was embarrassing. 

Everyone says to hang in there and it will get better, but what if it doesn’t? People kept telling me in August that I was going to have so much fun. And I did try, after my quarantine period I went to every event in my dorm hall and most of the cohort gatherings.

The only things keeping me here are the facts that I got really good financial aid because my family is /broke/, NYU is an iconic school and I don’t want to regret leaving, and I don’t know where I want to transfer to yet. I’m scared of transferring to a new school and hating it too. I actually like online classes because, maybe I’m just depressed, but getting up and getting ready to leave the dorm &amp; go to class was torture.  I was even taking online classes in high school before the pandemic. I don’t want to let my anxiety stop me from this huge opportunity but I don’t want to be miserable either. :( I feel like I’m a huge baby for being so upset!! My psych recommends online classes so maybe I should go through the Moses center?

Tl;dr NYC &amp; NYU are destroying my mental/physical health. I want to transfer but I’m scared of regretting it. I’m thinking the Moses center could accept my doctors note for online classes. (?)",1639807519,1,0

Math difficulty in Econ (Transfer student),"I just got accepted to transfer to Econ at CAS. The university that I'm in does not utilize math in Econ as much as NYU. For example, I can take intermediate micro and macro without taking any calc. The approach toward Econ is a non-math approach at my university but the Econ department is excellent and has astute faculty. However, the university isn't a top university by any means.

Now, I'm a bit weary of transferring to NYU and join a math-heavy Econ department that I'm not familiar with. I'm curious as to what math is used in Econ at NYU and how difficult it is. I'm aware that difficulty is relative but I would appreciate any insight that would help me decide whether or not to enroll.

I NEED HELP,"Hi! I’m 16 in year 12/grade 11. I really want to go to NYU - it’s my dream university. I still have a year until I have to apply but I’ve already read through the application process and I’m pretty confused. I have lived in many foreign countries growing up, have been to numerous schools, have multiple nationalities, etc… I have also been in many different school systems (English, American…) - this is a USP for me personally. However, I am currently doing my A Levels (British system). 

I’m aware that NYU accepts all sorts of examinations which I’m very pleased about. Although, a part of the application mentions that “all applicants” have to complete a ‘Self Reported Academic Record’ (SRAR), which I’m not very familiar with. 

I’ve done some research, however, not much information has been of use to me. I wondering how I’m going to gather all my previous school transcripts from different countries and systems, to then just compile them into a single report.

I also don’t understand how I’m going to fill in grades from the British curriculum and multiple other curriculums.

Right now, I’m attending a pretty “alternative” school which grants me a lot of freedom to take responsibility for my own self sufficient learning. I don’t think that my current school, has any transcripts from my previous schools (I just moved to this school to do my A Level course).

I’ve never been a straight A student, in fact my school record is very flawed - I’ve struggled a lot with my mental health. But so far, my grades regarding my last 2 years of school, are looking good! I’m confident I will succeed and can get into NYU, I just am in need of some guidance, so please anyone who somewhat understands what I’m asking - Please help!

NYU moving finals online was solely a PR move,"There are many things that NYU didn't change that actually contribute to covid spread much more than in person finals would have.

1. Dining halls are still very packed and people are still very close together without their masks on. If they really cared to limit the spread they could've made all dining halls takeout only.
2. Bobst is still operating with little being done to keep mask usage in check. Going onto any floor there are dozens of people unmasked.

Keeping these things in mind, does limiting guests from other residence halls really make a difference?

Also, from what I could see, dining halls and Bobst have higher occupancy densities than a lot of classrooms would, so doing something about that instead would do much more than moving finals online.

If NYU truly cared they would've just shut down the entire campus like Cornell.

How possible is it for someone to shift from career in HCI to Private Equity?," 

Professionals in Human Computer Interaction help in creating websites and apps for tech companies, SaaS cos, FMCG companies, etc; which is using the ideas of 'mass psychology' for commerce.

Using the skills accrued while working in HCI, MBA should help get the aptitude to slide into Private Equity; as managing / flipping a business is largely about knowing market consumption i.e. what market wants and cash flows  
(not entirely though, talent management and etc too are required);  
Hence, an HCI degree will have transferrable skills of how consumption works and then an Ivy League MBA will help get foot in the door for buy side finance.

I have a degree in finance from a regular college in Mumbai with a 3.0 GPA. Worked in State Street Bank for a year and then slid into advertising during the pandemic. Private Equity takes the elite of the elite of B School recruits and the aim is to sharpen your profile as one, hence I chose HCI as it is a easy transition for me as I am already doing the same work in advertising. The intent is to have a great profile and preferentially work in Management Consulting (as Accenture and BCG too have Ux roles) to sharpen up my profile and skills in making products for mass consumption and then get my MBA to transition in Private Equity

My questions

1. How possible is it?
2. What do I have to be prequalified with before applying for an MBA? Would CFA work? (large part of that is corporate finance)...Would courses from Wall Street Oasis, Peak Frameworks, Corporate Finance Institute work?
3. Do they need pre MBA industry experience or will it be the same ritual ie working in M&amp;A for an investment bank first after MBA and then get in PE after some experience?

Also, the aim for MBA is either Ivy League or M7 college like NYU or bust",1636650443,1,0

Math majors at most institutions often take a year of real analysis (it’s basically required for grad school)

Analysis 1 (first semester): Anyone can take the class
Analysis 2(honors only, second semester): Class requires an A in normal analysis

Problem: I am looking at an A- in analysis, which blocks me from any further analysis classes. There is no normal analysis 2, which makes honors the only way forward.
What do I do if I don’t make the cutoff? Drop out of the math major into a different one? Am I just locked out of any future in math?",1636521547,1,0

MS in Integrated Marketing from SPS questions,"Hi all,

I’m an undergrads student from CA looking to get my masters. NYC &amp; NYU have always been a dream of mine.

I’ve seen a few posts talking down on SPS (I’m not sure if it was more the certificate programs or the school as a whole) and I just had a few questions.

I have a 3.4 at my current university and am currently scoring around 680 on my practice GMATs (I think I can improve on this score by the time I take the real exam). Will I be competitive for admittance? 

What is student life like? By the time I begin in the Fall 2022 semester, I will be 24 years old. Does SPS have a lot of students in this age group? I have seen posts saying it’s hard to make friends as the school has a lot of relatively “older” students (nothing wrong with that at all, just curious). 

Also, does a MS degree from SPS hold the same weight as a MS from a program like Stern or CAS? 

I have seen mixed options on SPS, so I’d like to get answers directly from the source :)

I’m convinced Hercules CP intentionally made the dryer temperature lower,"With full recognition that I’m probably wrong, I am convinced that the company that runs the washer/dryer service in the dorms intentionally decreased the temperature of the dryer in order to get more money. Last year until about 3/4 of the way through the year, the dryers worked great. I never had any issues. But after that point, my clothes haven’t dried properly. I haven’t changed anything about my washing and drying routine, so I can only come to the conclusion that it’s the dryer itself. I always use the highest temperature setting on the drier. I’ve lived in Palladium the last two years and noticed this at some point last year, but I didn’t think anything of it. 

So what changed? Around the same time as my clothing stopped drying properly, the app that is used for laundry started prompting me to add an additional 15 minutes to the dryer cycle for an extra 25 cents. Am I being a conspiracy theorist? Yes. But even if I’m wrong, I need to vocalize that I’m frustrated with the Palladium dryers not working.",1636329546,1,0

process for private lessons,"hi all, just wondering if anyone knows anything about private music lessons for non-majors. I know there’s a form to fill out, and you can also enroll in the class on Albert. I filled out the form in November but didn’t put the class in my cart because I didn’t know which instructor was for which instrument. 


On the form it says that they check responses twice a month, but looks my request got ignored even though they should have checked it a few days ago. Just wondering if anyone knows if you need to actually enroll in the course before filling out the form in order for it to count, or what the other steps in the process are. (I’m a freshman in CAS if that helps)

want to change major/program in NYU (if i get accepted lmao),"I was initially always planning to major in politics at nyu since my sophomore year in high school and so when I heard that universities accepted and like applicants that have passion projects (extracurriculars that are related to your intended major) I did a lot of extracurriculars, joined clubs, related to politics and volunteering for political campaigns. 

But at the end of junior year, I decided I kinda wanted to change my major into pre-med or engineering (I still have a passion for politics and law but my parents and I just don’t think that I would get a good job with that degree). But I didn’t want to apply to nyu saying I wanted to major in that when all my extracurriculars were related to politics, and I couldn’t do anything to change that since application season was already approaching. 

So I applied stating my intended major is politics and college of arts and science. If I got accepted to NYU is it possible to change my program/major?  (Sorry if this sounds a bit complicated lmao) Thanks!!",1638579930,1,0
