"Dude, I’m not against the UCD athletic department. I’ve gone to the soccer games before. 

It’s just that, unlike others, I don’t have the privilege of attending the games. I work 2 jobs to pay for my loans, groceries, and my housing. As well as extra money to occasionally treat myself, plus buy gifts for my friends/family on their birthday

Do not even try to guilt-trip me on this.

With my schedule, plus my course load, attending the football games is just not a priority. If you want to go so bad, be my guest. But don’t guilt trip others just because they have other things to worry about. 

I am sure that, if I didn’t have to worry about groceries, loans, and rent, that I would have more time to, for example, attend a football game.

Alas, I do not. Case closed",1631513754,2,0

"It's the Sac State game at the end of the season. The Big Sky championship is on the line. Tie game; Aggies are receiving a punt with 2 minutes left in the 4th.

As the punt arcs through the air, the wind changes and a wave of cow smell from across the street crashes on the unsuspecting Aggies -- who, having been fully vaccinated and stringently tested under the team's COVID policies, still have full use of their sense of smell. The punt returner is bowled over by this attack on his senses and the ball pings neatly off his helmet into the hands of a Sac State coverage player.

The Sac player runs it into the end zone, but in his exuberance drops the ball on the one yard line as he is mobbed by his team. The ball, still live, tumbles into the end zone with the ref staring at it expectantly. There's no whistle, but nobody notices because the Sac State guys are cheering in the corner and the Aggie team is still dealing with unspeakable scents.

Now this is where things get a little crazy. Before the ref can blow the ball dead as an unrecovered fumble, Pint the tee-retrieving doggo, happy to be on the field again, runs in, grabs the ball, and starts making his way to about the 50. The ref gets ready to call for a stoppage of the game but the appearance of this wolf-like animal spooks Maverick the live horse mascot, who proceeds to stamp around the UCD end zone. Determining that this equestrian emergency is now more worrisome than the Ags having an apparent 12th and 13th mammal on the field in violation of the rules, the refs start running for the tunnel, whistles forgotten.

Maverick whinnies and trots over to the only comforting face in the crowd, Gunrock. Like all members of the UC Davis staff, Gunrock is a trained cowboy, and effortlessly  swings himself onto the relieved horse's back, patting him with calming, gentle words of rolling pastures, fresh hay, and playoff seeding scenarios that have UCD getting a Patriot League team in the first round. He gallops over to the punt returner, now beginning to get his bearings, and slings him effortlessly behind him on Mavericks back.

The trio gallops up to midfield, pursued by just about the entire Sac State team who finally realize the game isn't over. Pint proudly deposits the ball at the Hornet 45-yeard line just as the Aggie gang pulls up. In an effortless motion, the UCD player sweeps up both the ball and Pint into his arms, and with a shout they're back off being pursued by the Hornet swarm. Chancellor May lunges into the UC Davis Marching Band section, grabs the baton, and begins conducting the Avengers theme. 

With less than 5 seconds on the clock, our heroes tumble into the end zone in front of a wave of green jerseys. The Aggie Pack collectively gasps as the ball crosses the line. Half of the band realizes what's going on and tries to play the fight song, ultimately resulting in a profoundly modernist performance due to the other half still playing Avengers. Nobody can stop talking for about 20 minutes, and eventually everyone goes home in high spirits. The league office reviews the footage of the final two minutes and decides that 20 rule violations occurred and Davis would be banned from playoffs, but nobody minds because the real postseason is the friends you make along the way.",1631513204,22,2
"Let me tell you what I did for orientation years ago lol

I participated the bare minimum. Any “group” activities or those boring ass assemblies where they played videos or talked to you, I bailed. I literally just walked away, found a bench, and took a nap. The only things I fully participated were lunch to get food and signing up for classes. I talked to a few people in my group but I never again talked to them for the rest of college (I preferred organic friendships).

You’re an adult. No one yelled at me for straying from the group and taking a nap. My orientation leader once tried to goad me back into the group when I went to talk to my roommate (who had the same orientation day) but I just told her I was tired, and that was that. Do things at your own pace and what you want to do. The only thing you should be paying attention to is when you sign up for classes (that is, if they’re still doing that during orientation idk).

The fact of the matter is, we were forced to pay for orientation up the a$$ whether we like it or not, and that honestly seems like what they care about the most. As far as I know, I don’t think the other UCs even do a week-long, all-day orientation period like we do. It’s nuts.

"nasiri covers a lot more conceptual ground than lievens. youll the learn the same things in either lecture but youll want to focus on understanding the material moreso than memorizing it. 

lievens lectures are littered with words and phrases bc she expects you to memorize everything she tells you so that you can regurgitate it on the exam. 

nasiri will tell you something in lecture but might not explicity ask you about on the exam; it will be layered into a question to see if youre understanding the material and are able to apply it.

So, can you do well with lievens lectures? sure, the teach (mostly) the same material. they have some differences but when it comes to the bulk of it, its essentially the same class. just be wary that lievens sticks to simple examples that are replicated on the exam and nasiri tends to up the difficulty for her midterms.

I would recommend the class discord, the ""veterans"" on their can give you extra tips for her class. The invite link is: https://discord.gg/GzTqdDAhFu

There are also very comprehensive review videos on that discord that are meant to bridge the gap between what you might learn in class and what you might see on the exam.

I know there is a huge stigma around taking Nasiris 118 but I can assure you that the class will be fair. It will just push you to your absolute limits.

"&gt; They knocked my doors heavily today on purpose, I was afraid and didn’t come out all day. Do you think some of malice and bully need any reason？

It's really up to you to interpret that. Without being there myself I cannot (in good faith) make a judgement call on that.

It is somewhat possible they are trying to bully you but I would try to assume otherwise until you could talk to them and see what they want. Bullying is just such a rare occurrence in college, it confuses me as well. Maybe they are angry at you (from some misunderstanding) instead of being a bully, either way you need to try to communicate with them at some point to set the facts straight.

Did they say anything while knocking the door?

This is a very difficult situation, I know that from experience in dealing with difficult roommates myself, but if you could, open the door and answer them. In my view, the only way to solve anything is to talk to them to understand what the hell they are actually thinking. That way you would know for a fact if they are legitimately terrible people and just immediately move out, or if there was a misunderstanding after all.",1633592119,1,0

I am not sure there is no miscommunication. Here are more details. They plugged out my Xfinity even when I came back from school. And I told them this is the Xfinity which I paid for it. 

 I think most of respondents are not trying to call Americans assholes, they are just trying to call people who are bullying someone assholes.

They knocked my doors heavily today on purpose, I was afraid and didn’t come out all day. Do you think some of malice and bully need any reason？Honestly, I am confusing too.I have communicated with some departments for my situations.

"&gt; Afterwards,my roommates started to treat me with verbal violence.I felt like I was squeezed out. They asked me, ""Is this the Wi-Fi you bought?"" ""Just for yourself?"" I thought it was very strange, because I had asked them if they wanted to pay for it and we shared it together,but they all said no. Additionally, they also said thar they will report to the office that I installed Wi-Fi for myself.

Sir, maybe there was some miscommunication here? This is where it starts to get a bit iffy. I don't understand why anyone would report someone to the apartment complex for installing wifi for themselves if all the roommates said they didn't want to pay. That doesn't make sense at all to me and it seems more likely they had some serious misunderstanding/miscommunication?

Isn't ""verbal violence"" a little strong for complaints? Again, maybe they were just asking what the box was and not trying to make you feel bad or anything.

We don't really know anything else about the situation so it's your call, but your roommates' responses just don't make any sense in the context you've provided. I would try to give them benefit of the doubt and start asking them why exactly they are ""reporting"" you and why they would complain that you got wifi. I know this is a very difficult situation all around but at the end of the day, clear and direct communication with all parties is pretty much the only answer to this. You will need to confront them about these concerns and get a full understanding of the reasons, because I guarantee you there will probably be a lot of misunderstandings uncovered.

Also, why are so many people in this thread calling Americans assholes? Like what? People act like this is common behavior among American people (it's not).",1633589661,1,0

"While I get what you’re trying to say, at some point I have to be realistic about my capabilities. This is my third attempt at organic chemistry, and I don’t think I’ve ever been passionate enough about a career goal to take the same class a fourth time (plus, I think most self-respecting people would have given up by now). 

I was more asking this so that I could potentially pull together a list of majors, and find one among the pile I could look into further. While most of my interests involve taking organic chemistry (which is incredibly frustrating), I’m willing to entertain ones that don’t. I understand that it may come across as laziness, but it has truly been crushing to my self esteem to spend 150% of my effort in a class and still fail. 

And to the idea that I have to have to choose a major that applies to a concrete career goal, I know lots of people who’ve entered a major without a specific career goal. If I can find a major I like, I’m confident I find a career I desire out of that interest. It doesn’t always have to be the other way around.

That thing said in the end there are issues with that too, the homeless guy broke into my vehicle while I was sleeping in it and that's when I was done i transferred to UC davis.

At UC Davis we don't really have dangerous homeless people like UCSC, we just have a very rigid School that seems inflexible the needs of both students and learning differences.

"So I actually have experience doing this as I lived in my van for 2 years at davis, look I guess it can work if you're studying art or something but it just doesn't work very well as the campus functions right now at UC davis. It works at UC Santa Cruz because they have more 24-hour spaces but the worst part of living in a vehicle here is unless you have really good Wi-Fi and great sources of power doing anything that requires computer programming can cause a lot of anxiety because you don't know if you're going to have reliable internet access or if you're going to have power. I've done the whole computer science student while camping and trying to make things work and I'm telling you it's another level of stress you just don't need when you're a student.

That being said I've met a lot of graduate students that live in their vehicles, maybe if you have a solar panel on your gig and it charges overnight that's great. Another issue is theft, people tend to break into things. What this means is that your s*** might get stolen.

I think that what we need is more communal housing at UC davis, I know several years ago I'm not with the chancellor secretary and proposed a big parking lot with communal bathrooms and a communal computer lab that all the students could park at with their RVs and stuff. It didn't get off the ground though.

Currently I've just decided to pay rent, yes it's expensive, yes you're going to go into that, that being said at least you'll have an easier time passing your classes.

I used to use the 24-hour computers room but I had issues with the maintenance crew getting angry at me that I was essentially living there despite being a computer science student, they called the cops on me and because I wasn't able to get my advisors to speak up for me in the moment I got kicked out multiple times. It sucked I had a lot of homework to do, I later got an email from the cs department relating that all students who are studying computer science whether they are minors or majors have a right to that building 24/7, but then covid happens so I never got to hold the maintenance crew accountable for harassing students.

The campus is not friendly towards students who live in their vehicles. They are trying to change that but because people who are living in their vehicles are often embarrassed about their predicament they generally don't give themselves a voice. That sucks because if they spoke up the campus would have most likely provided a big parking lot by now that would have solved many of the issues that students were living in their vehicles face.

Several times on Reddit I proposed the framework for a community that would help solve any of these issues but it got downloading and unfortunately most students don't fully understand what it's like to try to live in your vehicle to avoid that and do well in your classes. There isn't enough sympathy right now for students dealing with housing issues, it seems like the answer that most people believe is we simply need more housing. The problem of that is that doesn't work, more housing does not equal cheaper housing because housing is a investment and investors want maximum return. The solution is a different type of housing that would provide both stability and security and also have things like a hackers lab and the tools that a person who's trying to develop themselves to be a 21st century cyber Ninja can really deal with and use for success. By the way I use cyber ninja as kind of a all around term for this new generation of tech workers that want to be skilled but don't necessarily want to buy into the capitalist system that we have right now

The other term is cyber anarchist. So I don't want to get too politically involved in my comment to you. I just wanted to share my experiences.",1635649746,1,0

Tomorrow is the Farmers Market. Grab some folks, get some food, and hang out on the lawn. It’s nice and chill. 

If you don’t mind being around people who drink, check out some open mic stuff around town! Sophia’s is a great place to meet new people and listen to people perform. I know a lot of international folks hang out there. Maybe finding people from the same country will help you feel a little less homesick.

For easier socializing opportunities, join some clubs. They’re always planning some fun community event especially early in the year. This is the best time to make new friends based on a common interest! It might feel a little awkward but there normally is some sort of ice breaker.

"I can relate to this! 

TLDR: I'm staying an extra year, a lot of my friends left/graduated, joined a club and met some cool peeps. Feel free to reach out to me! 

When I first transferred here under the physics department, I started attending Physics club related events to meet new people. After just meeting two people, it snowballed into making a few lifelong friends. 
However, I am staying an extra year and those friends I've made have now graduated or are studying abroad. To top it off, I am done with my physics courses and currently taking EEC and ECS courses - so these are new realms to me. 

This is my last quarter here and I feared being alone for the quarter. I was fortunate enough to join a club - OneLoop - over the summer to facilitate my interest in electronics and make new friends. 

Definitely hit up some clubs and try to find a tight knit group you can hang out with. Project oriented clubs are good - because they force you to keep communications with others if you're comfortable with that. One thing to remember when joining a project oriented club is that most of the new members you're going to meet have no idea what they're doing, so always be willing to learn! 
If you enjoy video games, participate in tournaments held by UCD at the game center - you'll definitely meet some cool peeps there.",1636736444,1,0

I relate to it very much and a lot of people aren't really cognizant to it in their own lives I don't think. If that's eating up huge portions of your time the best thing to do is block it. I'm not sure about stuff with phones, because I was able to address my phone by uninstalling apps and deleting social media accounts so there wasn't any way for me to even unconsciously go to the apps via the internet browser, but there are phone blockers that may work that you can investigate as well. My primary blocking mechanism is through my computers, which I use a program called Cold Turkey for. 

This quarter has definitely been pressing on my levels of blocker lenience and general attention span, as it's my first quarter here as well and ""the game"" of university is certainly very different.

"I'm going to UCD right now as a freshman and I will say that I do very much enjoy it here. I'm from SoCal and I've been to UCI for math comps, and the two colleges are quite different. UCD is very inclusive and the people I've met here are really nice and socializing isn't too difficult as long as you put in your effort. The location of UCD is controversial because I've heard people say there's not much to do here(most of these are the ""party people""), but practically everyone agrees there is a peaceful and friendly vibe and that the nature here is quite serene. If you want the party life, well I have no clue because I'm not interested in those whatsoever. In terms of race, UCI definitely has a lot of Asians(I'm Asian and I'm not trying to be racist or anything, just speaking demographics), and UCD is pretty diverse I'd say. UCI is definitely more urban so its location is more ideal for people who want to go out with their friends. UCI is known for their STEM and Davis is known more for their strong agriculture and vet majors(I'm a stats major). Other majors are good too because both schools have good academics overall. There is a lot of biking going on here, but it's not like there are bike accidents left and right. As long as you have a functioning brain and understand the basics of biking, you will be fine. Davis had a lot of renovations so the newer buildings look nice. The ARC(gym) is very nice(idk about Irvine's because I haven't been inside there). The lecture halls I've been in Irvine do look nicer than Davis's to be honest. Food is good at the DCs here at Davis and downtown has lots of restaurants(if you're nocturnal like me and wants to eat at 3am there aren't too many places open 24/7 or past like 12am). I do know that they have lots of restaurants nearby Irvine and Irvine food is pretty good(IDK about their dc, I think I heard it's alright). Do take into consideration that our palettes are probably different. Also, you probably heard about the cows at Davis so I'll give my two cents on it. I HATE THE SMELL. IF YOU LIVE IN TERCERO LMAOOOOOO PAL. Anyhow, yeah, I have a sensitive nose and every time I go near there I wanna turn around and bike back to good old Cuarto that doesn't smell like cow shit. But people who live there say they get used to the smell(might be lying like the crying behind the smile mask meme). For dorms, I'd say Davis has pretty spacious dorms. Irvine's seems a little small(my friend showed me his triplet and it's smaller than my double LOL). Also I hope you don't mind a bit of rain because there is a slight rainy season here but it's not like you're gonna drown ok, weather otherwise is nice.

Overall, I am probably biased because I actually really do like UC Davis. I came here with not too many expectations, but I am pleased to say that the surprises have been thumbs up for me. Also, the friends I've made here have been wonderful(especially my roommate who is my close, close friend since 6th grade) - no matter what college you go to, it's important to surround yourself with people who support you and vice versa. But as you know making friends is based on yourself. 

Lastly, no matter where you go, you have to make your college experience worthwhile. No matter how many praises I can give about UCD, if you don't put in your time into making your life here pleasant, then it won't be and this applies to Irvine or wherever else you might be deciding on.

For Santa Barbara, I've heard the party scene is nice and booming. There's the beach right next to it. Demographics are mostly white and Asian. Food idk about. The campus is really beautiful(visited once). Weather here and Irvine is very nice(I mean it's Cali bruh).",1636726600,11,0

Pre-Covid you could go to the ring road, which is in front of the school and you could buy food and boba from clubs for very cheap and just walk across the bridge and you’ve got in-n-out, tastea, Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell and many food options. I really liked it. If you are in the STEM field it’s a very good school for that, especially anything related to bio. Now that I’m back in Davis I honestly miss being able to go to a lot of places like I used to in Irvine. Davis is pretty nice too though, it’s a calm city, if you like biking this is the place to go to. I haven’t seen a lot of club recruitment or many activities, but that might be because of covid. We’ve got a 24 hour study room, so that’s pretty nice! UCD has a football team and it can be pretty fun to join the tailgating parties. One thing I like about Davis is the picnic day festival, which is like an open house for the school and all the frats celebrate all day hahaha. Downtown has a lot of restaurants to go to and farmers markets on Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings are a must. You can meet up with friends and enjoy a cup of coffee or simply just look around. Davis is very ecofriendly and you’ll see that throughout the city and even the school. I chose to come back to Davis because I wouldn’t need to pay for rent and I missed it here. If I was you, I would visit UCI, UCD and UCSB while school is in session so you can see what that looks like. Good luck choosing a school!! It’s tough! Let me know if you have any other questions!",1636706555,9,0

There are a lot of decent concerts in Sac/SF, so maybe check one out.

Outdoor Adventures at the rec center has white water rafting, hiking, camping, and backpacking trips you can sign up for. You can also go out on your own, Lake Tahoe is cool and Yosemite/Sequoia National Park is my favorite place in the world.

Sporting Events, I think our school's football season just ended but you can check out basketball, or nearby professional teams! For football there's the 49ers, for basketball there's the Sacramento Kings and Golden state warriors, for Hockey there's the San Jose Sharks, and for baseball the Giants.

If you're old enough to drink, California is famous for its Beer and Wine, there are lots of good breweries and wineries to check out and the selection of craft beer around town is great.

Also tons of great fresh local produce and cheese.

Also, if you go to SF, there are tons of food places to try. I've traveled quite a bit in the US and California's diversity and quality of food is unmatched.

I can give more recommendations for food and SF/SAC too if you want.

"The letter claimed the rationale is that (backwards-looking) positivity rates have remained low. Which is true, they’re relatively low and have been low since we began testing in 2020. What I don’t understand is what has *changed* to make this a smart policy decision. It seems to me that unless there’s a serious budgetary concern, the risk/reward for dropping mandatory testing skews heavily to the risk side. This decision fails to take into account the data we’re seeing in Europe and prediction models here in the US. It would make more sense to me if we did this heading into spring rather than winter or if this was in conjunction with a booster mandate. 

And what’s the benefit? Students save 5-10 minutes every 2 weeks? That outweighs our ability to somewhat accurately gauge the level of viral transmission in our community?

Mexican food has also become a huge part of American food. Sadly a lot of the Mexican/Mexican influenced food up here is weak sauce (I’ve been meaning to go try more taco trucks in woodland, haven’t yet), but there’s a couple places that are decent enough. Pupuseria la chicana is half Mexican, half Salvadoran, and has some decent tacos and great burritos (and pupusas).

"&gt; SO FAR, Omicron has a relatively LOW death/hospitalization rate.

""Rate"" is the key word. The hospitalization rate has to be multiplied by the number of cases, which is rocketing upward far faster than any previous variant. [Omicron is doubling every 1.5-3 days.](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/omicron-cases-doubling-15-3-days-areas-with-local-spread-who-2021-12-18/) A decrease in severity works only linearly, while an increase in transmission works exponentially.

The good news? Even if Davis goes online (which is **not** guaranteed), I really do think it would be much shorter this time.

UC Davis
December 30, 2021

Dear UC Davis Community,
As we reflect on the end of 2021 and look forward to 2022, we wanted to take a moment to reiterate our winter quarter plans and provide you with a few updates.

We know there is concern in our community about the recent surge of COVID-19 cases, largely due to the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Here on our campus and through Healthy Davis Together, we also are seeing an increase in the number of positive cases due to the Omicron variant, but thankfully our overall number of positive COVID-19 cases is still quite low compared to most of the rest of California.

Moreover, emerging data suggest that people who are fully vaccinated and boosted are very unlikely to become seriously ill if they contract COVID-19 caused by any of the currently recognized variants. While the Omicron variant is more easily transmitted, it appears that it is likely to be less virulent than earlier variants, that is, significantly less likely to cause serious illness, hospitalization or death. Given that the Omicron variant is highly transmissible and appears to cause milder disease in vaccinated and boosted people, we are entering a new phase of adapting our campus approach and activities to living with COVID-19 at an endemic level. This shift in approach means that we will continue to monitor both infection rates and severity of disease outcomes, just as we do with influenza, while we continue to do our important work at UCD of education, research, and service.

Please take time to read this letter as we’ve attempted to address common questions and concerns that you have shared with us regarding COVID-19 and winter quarter.

Testing
We announced on December 21 that we will begin winter quarter with a week of remote instruction and working from home (except for employees with essential duties) from January 3-7. We are doing this for two reasons. First, we are setting aside a week for a critical round of COVID-19 testing — critical because we will require a negative result before allowing people back in the classroom or workplace on January 10. Second, by identifying cases early in the quarter, we can slow the spread of the coronavirus and keep campus operations running as smoothly as possible.

To accomplish these aims, we are requiring that all students, faculty, and staff at the Davis campus get tested between now and January 7. If you are currently in the Davis area, we strongly suggest that you get tested NOW to avoid the rush next week. If you are outside of the Davis area, please return before January 3 and make an appointment to get tested as soon as possible upon your return. Please do not wait to return to Davis after January 3 since it will reduce our chances of getting everyone tested and minimizing the rate of infection.

Please see testing locations and hours on the Campus Ready website. Note that all UC Davis and Healthy Davis Together sites will be closed Friday and Saturday for New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, but you will have two options for testing on Sunday:

Activities and Recreation Center, or ARC (asymptomatic testing) — 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. Make appointments in the Health-e-Messaging portal. You can park for free in Lot 25 while getting your test.
Healthy Davis Together at Research Park, 1632 Da Vinci Court, Davis (asymptomatic and symptomatic testing) — 8 a.m.to 5:30 p.m. Sunday (closed 11:15 a.m. to noon)
Further, we will carry over from fall quarter our requirements for regular testing: every 14 days if you are fully vaccinated (still, we encourage you to get tested more frequently) and every four days if you are unvaccinated with an approved exception.

Healthy behaviors
Be reassured that we are monitoring our campus testing results, including our genotyping results, along with those from Davis and the rest of Yolo County. We are in regular contact with the county’s public health officer to ensure compliance with changing guidelines and to keep our community as healthy as possible.

At this time, we are confident that our high vaccination rates, our testing program and the other procedures we have in place will allow us to keep the campus open while slowing the spread of COVID-19 infections. We also know that our community will continue to do its part to keep everyone healthy. While it is unlikely that we will need to change these plans due to the Omicron variant, we will make changes to our winter quarter plans if we believe it is necessary.

We urge everyone to continue practicing healthy behaviors that can help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Continue to follow our testing protocols, get the required booster vaccination as soon as you are eligible, and wear face masks whenever you are indoors. Given how transmissible the Omicron variant is, we note that N95 and KN95 masks with proper fit are more effective in protecting against COVID-19 and particularly the Omicron variant.

Booster shots
As we stated in our December 21 letter, all students, faculty and staff must get their COVID-19 booster — third dose if you previously received the Pfizer-BioNTech series or the Moderna series, second dose if you previously received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine — and upload their updated vaccination information into the Health-e-Messaging portal no later than January 31. You are eligible for your booster six months after completing your primary vaccination series. Please do not delay. If you are not eligible for a booster by January 31, you will have 14 days from your date of eligibility to get your booster and upload your vaccination information; we recognize this applies to many of you who received your vaccinations in September.

Need a booster? Go to the state’s My Turn website to make an appointment at any number of clinics in the area.

Contact tracing and test results
Consistent with this past year, if an unvaccinated person tests positive, they will be contacted by the contact tracing team to help identify close contacts and provide isolation instructions.

IMPORTANT: Please review your test results in Health-e-Messaging as soon as you receive notification by email that your results are in. New for winter quarter: if a fully vaccinated person tests positive, they will only receive isolation instructions via email, with information on how to identify and inform their close contacts. 

More updates about our contact tracing, isolation and quarantine practices are available on the Campus Ready site. In addition, we have provided answers to a wealth of questions on our FAQ webpage.

Keeping you informed
We will remain vigilant as the new year unfolds. We will continue to follow county and state public health guidelines. The next “Checking In With Chancellor May” e-mail will include the latest COVID-19 updates — look for it on Friday, January 14.
 
In the meantime, let’s stay compassionate, patient and understanding as the new year begins. We will get through this, together.
 
We wish you all a Happy New Year. Go Ags!

Best regards,

Gary S. May

"I feel it. As I got better at school over the years, I always felt an inferiority complex because most students that got accepted at Davis were at the top 10% at their high school and that could technically mean anything based on the size and average GPA of a graduating class. This school really emphasized the “there’s always going to be someone smarter than you” idea compared to K-12 because usually the smartest people I have met in K-12 where within the the Top 10% where I was or they were a gifted kid that hella didn’t try in high school and had lower grades because of it.",1640918229,1,0
"I dunno, I've always been really good at tests but I don't see them as a useful metric of intelligence; they're just a measure of how good you are at taking tests.

My advice: find something

• that you enjoy doing

• that genuinely helps other people

• that you're good at or can become good at

• that pays enough to live on

"For young men (18-24) who are opting to get the booster as a result of this mandate, remember:

Myocarditis is a serious concern in your sex and age group.  Appx 13 myocarditis diagnoses occur for every 57 COVID hospitalizations prevented.  (CDC, 06-COVID-Oliver-508).  (Both are exceedingly rare, and the booster is generally much safer than the second dose)

You can substantially reduce your risk of myocarditis by:

* Choosing the Pfizer booster instead of the Moderna booster.  
* Deferring the booster 8 or more weeks after your second mRNA dose.

Talk to your doctor.  **It's not a question of whether to boost, but how to boost safely.**",1640917920,1,0

"My issue with this is that if a student gets covid, and now can’t come on campus for 2 weeks that can cause huge problems and potentially get you dropped from a class. Last time I checked the policy on accommodations when having to quarantine they were basically non existent. I was told by a professor last quarter in a class with a required lab in which if you miss even one you fail the class, that if you get covid that’s basically not his problem. So somehow we have attend mandatory labs and discussions, while a variant is spreading that’s vaccine resistant, and if we get covid then sucks for us I guess?? Unless I’m missing something that seems to put students in an impossible situation.",1640917284,1,0

"You can date whoever you want of course. But in the process of expressing your preference you are being both condescending and accusatory of people with different preferences then you. 

Not dating you’re undergrads is generally a good rule, but you go farther then that and say it’s not about the institutional power; it’s something inherent in age.

You are saying that these adults are not “really” adults or capable of making their own decisions. But age is not really a great stand in for maturity or knowledge. I work with two people who are both the same age. One is woefully emotionally under equipped and inexperienced with how the world works. The other is assertive in setting boundaries with peers and superiors, good at managing their time, and understands the implicit dynamics of the work place. You see this pattern with people well into their 40s and 50s. Just type #vaccine into Twitter and you’ll see plenty of septuagenarians with the emotional self awareness of an 8 year old.


Then you’re accusing older partners of predation and abuse. There can be toxic or abusive patterns in age gap relationships. And in same age relationships. And interracial or intercultural relationships. But the same way experience or self awareness is not dependent on age alone, neither is toxicity inherent in any of those pairings.",1638817878,1,0

"Agreed. Also, you will be very cold. I was used to riding in SoCal weather and riding in winter here was a shock to me. Definitely layer up if you are riding &gt;40mph in winter. A good base layer and wind breaker layer under you jacket can do wonders to keep you warm.",1638815471,3,0
"The City of Davis doesn't choose what to do with private property but rather approves or rejects plans for (re)development based on a number of factors including the General Plan for the City [https://www.cityofdavis.org/city-hall/community-development-and-sustainability/planning-and-zoning/general-plan](https://www.cityofdavis.org/city-hall/community-development-and-sustainability/planning-and-zoning/general-plan)

The Umall has been 1/2-dead for a decade, gigantic waste of crumbling and not particularly well built or attractive space sitting on the most valuable real estate in the zip code. 

I actually wish the City would exercise some powerful eminent domain once in awhile: the 3rd street rehab, for example, would have been made 1000 times better if they'd bought up the private houses between A and B St and turned the whole thing pedestrian / bike with new businesses and tons of outdoor seating.

I will note that I saw your other post, and I agree with your sentiment on “good faith” cases. At end of the day, students and TAs are people, so if a TA/undergrad finds love—great! I’ll take what you’ve said into consideration.",1638812885,1,0

Yah I mean people of the same age can have had more experience or partners. One partner can be more assertive then the other. You could call of those “power imbalances” but it doesn’t mean them dating is inherently unethical as long as they both are happy and treat each other well and with respect.,1638803559,3,0
[deleted],1638803077,1,0
I think there is some arrogance here. The fact that you regard people younger then you as some how intellectually inferior does not mean they actually are no matter how “confidently” you say it. I’ve dated older people then me. There wasn’t a “power dynamic” because they weren’t arrogant dicks who disregarded my opinion because of my age. I’m really curious what department you’re in now.,1638801122,6,0
"This is reminded me of a friend of mine who was a cool hipster girl that dated their TA. Turned out she wasn’t the only one and he had a habit of doing it. Most of the women in the department ended up turning against him and to this day when I hear someone with his name the first thing I think is “trash”. 

So I think if you’re casually dating undergrads on the regular that’s a bad look. 

But I think their are also good faith cases where that is just how you happen to meet the person you’re supposed to be with ( as with the people in the thread who have been together for over a decade and met this way).

 The idea I couldn’t be with my current partner if we met when I was an undergrad and they were a TA would be tragic. And if I was a TA and I met my partner as a student I don’t think I’d let my job get in the way of being with someone I really care about. 

But if I did it’s the sort of thing I would disclose to my advisor, department chair, fellow grad students, and who ever is in charge of TA assignments so there wasn’t even the appearance of impropriety. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. 

So yes, generally TAs should not date undergrads. But I’m not a huge fan of how this thread seems to stigmatize it in all cases. There is a right way and a wrong way for something like this to happen.",1638800973,2,0

"Been commuting on motorcycles to campus for two years now. I do both commutes and tracks, so my gears can be closer to the higher end. But on daily bases, I’d only wear a jacket(leather for winter and mesh for summer), pair of gloves(will definitely save your palm from a minor crash), and a helmet. Ideally, you’d want some protection on your knees and hips also. Just make sure your helmet is DOT certified, go for bigger brands like shoei, arai, etc. Try the helmet on in the shop(cycle gear) for the best fit, they are truly the most important gear that will save your life if anything happens. All other gears are only for preventing major soft tissue injuries. There are plenty of motorcycle parking on campus, I’ve never had to walk more than 5 minutes to any of the halls from where I park.

"I’m an NPB major and pre-pa and I wouldn’t recommend going to UCD. NPB 110 series is super hard and it will lower your gpa. I didn’t take pre-reqs here but from what I hear ochem and physics is super hard as well and is a strain on many ppls mental health. GPA isn’t everything ofc but it’s a major part of being a good applicant for programs. And a lot of ppl who do not get a good gpa retake those courses in post bacc programs which end up costing more time and more money. I’d recommend going to a cc to get your lower division prerequisites completed and then transfer a csu. You can also get a part time job on the side like being a cna, emt, pt aide which are good for your app. This isn’t as manageable if you go to UCD since it’s a quarter system.
