Student Leadership Opportunity: Helping Homeless Communities,"**Hearts for the Homeless International** is a student-led nonprofit organization that provides free blood-pressure screening opportunities and heart health education to homeless populations around the United States and globally. We are a team of undergraduate students, medical students, PhD students, medical doctors, and other professionals who are invested in improving the well-being of homeless communities around the world- including yours. H4H was originally founded by students at the University of Central Florida and has since grown into an international organization with over 15 chapters across the United States, Brazil, and India. With your passion, we aim to work with you to help you positively impact your homeless community. Together, we can better fulfill our goal of improving the condition of humanity! 

We are **interested in working with student leaders** who want to innovate, to serve, and to enact change. For student leaders who are interested, all we ask is for your time, leadership, and compassion. We will take care of the rest. The lives you will change, the friends you will make, and the experiences you will gain will be invaluable.

The work of our students has helped so many, and for this reason, it has been recognized by the US Congress, the Brazilian government, President Clinton, educational and medical institutions, and other non-profit institutions as well. Some of our other significant achievements include leading an effort to rescue the homeless in multiple cities from hurricanes, partnering with Shark Tank’s Bombas Socks, as well as being published by [Forbes Magazine](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesnonprofitcouncil/2017/11/06/how-young-leaders-are-strengthening-community-responses-to-disasters/#77391a361850). 

We want to be able to help serve the homeless community in the Stanford and San Jose areas. Just recently, it was discovered that the situation was worse than expected. According to a recent [study](https://www.security.org/resources/homeless-statistics/) by safety resource Security.org, California is the state with the highest number of people experiencing homelessness, with many of them being in the San Jose area. As the Hearts for the Homeless Stanford President, you will positively impact your community with a great international team supporting your drive to help others and implementing any great ideas you suggest.

However, seeing as I missed the deadline, it seems that I would only be able to start the degree sometime next year. I did see on the website, however, that it is possible to transfer credits from your undergrad classes, and was wondering if it would be feasible to start taking various MS&amp;E coterm classes right now, and then transfer it over if I happen to get in, and so end up finishing it in 4 years. This seems kind of wonky, because I would technically be finishing the coterm degree in the space of a few months, having transferred over most of the classes to finish the degree before even technically starting it. However, does anyone know if it would be possible? If not, would there be any other loopholes or ways that I could somehow finish it in 4 years?

Claiming AP Credits for Premed?,"Hi all, prospective freshman here!

I am in a bit of a dilemma. Looking at the AP chart, I have the ability to claim AP credit for Calculus BC, Chemistry, Computer Science A, and Physics 1&amp;2. As a premed, would it be better to claim these credits or not?

I came up with a list of possible pros or cons:

Pros:

* I would place out of potentially difficult general education weeder classes (are premed intro classes at Stanford difficult to succeed in?)
* I would have room to take more classes that interest me and fulfill my requirements faster in time to study for the MCAT

Cons:

* I took the AP exams over a year ago, so my foundation may be weak, setting me up for failure in upper division classes or the MCAT
* If the premed intro classes are relatively easy to succeed in, I could be losing out on potential GPA boost
* Some medical schools may not take AP credits? (Not sure, I haven't looked into it yet)

I was hoping a current or past student could offer some insight into this dilemma. I guess the main concern underlying this decision is: how hard are the premed intro classes, and do they provide a necessary foundation that couldn't be replaced easily?

If anyone has insight on specific tests that I listed, like Computer Science for example, and how doable classes are for someone who claimed AP credit, that would be great as well!",1581212269,1,0

Once again asking for your academic support (Grad school),"Long story short, I was originally accepted to Stanford and another T5 school for EE undergrad. I loved Stanford way more--the people, the culture, the location (especially with my SAD), and overall atmosphere--but also didn't mind the other one either and thought it was okay too. I ultimately didn't choose Stanford because I was offered a full ride scholarship through a merit program given to about only 80 students here so that was a no brainer at the time; however, I can't say I'm enjoying my time here despite constant efforts to mingle and find community.

I'm interested in going here for grad school in EE/Bioeng but I always hear tales about how GPA is important for grad school and this semester particularly, I've been getting hit hard on midterms. Most people in my class are but it's not because the class as a whole doesn't understand the concepts--the professor even said he purposely makes it so that not everyone finishes on time and even curved our tests down because 50% of class made 90's one time. 

For any current grad students here, what's your story, what was your incoming gpa, and overall, what's important when applying for grad school? How can I set myself up to better prepare for grad school as a current sophomore? I guess that I'm just losing hope right now, probably having some imposter syndrome lately because I don't consider myself the brightest and I'm relatively slow at learning compared to my peers here despite receiving that merit scholarship. I also don't have any research experience other than being an research assistant in a bioeng lab making small things for grad students but not really contributing directly to their work. I suppose ideally just want someone to say, ""It's okay if your gpa drops. It's okay to not focus on school all the time and make time for your hobbies at the cost of your grades. There's still a chance."" Apologies if this type of post isn't allowed on this sub.",1583268298,1,0

Canadian Applicant Confused if I should go to Stanford,"Canadian confused if I should go to UCLA

Which is more important when determining workload: number of classes or units?,"In the math major, all classes are 3 units.

Thus, I was wondering how you guys usually decide what an acceptable workload is. I suppose a way to make this precise is the following question: Assuming pretty average difficulty, would you be more worried about 5 classes comprising 15 units or 4 classes comprising 18?

Biochem Help Today?,"I have a problem set due at 6pm that's released at 3pm. If someone is good at the CMP regulation, please pm/email me at [biochemtutoring123@gmail.com](mailto:biochemtutoring123@gmail.com). I can pay you very well..  One example question we were given is about what will happen to the CMP in biosynthetic conditions? 

The answer we were given is here: We are in biosynthetic conditions. This means we are using something smaller (in this case citrate) and using that to build something larger (in this case fatty acids). For biosynthetic conditions to even be active it implies we have a much higher amount of ATP because ATP positively regulates biosynthetic pathways. Since we have high ATP that means have a lot of our products for the ETC and therefore ATP synthase will get inhibited. If we inhibit ATP synthase this means that we have nothing to dissipate our pH gradient and therefore it will become too unfavorable for the ETC to continue to pump protons against its concentration gradient and therefore the ETC also will shutdown. This will then cause a build-up of the substrates of the ETC, one of which is NADH. Now, that you have high amounts of NADH and ATP, they will together go and inhibit the irreversible steps of the TCA cycle.However, this is where it gets a bit complicated and why you need to remember the bigger picture (and this will answer your second question). Yes, NADH and ATP will both inhibit the irreversible steps of the TCA as well as ATP inhibiting both PFK and PK in glycolysis. However, remember that you are also removing citrate to produce fatty acids. Even though citrate synthase is being inhibited by NADH and ATP, if we keep removing citrate you would eventually get to a really really low concentration of citrate and therefore it will pull forward that reaction even though citrate synthase is also being inhibited (remember our bigger picture is that we need to keep being able to produce citrate to remove it to make fatty acids so that's what is happening here as well). Same thing happens for glycolysis. Since we keep removing acetyl-CoA to make citrate, and pyruvate to make acetyl-coA, and so on, the rest of glycolysis will also be pulled forward even though we are inhibiting many of its enzymes. So there wouldn't be an accumulation of glycolytic intermediates again because they are being broken down to form more citrate so we can ultimately make more fatty acids.",1584291711,1,0

3 confirmed cases on campus &amp; employees still on-site,"Hi everyone,

I'm asking again that students and the greater Stanford community support this petition for enforcing mandatory telecommuting practices for employees: http://chng.it/xjqQFK8Z


Stanford University has now confirmed 3 cases on campus, with additional cases being 'presumptive'. We are not asking for the closure of the University, as we expect to be just as productive at home. By enforcement of working remotely, this will help the greater campus and community, since it greatly reduced the amount of interaction between individuals who may be carriers/silent carriers, helping everyone involved. This will be supportive to the employees who will be required to remain on campus (custodial staff, etc) while greatly reducing their workload and reducing the amount of individuals they come in contact with. 


This will also be supportive to employees who have older children in school (who do not need constant supervision) that they would like to pull out for home instruction at this time. Many parents are worried about their young children who suffer from chronic illnesses, yet are unable to offer them an alternative due to being required to come in to work daily. 


No other *company* in the bay area is reacting like this with several confirmed cases on their campus. It is too late to be proactive, since it has likely already spread on the main campus, but it is time to be reactive and pause the spread. Stanford University should be especially concerned with this, since the Stanford hospital is in danger of becoming overwhelmed due to the overload of cases in a short period of time. 

Stanford has over 30,000 community members between the University, LPCH, and the main hospital. They interact daily and there are large portions of employees on the hospital side as well who can be staggered/completely work from home during this time while sufficiently supporting the medical staff.

Nobody in my school knows about ACT and SAT’s and nobody applied for an American institution. So I never really knew much about American institutions, but I’ve literally fallen in love with Stanford over the last couple months. 

I got into a top Canadian university, but it’s nothing like Stanford. It’s ranked in the 30-40 range worldwide, nowhere near Stanford. Also Stanford just seems so beautiful and close to where I dream of working one day, in the Silicon Valley. 

I want to transfer but I’m reading they only take 12-24 students, and favour veterans. I want to take a gap year, but then if I don’t get into Stanford it will be a big waste. 

Somebody’s advised me to just go to the Canadian university for first year, and apply as a freshman for Stanford. But then I won’t be able to get the credits from my first year at the Canadian university. I will have to pay tuition, but Canadian tuition is only 5-6k for Canadians so it’s not too bad, that’s fine I guess.

Transfer Students and Prospects,"Hi everyone! So I am currently a student at Rutgers University (some of you prob have never even heard of us lol), and I was looking into (applying to?) transferring here to Stanford. While Rutgers is great in terms of opportunities and stuff, I feel somewhat limited by the academics, as there is something very specific I want to pursue academically, and that's not on option there. Actually, its not really an option in any universities besides a couple, including Stanford University. I do not want to transfer just because of the name, in fact, I ended up here specifically through searching that program I was looking into. 

I know the chances are absurdly low (Basically 1%), however I have taken advantage of many opportunities while here at Rutgers, and I even intend to start doing research next semester (I am currently a Freshman). As far as LORs I have been able to connect with multiple professors, who will probably write 2 of them, but then I also have a High School teacher who was also my Mock Trial coach, and who I still keep in contact with, who would be willing to write me one as well (for the extra LOR for someone who knows you well). 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I am rambling, but I just wanted to reach out here to see what I can do to be able to get in. Are there any transfers here who came from not a CC or the military, but from a State University? I feel like I've taken advantage of many things here, and this seems like an appropriate step to take. I have been lurking here for quite a while, and have been watching videos of students who come to this school, and I feel like I would fit in so well with the culture, which I have accidentally grown to love through my active indulging of any content Stanford-related.

- Co-terms and masters stuff
- Deciding between colleges and majors? (Though I took an extra 12 months doing both of these things... My main hint is never to introduce yourself by “I’m choosing between x, y, and z”)

I think I want to study either public policy, public health, or economics. I'd love to hear a student's perspective on studying something other than tech at Stanford.

Since these schools are relatively similar in academics, I was also hoping to hear about the social scenes. I think that greek life might be bigger at S than H/Y, which doesn't really bother me unless it comes off as overpowering campus social life. I also am a fan of school spirit-- so I think Stanford wins there!

The single most important thing to remember as a Stanford student (or admit!),"Recent grad here who did an undergrad and coterm. There's so much to be overwhelmed by at Stanford - everyone seems to have more friends, more fun, more job/internship offers, less confusion, more sex, less existential angst, more units, more group texts, better grades, more party invites, whaaatever. This way overwhelmed me until, like, the end of junior year, when I realized: **you cannot compare yourself in the singular to your peers in the aggregate**. Of course you individually didn't get four job offers; that's the lump sum of what the five people you most recently spoke with got, but it's all sticking together in your mind. Of course you don't have three professors you text with; that's, like, the combined total of all of your friends plus those randos you sometimes talk to in your dorm (or on Zoom?). **You are only one Stanford student**, but it's easy to compare yourself with the combined top achievements of the 15 people you talk to regularly.

What is it like to be an RA for an upperclassman or sophomore dorm?,"How intense is it to be an RA for an upperclassman dorm or a sophomore dorm?

Being an RA for a frosh dorm seems so intense in that it seems you have to be on-call virtually 24/7 - I was wondering if it's the same for non-frosh dorms?

Can you easily balance RAing for an older dorm with spending time with friends, classwork, clubs, and events on campus, or is it something that will take up most of your time? What are your responsibilities, and how easy/hard is it? Does it still feel emotionally rewarding? (I've heard that upperclassman dorms tend to have a less strong sense of community?)

Applying to MD PhD with One Withdrawal,"I plan to apply for MD PhD programs my senior year (taking a Gap year). My two top schools are Emory and Stanford. I currently have a 4.0 GPA and I’m a junior. I’ve been doing research since the summer of freshman year, each semester. I also got into Mayo Clinic’s summer fellowship for this summer (even though it may get cancelled due to Corona). However, there is one class (professor actually) that is really bothering me. It’ll be the class to destroy my straight A streak. It’s microbiology lab (1 credit hour). The class is point based but I’ve lost too many points in the class to make an A so I’m currently in the B range but we have a Lab Practicum coming up where I’m sure she’ll take off a lot of points (she’s known for taking off a lot of points for tiny errors), possibly making me end up in the C range. I’m certain I would make an A if I take the lab again in the spring of my senior year with a different professor. There’s a lot going on right now and because of Corona, our school is letting us withdrawal (W) anytime for the rest of the semester without academic penalty. 

How bad would one W look for me through Stanford and Emory’s eyes? Would I still have a chance of getting an interview? Should I withdraw? Have any advice?",1584809365,1,0

Math 51? CS 106A/B/X? Both?,"Incoming pre-frosh with some preliminary questions about my first quarter.

I'm wondering if I should begin with Math 21 or 51. I got a 5 in AP Calculus BC (junior year, so I'll be a year removed) and I'm fairly interested in dabbling in some higher-level, proof-based classes. Would it be wise to brush up on my calculus in Math 21 for a quarter, or should I start with 51? I've heard 51 has the hardest curve in the fall quarter.

In addition, I'm wondering which CS class I should begin with. I'm currently taking AP Computer Science A, and I'm fairly confident I can swing a 4 or 5, which according to the table should knock out CS 106A. However, I've heard good things about the class and I don't consider my CS foundation to be super strong. Any advice which CS class I should start with?

#CrootTheGroots! College Football Risk needs you!,"Howdy!

My name is u/TxAg70. I am the leader of the Texas A&amp;M Army for College Football Risk, an online college football equivalent to the strategy board game ""Risk"". I come to you today with a request. Come check out [this discord link](https://discord.gg/F5T8uc5) to join the Stanford Team for College Football Risk.

Now... I know what you guys might be thinking. ""What the heck is this lost Aggie doing here? Why would he help us recruit?"" Well, there's an argument to be made for strategic value for sure, although we're certainly big enough to hold our own. It doesn't hurt that the team invading you is Michigan, a team that is also at war with us. But I tell you, that is not the reason I am here today. Nor is it the fact that y'all are the last team standing from the Pac-12 and have held your own in the forests of Northern California for many, many turns. Nor is it the fact that y'all have some fun traditions like jumping in the fountains [we do something like that when we win an A&amp;M game -- the Corps of Cadets throws our yell leaders into the ""fish pond""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lADrKUgHsw)

No. The reason I am here...

I come to you not as an ally (we are neutral with Stanford, as we are with many teams not named Michigan or *that orange school*), and not as an Aggie, but as a shitposter. I simply want more of these memes. 

However, I'm sure I don't have to sit here and tell you that a you guys as a team of 40 players will struggle against Michigan, a team of 800. Presumably y'all have some newfangled Palo Alto style app for that. Or just tell your friends and fellow Stanford fans!

Stanford vs Harvard for CS/Physics Interests?,"Hey everyone, hope you're all doing okay. I'm a cross-admit to Harvard and Stanford, and I'm finding it so hard to make a choice. I'd really like to study both physics and computer science in college, as my biggest interests atm are in the intersection of ML and physics in research. I also like the option of having CS industry work as a backup in case my interest in physics fades in the future.

So whichever school I go to, I'd likely want to do a double major (or maybe coterm in one of the two majors if I go with Stanford??). Both schools have top-notch physics programs (Harvard seems to be a tad bit better, especially with the amazing Center for Astrophysics, but prob nothing meaningfully different for undergrad). Obviously it's clear who has the better CS program.

Simply based on academics it seems like Stanford would be better since it accommodates both my interests very well, but I visited both campuses last summer, and there was something about Harvard's campus that felt cooler than Stanford's, and I really liked the urban setting in Cambridge. Their housing system seems awesome too. Maybe I'm just in over my head with the whole Harvard brand name. The social scene there seems a little wack, tho :/ I was hoping to use the admit weekends this month to validate my prior feelings, but that's not happening anymore :( 

I do like the idea of the quarter system since I'll be able to take so many more classes, and it seems that it would make things like a double major more feasible (I've tried to chart a 4 yr plan for physics and cs majors for both schools, quarter system would def space things out more, plus provide me with more electives).

"Sewing face masks on campus, needle broke. Desperately looking for 80/12 sewing needles from anybody who may still be around Stanford somewhere.","Okay, I know this is a long shot, but I'm desperate. I have been sewing face masks for the past couple of weeks, and was just working on a batch that I'm already late getting sent out. Of course, the universe decided now would be a good time to have the needle on my sewing machine snap in half. Also not-so-serendipitously, I discovered that I only have needles for much heavier weighted fabric, and using them on thinner fabric can easily ruin a project. I tried seeing if I could order any online, but the soonest I could get them to arrive is 8 days from now.

Does anyone anywhere on or around campus have size 80/12 sewing needles that they would be willing to part with, even temporarily? I am really freaking out about this right now and will happily pay for them, or just return them to you if you'd prefer that. I will even pay you for them *and also* return them to you if that's what it takes.

I just really need to get these masks done. There are people counting on me, people waiting for them to arrive, some of whom work in customer-facing positions without any PPE provided. I would be happy to make you a mask as well if you have size 80/12 sewing machine needles I can borrow.

I can not possibly express how grateful I will be if anyone can help me with this. I feel like I am letting people down, people who were counting on me to get them these masks, and there's nothing I can do about it.

Please PM me if you think you might be able to help or think you know someone who might. I am on campus and can give an exact location if you reach out to me and can help, and we can figure out an equidistant location to make the exchange.

That being said, the information on the internet about Hopkins Marine Station (at least on the undergrad front) is kind of sparse. Does anybody have any experience taking classes/staying there? And, if so, what'd you think of it? Do you recommend it if I plan to double major?

Advice with undergrad college decision (Stanford vs Notre Dame scholarship),"Hi I am an incoming freshman who is interested in Economics, International Relations, and Spanish. I am trying to decide between Notre Dame and Stanford. Notre dame offered me a full scholarship (hesburgh-yusko) which includes individual programming and help and up to $5000 per year for service projects and internships. I feel like these experience could be really valuable and being recognized as a top student at ND could also be a great experience. I guess this is a really lucky/good dilemma to be in 

I won’t qualify for financial aid at Stanford, but my family has enough money saved to afford it without debt. Overall, without the scholarship to ND, I would choose Stanford without even having to think about it, but the ND scholarship makes it very compelling and I really think I would enjoy notre dame anyways. I plan on going to graduate school as well, so I could use the saved money for that I guess. However, going to Stanford undergrad is a once in a lifetime experience and 2 people I know from previous years have turned down the scholarship I have to ND to attend Stanford at full tuition. 

What have your experiences been with Stanford economics or IR? What kind of summer opportunities does stanford help you or fund you for? Do you think the Stanford brand and the overall experience is worth the 300k? Any advice any of you undergrads, grad students, or graduates have would be REALLY REALLY helpful to me as I try to decide. Thanks!!!",1586407963,1,0

Late Dropping Class after MS CS Acceptance,"Hello!

I accepted my admissions offer from the MS in CS program next year at Stanford, and am considering late dropping an introductory machine learning class at my current undergraduate university. (I've been getting ~1 SD below the average on everything, don't need the class to graduate, and have little motivation to continue on given the whole pandemic thing going on right now.)

The university has extended the drop deadline to the beginning of finals week for everybody, but they have also instituted a blanket pass/no-pass policy for everyone as well. Especially since I'd have to retake this machine learning course over at Stanford anyways, and it's really hard to concentrate on studying since I'm trapped in a small apartment all day, I'm leaning towards just dropping the class outright.

Would the university consider rescinding my acceptance offer if they see that a class that had been listed on the previous official transcript I sent them is no longer there? I figured that if push comes to shove, I'd rather have a lack of a class on my transcript than have to explain to the grad student office than why there's a big fat ""No Pass"" on an introductory machine learning course. (Though, given the circumstances, they would probably understand if that were the case.) Also, should I still continue with the class even if the university won't consider rescinding my offer over a course drop?

Any advice is appreciated, and thank you so much!",1586247513,1,0
Question from a Stanford Reject,"Hey guys.

I thought I'd pop into this subreddit quickly to ask something that's been on my mind. I'm an international student (Arab male CS asking for almost full aid) who was deferred from REA back in December and then rejected a week ago.

I have been thinking I about trying an appeal, because I managed to figure out a way to pay a much bigger percentage of the cost of attendance (About 50k contribution compared to 14k lol). Now because Stanford is need-aware for internationals and explicitly says they have limited funds and accept few non-citizen fin aid applicants, the contribution (I'm assuming) is weighed heavily.

Premed at Stanford Questions,"Hi all!

I am a prospective premed freshman and I have begun to look through different requirements and get a vague idea of how I will plan my schedule. I was wondering if anyone who has gone through premed at Stanford could provide input!

1. In terms of getting the premed ""requirements"" done, how did you space out your classes? I was wondering if it was possible to finish all the necessary classes by the end of sophomore year, and take the MCAT by Junior year? How did you go through this?
2. If you took AP classes, did you claim the credit for any of them? Specifically, I have the opportunity to claim AP Chemistry, AP Physics, and AP Calculus. Do you think I should retake the classes to strengthen my background for both the MCAT and upper division classes? Or, should I avoid taking the classes (if, for example, they were known to be especially hard)?
3. I'm not sure if anyone had to go through this, but what would you say (in terms of difficulty) about ESF (Education as Self-Fashioning) course, which fulfills a Thinking Matters requirement as well as PWR 1 (first level of writing requirement). Would it be better to just take separate courses to satisfy these two requirements, keeping in mind I want to maintain a high GPA, and I would be taking it in conjunction with other potentially difficult and time consuming science classes?
4. I would love to major in another discipline that doesn't have a lot of overlap with premed prerequisites (not sure exactly what yet, but I am, for example, interested in Computer Science), but I'm not sure if this is possible with getting through all the premed requirements. Do you know of anyone who did this? 
5. What are some of the majors that have a lot of overlap with the premed prerequisites? Can anyone comment on the Biomedical Computation major (which has the overlap of computer science and bio that interests me) in general or as a premed student?
6. Finally, do you have any general or specific advice for me as an incoming freshman, or as an intended premed student? Especially about choosing classes where I will succeed (for example, classes with a higher distribution of As), and any resources to help me do so.

I know, I know I've heard it before. Stop worrying about GPA right now, you're not even in college yet. Many people come in intending to be premed or major in something, but either they find out they can't hack it or they decide to change. The truth is, I just want to be as prepared as possible coming in. Maybe my plans will change, but right now, I have a goal, and I will do everything I can to work towards it.

I know this post makes me sound narrow minded, but from what I've heard, getting into medical school is no joke. These questions are blunt because they are questions that I truly want to know and would not ask if my identity was known, or if I was in the process of applying.

I apologize in advance for all of these questions! I don't know anyone who has gone through premed at Stanford.

Does anyone have any advice on which might be better? 

In particular maybe one session has a better instructor than the other, or maybe the course content is too much to be squished into a shorter summer term?

Stanford Online Summer Classes for Pre-Frosh,"Class of 2024 here. I saw that Stanford Summer enrollment was starting soon. All of my plans have been cancelled this summer, and I’m just looking for something somewhat productive to do.

Are Stanford Summer classes worth it? And do you know if they will give me financial aid for summer tuition? (I am currently on generous financial aid)

For some background, I am planning on majoring in CS or EE. I am currently enrolled in AP Calc AB. I was thinking of taking Math 21 and maybe Psych or something.

If not, does anyone know of other places I can take online classes (for a reasonable price) that will give me Stanford credit (or at least place me out of math or physics)! Thank you!!",1588135572,1,0

Stanford vs UCLA,"It is April 27 and I have 3 days left to pick an undergrad college and I am quite stuck. I was lucky to be admitted to a handful of great schools and have narrowed my choice to UCLA and Stanford. After college, I am interested in either entering industry or attending grad school. In terms of fit, I think I would fit in and enjoy both schools. However, Stanford has a pretty sizable edge in making connections, meeting smarter people, and location(and prestige but I've heard that doesn't matter in CS). The main drawback of Stanford is that I would have to take about 100k in student loans(I tried appealing and they turned me back). I wonder if you guys think that going to a school like Stanford is worth taking on 100k in student debt compared to graduating debt free from somewhere like UCLA especially in such an uncertain economic time.",1588052900,1,0

CS Physics credit over the summer,"I'm planning on majoring in CS and was thinking of fufilling the physics requirements through the BYU courses people have mentioned but I had a few questions.

2) If you do get credit through an online university course like BYU do you still need to do a diagnostic test to get physics 21 &amp; 23 credit? And is there a minimum score/GPA above the 60% pass/fail you need to get on the BYU course to get credit?

Harvard vs Stanford?,"Hi! I originally posted this in r/ApplyingToCollege but was told to post here too. Basically, I'm in the incredibly lucky position of being able to choose between Harvard and Stanford. However, I am having trouble deciding, especially as the deadline is this week!

Some info on me: I'm from the Bay Area. While currently undecided, I'm thinking about majoring in some mix of CS + Econ, although I have a wide set of interests so I would like to be able to explore many fields. I have visited both schools, but know comparatively less about Harvard since we visited while my older brother was applying to colleges so I was much younger. I would love to end up in NYC in the future, although of course that's subject to change!

**Harvard**

Pros

* urban environment, integrated within city
* Cambridge/Boston/East Coast would be a great new experience (snow!)
* insane alumni network, connections to NYC/Wall Street
* liberal arts education
* can also take classes at MIT

Cons

* not as strong at CS
* club comping seems somewhat intimidating and elitist
* not sure how true this is but Harvard has a reputation for being more uptight and snobbish
* I feel like I know less about Harvard, since all the in-person admitted events have been cancelled due to COVID-19, so I'm unsure of how I'll actually feel about the campus/vibe/etc.

**Stanford**

Pros

* again, I don't know how true this really is but Stanford students have a reputation for being happier
* supposedly a friendlier, kinder, more collaborative environment
* insanely good at CS
* can easily join any club, no club comping
* nice weather

Cons

* feels a little too close to/similar to home
* Stanford bubble, suburban environment
* pressure to do CS feels somewhat limiting
* connections to Silicon Valley mean I'd probably stay here for my entire life

If anyone has any thoughts at all, I'd love to hear them! Especially if anyone's been in a similar situation before and chosen Stanford, I'd love to know why. Thank you all so much!",1588024537,0,0

I am going to be a freshman at Maryland next semester studying CS. My goal is to get into the Masters program at Stanford for CS in 4 years. To anyone who is currently attending or has graduated from this program, I wanted to get some advice as to how I can gear the next 4 years of undergrad towards achieving this goal. 

From what I've researched so far, it seems that admissions into masters programs are based on mostly 3 things: GPA, Professor Recs, and GRE scores. Is there anything else I should focus on during my undergrad? (such as internships, side projects, being the president of a cs club).

Stanford v Yale,"I know there was another Stanford v Yale post earlier in this subreddit. I'm lucky and blessed to be making the same choice. It's much harder without being able to visit Stanford,so I'll let you guys know where I'm at with my thinking and if any of you have thoughts to share I'd really appreciate it.

Thoughts on Stanford:

I am incredibly drawn to the idea of working on a start-up, whether it's making my own or joining another team. Preferably something to do with social impact. This is one of the biggest factors going for Stanford in my head since this is a big passion of mine, and one of the only things I really see myself doing for a career. My impression is that I'll be able to get somewhere with my entrepreneurial endeavours at Stanford more so than at Yale. 

Weather - I'm a California girl. Love being outdoors, the sunny weather is very appealing. 

Thoughts on Yale:

Yale's community with its residential colleges seems unparalleled in my head. The incredibly kind people and strong community are Yale's biggest selling point for me. I've never visited Stanford so I don't know what students are like...the vibe and the community is an unknown. 

I applied as an English major. Yale's humanities are known to be stronger. That leads me to another concern about Stanford, which is that less students seem to be in humanities fields. CS is where it's at right? 

So this is my dilemma. If any of you have things to share about Stanford's community in particular I'd appreciate it. How easy it is to find your people? Is there elitism/presence of cliques? Are people down to earth, genuine, chill?

1. Would someone care to provide their perspective on ESF? I.e. are they worth it, what are they like, which ones are known to be good and why, etc. Not too interested at the moment (they seem way to liberal arts-like for me), but nothing's definite yet.
2. Any other Thinking Matters courses that are worth taking a look at? As of now, I'm probably going to take ""Our Genome"" or something because it matches my interests, but I'm also looking to explore. I'd love any recommendations!
3. How/when do we signup for introsems? I don't see the 2020-2021 introsems in the Approaching Stanford packet either, so where would we find them?
4. For anyone who studies BioE/has studied BioE, what's it like? I've heard BioE is super broad and isn't the best at helping you dive deep into one or a few areas, but I;m not sure, obviously, how true this is.

how to choose b/w the continuous series and the discrete series?,"I'm struggling to figure out whether I should do the math 60D series or 60C series. I'm definitely more interested in the content covered by the discrete math syllabus, but I'm worried about missing out on formally learning intro real analysis/multivariable calculus (I've only self-studied it from MITOCW) and differential equations (plus the other stuff taught in the CM series but not in the DM series). The 60CM series seems more cumulative. 

Moreover, I'm concerned about whether taking the discrete math series prevents me from exploring economics/engineering tracks. 

How would you recommend I make this decision, given that I'm not totally clear on what I want to major in? Do you think either decision is particularly costly/risky, or that I needn't worry about it too much? Are the two series generally considered similar in workload?

im mainly having intro series FOMO lol, like if if i do CM id be angsty about not getting to study graph theory and combinatorics etc, if i do DM id be angsty about missing out on real analysis. how to choose?

I'm super sorry if these questions are too broad, any advice/information would be helpful! ",1589163044,1,0

frosoco,"im leaning really heavily towards frosoco, but i wanted to confirm some perceptions i have of it + any new inputs would be really helpful!! (the reddit posts on it are sort of old)

heres what ive understood of it so far -

pros: (1) really academically intense people, the group self selects for a higher concentration of ambitious/studious ppl, usually super passionate about what they do (2) you can totally study in your room because quiet hours are respected and theres basically no partying (3) nice food and nice gym close by (4) ""tight knit community"" (not sure about this because it IS still 180 people?) (5) tutors (6) lots of funding and staffing

cons: (1) you wont live the cathincollege life, sort of? relatively more effortful to party/get drunk since you need to walk/bike to somewhere else and its also harder to be integrated into the all frosh culture/people (2) the environment can be a bit overbearing and stressful since even though the people are diverse, theyre all generally pretty hardworking and intense

my main concerns are that

(1) im not quite sure what kind of person chooses frosoco, because obv there are hardworking and academically intense people in every dorm and not just frosoco. is it only really quiet/shy people? im pretty talkative and excitable, i love to have spoNtanEOus aDVEntuRes, and uhhhh alcohol is 10/10 sometimes. will i have FUN at frosoco occasionally? i dont care about parties at all but i wanna be able to hang out w people and laugh a lot

(2) some ppl ive spoked to HATE it. this seems unreasonable to me, but its still concerning? ive heard that its a circle jerk of smart people who cant socialise at all. i dont necessarily mind that, but is this true?

honestly im pretty decided on frosoco, but i would just love to know more about it, so any anecdotes/experiences would be awesome.

Help an international student decide between Stanford and Wharton Undergraduate,"Hey guys,

I'm an Indian student from the United Arab Emirates and I still can't believe I got into either of these schools, let alone both! Just for some context, I am *super* into tech entrepreneurship; most of my time in high school was consumed by my startups. Also, I plan on majoring in CS (I would do a dual degree in CS at Penn Engineering if I went to Wharton) and my dream is to graduate from college with a financially-sustainable startup that I can pursue as my full-time job. Besides entrepreneurship and STEM, I'm also interested in studying public policy and finance, but I probably won't pursue those fields professionally. 

With this in mind, I know Stanford seems like a no-brainer (and tbh I am heavily leaning towards Stanford), but I just want to make sure that I'm diligent about this selection process.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to play devil's advocate, I've listed a couple of Pros of going to Wharton, along with questions about Stanford that I was hoping you guys could answer:

1) Wharton is obviously a dedicated business school and there are tons of classes that sound interesting to me like Negotiations, VC fund management, business plan prep, fundraising, Startup accounting etc. Would I find easily classes like those at Stanford as well? If not, can I do those classes at the Stanford GSB as an undergrad?

2) I've heard that it's awesome to be an international student at Wharton because of the high % of international kids and the welcoming nature. How is it like to be an international kid at Stanford?

3) The Wharton Alumni community has a much stronger presence in my country than Stanford did. I've also heard that you will find more Wharton alums internationally and it's easier to raise money through them for ventures (especially in countries like India). Are Stanford alums generally US-centric? How strong are the alumni opportunities internationally?

4) Finally, I've heard that the social life at Penn is incredibly fun? How's the social life at Stanford, especially in the dorms?

I am hoping to do computer science, but I just found out about this product design major. Is it more designing EE stuff since it is apart of the engineering school or?",1585595498,1,0
How many units to take/Study abroad?,"Hey, class of 24 here. 

I heard from some upperclassmen that it's best to take a lighter fall and spring courseload, but a heavier winter courseload. Does anyone know why that is? 

Also, when is the best time to study abroad? Or, what are the pros and cons to studying abroad in the fall, winter, spring, and summer? 

Thanks!",1585593756,1,0

Financial Aid Appeal,"Hi all. I just got accepted to Stanford, and after reading about it, am 100% convinced that it is the perfect school for me. The only problem is the cost - my parents earn above the cutoff for financial aid and 72 k a year is a lot. However, because of COVID, one became unemployed recently so I would like to appeal my financial aid offer. The other problem is I never knew that the CSS was a thing so I am  just now applying for financial aid, and that would take a while to process. My question is this: is it possible to appeal my financial aid offer using the appeal form before I actually get a financial aid offer because I know that they will take a while to process my CSS and FAFSA and I would ideally like to know my offer before decision day as I have a few cheaper options(because I am 100% sure that my offer based on the data on the fafsa is going to be nothing)?

Opinions on Stanford Summer Session,"I’m a Canadian high school student in my senior year and will be graduating this June.

I know the credits/units will be transferable, but was just wondering if anybody had general opinions about the program?",1585531656,1,0
Deciding Stanford vs Yale,"Hi,
I recently got admitted into my two dream schools, Stanford and Yale, however, now I seem to be unable to make a decision. A lot of people have told me to go with my gut, but I can’t visit due to COVID-19 so it’s pretty difficult for me to have a gut feeling. That being said, I was wondering if anyone had any advice that they could give me in terms of choosing between the two schools.
I’m planning to probably do something within STEM, maybe computer science, but I’m also planning to explore throughout college and I figure that I’ll probably change what I want to study throughout the course of the 4 years. 
I’m curious if comp sci/STEM is extremely competitive and/or miserable at Stanford (as I know it can be at other top tier schools) and as someone who is not yet really good at programming if I’ll be able to survive/thrive. Also, I know that Yale has residential colleges to build community and I was wondering if Stanford has anything similar/if the community and support at Stanford is strong. I also have really strong interests beyond STEM in the humanities (ie poetry, mythology) and was wondering to what extent STEM students are encouraged to explore humanities at Stanford.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1585528355,3,0

Late Financial Aid + Waitlist,"I was waitlisted for the class of 2024 :/. The problem I have is that if I am miraculously admitted in June, I didn't apply for financial aid through CSS. I didn't even know CSS was a thing until yesterday. Does anyone have advice for what to do if I manage to get off the waitlist in terms of financial aid? Will I be able to get a large enough package (OOS)? Please take this post lightheartedly as I'm speaking theoretically. 

Thanks a ton!",1585502849,1,0

Deadline to defer admission?,"Hi, I recently committed to Stanford as an incoming freshman. I am not interested in taking classes online from home and basically losing a year of college through online courses. 

Does anyone know when the latest is to defer your admission for a year. I’m assuming that they won’t just let everyone defer admission if they announce that classes are online, but is there some soft deadline in the summer other than the May 1? I’m basically wondering if I should just defer before May 1 or wait a little bit to see if corona gets better and then either try to defer later or hopefully be on campus in the fall.

Are Stanford clubs competitive?,"Hi everyone! Another question from a pro-fro.

Are clubs at Stanford difficult to get into? I'm specifically worried about some of the business pre-professional clubs (Stanford Women in Business, Stanford Consulting), as I'm interested in business but I don't have much prior experience aside from Econ classes. I know that these two have applications, but it's unclear how intense that process is and I would appreciate any insight. Thanks!",1587686479,1,0

for some reason I can't get into any other link from this page, all the PDF links give me a page that says ""Forbidden"". I'm wondering if any one from Stanford can connect via the campus network or VPN and help me with the solutions of the book.

Questions from an undecided 2024 admit,"Hey everyone, 

I'm a recent 2024 admit torn between Stanford and Harvard for CS. Stanford sounds amazing for so many reasons, but I want to try to get a balanced picture and I have some specific concerns. 

\- Is it difficult to find your place and community at Stanford? The campus is so big that I could see it being isolating. What has been your experience? Are there enough opportunities to find close friends? In contrast, I really love Harvard's residential system which forms a more intimate community for 3 years.

\- CS students -- do you feel that the CS department is too big and not personalized? Is it difficult to get access to professors? Are internship and research opportunities crowded? I recognize that I would have to be proactive -- but if I devote the effort, will I generally get access to the resources?

\- Do you feel that you developed intellectually outside of your major? Harvard seems to emphasize breadth in overall intellectual development through gen-eds and diverse student interests. Do you feel like you got that at Stanford? How heavy is the CS presence and how varied are the student interests?

I would really love to hear your thoughts. Sorry for adding to the wave of admit questions. Not being able to visit is making this kind of difficult. 

Thank you very much!! :)",1587641827,1,0
