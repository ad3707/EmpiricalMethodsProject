Scavenger Hunt QR stickers in UPenn,"Hey Reddit,

A global scavenger hunt called Satoshi's Treasure is dropping some QR code stickers around campus today. 

The stickers look like this: [https://imgur.com/a/1bppSoM](https://imgur.com/a/1bppSoM) and you need to find at least 5

There will be other sticker drops in universities all over the US this week, CMU is next; whoever gathers 20 (from 4 locations) gets $500 in bitcoin and a Satoshi's Treasure key for their global prize

"Same course, different sections: variations","I am currently taking a Math course (Math 170) taught by two different teachers. I am in one section, my friend is in another. The midterms are coming up. My friend's instructor posted a few days ago a review sheet, that not only included a comprehensive review of all the concepts, but also a list of the questions to focus on for the exam - essentially, she \*gave\* away the exam questions. My instructor, on the other hand, just posted her review sheet, which is essentially just a one-page, extremely quick review. She also said to just review our HWs - which we don't have, because we submit on paper(!), and she doesn't post the solutions(!!). I took photos though before submitting.

To be honest, the whole affair seems very disorganized. Anyhow, enough with my venting. My question is whether university policy allows this wild variation between different sections of the same course? Is it fair? Anything that can be done?",1569258762,0,0

Is Calc BC Necessary for Wharton?,"(I posted this to a2c but didn’t get any responses so I’m posting here too)

I'm a junior from Canada in the IB Diploma Program at my school. My school (along with all IB schools in my city) doesn't offer IB Math HL, so I have to take IB Math Analysis SL (pretty much the equivalent of AP Calc AB). My top choice school is Wharton, and the dean of admissions at Penn recently posted [this](https://www.page217.org/ib-curricular-changes/) on his blog, which, in short, explains that Math Analysis HL is the best option for applicants in the IB program, and that Math Analysis HL ""would not be \[their\] first preference for students interested in business.""

I understand that colleges tend not to penalize students for not taking a class because it not available at their school, but I am able to self study and take the AP Calculus BC exam (but not take the class) at another school in my area. Would this increase my chances at all and make up for not being able to take a rigorous math course? I am sure I can handle all of the contents of AP Calc BC (and likely score a 5), but if it would make no difference to my application, I would probably rather spend the time that I would use studying for that exam by studying for my other classes and doing extracurriculars. If I were to take the exam, I would probably want to do so this year so that I am less busy next year. I am just a bit worried because I don't want to be at a disadvantage as a result of not being able to take the class.

TL;DR: Will self studying AP Calc BC (which is not offered at my school) help my application to Wharton, or is it not worth the effort?",1568811093,1,0

"I need to give it up, right?","Hi everyone, Penn has been my dream school for about three years. I applied to Penn right out of high school with subpar grades and essays. I applied at the last minute because I didn't think I would even want to go to Penn, but after I submitted my application, I researched Penn more and I realized Penn would be a great fit for me. I regret my decision to submit a half-assed application in high school.

During my freshman year in college, I went in trying to enjoy my college experience, but I realized my school isn't really the best school for me for a variety of reasons. I ended up deciding to apply to Penn and one other school to transfer during the second semester of my freshman year. Unfortunately, I was rejected again from both schools because I'm an idiot and I procrastinated on my essays. My essays ended up being garbage because of my procrastination but also because I didn't know how to articulate what I wanted to gain from transferring. A friend read one of my essays and told me he couldn't even decipher why I wanted to transfer! However, this time around, my grades were much better -- near 4.0 in hard classes like calculus 3 and statistics and stuff.

However, despite receiving two rejections, I think I still wanna apply to Penn one last time as a junior transfer. Over the past couple of months, I've been reflecting on what I want out of college and I finally think I'm able to put it into words. 

At my current school, my social life is stunted. I currently go to a school that is dominated by greek life; something like 40% of undergrads are affiliated. I don't have a big problem with this, but as you can imagine greek life dominates the social scene of my school. Unfortunately for me, I don't like the taste of alcohol, even with it mixed, and I find it hard to connect with random people at fraternity parties as I'm kinda a nerd. My school has a lot of school clubs, but most of them are either professional-oriented, sports teams, or multicultural-based. This is great, in fact I have joined many of the professionally-oriented ones, but the others are not my cup of tea. I realize that if I went into college being on a sports team, I think I would have found a group of friends much more quickly. My school does not have sailing, one of the only sports I enjoy, but Penn does and it looks like a lot of fun. Additionally, I'm gay and, although my school is very accepting of LGBT people/issues (I'm grateful for this), the number of LGBT people at my school is quite small. At the LGBT club's meetings, less than ten people show up each week for the meetings. Also, there are like the same ten to twenty people on dating apps (lol). The reason I'm so drawn to Penn is because it is in Philadelphia which is a great city to be gay in. Penn is more than twice the size of my current school and I'm really drawn by this. I initially thought I wanted a small school, but a large school will have a larger LGBT population and more school clubs/things to do. This will be amplified at Penn because it is in Philadelphia. 

Academically, my school is fine. My GPA has declined to a 3.86, and the coursework is challenging. I love my professors, and I'm doing some awesome research. The only thing I wish my school had more of is computer science classes, particularly computer graphics classes. I spoke to my friend at CMU, and he said he wanted to stay at CMU for another year to take full advantage of the classes there. I'm only in my second year at my school, and I'm almost halfway through all of the computer science courses my school offers, and some of them are highly specialized and don't really interest me such as bioinformatics.

I need an outside opinion: should I apply to Penn again or not? I didn't articulate this at all in my previous applications to Penn. Should I take my gripes somewhere else?

College fit &amp; experience,"Hello. I'm planning to apply to Penn, but I'm having trouble finding the right college/program for me. I know I'm more STEM-oriented (I don't really like history and politics, never tried social science but probably the same) ,but ironically, I don't really love experiments and research (chem, physics, etc). I did like computer science, but I hated the sorting algorithms. I like learning diverse subjects, but feel that I don't like one enough to consider it as a major. I'm thinking of learning some business, because the knowledge will be (hopefully) helpful in whatever I do in the future. From this, do you think that arts &amp; sciences is a better fit than engineering? Thanks for reading and have a wonderful day!

P.S. How's the quality of STEM education in general? I know Wharton's the unparalleled #1, but from the rankings the STEM departments seems sort of neglected and less prominent than other universities..? I'd love to hear genuine experiences!",1569805170,0,0

CSCI vs CSAS at UPenn,"Hi, 

I am currently a senior applying to UPenn ED for Computer Science, and I am having difficulty choosing between a CSCI major and a CSAS major.

For context, I take the IB curriculum, and I take Math, Physics, Economics, Computer Science, Chinese, and English Literature. I have a keen interest for Computer Science especially after I interned at an AI company, and I am hoping to go into the direction of a software engineer/data scientist.

I've looked at the CIS website and my understanding is that CSCI is the more common Computer Science major, whereas ASCS has a lot more flexibility with other disciplines. It also seems as though CSCI is much more demanding than ASCS. I would assume that I would be more suited towards the CSCI program since my current courses are heavily STEM based, but I also am interested in the humanities, hence my interest in ASCS.

As of now, I am leaning towards CSCI and then perhaps switching to the other if I change my mind, but I was wondering how easy it is to switch between the two? Is there a difference in the stereotype of people that take these two different programs? Also, if anyone has an idea of which program has more competitive admissions, that would be great. Or any information about these two programs in general :)

Anything and Everything about Penn Alumni Interviews! [ED/QB Fall 2019 Edition],"'Tis the season for Alumni Interviews for ED and Questbridge Applicants.

Most (BUT NOT ALL AND IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T GET ONE) applicants will have an interview anytime between now and the end of November. 

Feel free to ask specific questions to people here (and check out previous threads below), there are multiple alumni interviewers that are active on this sub (including me). The best advice I can give is to be prepared, speak your truth, be an advocate for yourself (the interview is NOT the time to be humble), and try to have a relaxing, comfortable conversation about your strengths and experiences. Also, definitely research things about Penn that you can specifically reference to when explaining why you want to come to Penn. Also don't google your interviewer. It's super weird when you do this.

That's pretty much all there is to it. BUT if you are freaking out a bit, here's some other information that may be helpful:

QUESTIONS YOU MAY GET/MIGHT WANT TO HAVE ANSWERS TO

Recommended questions for interviewers:

Note: You shouldn't memorize any answers to these questions. They should come naturally. It's helpful to prepare to make sure you hit on a few key points you want to get across, but if you sound like a robot, it won't look good. These are just RECOMMENDED questions, so you aren't guaranteed to get any of them (In fact, many interviewers don't know this lists exists and won't use any of these questions). During my interviews, I usually start off with a few questions that I want to make sure I get, but the conversation that follows usually comes natural (i.e., I ask follow up questions that relate to what the applicant says).

*General introduction*

Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?

How would your friends describe you?

What experiences have you had with people who are different from you?

What would you like the Admissions office to know that might not appear in your application?

*Academic and Personal interests*

What do you most like learning about?

How do you learn best?

What is your favorite part of your school experience?

What topics or assignments have you found particularly intriguing?

Is there anything that you would change about your high school experience?

How do you spend your time when you're not in school?

What's the biggest challenge you've overcome?

*What would this student be like at Penn?*

Why Penn? How did you first hear about Penn?

What draws you to the undergraduate school/program to which you’ve applied?

What on-campus opportunities are you most excited about?

*Share your Penn experience*

What questions do you have?

Is there anything you’d like to tell me that I haven’t asked you about?

Relationships at Penn,"Hey guys, thanks for reading this because I need some advice. I’m a new transfer student here, and I’ve been on a few dates this past week... I’m confused. 

It seems like everybody here has no time to foster a meaningful relationship with another person, and instead chooses to hook up. This culture is pervasive, and seems to be taken to the extreme. 

I was booty called Sunday night. When I got to her room, I could tell something was wrong. She explained that she was behind schedule on her CIS homework, and that she could only have sex if she could work on her homework at the same time. 

It seemed like a fine idea to me; it would check two things from the to do list at once. So, with my face buried in my Spanish textbook, and her torso hunched over a MacBook Pro opened to Codio.com, we shared eight sweaty minutes of doggy style productivity.

The highlight of the evening was when she asked if I’d try BDSM. I agreed and she pulled out an Orgo textbook and asked me punish her.  
So I turned to Chapter 12, and asked her review questions. 

Each synthesis question cracked like a whip. As she demanded, “MORE!” and the pages turned, I took a moment to reflect...

I had come to her room searching for companionship, but when I came in her room, I found only two burned-out shells of people, yearning for a feeling.

This isn’t love, and this isn’t learning. 

How can I find a happy relationship in a place like this?",1571120438,119,0

Making Friends Around Campus,"I have seen quite a few posts about new students feeling lonely and decided to post about it. I hope you guys will find it useful. The main advice given for such posts is to join a club or go out there and start talking to people around you. It's easier said than done. It may work with some people, but not always.

I used to be an international student and I know all the struggles they go through (far away from families, friends, new culture, new language, the list goes on). After I graduated not so long ago, I decided to create a platform to help international students make friends at their new colleges and help them feel more comfortable.

I published my mobile app about 2-3 months ago, and what I found out was quite interesting. So many local students from different universities signed up (even more than internationals), and I realized that this can be a great way for students to meet new people, make friends, go to college events together, overcome social anxiety.

I'm not sure exactly what information you'd want to know, but I'll start here and add more if there's any feedback.

**Topic:**
Health/Technology

**Description:**
https://www.higenemonkey.com/

We've built an interactive handwashing platform that uses an automatic faucet and a screen. We just took it to the Philly Maker Faire, so there's plenty of pictures/videos for you to check it out but feel free to reach out too. Anyway, we'd like to measure it's effectiveness.

**What the device is capable of measuring**
* Length of time a person washes their hands
* Average amount of people who do/don't wash for 20 seconds (CDC recommended length)
* How many people skip out altogether
* Effectiveness of device compared to nothing at all

**Research Questions**
* On average, how long do people wash their hands?
* Does the device increase the number of people that wash their hands on a daily/weekly/monthly basis?

**Facts:**
* Handwashing is the #1 method for disease prevention
* 95% of people don't wash their hands the correct amount of time
* 1 in 5 people skip washing their hands

This is my first year here at Penn as a master’s student and the student body here seems to be more mean-spirited than I anticipated. There are ways to disagree with someone’s argument without completely denigrating them. 

P.S. There are actually arguments in favor of giving legacies a leg-up in admissions. As the author alluded to, legacies are more likely to donate to the university, which benefits all who attend. Granted, I don’t think this benefit outweighs the cost of unfair admissions, but we don’t have to treat anyone who points out this fact like they are a contemptible human being.",1570506887,8,0

The best thing about Penn that most of you didn't know about,"Hey I'm back again after that Penn vlog.

Anyway, I just posted a new video on my channel ([https://youtu.be/T5BZ5feGVyo](https://youtu.be/T5BZ5feGVyo)) and thought I could elaborate a bit on the point made in the video.

The main point is **there are numerous resources in colleges available to students which, in the midst of all the academic pressure and chaos, are often not publicized/made known.** As an example, Penn has a First Folio edition of Shakespeare (printed in 1623 and is the only reliable text for all of Shakespeare's 20 plays), or a digital library that allows you to rent equipments worth tens of thousands of dollars. All of my friends on campus that I've talked to did not even know of their existences, let alone actually using those resources.

I was recently at a talk where the guy told the audience to get that NSO flyer with all the resources and do a few each month. You really do not know what you'll end up finding out about Penn.

Have a lovely homecoming y'all.",1573313552,1,0

I need some help with the question 4 in PFAS. The question goes: ”From the sources listed below, what do you estimate contributing towards your education will be. Do not include anticipated financial aid.” So does this mean that how much would we pay if UPenn wouldnt give any aid or how much can we afford to pay?

Our family has enough assetts pay the 80k/year   but it would take all our savings so we wouldnt do that. But if needed we COULD do it. So should I list that 80k?

Or if it asks how much we want/really afford to pay, how can we know that amount? Just estimate it? Like 20k per year is something we could do without problem :P

Student protesters offer ‘safe space’ from ‘Diversity Delusion’ author Heather Mac Donald,"  

# NOTE: This post complies will ALL Reddit rules AND it is in scope and in context with this subreddit. Civilized and polite discussion is invited.

***Speech monitored by ‘open expression observer’***

PHILADELPHIA – Heather Mac Donald provokes strong reactions in audiences when she speaks on campus. Black Lives Matter protesters [**repeatedly disrupted**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/war-cops-author-heather-mac-donald-shouted-ucla-hysterical-black-lives-matter-protest/) the author of “The War on Cops” when she spoke at UCLA nearly two years ago.

Her detractors at the University of Pennsylvania on Thursday night were better behaved. Yet even the presence of a university-sent “open expression observer” didn’t discourage the largely hostile audience from frequently interrupting Mac Donald.

They also tried to stump the Manhattan Institute scholar with questions, went off topic and snapped their fingers in unison when others in the audience answered.

Mac Donald spoke at the invitation of the Ivy League university’s conservative newspaper, [***The UPenn Statesman***](https://www.facebook.com/events/784348905263192/), about her latest book, “The Diversity Delusion.”

"Penn program drops GRE for admission, claiming ‘biased’ test hurts women, minorities"," ***‘We will not discriminate against you’ based on ‘biased’ test***

Does the Graduate Record Examination primarily benefit rich white men, or level the playing field for less privileged students to compete for admissions slots?

The University of Pennsylvania’s philosophy doctoral program is taking the first view, ditching the GRE not only as an admissions requirement but also promising to ignore GRE scores if applicants provide them.

In a statement shared on the philosophy blog [***Leiter Reports***](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2018/09/penn-philosophy-will-not-require-gre-for-phd-applicants-this-year.html), Chair Michael Weisberg said the decision to blacklist the GRE was “unanimous” in the department.

Not only does the requirement harm low-income applicants and offer “unfair advantages” to applicants of means – namely, score review and test prep services for extra fees – but women and “underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities” fare more poorly on the GRE, Weisberg claimed.

I think every school in the country can benefit from an esports program and I'd love to see one at UPenn.

This program can include anything from a school funded club all the way to a varsity team that gives scholarships to its players. To address this challenge, I have started a survey that I'm hoping you guys would be willing to take. I'm trying to get this survey to as many schools as possible.

"How hard/math intensive is an econ+stats double major at Upenn? Also, does Wharton look better to recruiters(preferably to a consulting firm like McKinsey) than an econ+ stats double major? Many people have told me that a specific business degree does not look as good.","Hi all,

I am planning on applying to Stanford, UPenn, and UChicago next year and doing econ and stats as a double major, but I had a few questions. 

1) Is econ and stats in Liberal Arts and Sciences or is it in Wharton? Are there even specific business undergrad majors? If it is not in Wharton, is taking majors like Finance or Marketing just as good as taking econ and stats if I want to eventually get an MBA and get a management position? I know that Wharton is renowned but I don't know how much a specific major will help. 

2) How hard is an econ and stats double major? I know that prestigious schools are really hard, and I wanted to know if UPenn is the same or if it is relatively easy to the other prestigious schools.

3) Is econ and stats going to help me find a consulting internship out of college and eventually help me get an MBA?

4) How much calculus would be needed for this double degree? I stopped after Calc BC and I am only taking Comp Sci as my math in senior year because I don't want to do Calc 3.

5) Is grade deflation a thing and will it hurt me?

Successfully applying for Penn jobs,"  

UPenn has a highly competitive job market and if you are truly serious about starting a career at UPenn, you will need to begin with putting together an exceptional application packet. I am a hiring officer for entry level positions for my department at UPenn. I mainly hire from outside of the UPenn community. With that being said, one entry level vacancy can garner over 200 applicants. If you want your application to stand out above the others you NEED to do you research on the department and job description. Please look like you are interested in working for the department and read the department’s website. (Google is a wonderful tool). A well written cover letter that correlates your skills and experience with the job description will get you far. We need to know why you want to work in the department, what are your professional goals. (Never say that you want the Penn benefits, we already know that, we want to know more about what kind of challenges you are looking for in your career and why you think working in this department is interesting.) This is Penn and strong writing and communication skills are a necessity for any job, demonstrating these skills in your cover letter is the best way for you to tell us how your skills will benefit the department and why you want to do this type of work, etc. If you are unsure how to write a clear cover letter, Google it! There are plenty of examples out there to give you a jumping off point. Next, make sure your resume is up to date, use the correct formatting so it is streamlined and clear. We do not want to see an eight page resume (double spaced with weird formatting), it’s a big distraction, and as a hiring officer trying to screen hundreds of applications, these get trashed first. Streamline your resume so it is easy to read and get someone to proof read it before you upload it to the job portal. Your resume should not be longer than one page (unless your employment history supports more pages or you have publications to list).  Again, if you are unsure how to format your resume correctly, Google it! Happy job hunting and GOOD LUCK!!!",1576179545,1,0

Exchange @ Penn from Edinburgh Uni,"Hi! I'm an English guy from Cambridge currently studying Computer Science at the Uni of Edinburgh. Second year at the moment, and only recently did I discover how big the exchange programme at Edinburgh is. I applied and recently found out that I have been nominated for a year-long 3rd year exchange at Penn (Sept '20-May '21).

Whilst this is really exciting, Penn and American Uni seems very different from UK life I am used to - everything from language like ""Upperclassmen"", to understanding Greek life. Quite a lot to take in!

Does anybody have any general exchange advice? What should I be thinking about before I accept/decline the offer? Do you know many exchange students at Penn? What's Computer Science like specifically at Penn, from the perspective of an exchange student? Any fellow exchange students in this sub - it would be great if you chipped in with your experience :)

I have taken math up until differential equations and have taken a lot of CS classes as well (not sure how this translates to Penn's coursework). I am a CS major and am hoping to transfer to the M&amp;T program at the end of freshman year.  Here are my questions:

what math class should I take (I think I can skip up till math 240 since I know Linear Algebra and Differential equations)?

What should my first-semester freshman schedule look like? (CIS 160?  which freshman seminar course? any Wharton classes I can take since I want some exposure to these as well). How many CS classes should I take etc?

Financial Aid: How effective is the Appeal Process?,"Hello! I'm a newly admitted ED student, but I'm heavily disappointed at the lack of financial aid that I expected. 

I relied on my FAFSA EFC of approximately a $1000 and the Upenn Net Price Calculator of around $10,000 to ""demonstrate my need"" that Upenn promises to meet for every student. 

And right now I'm sitting on a 79K estimated total cost of attendance, and I think it just does not make any sense that I have to pay 8 times my NPC and 80 times my EFC? In which case I will not be able to attend obviously. 

Their website says that even people above 200K+ income receives financial aid, so I believe there must be a mistake. I submitted a few forms late, right after 11/4, but I have confirmation emails about them. I wanted to check whether they had any missing documents before considering my aid, but the only thing that the financial aid office could do was tell me to appeal, which I certainly am. 

If anyone has any idea what could have possibly happened, or if there's a way I can get more information on how my evaluation went down, that would be much appreciated. I heard appealing takes months, so I hope to be able to take action or at least get some information from their office soon—I'm just unsure how...
