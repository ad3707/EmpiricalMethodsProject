\#Marksmanship Club at UCSD 

Have you ever wanted to know how to fire a gun? Do you want to exercise your right to bear arms at one of the most anti-gun universities in the country? Perhaps you want to understand what makes gun ownership an American tradition.

Marksmanship Club at UCSD is a student org at UCSD that provides opportunities for students and faculty to become educated with the fundamentals of firearms safety, handling, ownership, history and marksmanship skills. Every year, we attend off-campus range events (example photos on FB)\[[https://www.facebook.com/marksmanshipclubatucsd/posts/197993221534880](https://www.facebook.com/marksmanshipclubatucsd/posts/197993221534880)\] and participate in several shooting competitions (YT video of a USPSA pistol match) \[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdpNuq8a3ZM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdpNuq8a3ZM)\]. We are an extremely open and inclusive club that welcomes people from all walks of life, whether you are a completely new shooter or just want to know more about firearms culture.

Last year we had a 10+ range events with over 150+ range tickets sold. Around 50% of shooters have never fired a gun before, with about another 45% having very limited experience, making all of our events great for new shooters. With the covid situation we’ll be having our usual weekly meetings(Thurs 6-7pm PDT) over zoom while also inviting special guest speakers(e.g. last year we invited Top Gun star Jamie Franks).

"if you haven't started ochem at UCSD yet, do it back at a CC instead this year.  Med schools don't actually frown on it as much as everyone assumes, as long as you are achieving the same level of grades at CC as you are at UCSD. As a transfer, you know that you can still find quality coursework at a CC, and so do they, so don't completely knock the idea. You're going to be stuck online either way right? cheaper tuition.

HOWEVER, if your CC grades are notably better than your UCSD grades, THEN it looks bad, because it looks like you switched to a CC for those last pre-meds just to get higher grades in them.  So if that is a possibility, don't. I also wouldn't switch schools if you are in the middle of the sequence (because again, of potential comparison problems if you happen to do better at CC in the subsequent term of OChem, as well as issues with the quarter/semester mismatch)

And if you are about to say: But I hit the unit cap on transfer work--that's fine.  You wont get more units for the additional CC coursework, but the GRADES can transfer in to UCSD and clear a requirement (as long as you have double checked that the course themselves can apply for any major/ge reqs... always double check that).",1600972603,1,0

"1. Living on campus vs being a commuter, starting as a freshman vs a transfer, how much you prioritize grades, and how much free time you have given classes + work/hobbies/life maintenance/extracurriculars will all play into determining how easy it is to make real friends as well as how often you will actually be able to accept/extend invitations to bond with them.  

2. For what its worth, my few PSYCH classes were fine (wasn't my major), but I found my Cog Sci Neuro classes very interesting. I'm sure it depends on the professor. You may be surprised that there are courses in a variety of departments that emphasize psych concepts.

3. This is sort of vague because you didn't specify what the other type of grad school would be. Like others will probably say, this will depend on your preparation. 

I can tell you that the major minor thing can be rough in terms of timing. Since different departments often schedule core classes at the same times, you may not get to choose the minor courses you really want. In those cases, this usually means summer school or settling for some courses you didn't have particular interest in. I had multiple majors and minors so, this, I know. 

I am not a Warren person myself, but I hear their college requirements basically force you to do most of a minor that will count towards their specific college grad requirements. So consider the classes that count towards your college as you think about this. 

4. There are vegetarian options on campus. There is also a shopping center right across the street with plenty of options at restaurants + grocery stores where you can get items that suit your diet best. La Jolla is a fairly vegan/vegetarian-friendly place.

Hope that helps.",1599964826,2,0

oSTEM is a nationally recognized organization that is geared towards the personal and professional development of LGBTQIA+ students who are interested in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics through social, educational, professional, and outreach programming. Our mission at oSTEM @ UCSD is to provide an LGBTQ-affirming space which supports students in STEM, and helps build a network between these students and professionals in industry and academia! 

Check us out at our first general body meeting this year on Thursday, October 15 from 6:30-8:00 PM! At this event we will bring several professors and academic professionals who are either part of the LGBTQIA+ community themselves, or are committed allies, and we will have social activities so members can get to know one another!

If you’re an Engineer, come check us out at “Engineers on the Green” on Tuesday, October 6, from 2-6 PM, and for our event “Out in Engineering” later that day! To get more details and the Zoom link for these events, sign up for our newsletter with the link below.

"1) Nope. When I was a first year, I worried a lot about making friend but everyone here is extremely friendly and welcoming. Like what medicialbasil8 said, your social life is how you make of it. The whole “socially dead” is somewhat true in terms of parties, but for social gathering events, I think we are pretty good. 

2) I’m not majoring nor minoring in psych, so I can’t speak much about it. I have a couple of friends who are and they seem to like their major. 

3) This depends on your major/minor and GEs. If you are a bio major, you can easily knock off your premed prerequisites simply because bio majors overlap with the prerequisites. If you came in with a lot of AP credits, be sure to check which college can exempt you the most from your GEs. Muir and Sixth tends to have the easiest GEs or accepts the most AP credits compare to other college. The more AP credit you are exempted from, the easier you can focus on your major/prereq, enroll in courses, and possibly graduate early. 

4) I’m not vegetarian so, I can’t give much info about this personally. I have a friend who is vegetarian and she said it’s hard for her to find good vegetarian places on campus. She said their vegetarian dishes here are alright, but not that great.",1599937291,5,0

1. It is very easy to make friends, but you need to open yourself and talk to random people in your courses, join clubs, and go to events. I feel like the “socially dead” stereotype only applies to those who try really hard NOT to make friends

4. All our dining halls offer pretty good vegan/ vegetarian options, there is also food worx. By the time you come, there will be a restaurant on campus called Plant Power, a popular SD vegan place.

"1. In my experience, no. Basically, your social life will be what you put into it. I’ve found my classmates to be very friendly and haven’t had much trouble having friends. There are numerous orgs/clubs you can join to make friends as well.

2. I’m a psyc minor so my knowledge of the department is a little limited, but I found all the professors I’ve taken to be great. The classes themselves are pretty straightforward in my opinion.

3. This will depend on the units you come in with and the college you are placed in. If you have taken a bunch of APs that help count towards your GEs/lower div requirements, youll have more room for minor and other classes you need to take for med school/grad school. I’m in revelle and only had to take the HUM series and a language class (total 6 classes) because the rest of the GEs overlapped with AP credits or my major/minor. If you are majoring in psychology, then you will need to take quite a few extra classes to fulfill your med school requirements (perhaps a biology minor would be helpful). Feel free to message me if you’re curious on those classes (I’m a premed)

4. The food is alright. I’m not a vegetarian so I can’t speak from experience but there is a vegetarian/vegan dining hall in Muir called Roots. There are also quite a few vegetarian/vegan restaurants around La Jolla.",1599936197,13,0

"Don't drop out. You are not alone. What you need to do is find people in those classes to help you study. I took 21, and I had an awful time with some of the topics. I didn't find a group to work with until the 4th homework, which was on me. Once I did, everything changed immediately. Explaining what I knew to other students concreted the knowledge in my head and my classmates were spectacular in explaining previously difficult material in a way I understood. I know it's not easy in the current conditions, but you won't regret it. 

Also as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, start the homework's earlier. My advice is to work for a set 20 minutes, no distractions. Phone away, all tabs closed, etc. Just 20 minutes of pure focus on the work and see how far you get. Then transition to something else, and come back for another 20 minutes later. 

If you can't find anyone in your class to chat with, feel free to DM me. I don't know much about 180A, but I did pretty good in 21.",1602045069,1,0

"COGS 108 is a cakewalk especially if you’re a DSC major, idk if it’s allowed for your requirements but if you’re comfortable with python this entire class took literally less than 10 hours of work for me over the quarter for a solid A. The topics they cover are probably things your DSC major has gone into depth on already, but she invites really good guest speakers whose talks are interesting regardless.

I followed directions to get to Price after leaving the parking structure until I saw the umbrella tables for the SSC at the courtyard! 

Living off campus right now and being unfamiliar is so rough. It feels foreign going, and it makes myself at least feel like I’ll never have a personal connection to campus. We’ll find a way.

after admission, the dept writes support letters to the division if you're nominated for additional fellowships, and they do that using the additional info boxes. they really do want your answers to be short/succinct, because the letters the dept writes aren't very long and need to be to the point. i'd think about the headline achievement you'd want to advertise to your department or division and put that there, but i wouldn't go over the limit they suggest.

School is ultimately what you make of it.  If you only come to campus for your classes and then leave immediately, you miss out on so much the school has to offer.

I'm so grateful UCSD brought me to live in La Jolla/SD (I found a place off campus which I'm particularly appreciative of right now) as it's been one of the best areas I've ever lived.

The most difficult thing about asking for help is the way in which we compare ourselves to others or even to ourselves. I've been through some shit in the past and sometimes I wonder how the fuck did I get through it then but I can barely manage to get through some shit that feels way less taxing now?

To that, I say I don't know, but the only thing I do know for certain is that we as Human Beings are social creatures. We literally would still be just fucking around eating berries and shit if we didn't work together. So that to me is what I lean on, it's difficult to ask for help or to communicate your own thoughts/feelings sometimes to others. But it is worth at least trying to do. 

As for your friends, if they don't want to take you up on that I say or if they aren't willing to change for the betterment of themselves fuck em. In the past few years, I have left many friends due to various things like being racist idiots, or not being emotionally available. The thing is that relationships either if they are with you SO or just friendships are not supposed to be toxic, they aren't supposed to drag you down. 

We all out here trying to move forward in our lives and the best friends you can have are ones that are willing to be there and that with you.

"I understand that people want this option to be made very accessible, but there are some legit concerns about using pnp, even in light of the fact that there’s a pandemic on.  If pnp accommodations get approved or fast-tracked for fall or more likely, the rest of the school year remember that:

The senate ONLY has say over deadlines and limits on how much you can take (25%).  They CANNOT tell departments to accept major courses as graded pnp.. they can only ask nicely.  Some departments will accept and some will probably not.  It is up to the student to check carefully on that issue.

ALSO- think carefully about your goals and dreams and aspirations.  Some fields and disciplines don’t want a bunch of pass no pass on your record for prof. certification issues and would rather you keep that B or (gasp) A- 😉.  Pass no pass might alleviate stress in the immediate now, but too many could affect you in the future and I just want to point that out.  

For a lot of jobs and disciplines and grad schools, a B- looks a lot better than a P, please please trust me on this.

Just being afraid of the vague consequences (""fuck it'll be on my transcript I can't go to grad school now"") and profs/TAs just telling you, ""don't cheat, don't look at the internet, don't text your friends"" is more likely to make students unsure or at least fall into some gray area of cheating...which will then brand more students as cheaters. Of course, in OP's case, it's a clear-cut, admitted-to-cheating case, so no gray area, but for others, I feel like not spelling out exactly what happens when you do XYZ is detrimental to all, both us students and profs, especially kids in impacted and lottery-type majors.",1608341546,6,0

"for my fine arts ge i took tdge 10 with havis this quarter and it was super easy and chill. you basically watch a movie per week. grade is based on one midterm, one final, weekly multiple choice four question quizzes, and one 6 page paper. it was especially easy this quarter bc the class was remote - the exams and quizzes were open note, and their questions weren't too tricky. they asked about main scenes in the movies (to check that you watched them), topics discussed in the weekly (\~1 hour) lecture, and the course reader. also there's a curve and extra credit. the films are interesting, and as far as a ge (or any class) goes it consumes v little time and effort",1608333934,5,0
Do you have Bowers or the other instructor? Bowers says that you don’t have to pass the final but that the outlook for a curve is low bc it’d bring down the overall grade avg of the class instead of up. I’m at a 69% with the final project pending so 🤞,1608333717,1,0

"Actually? for chegg, never use your real god damn credit card and use a seperate computer 

don't be that guy who posts the actual exam problems to chegg, you normally won't even get a response in time so i don't know why people do this

if its chegg, prof contacts AI , AI gets info about post from Chegg

if you cheat in other ways (most courses ie math) have lazy profs who just testbank questions , and those are showing up on google and quizlets, that kind of shit you'll never get caught for 
people also cheat by having their notes and or sample problems with them (whether printed, other computer or other tab) and use those 
back in the day of real classes a bunch of people would cheat by going to the bathroom and looking up their notes etc on their phones

but now with online classes 
but most of the time people get caught because they share answers with their friends 

i don't cheat btw

if you're actually curious though you get like an email from AI telling you you got flagged, depending on how bad it is you either just get a warning and you have to write an essay or you have to actually have a meeting and defend yourself

"Ok this was a really long post. I skimmed most of it, and the gist I get is that you want to know what happens to you if you get an AI violation as a freshman. First off, freshmen won't know how it goes down, mainly because they're freshmen?? And haven't been here for more than 11 weeks, so they can't know until it happens, unless they have upperclassmen friends.

To help you out, I am a junior, and objectively I've had more time at UCSD to learn about how things go down. This is an equally long comment, so buckle up.

First, do not assume that they'll be nice to you because you're a freshman. If anything, they're going to treat you like anyone else because you're now in college, you can't mess around anymore and expect just a slap on the wrist.

Second, you are ""right"" to wait it out unless you feel a shred of guilt about what you've done. Either way, you will receive an F if they catch you, and the AI violation *will* be on your official transcript. Profs, especially in the CS dept, use a sort of cold-reading where they try to lure other guilt-ridden students like you into admitting it without them needing to go through Chegg or other sites to flush you out. Source: my CS friends and other threads here. I have heard that if you come forward, they're not as harsh, but really, who knows? Prof might be having a bad week or the dept might want to be less lenient. (If you're a CS student, I hear that they just give you an F and move on.)

The AI violation email should, I believe, come after finals week.

I have never been accused of cheating or plagiarizing, and afaik none of my friends have, so I cannot say for certain as a first-hand source. You've heard about the retroactive P/NP change ability, right? Yeah so they'll likely tell you ""No"" if you want to petition your grade on the grounds of having cheated, as opposed to saying yes to ""I need to change my grading option bc X reason.""

The other thing is this: you do not want to be dragged down (irl or virtually) to Academic Integrity Violation ""meetings."" I asked a prof about it, out of sheer curiosity, during Spring '19, so this was my freshman year, spring quarter, back when everything was in person.

My prof, super kind-hearted guy, had to file an AI violation against a student, and at some date later on, it was the student, the prof, dept chair, university officials, AI officers, and iirc a (few) major advisor(s). The student is allowed an ""advocate"" which I believe is usually another student. Evidence is brought up by the ""prosecution"" to prove the student's guilt, and then the student is given the opportunity to defend themselves. Usually it is p clear that the kid cheated, so he'd hang his head or look blank, but according to the prof, the dept chairs and other people there can be vicious. I see why: they're angry that the integrity of the school has been brought down by another cheater.

Lastly, you can appeal. As in, you can fight the violation if you have compelling evidence. If you get the email accusing you of an AI violation, it should state how to fight it, and if it doesn't, you can ask your advisors or here ig.",1608331188,16,0

"Spent most of my formative years in the deep south as a minority. It depends on a lot of factors: your lifestyle, is it temporary, what you want to get out of it, etc. Normally I'd say you should scope out the place before choosing to accept a job offer but I understand that can be difficult now. There are good welcoming people in most places and there will always be those that judge you for being the ""Other"".

Try signing up for the Microsoft Office Suite and/or PDF Office with your @ ucsd. edu email if you haven't already. The Office Suite definitely comes for free (I've tried it), until we graduate, but I personally haven't tried using PDF Office yet with my ucsd email. If it works and you get it for free, great!

Literally me. I think I gained 5+ pounds last month from stressing over finals. I ate whatever I wanted and even over ate just to get through my assignments. Eating whatever I wanted was validated because I had to study.,1609374347,1,0

"Holy shit D is so bad. I've seen elementary schools pull of similar designs but even in those cases they look gaudy. 

B is boring like you said, but I do like it a bit. If the goal is to match a lot of the rest of UCSD's modern architecture, this is it. It does make sense, given its proximity to the Village East (or I guess Seventh East now). It gives me similar vibes to that. I do like the emphasized 52 a lot, though. 

I see why you like C, it's definitely very nice and fits in well. I really don't think it's too different than B though. It just feels like a fairly generic modern design. It could really be any building. 

I personally will be voting for A, though. That area of North Point is actually very woodsy, and I think it can pretty accurately match the render. It's nice and discrete, but still looks modern. I love when UCSD buildings include some wood as an accent in their design, and I think that design A does it best. It feels more like a building that could have been built at any era in UCSD's history, not just in the 2020s. I think of all the designs, A will age the best and not significantly change that area of campus too much. I would prefer to keep North Point fairly woodsy if possible. Again, similar to B, I really like how emphasized the 52 is while still being fairly subtle.",1609374054,4,0
"A few things about that: 

* You might be looking at questions which are targeting a harder difficulty than is appropriate for new college players
* Quizbowl questions are designed to have hard clues first. If you look at the last lines of questions, you'll probably find those easier to handle, but having harder clues mean we can learn things while playing, which is pretty nifty
* Nobody expects anybody to know everything! Everybody knows some things better than others, and a wonderful thing about quizbowl is that everything you've ever learned will, eventually, be asked about.

And I'll pm you about jeopardy :))",1609373967,2,0
