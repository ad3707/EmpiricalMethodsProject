There's an underground road that goes from the football field to Huntsman -- you can't access it as a student as its mainly used by facilities and security. 

Only reason I know about it was because I locked myself out of the computer lab in the basement of Addams Hall at 3am (all my stuff was locked inside). I called campus security and they took me through this [building](https://goo.gl/maps/4fvoUWAmNwC193BM7) behind ARCH. It looks like a small brick shed with nothing but a large metal door -- behind the metal door is an elevator that goes down to said tunnel. (For some reason he couldn't open the front door of Addams.)

Long story short, it's basically a large underground road that runs beneath the campus (guard told me). I remember seeing a row of big garbage trucks parked down there as well as a bunch of cars used by campus security. 

Anyway, he took me to the underground entrance to Addams using this tunnel and he swiped me into the lab that was locked.

"You can still easily get interviews from the college, but the top finance jobs probably won't be as viable",1580066832,1,0
"That’s true, but that just says more about how much we’re being ripped off. A swipe is valued at like $15-18 depending on your plan. The fact that changing plans for more dining dollars gives you less than $3 for every swipe given up is ridiculous. The swipe conversion rate should be at minimum $8 a swipe (half of the actual value of a swipe.)",1580066372,6,0
"Okay, thank you for the advice! I'll see what I can find on the career services pages. Also as far as the transfer acceptance rates for Wharton and the College, I'm mostly going off of youtube videos of people that were accepted, as well as some previous reddit posts, and both sources said that there were only around 7-9 admitted Wharton kids out of the 180ish accepted transfers.",1580066301,1,0
"As far as I know, Wharton does not have specific recruiting events that explicitly bars students from other schools from attending (i.e. career fairs). A lot of recruiting for investment banking and consulting goes through on campus recruiting in which investment banks will invite students from all schools to interview in a dedicated basement of a building.

Now, as to the relative invitation rates of Wharton vs. College, I'm pretty sure those stats are not publicly available. If I go off my anecdotal experience, college students I know have landed similar investment banking and consulting jobs; perhaps not at the same rate but that may be just because less college students tend to go down this path.

You can also dig around on the Penn career services pages. https://careerservices.upenn.edu/.",1580065397,1,0

"I have mixed opinions on this. Tl;dr do i think its worth it if you're someone who wouldn't be able to study abroad in the typical way? Yes. Is it equivalent to a normal study abroad experience? Nope

The classes were good, very on par with normal Penn classes (which makes sense, given that it's Penn students and Penn professors.) In some ways, that's where they lacked the most. I wish we had been with students from Spain in classes

The house situation was a little odd in my opinion. In this program, they compensate the families for housing and feeding us, which sounds pretty normal, but is actually very different from most friends' experiences in study abroad programs. It puts a weird dynamic on the home stay. We had several students our year who were very clearly staying in one of the childrens' bedrooms, while the child slept on the floor in the family room or whatever.  In my house, my host mom very clearly ran the house kind of like a business, where multiple study abroad students stayed. She had us eat separately from her family and we never interacted with them at all. There are also certain guidelines for what they provide, like we must have a personal room with a desk and a window to stay in, must have access to coffee at breakfast, must have dessert with dinner. So weird things would happen like her forcing a jello pudding cup on us as dessert. I get that this makes sense so that you there's some semblance of equality but it's a little weird. Compensating the families means that a lot of them do it as an extra source of income, not necessarily because they love hosting students. 

The fact that the program costs several thousand dollars and isn't covered by traditional financial aid is also not great. I think that this, in conjunction with a low drinking age, led to some people being there in order to drink and party for their summer, not necessarily because they really wanted to immerse themselves in Spanish culture. You're in a Penn microcosm in Spain, not really in Spain. For example, professors continually recommended that we speak to each other in Spanish while we're out roaming the streets, partly to avoid being stereotyped as americans, and partly because its good practice, and nobody in our groups ever was willing to do that.

So if this is your only opportunity to study abroad, due to nursing/engineering/premed restrictions or whatever, yes I think it's worth going and making the most out of it. Classes are pretty much only half a day (I think the two classes are 10-12 and 12-2, M-Th) so you have tons of time to travel and explore otherwise.

If you're debating between this and a semester abroad, I would opt for the more immersive semester abroad.",1580019102,1,0

There’s quite a bit of reading for a history major anywhere, but history classes in general require writing (essays of 10+ pages) once you get up to the more advanced levels. There are many people in the history department, which, based on your interest/concentration, can also include faculty from the History of Art, Ancient History, and EALC/NELC majors, so opportunities for research and independent study are often available.",1579960013,1,0

"I might not be the best person to respond - am considering a BBB and Comp. Bio Major - but the main difference between the CS &amp; CogSci and the only CogSci major is the depth and breadth.

In the CS &amp; CogSci major, you take more CS courses, do all the Engineering reqs and have a more computation-focused curriculum. There are around 8-10 courses (if I'm not wrong) that you elect for your CogSci major. On the other hand, for the CogSci major, you'll have to complete, firstly, the breadth requirements (psych, math, CS, philosophy, linguistics, neuroscience), and then your focus will allow up to 4 ""technical"" courses and a total of 8 or 9 credits for depth (5 for the Computation &amp; Mind focus). This means that you'll prob not be able to count that many ""advanced"" CS courses for your major but will just elect them as electives. A pro though for the CogSci only major, you would get to do more actual cognitive science, e.g. psych, neuro, philosophy, and also more extra credits to use for a Masters, another major or minor, or anything really.

Transferring - have heard that it's not that challenging but still requires you to take physics and math (because they want someone that is suited for engineering and its rigour).

What I personally would advise (I'm kind of in the same boat because I've considered transferring into SEAS to do CS with Neuroscience): If you like the CS courses, you can do a double major (one major in the college and one in SEAS), the major in SEAS will be included in your degree as if you did it in SAS (as a BA not a BAS or BSE) and you will have more space to explore CogSci courses. If you insist on getting a BAS or a BSE (Engineering degrees), then transferring is an option up until sophomore year (so, there are always options).

If you want to see the courses that you need to take for the majors in SEAS and SAS, check out the [catalog.upenn.edu](https://catalog.upenn.edu)

Also, if you have any further questions, I'd be happy to help. Either way, don't worry about deciding your entire path first semester. Not to be cliche but it's about the academic journey, not the destination (a lot of Penn students often forget that).",1583093543,1,0

"Basically, if you live on campus you're guaranteed to be safe from any dangers of the city. Just don't do anything stupid like go past 45th wearing gucci and flashing hundred dollar bills at 2 AM. Penn is very much in a security bubble and has even go so far as to incentivize the surrounding neighborhood houses to be bought by professors/university employees. 
Wrt the other things you mentioned, if you're worried about the frat/sorority culture, you don't have to interact with it. And chances are you're not going to have to deal with Amy Wax unless you're in the law school (and even then her teaching duties are severely curtailed).",1581109037,3,0
What? I’ve been to penn and it’s a safe and nice place. Also what’s up with not taking advice from white people. Just because you’re a minority doesn’t it make you automatically more in danger than a white person lol,1581108979,2,0
"It’s quite bold to assume that the fact that a student identifies as white  automatically should disqualify them to give advice or attempt to be helpful. 

I understand that living on and interacting with an urban campus may seem intimidating at night, but you cannot blame people for their honesty. People are only going to share information based off of their experiences. The fact that they are in a sorority or fraternity doesn’t mean they’re racist, and doesn’t mean that they’re giving you advice from a privileged perspective. 

Penn’s socioeconomic diversity is amoung the best at selective schools. Your comments here are only dividing the student population. 

What do you want people to say?.. that you’re not white so maybe it’ll be less safe for you?? That would literally make no sense.

You haven’t even been on campus and already assume that it’s dangerous and racist. You’re going to have a horrible time if you never give Penn a chance. Assuming that it’ll be dangerous for you because there are people of different races in one educational environment is totally ridiculous. The majority of students at Penn have literally no agenda against each other based on race or sex or gender identity etc etc.

No one cares about your skin color at Penn. That’s the beauty of our school. You’re who you are because you worked hard and deserve being here, not because you identify with a certain population. I promise you that if you assume people are bad before you meet them, you’ll have a difficult time matriculating to college.

However, consistency is key and helps a lot. If you’re someone that feels anxious if you can’t keep up, take a pause but I promise you if you keep going to the classes it really helps.

I find paying for the semester is much much cheaper than drop in. Even if you do 3 a week that’s 3 x 12 weeks of classes = 36 classes which is like approx 2.2 dollars per class (I think my math is right)

"Congrats on some great options! I don't know if you visited these schools beforehand and how close you live to them, but I would also consider how the level of ""fit"" of each school based on criteria outside of premed. Regarding your questions:

1. Yes, grading is generally on a curve, but then for some intro courses like BIOL102 (Intro Biology B) or some upper-level biology and chemistry courses, the curving is a lot more in your favor or is not an issue. General chemistry definitely has a curve of B-, I believe, but if you pick up good study habits early on, go to your professor's/TA's office hours, and find online resources, you should be good. 
2. Some of the exams are difficult, but I'd say that making silly mistakes (something I do a lot haha) is more of something that might take you from 90s to 80s, and that getting in the 50s is something that happens from more of a lack of overarching understanding. While not all of the professors are fantastic for intro-STEM courses (that can be said for so many universities), some really are and the TAs I've had really make sure you understand what you're learning. 
3. I'd say that premed here is pretty collaborative. I've met a few people who might fit the ""cutthroat"" stereotype in terms of personality, but nobody here is out to get everybody or withhold answers or something like that. Since you'll be taking a lot of the same classes with premeds, you're bound to make friends and collaborate on problem sets, studying, etc.  
4. I'm not in any premed clubs myself, but I'd say it kind of depends and it might be a bit ""luck of the draw"" or dependent on how well you get along with the other members of those clubs. Some people thrive in pre-med/pre-health fraternities, others like community service clubs, and there are so many unique ways to meet other premeds or do health-related activities.

I don't know much about CMU's premed reputation, but I'd also look into that if you're looking to compare costs, premed education quality, etc. Vandy is also a great school but your concerns are valid. Best of luck!",1585490389,1,0

And having TAd some of the kids who did exclusively group work, they used it more as a mechanism to get out of doing work, which really f’d them over on exams. 

Clubs: so...I never had difficulty getting into clubs but I had the skill set they were looking for coming in. Wrt premed clubs specifically, I joined a couple and dropped immediately bc they seemed kinda generic (for lack of a better term). I know it’s harsh but premed clubs (on any campus) tend to be generally “connect to doctors”, “raise money for X national organization”, “volunteering somewhere in the community”, or “go to random 3rd world country”. I did just fine volunteering on my own and serving philadelphia locally, so I had no need for the clubs. But I can understand that others do want a community as well, so the clubs are a good way to get into that. I wouldn’t say it’s difficult to get into premed clubs. 


So...I’ve been a bit negative on premed life at penn but here are some positives. 

1) you sure as hell are going to have a much easier time getting access to resources here. Big schools have a disadvantage of students clawing over resources and research opportunities. 

2) At penn you’re probably way more prepared for whatever med school you go to. 

Also FYI, premed courses are rough nearly everywhere that’s competitive to get into. You get a tiny bit of slack at penn but not much.",1585456344,1,0
"SEAS definitely isn't a walk in the park, but you can do well if you put in the time and use the resources that Penn gives you (Office Hours, meetings with profs, tutoring if needed, etc). Penn hasn't released official school-specific GPA averages in a while, but the most recent one was from 2001 and Engineering was the lowest of the four with an average GPA of 3.28. 

I also would stress that it's a different type of learning than humanities courses and it's difficult to compare them - straight problem sets vs. essays and readings, from experience both offer their own challenges if you take them seriously. 

I think a 3.8 is definitely attainable, but it depends on how much you're willing to put in and how well you do in time-pressured exam environments. I think the time pressure aspect is something that people have to adjust to coming in, but it's something you can also get better at as you take more classes. 

If you choose your courses carefully and don't take a ton of hard ones in a single semester, you should be fine. To the point of grade deflation, I don't think any curves at Penn Engineering are designed to give you a worse grade than your raw score, in my experience they usually only help you. That being said, Penn is not a place that has the type of [grade inflation at Harvard.](https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-attend-Harvard-when-it-had-grade-inflation)",1585456127,1,0

"Potential incoming freshman here hoping to be on the pre-med track! 

* What is the grading curve like for intro premed course requirements? Like for general chemistry or intro bio. Is there actually deflation?
* How difficult are the exams for intro premed requirements? Is it super easy to lose points with dumb mistakes and land yourself with a 50%? 
* How collaborative vs cutthroat is the premed environment?
* How difficult is it to get into clubs here (both medicine related ones and clubs in general)?

For more context, I have been accepted to Penn, Vandy, and CMU, and right now Penn is my most expensive option (by a lot). CMU doesn't seem like the best option for pre-med, and I've seen A LOT of threads complaining about general chemistry and grade deflation at Vandy.

I haven't really seen this level of horror about pre-med at Penn, but from my research the weed-out courses here also seem pretty intense. I've also seen that Vandy intro premed courses grade on a B-/C+ curve (that seems pretty standard, so I don't really understand why there's so many deflation complaints), and I was wondering if UPenn was the same? 

UPenn seems pretty competitive, so is there a reason that there's not THAT much complaining, or am I just looking in the wrong places?

My parents like Penn a lot (for the prestige) and are supporting me to come. I'm just very concerned about the cost though because medical school tuition is no joke, and also the difficulty of getting into clubs here. So if pre-med at UPenn is just as hellish as say at Vandy, should I just try to take the cheaper option?",1585455235,1,0

"there is a reason why there are more networking events for women, because at the end of the day, sure there are diversity programs, but there is still an overwhelming propensity to hire men in most industries. So women need to prove themselves in other ways. Yes. The women’s programs with superdays do hire just women. However, 1) a lot of these networking events don’t have superdays and don’t end up being that valuable 2) when it comes to regular hires there is definitely still a bias. So it ends up being women competing amongst themselves during these diversity programs and then when it comes to regular recruiting the unconscious bias for men kicks in. Obviously a generalization but definitely a trend. 
Companies are working towards more diversity. No one wants to be sexist. I think that men have to rely less on GPA to succeed. Personally, I don’t even think GPA is that important or determines intelligence. It’s just that in my experience and from the research I’ve been exposed to, women rely on a track record of past success while men can rely more on confidence, the inherently tighter networks of their frats, and the unconscious bias in the recruiting processes.",1585442034,1,0

"Hi! 5th year student at Penn. I joined the Science and Technology Wing (STWing) floor my freshman year and lived on the Perspectives in Humanities (PiH) floor my sophomore year. I returned to and am currently still with the STWing program.

So the activeness of a program really varies depending on the incoming freshman community, since the ""spirit"" of the floor comes from the community. in the past, most if not all of KCECH's programs have been pretty great, STWing and WiCS being the two most active. maybe if you were not a part of the program community you felt like the floor was inactive, thus the mixed reviews?

I think any program community is definitely worth participating in--at least for a first experience as a freshman. you can always live in a suite or an apartment (like the Quad or Lauder house), **but you can only try the freshman dorm experience once.** why not do it the right way and choose a program community?

Choosing to live on the floor doesn't mean you're obligated to participate; in fact, you can have a room on floor and decide to not join after all for whatever reason (maybe all your friends are outside the program community). program communities are as much academic environments as they are social groups, so its kind of like having an entire dorm floor for your club members. this means your floormates not only likely have the same class schedules but also the same interests, and for someone who came in to Penn really shy, the convenience of friends who were ""pre-filtered"" for me made it really easy for me to adjust to college life. :)

cant say much about the first two, but PiH is great! this upcoming year has great leadership (i know the pih managers and ragas personally) and has a lot planned for incoming freshmen. :)

"Hey, great question! I took Math 508 with Gressman last semester and am currently taking Math 509 with him as well. I’ve posted about this in a few other places, but I’m happy to share a little about my experience this year. Gressman does a really good job starting Math 508 from first principles (properties of the natural numbers), so there really aren’t any formal expectations that you have any background in Analysis. That said, you prove every statement that you see in the class rigorously, so comfort with proofs of all sorts (direct, induction, contradiction, contrapositive, etc.) is an absolute must. 

The class covers *a lot* of content over the course of the semester and since everything is proven, it can definitely feel overwhelming if you don’t stay caught up. The HW assignments were due weekly and consisted of a varying number of proofs at different difficulties. Often, the most time-consuming part of the class was the HW. It’s really really helpful to find a study group to do the HW with, given the amount of time that it takes. Although they were challenging and time-consuming, they were also really fulfilling because he would often cite results that you proved in HW during proofs of larger results in lecture. 

He has handled the transition to online classes extremely well (by far the best of any of my professors) so if classes are online next semester, don’t let this deter you! He teaches the content really well and helps give you an intuition for everything that you’re doing, especially during proofs, so this really gives you a sense of the Big Picture. 

The grading in the class was super fair, I was curved up to around a B+ and I think the average was somewhere in the B+/A- range (if you showed that you had a decent grasp on the content even if you didn’t do well on assessments, a B+ was super attainable). I would definitely recommend the class if you feel comfortable with proofs and the rest of your schedule is conducive to the time needed to stay on top of the content and do the HW.

"Agreed. I managed to place out after taking IB Spanish SL with a very rigorous teacher in my fourth year of high school, but I'm amazed that I did. From what I remember, the online placement test that they had was like 10 questions and took a few minutes, and the in-person exam to place out was a million times harder. The in-person exam (to place out of Spanish 4, mind you) was a Spanish 5 final. Studying wouldn't have helped, I honestly don't know what could have helped me take that cruel test. 

I was in Spanish 4 at Penn for a brief moment, and it seemed like it would have been a pretty chill class. If OP sets out now to become a master of the Spanish language, they might bump their score up on the in-person placement a few points, but otherwise it's not really worth preparing for that much.",1587589595,1,0
"Hi, I took Spanish 140 last semester (the last course in the sequence), I scored high enough to completely place out, but I think that I missed the verbal test and had to take the course instead. For reference, it's a very light course as long as you participate and do all of the projects. Usually doesn't cover too much. I'm pretty sure if you took four years of Spanish you should be more than fine for the course, but for the test you will also be fine. You can also just use google if you're set on getting a high score on the placement exam so you only have to take one Spanish course here at Penn -- I know a few people did this and were completely fine in the course.",1587588678,3,0

"Try an SAT II Spanish exam, if you can score 600 or more on that you should be fine because that’s essentially what the placement exam is. I guess it depends what content you covered in your high school, but I didn’t think it was too challenging having studied Spanish for 4 years. You might as well put in some decent effort so you don’t have to take an additional course. Just make sure you understand grammar topics well and you should be able to score decently.",1587584684,5,0
"I took 5 years of Spanish before college and thought I'd be able to place out for sure.

Honestly it's been too long for me to remember what the exam consisted of but you'll likely be able to place out of at least 2 semesters. 

I don't think it would hurt to study before, probably study questions similar to AP/IB Spanish exam questions. But I also would caution against studying a lot for it (definitely don't put in more than a few hours at the most) because it's just not worth it imo.

Agreed very much, and although my evidence is anecdotal it certainly seems to me that people from average areas/unknown schools have to have much more accomplishment and higher scores to get to the same place. Meanwhile Penn targets very specific disadvantaged communities to recruit from to bring up their numbers (a few magnet schools in Philly and other cities) while ignoring the other disadvantaged people outside. There is no meritocracy in this country.

I think Penn tends to be risk averse by avoiding unknown schools and communities unless there is some special reason. I felt like I was the odd one out all the time. My high school was nothing like Penn and I definitely could have used some additional preparation for the lifestyle or a more robust community of similar students. I think those of us who exist at Penn tend to be lumped in with one extreme or the other so it is hard to pinpoint where they are. A lot of the issue is probably reinforced by campus culture.

if you’re not a fan of walking up and down the stairs to get to your room, keep this in my bc there’s no elevator, and sometimes when coming back from a party it’s hard to go up the stairs, ngl lmao. there’s a dumb waiter though for your stuff and it’s pretty big. but this also gets annoying when doing laundry if you have a heavy load and the dumbwaiter stops working. there are also only 6 washing machines/dryers so try not to do laundry during busy hours. there’s a “gym” in the basement but it’s kind of creepy so you’re better off going to pottruck. distance is also a factor, personally i like walking so this wasn’t a big deal to me but the engineering section could be a good 12 minute walk depending on your speed. keep in mind that you’ll probably be separated from most of the freshmen who live in hill or the quad as dubois is in a largely upperclassmen part of campus.

"Keep in mind the physical distance at Penn. There are few other schools where you can walk 10 minutes and go from the business school to the engineering school. Another 10 minutes to the medical school. I think if you're interested in entrepreneurship:

.1) some may disagree here, but make sure you get technical skills OR industry knowledge (Musk majored in physics and business, not just business) 2) call people that are into entrepreneurship at Penn (former students, etc) 3) get exposure by working for startups in summers 4) take an entrepreneurship class. while people may say you can't 'teach' entrepreneurship, at the classes, you will find people that are also looking to found a company. also, you will learn how to pitch your idea, which will be important for actually getting funding. 5) attend entrepreneurship events

Another thing to keep in mind is the opportunity cost. If you're into entrepreneurship, you are giving up a job that potentially pays 6 figures after graduation. You have to make sure you've tested your idea before committing fully to it, and at Penn, there is a good amount of pressure to get a stable high-paying job (that's present at any college though).",1586535127,2,0

I also went for an SF WIEP Wharton trip which was just amazing. Penn is really trying to shift a little towards Business Analytics. They're becoming more  techy and entrepreneurial imo.

Most classes don't have super weird grading where only a certain number of people can get and A and a lot of introductory classes allow you to drop a midterm (chem and bio) so that helps.

"Penn has plenty of opportunities and tons of clubs related to health care. If you're work-study there's also plenty of jobs available for you in research and stuff (not the best, but it's something). One thing I'd definitely keep in mind is know your limits and take it seriously. I slacked off a bit in the beginning of the first semester and I ended up  having to seriously play catch up, so don't be me and be smart about your time, but also have fun! Another thing is to definitely try and join a club of sorts (pre-med or not) to kind of have people you can talk to and have something to look forward to at the end of the week. A planner/some sort of planning program is a very very very helpful and try to at least take a day or so just for yourself as some sort of mental reset. 

Another thing, I assume you'll be taking premed reqs and such: save yourself some money in the long run and maybe look online for pdfs of the textbooks and such. Very useful and handy when you're trying to get in some study time and don't necessarily want to drag around huge textbooks. 

One last thing (lol, I have a lot I'm still learning from my mishaps) you're going to be surrounded by a ton of premeds in most of your classes: don't give in to the competitive mindset and compare yourself to others. I had a pre-med roommate and she used to freak me out with how she got involved in so many activities so early. She managed to have good grades, be social, AND so some sort of clinical work. It's a lot, and trust me only comparing myself to her made it so much worse. Go at your own pace and focus on getting used to college and then maybe add an activity or two in the spring or even in the fall if you're ready. 

Good luck! I hope you have a much better experience than I did.",1586473696,1,0
"Penn is probably one of the, if not the, best school in the country (and probably world) for entrepreneurship. A few reasons for this: 

1. Penn has a separate Wharton and Engineering school which allows students with strong business backgrounds and engineering backgrounds to overlap and create great tech-based start-ups
2. Penn puts immense funding into entrepreneurship. The Weiss Tech House, Venture Initiation Program, President's Engagement/Innovation Prize, HealthTech incubator, I could go on and on 
3. The MBA's start their own VC funds or enterprises as well that allow for undergrads to be exposed to new opportunities
4. The VC space in Philly is awesome with Red &amp; Blue Ventures, Quaker Partners etc.

"So I didn't live on campus, since I'm from the area and could just commute. I took stats one fall semester, and the day after the final was due I was flying to the Midwest to spend the holidays with my girlfriend. So, I decided I was going to come into the city that evening, do my final, stay over, and fly out the next morning. Except I forgot the libraries/buildings close early on the last day before break and by the time I arrived the libraries were all locked up. I needed to use Maple for the final and had to find a computer with it on. After a few failed attempts, I tried Rittenhouse Labs, but my access card no longer worked. So I waited for someone to exit the building, snuck in, and proceeded to wander around for a classroom that was open. I found one, but the computer was hooked up to the projector and I couldn't get it to work. Finally I resorted to jimmying a door open to a classroom and (2 actually, the first didn't have a working computer) and managed to get my final done and submitted with LITERALLY 2 minutes to spare before midnight.

"Two specific memories:

1. I was a weirdo who decided to do my  honors thesis junior year, and my thesis defense winded up being on the morning of Hey Day. I was super nervous before my presentation, but a few seconds after I started, my PI, who was also my professor that semester, walked in to listen. It was extremely rewarding to present in front of her and 2 professors whose classes I would take my senior fall. After I was done, it was only 9 AM; a ran back to the high rises gleeful, grateful, on a natural high; changed, took some shots, and then marched down Locust Walk with the class of 2019! I took dozens of pictures with all the friends I had made, including one of my favorites with my freshman hall mates. It was the best day of that year, by far.
2. My senior year NSO, my a capella group was rehearsing in Houston Hall for a freshman event. The University Chaplain, Charles Howard, happened to hear us because the rehearsal room is right next to the office for Religious Life. Apparently he listened to us sing the whole time, and it was arguably one of our best performances of that song. He was brought to tears!

The problem is that Canvas doesn’t provide any way for students to get notified when someone has replied to them.

"# COURSE INFO

**PREREQUISITES**

This course will assume a solid command of basic chemistry and biochemistry; basic cell and molecular biology (e.g., that provided by BIOL 202); and basic genetics, including Mendelian inheritance, gene structure, function and expression (e.g., that provided by BIOL 221).

No previous knowledge of immunology is necessary.

**COURSE GOALS**

The goals of this course are several: First, I hope to introduce you to basic principles and current concepts in the field of immunology. Second, I would like to stimulate your thinking, especially from an experimental standpoint, about how these principles and concepts are formed. Finally, I hope you will leave with a foundation that will enable you to learn more on your own, through critical appraisal of the literature.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

The course will begin with a general overview of immunity, followed by in-depth considerations of the underlying cellular, molecular, and genetic events. Finally, later discussions will focus upon more specialized issues in immunology, such as disease states involving the immune system, as well as particularly interesting problems in modern immunology.

**SCHEDULE**

Each 3-hour session will be roughly divided as follows:

\* A brief overview of where we stand conceptually, and any logistic announcements.

\* The quiz (\~10 minutes) will be given and collected.

\* A 5 min break  (or you can just keep working on the quiz)

\* Two one-hour lectures will be given, with a 10 minute break if there is time

**HOW YOUR FINAL GRADE WILL BE DETERMINED**

The following ""straight scale"" grading system will be used:

\&gt;97 = A+

87-89 = B+

77-79 = C+

93-96 = A

83-86 = B

73-76 = C

&lt;70 = D

&lt;60 = F

90-92 = A-

80-82 = B-

70-72 = C-

Throughout the course you may collect ""chips."" At the end, you cash in your chips, and your grade will be computed by taking your total ""chips"" and dividing by 4.

**NOTE:  If you are taking the course ""pass-fail,""** to achieve a pass **you must complete** **all** **required evaluation instruments** (discussions/debates, both exams, and the paper) **and** achieve an average final score of 60 or higher.

**CHIP SOURCES AND MAXIMA**

QUIZZES: There will be 11 optional quizzes. Each is worth 10 chips. At the end of the course, 20% of your quiz chips are added to your other chips PRIOR TO division by 4. The maximum chips from quizzes are thus (110 X .20), or 22; the maximum the quizzes can add to your final grade is thus 5.5. If you miss a quiz, you may get a copy for study purposes, but as they are optional and can only improve your grade, no ""make-ups"" are given.  However, since everyone misses a class or 'bombs' a quiz once in a while, at the end of the course your lowest quiz score will be replaced with a 10.

PAPER:  Your scholarly paper will be worth up to 100 chips.

THREADED DISCUSSIONS &amp; DEBATES: Each threaded discussion or debate is worth 10 chips. There will be ten of these - five in each half of the course - so they are worth 100 chips altogether.

EXAMS: The in class portion of each exam is worth 55 chips. The take-home part of each exam is worth 45 chips.

 **SUMMARY OF CHIP SOURCES AND MAXIMA**

**TEXT**

The recommended text is ***Immunobiology 9th edition***, by Murphy, Travers, and Walport, published by Garland Press. Copies are available via:

[University Bookstore (Links to an external site.)](http://upenn.bkstore.com/)

(898-7595)

or

[Amazon.com (Links to an external site.)](http://www.amazon.com/)

Note that if you want to use an earlier edition, that is OK, but I think the 7th edition is about as far back as you should go in order to be reasonably up to date, and you will need to figure out the appropriate pagination on your own.

"As a STEM major my first reaction to this question was just... deep despair. Lmao.

But on a more serious note: It'll take a lot of hard work and a lot of strategic planning. If you make sure to take the right classes at the right time, get the right professors, ask upperclassmen for help, etc. it should be doable. 

Aiming for a 4.0 is generally not necessary unless you're trying for law school maybe? my parents were convinced i wasn't going to amount to anything bc my gpa dipped below a 3.5 for a bit in junior year, but i got into every grad school i applied to so. 

you're not going to come out of college the best you can be if you're just focusing on trying to get a perfect gpa, but that's just my opinion i guess.",1589742295,2,0
"It's very possible. For some it is not even difficult. It just requires things like studying on Friday nights, spending the occasional weekend in Van Pelt, and being conscious about silly things like what section of a class to take, and which of your finals to study harder for in order to optimize your grades. Personally I would not aim for a perfect 4.0, if you want to get top grades be satisfied with &gt;3.90, maybe &gt;3.95. It's not worth the time and effort to avoid an A- in some random general requirement.",1589742041,1,0
"Lol. I remember on the first day of chem 101 a prof told us that if you’re walking out of penn with a 4.0, you did college wrong and didn’t discover your limitations. Getting a 4.0 varies in difficulty across majors. Just work hard and take what you get. For classes graded on a curve (aka most intro classes) keep in mind you are competing against the top 10% of high school students in the nation and to get an A grade you need to be in the top 20-30% of that group. Now you need to make sure that you’re consistently in that group for all 30-40 credits you take at penn. Have fun.",1589741476,1,0
"Reading the thread, I  disagree with anyone that suggests it is ""doable"" even if it is doable -- because it suggests this matters -- and I do not agree with the high-side 15% figure at all....nor should you care.  Why, it is just not the point and dumb... don't sacrifice your education to grab a perfect GPA or impact 4 years of your life for diminishing returns.  Sure do it if you can.. but don't be consumed by it.. it is merely a nice goal..  And I think the average GPA at Penn is probably around a 3.5... so obviously way more than  half the students are not getting 4.0s... where did that come from in the thread... give us some figures on that one.  (I checked an article for the 3.5 average).... I did see one thing that I am curious about, it suggests that Penn Law or law schools will review the transcript and adjust your gpa for admissions purposes.... by adding points because of one or more A+ 's on your transcript that we know do no count toward the Penn GPA. If that is true, it is great that schools will look at your transcript, but even so, it does not make your Penn GPA any better, it just makes it even less important to get all As in everything if you can get a great result in a class you really hit out of the park to show how you perform in something you might like a lot or have great promise to succeed in.",1589741323,2,0
"I am assuming you’re taking it with Cancro. This was probably one of the best courses I’ve taken at penn. Really well organized, really straightforward with expectations, and really forces you to do more than memorize 200 slides for each exam. 

I’d say it’s easy to get something like a B in the course. An A is difficult. But he’s really transparent about what you need to do to perform well (your raw grade = letter grade) which i loved about the course since people were more into working with each other. 

I do have notes but they won’t be helpful. Just focus on absorbing and recreating the lectures.",1589741226,1,0
I can’t speak for the rest but ANCH 026 with McInerney  is the best history class I’ve taken. The actual workload is feasible with weekly readings not taking up more than an hour. Just make sure to also take Kyle West’s recitation if you do end up choosing it.,1589741009,1,0

"Hello u/Mane, it is extremely difficult.  I attended and have a daughter attending now.  Regardless of whether you are in CAS or the other colleges, you will run into a few courses during your time there that will be very challenging or that are graded strictly. A great number of students at Penn are extraordinary students and are kids with mid-high1500 SATs, 35 ACT and 4.0 HS Averages.... All those students are NOT getting As in every class over 4 years,.. a very small percentage will...You could certainly ask a Dean at Penn or an academic adviser.  An A+ in many courses at Penn (they do give them) does not help as that does not increase a gpa (you get a 4.0 regardless for that class). Writing seminars are often very tough, intro comp science classes can be very tough 120, 121 and 160 are all tough classes... you need to be top third or so to get an A.  Math 114, and above if you are a math guy/gal and upper level math courses as well as many stem courses are brutal as are many engineering courses.  Some are notoriously tough but well worth it for your education.  If you get ill or have a bad day on a final or simply write in a style that your sociology or anthropology teacher doesn't like..... etc etc..  or  you forgot to submit the final version of your edited paper on time, or you stink at languages (and didn't test out) or if you  falter (under a pure A) in many classes for reasons that may even be beyond your control -- in all these cases Bs are easily obtained despite you being brilliant and all your efforts.  Phil, Politics and Economics will have lots of papers... will all teachers find ALL your scholarly work A worthy?  Heck, the most brilliant scholars in history have had their run ins with their possibly less insightful professors.  Now, the real question is, why do you care? Employers and even most medical schools are not going to go nuts over the difference between say a 3.87 and 4.0.... They will also see how challenging your courses are, what projects you worked on, what your passions are too... how you did on your law/med/boards...etc...    Since Brown gives you P/F option for any class... it may be easier to do that there..... Hopefully, you are NOT making a decision based upon this answer.  Penn has remarkable opportunities for curious, dedicated students in virtually all areas of study and is unique in that CAS is a liberal arts college surrounded by CIS, Wharton, Nursing etc...Penn Medicine, Vet, Dentistry, Law... all leaders in their fields...... which a savvy undergraduate can utilize for his/her advantage. Learn there and don't get obsessed with As...  Wherever you are or go...Good luck, Singularity",1589740251,3,0

"1.) You'll find it pretty easy to find buildings near where you go to class -- I'm in CAS and Engineering so I have a pretty good understanding of where buildings are on those sides of campus. Nursing, not so much.

2.) There are plenty of good restaurants, food trucks, and fast food places around campus, so yes. As for the dining halls, I enjoyed the food at some places (KCECH, Hill) and didn't enjoy the food at others. I believe the consensus is most people are not fans.",1589732388,2,0

"You're going to have a much better time in college if you don't stress about whether you get a 4.0 GPA vs. a 3.x GPA...

Unless you're applying for med school or law school, no employer or grad school will ever scrutinize your GPA and you're much better off actually learning and enjoying whatever classes you take in college rather than grade-grubbing for a perfect GPA. So just don't sweat it, take classes that you will enjoy and not worry about grades too much :)",1589732001,4,0
"Getting a 4.0 is not going to be easy and its gonna require sacrifice. Honestly tho, it probably wont help you any more than a 3.8 or 3.9 , which would still require a lot of work but also give you the freedom to take some more interesting/difficult classes.",1589731806,1,0

"A good barometer is comparing the Latin honors GPAs at those schools to Penn. 3.75/3.87/3.93 are the GPAs for cum Laude/magna cum laude/ summa  cum laude at UCLA. At Penn those are 3.4/3.6/3.8 respectively. I’m guessing from your major and other reddit activity you’re interested in high finance. FWIW I had a 3.4 and Econ major and had multiple competitive Wall Street offers. Had I had 3.6 or 3.7 it would’ve been better. But GPA is a small part of OCR anyway. If you’re applying to grad school it may matter more but again that depends on what you want to study.

Finally - Econ is a LOT harder of a major than PPE, so if you’re super focused on GPA for whatever reason, I would not major in Econ.",1589730111,1,0
"You can definitely get a 4.0 in some majors, even without much sacrifice. Other people here are mistaken about that in my opinion. I know people who have gotten a 4.0 and still enjoyed the rest of college very much.  An econ track will make it difficult though unless you sacrifice other parts of your life (lower social life, etc), but it’s still doable with enough effort and ability. The real question is why? I know law school cares deeply about GPA more than most other things, but many jobs and higher education paths don’t. 

If you’re trying to go to law school, be aware that A+ counts as a 4.3 in law school admissions. So you could very well counteract one less than perfect A- with an A+. I’ve seen people with ABOVE a 4.0 in some law school admissions (not necessarily people from Penn).",1589730040,1,0
"I fucking love Penn, and every day in quarantine I find another thing I miss about being on campus. I don't think there's much of a collective school pride and *definitely* not one around sports. But there definitely are many inclusive communities that I've found as my people. It took me a very long time - until the middle of junior year - to really find my place but once I did it really felt perfect. 

Of course everyone has different experiences, and this is true of every school - high schoolers have this unshakeable tendency to homogenize  schools and say they have X culture or Y character. It's kinda nonsense and you don't realize until you go to a college that everything you heard about it is true, but the opposite is also true.",1589729535,1,0
"Honest opinion—it all depends on where your priorities lie. If you’re dead-set on getting a 4.0, it’s definitely doable. A good number of students are able to do it (definitely not the majority, probably anywhere between 5-15% is my very rough ballpark lol). But if you want to join clubs, make career goals a priority, etc., the difficulty of maintaining a 4.0 goes up drastically in my experience. I think a large part of maintaining a GPA in your goal ballpark is selecting courses that you like—that you’ll enjoy studying for. A big part of that is having professors that go above and beyond to help their students as well. Definitely use penncoursereview for gauging this. At the end of the day, though, I echo the sentiments that GPA is not everything. Don’t sacrifice your college experience/stress levels for trying to keep a 4.0, and very few fields (literally all except med school to my knowledge) expect anything close to perfection.

Edit: pertaining to PPE specifically, all of the major-required classes are very doable, especially if you truly like learning about them! Feel free to DM if you have more questions",1589729397,1,0

Be aware that classes are not graded on an A, B, C, D scale. Instead, there is A, A-, B+, B, B-....

In general, expect your GPA to be at least .25 points below what you could have gotten at a less challenging school.
