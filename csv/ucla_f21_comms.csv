This week alone at my dining hall, 2 top cooks put in resignations and are working at higher paying jobs. We are so short staff that we have to close down a station till further notice.

Otherwise, there's no dues, fees, or commitments; this is for you to try and hone in on your craft, post your dope shit, and allow yourself to work on big ambitious stuff with ambitious people.

"Right across the plaza from Royce is Powell Library, where there should be plenty of quiet seating and power outlets. Air conditioning and shelter from weather are nice too. Haven't spent much time in there so I don't know how busy it gets during class hours, but I think that would be your best bet.

If you'd rather have an empty classroom instead (maybe you need to be able to talk frequently), you can use the [Classroom Grid Search](https://sa.ucla.edu/RO/Public/SOC/Search/ClassroomGridSearch) tool. Look up classrooms in nearby buildings and see if any are unoccupied during your online class. I wouldn't assume that the doors are necessarily unlocked though, so you may need some trial and error.",1631502383,19,0

You take a pill when you are about to enter a stressful or anxiety-inducing situation and it helps keep you calm.

"Hi, I can speak for 2 of the 3 majors from my personal experience as a triple major and can give input on the MCDB major from lots of friends who are in their 4th years of the major, mostly done with all of the classes and can give you a collective input from what they have told me with regards to their MCDB major. 

TLDR: Do you want to learn molecular biology wetlab methods and apply them to research labs of your interest? Major in MIMG! Do you want to learn more about the human brain, functions, and other things about the human brain? Neuroscience! Do you want to improve on your literature reading skills when tasked with scientific papers and articles to also apply these reading skills to the MCAT if you're on the Pre-Med Track? MCDB!  

For MIMG, it's super hands on if you're really into molecular biology methods, mostly wet lab methods such as transformation, inoculation, cloning, and etc. Any MIMG Research lab (not classes, like actual labs) have experiments that revolve around these techniques so undergrads should have sufficient knowledge in all of these techniques before getting their own small project in the lab. With this being said, a lot of the core MIMG classes such as MIMG 101 will discuss molecular biology techniques and show you how fundamental it is to have this down before continuing to your other MIMG core classes. With that being said, MIMG has 2 ways to fulfill the major, you can do path 1 which is taking an actual lab course (103AL and 103BL taken successively) that focuses on phage virology or path 2 which is independent research with an MIMG faculty member where you enroll for research classes through a contract generated on myUCLA, detailing what the focus of the project will be and you are expected to present your findings / results in an annual MIMG poster symposium that's held in the Spring Quarter every year. I unfortunately am fulfilling my MIMG requirements through Path 1 because I wasn't able to join an MIMG lab in my first year as a transfer because of covid and everything. If given the opportunity, I would change to path 2 in a heartbeat just because of how much more freedom I have in an independent research setting versus a lab course that you're obligated to be present in which can be a pain in the ass if you have other obligations as well. I got into an MIMG lab over the summer after taking 103AL during the Spring and it was too late for me to pursue path 2. Because of this, I'm currently taking 103BL right now and even though it's in person, it's honestly a waste of time for me since I'm just simply not interested in the material in 103BL and would rather spend the time in my research lab instead but I have to fulfill the course requirements for the major unfortunately so the timing for that is just unlucky. I would DEFINITELY do Path 2 because not only are the 103AL-BL classes lab stuff, it's a lot of fucking work in the sense of you're doing more for less if that makes sense. I have SO much more freedom in the MIMG Lab I do research for, make my own hours to come in, plan out my own protocols, and it feels great because I'm more motivated when I have control over things. Sorry for the long long read for MIMG lol, you'll learn lots of molecular bio methods applicable to labs and if you have a personal interest in immunology, this is the major for you since the lab I do research for focuses on immunology through cancer immunotherapy and you'll have to take MIMG 185A - Immunology as a core major course and that class challenged me so hard in a good way to see if I'm an actual scientist or not in regards to critical thinking. 

For Neuroscience, you have to take the core series that's offered Quarterly so m101A offered only in Fall Quarter, m101B offered only in the Winter, and m101C offered in the Spring oh and Neurosci 102 - Neuroanatomy that's offered in the summer or fall but I would take it in the summer prior to starting your first fall quarter because it's painful to concurrently take both m101A + 102 at the same time so do yourself a favor and just get 102 out of the way in the summer. You'll see the mental health difference when you compare stress levels from a m101A + 102 student in the fall versus a m101A only student. For the core series (m101A/B/C) there are 3 modules for each course so m101A has 3 modules, m101B has 3 modules, etc. Each module has its own topics and an exam associated to that module when the time comes and because of this, the ""final"" exam is just the 3rd module of each respective course that pertains to only the material of that module meaning it won't be cumulative ever. So over the course, you'll be taking 9 exams total, 1 for each module and 3 modules per core course. The Neurosci major also has you take 3 elective courses from different departments of your choice so you can fulfill these elective courses by taking other Neurosci upper divs, psych upper divs, physci upper divs, etc... Whatever interests you. I personally just wanted to get the elective part out of the way when completing the major so I just took 3 psych courses over the summer and finished my electives like that lol but there are definitely some interesting elective courses to take just by seeing their courses title. I think there's a new Neurosci course being offered this upcoming Winter Quarter like Neurosci 142 - Neurophilosophy, sounds interesting to me, not sure what others think but yeah cool stuff. The last requirement of the major is kinda the same for MIMG where you can take a Neurosci lab course (Neurosci 101L - Offered only in the Winter) + an additional elective to fulfill the requirement or do independent research (same as MIMG, poster presentation as well) or Team DOPA which is a program where you do outreach activities to nearby middle / high schools in regards to educating future children about drug abuse or interesting things about Neuroscience. Team DOPA definitely sounds interesting to me but I'm also in another lab that focuses on Serotonin and decided to fulfill my part of the Neurosci major by doing independent research there instead of putting more things on my plate by applying to DOPA and being overwhelmed. If you plan on making a career or want to explore the brain professionally, this is the major for you. In addition, when you take the m101A series, there's so much fucking diversity there in regards to other majors. Like in my discussion, there are math majors that need to take the whole m101A series, biophysics majors, CaSB majors, and etc. It's really fun to form study groups with people that aren't all neurosci majors and seeing how they want to explore the human brain outside of a neuroscience perspective. 

MCDB. The major that leads to the most pre-meds who score super well on the MCAT and prospective PhD students that become so good at reading literature. This major has lots of reading tasks in regards to scientific papers. Some classes revolve around weekly paper readings and you're quizzed on the content of these papers so it definitely trains you as a scientist on what things you need to know from a paper and how you are able to absorb information. I know for a fact when I read my first paper, I had no idea what the fuck I was reading but over time, as I read more papers, I started to understand the content more, I googled every term that I couldn't understand from the fancy scientific jargon the authors use and just learned something new that day. MCDB does these things to make you a better reader, a strong critical thinker, and a creative scientist when you're tasked to create an approach for a new experiment. Ironically, most of the undergrads in my MIMG Research lab are MCDB majors and they are super super fast on absorbing information from a recent publication my PI emails us to read before our weekly lab meetings. Like I shit you not, they get the paper, skip through the first few pages and look at the figures first and then they're able to tell me what the papers about LOL. Like they're at THAT level from being exposed to so many scientific papers from their core classes. This will definitely train you to improve on your reading comprehension skills for the MCAT as well if you're on the Pre-Med track where there's a whole section dedicated to that, CARS (Critical Analysis Reading Section) and you'll be blessed to score high in this section because most people tend underperform in cars. I would've added the MCDB major if I had the chance but I was admitted as a Biochemistry major as my primary major and according to the MCDB website, they do not allow Biochem / MCDB double majors :(

But I do think if people are meeting one on one or in small groups, then that is completely fine. Also, I agree in that there are MANY elitist clubs on campus that reject for the sake of rejecting. BUT, there are still a lot of social clubs that do not reject and accept everyone. Many game clubs, and general social clubs do not reject people. Also, uclahousing posts different activities going on with their Instagram so that is another good way to get involved. Also yeah, 100% everyone deals with loneliness. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve mentioned this before, and I‚Äôll mention it again: you just need one friend or one person you want to hang out with. You don‚Äôt need a whole group right off the bat. You just need one person that you can confide in. It may not happen right away, but if you put yourself out there, you have a higher chance of finding someone who themselves are also looking for another person.

Intuition is still important, but you're now being asked to translate that into formal arguments. It's hard because it requires an entirely different skill set than the math classes you're used to taking. Over the course of many classes, you'll get used to it and better at it.

Like, anyone who regularly tries to throw parties that are open to all will quickly realize that even if you‚Äôre charging at the door to cover costs (you definitely have a cleaning and repair budget), it‚Äôs kinda just too much trouble, and for what? So you can party with a bunch of guys that you don‚Äôt know? 

Technically a frat is responsible for the actions of EVERY person that they let into their parties. They need to vouch for *everyone* they let in, but women get by on that because it‚Äôs just a societal reality that they don‚Äôt really ever instigate problems at parties. A guy though? If no one can vouch for you, the odds of getting in are zero. 

It‚Äôs worth pointing out that a large subset of news stories about bad stuff happening at frat parties is about shit that outsiders did at the parties. Even if brotherhoods often end up in the news for SA, letting in more guys with even less accountability is the opposite of a solution.",1635667488,59,0

"Sounds like a neuro angle for you. Don't be in it for the gpa, be in it for the interest and good grades will come to you when you are motivated in the material and having fun with it instead of frantically panicking on the best study method to get the highest grade possible. Yeah, medical schools screen GPAs and stuff but if you're super passionate on the things you do, I would prioritize getting the opportunities there at all costs because medical schools are more interested you talking about your experience in that than a few underperforming grades that doesn't define you as a whole. Yes, I've gotten some low grades in my neuro exams but i don't think of it as the end of the world for me. I chose the major for a reason and it aligns well with what I'm personally interested in the context of neuroscience and being able to connect classroom topics to the things I do in my research labs solidifies my purpose for even adding neuroscience as my third major.",1635665431,3,0

"It‚Äôs not that easy making friends, as you already know. I would guess that 80% of UCLA students have 1 or less friend that hang out with semi-consistently outside of their roommates. 

That simply means that we are all looking for friends, but being introverted (or even ever-so -slightly extroverted in my case where I am the designated person to order food or ask for help at a store) it makes it slightly more difficult to reach out to make friends. 

With that being said, I think it might help reduce the homesickness if you had consistent social interaction and lucky for you, your typical interests coincide with a great deal of people (most of this subreddit actually). 

I do think CAPS is definitely a great resource, but knowing the difficulty of having frequent enough appointments, it might be helpful to have a friend as well. 

Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking - ‚Äúwell duh, having friends would be the obvious fucking solution, but making friends is the difficult part‚Äù which is why I hereby extend my hand (or elbow for covid friendly purposes) for friendship if you so choose to accept.

"Think of it from their perspective. Say it‚Äôs winter quarter your freshman year, and you‚Äôre pulling door duty for your first time as an active brother. You have spent a quarter pledging, been through two rushes, and have spent over $1000 to even get to the place you are today. A random person, who you have never met, another freshman, has not done any of these things. He wants to get into your house, not to do any of the things that people roll their eyes when frats talk about (brotherhood, connections, community) but because there are girls and booze there and he wants to party. Why would you let him in? If he wanted to help, he could have become a member and paid for the booze he‚Äôd drink for free. He could have set up some shit. He could have at least run the door, like you are, to help make sure no ones room get robbed. But he didn‚Äôt. He just wants to party with girls. 

People talk a lot of shit about frats, and some of it is warranted. But a guy who wants to get into your party is worse than every fucking fraternity stereotype, because he wants to be there for the party too, and he didn‚Äôt do anything else to offset his own risk. 

Most frats have guest lists. If you befriend a guy who is in a house, and say you might want to rush, you will get an invite to every party they throw, even if you don‚Äôt rush three times in a row. The fact that a guy wouldn‚Äôt want to even take the step of knowing a person who lives at a house that they want to party at, makes them a huge risk. 

Lastly, I know you mentioned security but it really is true. I was on a fraternity leadership team for two years, and we never had an incident where a member was creepy at a party. That shit is terrible for everyone, and we would cut pledges if they even appeared to have any sort tendencies to do that. That is not to say that we never had an issue with a member, just that they understood the drastic importance of house as a safe space for the community. Guys wouldn‚Äôt try something where they lived, they weren‚Äôt that fucking stupid. That being said, I have personally kicked out four different random people in my two and a half years (covid) because they were being creepy. They didn‚Äôt know anyone there. What did they have to lose.

In summation, yeah it sucks that houses don‚Äôt have open parties, but they really can‚Äôt afford to. If a member gets reported, they can blackball him, help investigators, do all sorts of things to make sure that he sees justice. If ‚ÄúGeorge‚Äù who knows ‚ÄúJimmy‚Äù from chemistry class tries to take advantage of an unconscious girl, we can kick him out, but we can‚Äôt really do anything else.",1635652567,27,0

"I was in the same position before and have dropped quite a few classes when I was having a rough year. 

Always prioritize your mental health over your classes. 

If it is mentally taking a toll on you and you do not think you will pass, I recommend dropping the course. If you‚Äôre just worried about it impacting your GPA, consider petitioning for pass/no pass especially since it‚Äôs not a course for your major. 

Just know both will appear on your transcript but a dropped class is better than an F. 

As for housing, you need to be enrolled in 12 units to be able to qualify as a full time student for housing. They typically do unit checks between week 5-week 7 so you should be good if you never received an email. For me, the Resident Director just sent me an email along with resources and said her and my RA‚Äôs were available to talk to. My RA said that I just needed to have more than 12 units next quarter and I would be fine. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal thankfully and they won‚Äôt just kick you out with no warning so don‚Äôt worry. They want you to succeed :)

Lastly, you will more than likely face the same issue I did down the line where I had completed unit deficits and you will have to meet with an academic advisor to remove holds. I believe these checks only consider how many units you‚Äôve taken at UCLA and not how many credits transferred. 

They do these checks after Fall and Spring quarters. The first three are just warnings where your counselor will offer advise and remove them with no problem. 

The fourth is completing a degree contract where you meet with an academic counselor and department counselor to map out your remaining schedule to ensure you graduate on time. After the 4th you‚Äôre exempt from future holds which is nice.

In my case, I dropped quite a bit of classes and was never able to make up my units in time and got to that fourth warning. But in all honesty it wasn‚Äôt that bad because the degree plan actually keeps me focused and I know that by following it i‚Äôll graduate on time. The only downside is I had to take a few quarters taking four classes. But depending on if you had units transfer, or if you‚Äôre double majoring/minoring, you may not face the same situation. In my case I am double majoring so I had more requirements to fulfill to graduate and had to take 4 classes some quarters.

"Another thing that doesn't get nearly enough consideration is quarter vs semester system. Quarter system is fasted paced and offers more flexibility overall in your college career but at the expense of a buffer time safety net in your classes. You really can't fall behind in your classes. 

Also the 10 week (+finals) quarters means that any class with 2 midterms is very likely to have the same 4th and 8th exam schedules. It's pretty common with math and science classes, so especially for those majors it's very possible to suddenly get overwhelmed when all those tests pile on you at the same time and it's not always possible to manage your class enrollment avoid that situation.",1637784674,3,0

"&gt;It‚Äôs not a cold for 48 hours‚Ä¶ especially not with a vaccine-resistant variant going around

if you're vaccinated it is. From Feb-Jul of this year, [1,500 fully vaccinated individuals died with covid](https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-08-09-21/h_9c6a79bada1c3b54c7d873635394a789). In any given year, anywhere from [12,000 - 50,000 die with the flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html). &amp; it's only ""vaccine-resistant"" insofar as transmission. It's unconscionably mild for people without the vaccine, let alone for those with it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And getting long term effects from COVID-19 is not ‚Äúan extremely minor risk.‚Äù We don‚Äôt even know a lot of the effects that could happen or how bad they can turn out to be.

if you were bright enough to properly read my response, you'd find that I'm saying there's no sustainable way to prevent this. If vaccines don't prevent long covid, then it's a risk we have to live with. One among many. Covid is never going away, and neither is ""long covid"".

"Per UCLA guidance, you'd have to test 3 times: 1) 72 hrs before returning to Westwood; 2) By Jan 9th (using the vending machine tests); and 3) 3 to 5 days after test 2 but no later than Jan 13 (using the vending machine tests). 

Test 1 is not actually verified, but you will need to take Test 2 and Test 3.",1640908828,1,0
"UCLA sent out an [email](https://covid-19.ucla.edu/exceptions-to-remote-instruction-for-first-two-weeks-of-winter-quarter/) to faculty that labs and studio classes can be held in-person if:

1. The course is designated in the catalog as ‚ÄúLab‚Äù or ‚ÄúStudio‚Äù or has a clinical designation.
2. Students unable to come to class in person (due to illness, need to quarantine, travel restrictions or other valid reasons) will be able to participate remotely without penalty, following the guidance in effect during fall quarter.

So it's not 100% guaranteed that all labs will be online during these first 2 weeks (but my guess is that most will be).",1640908638,1,0

"Dude, take a breather and read. We simply want to make society healthier and safer. Vaccines are safe, and they protect you very well against severe sickness. You can get one for free. Nobody is forcing you to get one, but it‚Äôs really inconsiderate to both your own body and those around you who are at risk. 

Numerous social media sites and ‚Äújournalistic organizations‚Äù like Fox News have been pushing anti-vax viewpoints that aren‚Äôt based in reality; they‚Äôre based on a fake emotional narrative that society is trying to brainwash sheep into doing what they say.

anyways i wont speculate anymore but i just feel like people are guiding these comments toward hate instead of looking at how this could have been prevented given that your family knew your brother was not vaccinated.

just like your brother has the right to choose whether to vax, your family has a choice to keep him out of their home to avoid bringing any viruses in.",1640907678,1,0

"since so mamy ppl commented, heres my take on this:

someone could be in med school and elect not to take the flu shot. except we dont judge those people.

for the overwhelming majority, the symptoms of covid-19 are pretty mild. not getting vaccinated is not nearly as consequential as media has sensationalized it out to be, a vast amount of people get covid and dont even know. plus his brother is in med school so no at-risk patients are involved. 

why shouldnt it be a matter of personal choice given that the symptoms are not life-threatening for healthy populations and most age groups? very similar to influenza in that way, which can also be a risk for older, less healthy, or at-risk groups. 

all other arguments and decisions that he made was more a private family matter than one we can judge publicly as they were aware he was unvaxxed.

not an anti vaxxer just tryna be fair, logical, unbiased here. perhaps if yall do the same then youll come to the same conclusions.",1640906599,1,0
