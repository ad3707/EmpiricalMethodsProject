"Cornell, grad life and other stuff","This is just a rant. Things I wanted to shout out from the top of the Clock Tower, but obviously never did. Here goes.

If you've been to PSB or Clark Hall, by the physics office, you'll see quite a few posters saying ""physics department cares"", ""how are you? No, really, how are you?"", ""Physics is inclusive"" and what not. Everyday I see those and I think to myself, ""how hypocritical can they get?"". 

I didn't come here expecting a romantic grad life, working on world-changing stuff and all. But I did want to survive. And from my first day of interactions with the professors, I've been constantly discouraged. My already low self-esteem didn't help either. Surely, professors only have the students' best interests at heart. I was so naïve I actually trusted them. I guess I wasn't used to this level of elitism because all through my school and my undergrad, I was constantly encouraged and I was really lucky to have good professors who actually cared. 

I listened. Mostly because I was hoping to work with them. ""We will deem you worthy of being considered if you prove yourself exceptional in your battles"", they said. ""I'll prove myself, elders"", I said. I did not. I won't say I'm the tail of the class, that's just hanging on, but I'm not the head either. More of the underbelly. And it definitely isn't because I'm not working hard. Despite all the corny pep talk that people will give you, I've realised that you can't always achieve what you want by working hard enough. 

Now, the ingredients are just right for my mental decline. A lot of stressed out students seek asylum at Cornell health and I did, too. I had to because I was already on medication. Need to get my pills somewhere. They're a whole different clump of unprofessionalism. Appointments are insanely hard to get, nothing ever happens on my time, and I've even had to miss a few doses because they couldn't get my medication ready on time. 

That was last year. Come summer, there's a hiatus. The sun, the birds, the breeze, the waterfalls. And poof, it's gone. Another bout of the grind starts. And I can see myself going down the same road again.

 I'm not sure where to go from here. 

I didn't want to put down people who actually do care, maybe I'm just unlucky in that I keep meeting those who only turn away. The professors that I've met don't have the slightest inkling about how to help someone, I don't expect them to actively do anything, just listen. 

I don't wish to be a drag but I was told by my psychologist that talking about it more freely would help and I don't have any other platforms. So, thou art my heathen.

If you've read till here, thank you for that. If you haven't that's okay.

To Arch. Majors: A few questions from an applicant,"(I hope I'm posting this in the right sub, I'm sorry if it's not) Hello everybody, I'm a senior that is most likely applying to Cornell ED. Some background: My school offers a lot of math and science classes, and so I've taken some accelerated math courses (from pre calc up to Calc AB), and I really got into physics (AP 2, C Mechanics &amp; EM), but I'm also part of the design major at my school. So I'm really passionate about art and design, and I wanna see if I can expand that passion into Architecture here. Anyway:

1. What's it like paying for a five-year course? Is it significantly more challenging than a traditional four years? 
2. Any small things that makes you think arch stands out at Cornell? I've heard so pretty good things, but I'd like to hear some firsthand experiences 
3. Do you love what you do as an arch major? 

Thanks, and sorry if these questions are annoying. I know there's an admissions thread, but I have no idea how to get there or if this should be there. To be honest, I'm teetering between EP and AAP. I feel like AAP would be a fit for me as someone who's also into design, and I'd have a way to stand out between the applicants as opposed to going to EP. But an architecture education also seems quite an expensive investment, and if that's the case I wanna know if it's doable or if I'd have a good return. Thanks you guys.",1569297053,1,0

New Club Idea! Let Them Eat Cake,"After reading, hearing about, and going through the experience myself, I came up with a club idea that goes against the notion of exclusive clubs at Cornell. 

This club would be called ""Let Them Eat Cake"", modeled after the idea that if we students can't ""get that bread"", we should at least be allowed to eat cake. 

So, of course, this club would have no application process, and everyone is welcome to join. During our weekly or biweekly meetings, students would all get together to enjoy a slice of cake or another type of snack and commiserate with each other over our problems at Cornell.

I've seen that a lot of people suffer from Imposter Syndrome at Cornell. Despite the fact that we're at one of the top institutions in America, excessive competitiveness and this inherent need to show off or act confident lead to a toxic or depressing environment where none of us (or a small amount of us) can feel truly confident.

Let me know what you think of the idea! I'm not sure if an organization like this could be approved, but I was wondering how all of you guys felt about it.",1569257195,115,0

"Rejected from Cornell AppDev or DTI? Consider applying to Holomont Technologies, Inc. Applications close October 15th!","Apply to join Holomont Technologies, Inc. this Fall! **Applications opened on September 15th, 2019 and will close on October 15th, 2019.**

Holomont Technologies, Inc. is a Cornell-affiliated, early-stage technology startup incorporated in May 2017 which focuses on **consumer-oriented mobile app development and IoT communication hardware**. We are **a productivity and efficiency company**. We obsess over saving our customers time and effort. Currently, we aim to **revolutionize points of transaction** by eliminating the 'wait line' and facilitating information exchange at an unprecedented speed and scale. We're starting by tackling professional events (i.e. career fairs, trade shows, networking events) and common appointments (i.e. doctor visits, job interviews).

Beyond the formal, standard 'blurb' about our company that we share with investors, we aim to be Cornell's **first 'company'-'project team' hybrid**. As many of you may have noticed, our marketing headline is ""Rejected from a project team?"" (or some variant) and makes very little mention of our actual line of products. This is for good reason. **We aim to provide as many driven and committed Cornell students as possible with the opportunity to be part of an impactful organization and own equity in their work output.** We've taken the best elements of a project team and merged them with the core elements of a company. To that end, when you join Holomont Technologies, Inc., you will have **a unique level of independence and influence** on the direction of our company. Unlike at traditional project teams, you are not working for free, to further someone else's vision, or towards a meaningless competition with us. Our aim is to empower you with the platform and tools to envision, develop, and market app-oriented ideas that have a major impact on the Cornell community and (hopefully) the world, while keeping an eye on our productivity and efficiency focus and another eye on profitability.

We are looking to hire for many roles from marketing to engineering to everything in between. We have a couple of senior-level executive positions and many entry-level positions. We want you! If you are interested in working for this unique type of early-stage technology startup, consider applying for a position at [**apply.holomont.com**](http://apply.holomont.com/).

Stupid question about career fair,"So I have sweaty hands regardless of whether I'm  feeling nervous or the temperature of the room. It's pretty much a nonstop thing.

Not to mention the fact that I dont want them to feel grossed out by a sudden wet touch. But on the other hand, telling them I dont want to shake because I have sweaty hands after they've already extended the arm forward seems pretty rude and awkward as well.

To the girl in my classes,"I really like you. I know you dont feel the same from how you act towards me compared to others, but I just needed to get this off of my chest since Im really hurting rn. 

With everyone else at Cornell, I feel like I constantly have to be putting up a facacde of normalcy, but with you I can really be myself. Youre the first person Ive ever met as an introvert that I dont get exhausted being around. When Im doing stuff with you all of my problems melt away and I feel something inside of me that I havent felt in a really really long time. Even if Im having the worst day, just being around you is enough to lighten my mood so much. Likewise, when youre feeling like shit its really hard for me to resist hugging you and telling you everythings going to be okay. We have so much in common its crazy and I wish that we could spend more time together outside of class.

Recently its become clear to me through certain events that we're classmates first and (barely) friends second, and I get it. I dont view myself too highly, so the idea of someone liking me as much as I like them is completely foreign to me. I just needed to write this as a form of closure where I could lay this all out at once and put it to rest.

HK Protest - Thoughts,"I am a Cantonese Chinese, I spent most my time in both Hong Kong and Shanghai when I was back in China. Recently, there are lots of posts about the protests happened in Hong Kong, and people also talk about this on campus or here. I actually have complicated feelings. On one hand, I stand firmly for people's freedom, including their rights to elect their leaders. On the other hand, I see people have different views against the protesters get attacked and insulted. I believe you guys have seen a lot videos recording the policemen beating the protester. I am going to share with you guys what happening in Hong Kong now is the protesters are scaring and attacking people who have different opinions: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-GR88q8pIw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-GR88q8pIw) This one is the protesters destroying shops and banks:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etahicd5htQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etahicd5htQ). I am not trying to justify which side, but I want people to think about this critically. When you become the people who are targeted by a large crazy group, will you feel comfortable seeing these posters around the campus? I am not supporting people tearing the posters off, but I want you guys understand the reasons behind that. 

Last but not least, I sincerely hope people in Hong Kong will eventually get their freedom, but in a more peaceful way.",1570381420,0,0

Help please: ADHD at Cornell,"My doctor at Cornell health recently told me that he's about 95% positive I have ADHD. I've known for years that I struggle with anxiety and occasionally depression, but I never thought I had ADHD until now. We are still in the process of testing me and figuring out what medication and accommodations are best, but that will take 1-2 months, so until then, does anyone have any tips for succeeding at Cornell when you have this disability? I, as with just about everyone here, did really well in high school, and cruised by without studying because I went to a very easy, low-income public school, and while my teachers picked up on some issues that I had, they still gave me As and turned the other cheek because they had students with far far greater problems to worry about. Now, I've been doing very poorly since I've been here. I'm a sophomore, I have an unemployable, low GPA, and I am basically incapable of: getting all my work done on time, getting to class on time, remembering to do things, bringing materials to class, etc, and I piss my teachers off basically every day, and of course lose participation credit, shit like that, all the time. Last year, in chem 2070, i would routinely get 60% on what were actually pretty decent lab reports that would have otherwise gotten 80-90% because i'd hand them in 2-3 days late every week because I couldn't stop fucking up and managing my time poorly. It takes me 4 hours to do something we are expected to do in 1 because I get so distracted and exhausted. I get yelled at in lecture for going on my phone or a TA tells me to stop going on Reddit, when I didn't even realize I was doing that. All of this piles up, and halfway through the week, I lose all motivation to focus, or do anything really, and sometimes even stop attending class, (yes I know that's bad). Sorry, this is super long, but does anyone have any advice? Please do not respond if you don't know anything about ADHD/related problems or do not believe it is a real thing.",1570237516,13,0

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I heard him chuckle as I turned away and continued with my notes on the stable matching algorithm. When Tardos was about to finish explaining the algorithm, he raised his hand and asked “what if I bought all of the women with BRBs instead?”

Tardos was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, but you’d ruin the algorithm.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually whipped out his student ID card, saying he was ready to purchase some girlfriends.

He turned to me and said “want to be a part of my stable matching?” I told him that I couldn't date someone who has shit in their hair. He said said that he washed it out in the shower. Then I told him that the rest of his body also smells like shit. He said it's because his suitemate poops in the shower.

Thoughts on Chinese government,"With all the riots currently going on in HK, I thought I’d chime in with my two cents as well. Any objective onlooker would probably say that China has fared quite well in the past few decades. This assessment seems sensible. Back in the 80s the USA’s economy was more than twenty times the size of China’s, but today China has never been closer to overtaking the US as the world’s largest economy. Not all is well for China tho. I personally think that it is not a matter of ‘if,’ but ‘when,’ that the communist government will collapse, and with all the increasing power that the government wields thanks to artificial intelligence, we should expect a cataclysmic upheaval when that collapse eventually occurs. 

There’s one crucial difference between capitalism and communism: in real life, the former works and the latter doesn’t. My main goal here, however, is not to explicate the impossibility of central planning to achieve the efficiency results of capitalism in the long run. Rather, I’m trying to show what would structurally emerge from a system of long-term central planning, and hopefully convince you of the inevitable collapse of communist regimes. 

Contrary to Western popular belief, the communist party is not a band of villains trying to take control of the coercive apparatus of the state and utilize it to their own benefit at the expense of oppressing the citizens. The vast majority of communists are genuinely nice people looking for a centrally planned socioeconomic order based upon common ownership to establish a more egalitarian state. But the task is complex: any systematic central planning necessitates an immense amount of unbridled power. In fact, its very success depends on the extent to which the leaders achieve such power. So the desire to maximize power is not a cause, but a consequence of the desire to centralize decision making. 

Unfortunately, this perpetual need for absolute authority turns out to be highly dangerous, not least because it directly paves the way for totalitarianism. A totalitarian rule is and has always been a long-term logical consequence of an unscrupulous and unrestrained system of central planning. 

Note, however, that totalitarianism isn’t a synonym for failure (think the New Deal period -- not exactly a totalitarian rule, but you get the idea). That being said, totalitarianism is certainly a recipe for disaster in the long run. Everything seems fine when the economy is booming. But when something goes awry (say an economic mismanagement resulting in a national famine), everything goes south. We basically wind up with a vicious cycle, where a government crackdown on a disgruntled public leads to more public disapproval which in turn leads to more government crackdowns. And the fact that China has been making massive leaps in artificial intelligence is even more cause for alarm. One could only wish they would not be there to witness the bloodbath.  

If capitalism is the “extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work for the benefit of all,” then communism is the equally extraordinary tragedy where men with the best of intentions will somehow lead us all to a hellish political, social, and economic existence. Hayek had it spot-on when he said, “Is there a greater tragedy imaginable than that, in our endeavour consciously to shape our future in accordance with high ideals, we should in fact unwittingly produce the very opposite of what we have been striving for?” A great tragedy indeed.",1571169268,0,0

Hidden Information About Antonio Tsialas' Death,"# The purpose of this post is not to needlessly bring back the pain caused by the tragic death of Antonio Tsialas--the purpose of this post is to try to ensure that what happened to Antonio will never happen again.

If you look up the incident on google, this is the first article: ([https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/](https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/))

&gt;The night before he vanished, the college freshman had dinner with his mother, then went to a frat event, the Miami Herald reported.  
&gt;  
&gt;*He was last seen leaving the Phi Kappa Psi house* around 9:30 p.m. but had not been heard from after the gathering, police said.

Most articles give the same information, but I contend that this information is incorrect, but I do not have absolutely concrete evidence.

I heard from someone that Phi Kappa Psi was holding a dirty rush event not at their house, but at the nearby City of Ithaca Cemetery. I don't have the means to investigate this claim any further, but perhaps someone who hears about this post might. 

If it were true that the event had been held at the cemetery and not the house, Phi Kappa Psi would not want to reveal this information, because they would have to face the repercussions of holding a dirty rush event, and especially of holding one in such a place.

This change of locations might seem like a minor change of details, but this change in details could have meant the difference between life and death, but I am not able to make any certain claim.

I do not know what was happening at the event, and I do not know whether Antonio left from the cemetery or from the house to return back to North Campus, but I believe that by revealing this information, we might discover something about the dangers of holding dirty rush events at cemeteries, or dirty rush events outdoors, or dirty rush events at all, and maybe frats will learn from this and no longer hold these sort of events, or maybe Cornell will crack down on these events much harder.

Comment below if you have any details contributing to my account, or if you disagree with anything I have said. Talk to your friends about this, and try to get Phi Kappa Psi to reveal the true nature of the event they were holding that night. Even if it means punishment for them, that should be a small price to pay to lower the risk of such a tragedy happening to another student.

Thank you for reading through this.",1572312811,21,0
question for econ majors,"just looking through courses to take for next semester

The 3000 level course is called Behavioral Economics and Public Policy while the 4000 level course is just called Behavioral Economics (but I suspect will also include public policy in its material) Is it okay to take both or is that redundant. And if it is okay to take both, should I take the 3000 one first and then the 4000 one?",1572312043,6,0
Unexplored Details Regarding the Death of Antonio Tsialas,"\##My purpose for writing post is to try to prevent what happened to Antonio from happening to anyone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will reference this article for the purposes of this post, seeing as it's the first article that comes up on google search.

[https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/](https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/)

The article states the following, which is the same information as most other articles on the matter: 

\&gt; The night before he vanished, the college freshman had dinner with his mother, then went to a frat event, [the Miami Herald reported](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/coconut-grove/article236702618.html).

\&gt; He was last seen leaving the Phi Kappa Psi house around 9:30 p.m. but had not been heard from after the gathering, police said.

\&gt; Campus police reported that they found his body Saturday afternoon at the base of Fall Creek gorge.

&amp;#x200B;

Notice the second sentence I quoted, which states he was last seen leaving the Phi Kappa Psi house. 

\#The missing detail is that the frat event was a dirty rush event being held at the nearby City of Ithaca Cemetery, not the Phi Kappa Psi House. He was most likely not last seen as the Phi Kappa Psi house, but rather at the cemetery at the frat event.

[Note that the cemetery is right by Phi Kappa Psi](https://preview.redd.it/nxqfjvd5pdv31.png?width=1522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74850aad7642c61790e251314bd5aeedf4080303)

I do not have hard evidence to convince anyone of this, but I learned that these were the true circumstances of that frat event by word of mouth. I am not absolutely sure that my claims are correct, but since I believe there is a possibility they are correct, it is worthwhile to explore them, since perhaps we will uncover the truth about the incident, and learn how to prevent this from happening. If this incident did partly stem from a frat holding a dirty rush event at the cemetery, then I hope we learn from this and work to eliminate those events to any degree.  

I hope you talk about this post to me, to your friends, to anyone else. I hope we create conversation about this and work to get to the bottom of this tragedy. I hope the frat faces chooses to be punished for what might have been a terrible choice of event, so that all frats and the university can learn to never host events like that again. I hope there is a change made so that this does not happen again. 

If anyone has any supporting details or questions, please comment below. Thank you.",1572311591,1,0

&amp;#x200B;

We are **interested in working with student leaders**    who want to change the way we do things, who want to help their    homeless communities in a way that prevents health crises. For those    student leaders who are interested, all we ask is for your time,    leadership, compassion, and we will take care of the rest. Our members    are represented at multiple universities and medical schools across the    country and would also be willing to provide mentor-ship throughout  the   process. The experience you will gain through the opportunity and  the  friends within the homeless community that you will make will be    unforgettable.

Our work has helped  so many, and for this reason, it has been recognized   by Congress,  President Clinton, educational institutions, medical   Schools, and  non-profit institutions as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Our most significant contributions include leading an effort to rescue  the   homeless in multiple cities from the incoming Hurricane Irma,   partnering  with Shark Tank’s Bombas Socks as well as being published by  Forbes  Magazine.

Mentally Checked Out,"I'm not sure if anyone else feels this way, but I feel burnt out and I've just mentally checked out of school. I see a counselor but that only does so much. I've fallen out of love with my major (CS) and it's a constant battle between wanting to enjoy it and just hating it. I feel like I don't belong and it's just really lonely doing this major. I do cs-related activities but those aren't really places to find study groups or make friends with other cs people (a lot of the interactions feel so artificial and out of pity that I didn't come with anyone to the event). 

I've also just checked out of my schoolwork in general. I'm doing great in most classes but there's one CS class that I'm almost certain I'm failing. And granted, it's my fault that I didn't go to enough OH and basically getting below the mean on almost everything, but it gets hard to even get out of bed when you hate everything about your life. I've just started to take meds to let me go to sleep because I'd rather let the year pass than deal with this any more; I do the basic minimum and try to save my awful CS grade but that's it. I'm genuinely not good at CS, it was a tough road to maintain above a 3.0 gpa, but I'm a senior and it's too late to switch.

The only reason I haven't offed myself is that I don't want to leave my mom with my debt and who am I to fuck up her holidays?

And I know a lot of ppl go on here to rant but it's genuinely like lipservice is paid to mental health and cultivating a healthy community.",1574619532,1,0

Enough is enough,"I’ve had it with these fucking bitch-ass vending machines in libraries around campus that promise me a sweet lemon ice tea but have the AUDACITY to say they’re “cASh OnLy” or have a “NeTWOrk eRRoR”.

This fucking FAILURE of SIMPLE currency-based automations was once again out of order. 

No wonder we’re the joke Ivy League when our fucking VENDING MACHINES see less working action than a eunuch’s balls. I hear people worrying about robots taking over the world. Sure, that could be true at some place I didn’t get into like Harvard or Stanford; but you can bet your “big red”-prelim tanking-desperate for a Goldman offer-shithaca hating-frozen ASS that the terminator ain’t gonna be made at this shitty campus where simple machines can’t even handle the BASIC FUNCTIONS of letting me buy a fucking drink.

I'm giving up,"I'm giving up on Cornell. I hate it here. I am tired, burned out and have crippling depression. I didn't get out of bed for two weeks and everyone expected me to act like I was fine and do psets and prelims. It's so much harder to make friends here and people seem miserable and depressed. I was genuinely looking forward to becoming a software developer but Cornell has made me hate the idea of school. I'm a junior and every semester my grades have been in the shitter. I don't party, I don't go to club meetings anymore, I don't do sports, I don't have a job, I don't volunteer, I don't have anything to show for any semester I have been here except numerous all nighters spent in PSB followed by bombing prelims and massive student debt. 

Everyone is so self obsessed and the competition is toxic. People seem to do things for the sake of being seen doing them and because they are expected to do them. Today I watched my friend share about his internship offer and no one bothered to congratulate him. All that followed was a pathetic attempt to one up each other. Professors don't seem to care about a student's well being. They almost seem to be getting satisfaction from their classes/prelims breaking students. Why is depression so normalized here? I've heard students openly say they are very depressed and no one seems to bat an eye. It takes weeks to get an apt. with a mental health professional at Cornell health. 

There seems to be an overarching standard of measure for every action I take. I am tired of hearing bs from students threatening to drop a class for being one SD below a prelim mean, or breaking down because they didn't get a call back from goldman sachs after their HireVue. There seems to be no life in this place. Everything is just a prestige and numbers game. 

To top it all off, the mentality of ""if you don't like it, then leave"" seems to be everywhere. Emailed my prof about a bad grade on an assignment and he suggested dropping the class, talked to another professor about $450 books I can't afford and he suggested dropping the class, talked to a mental health professional about having mental breakdowns and he suggested skipping town, mentioned discomfort over offensive anti LGBTQ comments about my friend at a club and they suggested I walk away from the conversation. Is leaving the only option? 

I am tired of being tired, burned out and depressed. Every day of being here makes me feel like I don't have a life outside of Cornell to look forward to. I go back home and I have to be all smiles and have all these lunches with high schoolers and parents of kids who would give a kidney to go here. I have gotten to the point where I don't bother to sugar coat it. Cornell is a miserable place, the ivy league degree is very valuable but it comes at the cost of a person's mental health and identity outside of beinga cornellian. I talk to a lot of people daily and it's disgusting how the one thing I have continuously heard from freshmen and seniors alike is how they hate it here and can't wait to get out. It's alarming to hear a freshman who has only been here 3 months say they can't wait to leave. 

I can't do this anymore.",1574473950,1,0

I... I don’t know what happened in MATH 2930 lecture today...,"We had just spent 40 minutes solving a simple linear system of two equations when Professor Strogatz... he just, he said “Now I’m going to show you all something just for pleasure.” My innocent mind thought “oh boy! Another Laplace transform!” Man, was i wrong...

He proceeds to tell us how we will have “M^eat” on the te^-st. And how “we have the meats”. 

At this point, I’m confused. Where is he going with this? Is it a metaphor for the limitations of what “exponentials can kill?” 

He goes on to tell us about how his wife gave him a plaque labeled “Stephen Strogatz: Over Explainer”. He was so proud. As he shed a tear, he unzipped his pants and sat the biggest penis I have ever seen right on the table at the front of the lecture hall. 

“I told you it was bigger than Trump’s.”

The room fell into silence. When he showed us the graphs of near-resonance frequencies of forced vibrations, no one ACTUALLY believed his dong was that big. Then everyone erupted in applause. I had never seen anything like it. 

Now, I’m reeling. I don’t know what to think of it all. My brain is in shock. I can’t process anything. I think I need to break up with my boyfriend because nothing will ever match what I saw on that lecture hall table today. In my mind all day, all I hear is Stephen Strogatz saying his own name over and over: “Stephen Strogatz, Stephen Strogatz, Stephen Strogatz....”",1574451007,1,0

Does Cornell rescind acceptances often?,"Hi guys, 

As you can tell, I'm a senior in high school. From freshman through junior year, my grades were all A's with a total of 3 B's on my transcript. I worked pretty hard and I tried my best. My academics were my focus and I tried to take as many rigorous courses as I could. However, this year, my grades are slipping. It is NOT due to senioritis. I have gotten two major leadership roles this year (president of a club and major leadership role in JROTC), and I am taking 6 AP classes at the moment. I have never taken this many all in one year before. But because of that, I have 2 B's and a C right now. My B's are in AP Chem and AP calc, and my C is in AP Physics mechanics. I'm applying as a life science major and it is not physics-heavy at all so I know my strong suit does not need to be in physics. I applied to Cornell ED and I am worried that on the chance that I get in, all my hard work will have been for naught because of  my senior year transcript and they'll rescind my acceptance. 

Were any of you in my situation as a HS senior? Will this happen? Any help or info would be appreciated. My anxiety is just through the roof right now and I don't think my grades will change drastically. Also I'm sorry if these types of posts aren't allowed, I can delete them if need be.",1574431849,1,0

I go to office hours every week I studied so hard for this test I read the text book do my problem sets, do all of the recitation  worksheets, and I’m in an AEW but apparently none of that did anything. I don’t feel like I’m smart enough to be here and I don’t know what to do. It’s really late to drop the class but based on my trend I’d get an actual zero on the final so I don’t know what to do.

Need help making Cake Club (Let Them Eat Cake) a reality,"Hey guys!

The more time I've spent talking to people at Cornell and browsing this sub, the more I think that Let Them Eat Cake needs to be a real club. 

(Here is the link for those who didn't see my previous post)
https://reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/d894s0/new_club_idea_let_them_eat_cake/

There are not enough resources for Cornell students to abate their loneliness or stress from everything that happens here. While I thought of the club as something that specifically goes against the notion of exclusivity, I now think that it could focus more on inclusivity and making sure that there's a place for everyone.

Of course, everyone would still be welcome to come and enjoy cake (please do), but my hope is that all of the people who have felt or expressed loneliness here at Cornell could find solace through this club.

On that note, I would love to make this club a real thing, but I don't feel like I can do everything on my own. There's a fair amount of planning that would need to go into doing everything for this club. Would any of you guys be interested in helping me out?

Feel free to comment or message me if you might want to help out. I think that meeting as a group and figuring everything out would probably be the best way to take tangible steps towards making the club.",1573572379,1,0

First he did a double take at the bus stop. Another time I was at the pasta station in the dining hall and while I was scooping, I just happened to look up and he was staring right at me. One time when I caught him staring, I smiled at him- and he got this dear in the headlights look. At that point I was like either he likes me or I look like a dead relative, I couldn’t think of any other possible explanations.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So after a while I was like you know what, I’m tired of the speculation. Cuffing season is here and I thought he was kind of cute. So last week I said f it when I saw him the dining hall, wrote my name, number, and “text me” (per my friends’ advice) on a piece of paper and gave it to him in passing.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It’s been 4 days since this happened, and I have yet to receive a text. At this point I’m just perplexed- if he wasn’t interested then why on EARTH was he staring at me like that?",1573446172,1,0

CORNELL SHA UNDERGRAD,"Cornell ED (hotel school)

Hi!! I am applying ED to the Cornell hospitality school, and have terrific essays, recommendations, interviews (I had two), tours, and shadowed two classes at the school.

Lower stats are found at the hospitality school. I am currently applying with a 1350 SAT (with no subject tests), but hours upon hours upon working and volunteering experience. I also have a 3.6 GPA. My grades are A’s and B’s, and I am currently taking 3 AP classes: APES, AP Chemistry, and AP Calculus BC. I am on the Dean’s List for my high school, and was given an honor roll.

In addition, I have a recommendation from my company’s I work with, a CEO, a social media manager (for the hotel companies), and from a Cornell alumni.

My uncle went to the school, and my two cousins went here as well; with one of them attending the hospitality school.

For Sophomores and Freshman enrolling in Physics classes this week,"Enrollment information has been shared by some of your programs and colleges. There is also enrollment information on most of the classes on the roster. Further information is provided below.

PHYS 2208: Priority is given to students who cannot satisfy their Physics requirement with PHYS 1102. If you cannot self-enroll in PHYS 2208 via Student Center, you should add yourself to the Physics [waitlist](https://www.physics.cornell.edu). If you only list one option for section and lab, you may be passed over for students who have been more flexible and listed more section options. Do not enroll in electives during lecture times.  If you need to add filler classes for financial aid purposes, do not add classes that meet during your requested section times. Your schedule will be reviewed to ensure spots you requested do not cause conflicts with classes in which you're already enrolled. Placements will be made in mid-December, directly through your college registrar. Due to the class having 38 separate components, it is not possible to give you your chances for enrollment to the class or a particular section. Most of the waitlist for 2207 was enrolled in their requested, or agreed upon, sections this semester.

PHYS 1112, 2213, 2214: There is no waitlist for this sequence and all seats in all sections have been released to Student Center. If you are flexible with your schedule you will be able to enroll.  If there are no open discussions or labs that fit your schedule, see the Physics Course Coordinator in 121 Clark Hall during your add/drop period. Sections will not be filled beyond capacity during the pre-enrollment period. 

PHYS 1116, 2217, &amp; 2218 are on the waitlist.

The swap feature works for Physics classes. If you are enrolled in a class and wish to change to a different open section, you can safely use the [swap](https://www.physics.cornell.edu/swap) feature without risk of dropping the class.",1573436838,1,0

2) I would want to join a frat, but as I know the big rush is in spring for freshman. Could I still join as a sophomore in the fall rush or even waiting for spring rush in sophomore year?

3) Since a year already passed would it be hard to switch my major or school from ILR to something else? I like ILR but I would like the option of switching majors to be available if I don't end up liking it that much. Do many people switch in sophomore year and how easy is it?",1575676291,1,0

Graduate Student Assaults Undergraduate Student: They don’t intend to share the campus with undergrads.,"
I am a graduate PhD student in the Hotel School and witnessed an assault by Ankur Mulji on an undergrad last night.

Ankur approached an undergraduate student and harassed the individual with threats on a sidewalk as the undergraduate student was waiting for the bus, and continuously stating that the individual ""does not belong at Cornell because he/she is an undergraduate student"". Ankur also continued his verbal assault, stating that ""undergraduates are scum and do not have any jobs when they graduate Cornell"" and other racial slurs directed towards the student's home country, and that he himself is part of the ""prestigious Baker Program, and will make sure the [undergraduate student] will have an awful time at Cornell"". Ankur then continued to attempt to physically intimidate the undergraduate student by standing right against the student's physical body, physically slapping the undergraduate student's chest, and stated that he will follow the student onto the bus when the student explicitly told Ankur ""to get away"". Ankur only stopped when the student stated that he/she will call the police if the behavior does not stop, and Ankur walked away saying that ""[the student] made a mistake, and he (Ankur) will be seeing the student real soon"". All of these assaults and threats were because the undergraduate student was merely waiting for a night time bus on the sidewalk, as Ankur pushed past the student, only to turn around to tell the student to ""move the fuck off the sidewalk"".

This conduct by a graduate student clearly indicates a distinct pattern from Ankur of hatred towards undergraduate students, which is completely unacceptable as Cornell now host nearly 15,000 undergraduate students during the school year. The physical and verbal threats for harm is completely unacceptable from graduate students, especially as they are often times a lot older and stronger than undergraduates that just entered college. I also believe Cornell shouldn't allow this type of behavior at all from graduate students or permit the acceptance and existence of these types of graduate students, whom do not intend to ""share"" the campus with undergraduates, as this erodes from the ""Cornell Community"" that we all sought to build here on campus. This feeling of graduate superiority, egotism, and hate should not exist on our campus, to the point of nearly a hate crime, as it specifically targets undergraduate students.",1575670025,1,0

Alternatives to exercise,"Dear Cornell community,

This semester has left me profoundly tired, mentally and physically. I sleep four hours a night and I really wish I had time to get back on my summer routine, which was so much more regimented and healthy because of my job.

In particular, I miss my running routine. I used to run five miles a day and at the end of the summer I had an ass you could bounce a quarter off. This semester, though, has left me with an ass so flat you could rollerblade on it

I miss my ass and wish it weren’t so profoundly flattened. I don’t have the time to exercise like that anymore so I was wondering if anyone could recommend me any good BUTT IMPLANT surgeons in the area. I’m looking for a really good dude with minimum ten years experience. Gannett won’t cut it—I’m looking for a truly top-of-the-line,  one-of-a-kind ass surgeon.

What’s going to happen to me?,"I’m a first semester freshman going through some major problems. In short, I haven’t attended a single class or done any work since the end of the first prelims. A combination of physical and mental health issues that were snowballing since senior year high school, combined with family issues and complete social isolation, brought me to the point where I was missing classes and struggling to stay emotionally stable enough to seek help from CAPS. One bad therapy session sort of tipped me into breaking and I haven’t been to classes, done work, or spoken in person to anyone since. I can’t believe so much time has passed so fast. Nobody ever noticed I was gone and I never received any emails or texts or even notifications on Canvas about grades or my absence, and although that’s something I should have expected with the freedom and vastness of college it only made me feel worse.

Somehow finals are only a week away, and it’s probably impossible to salvage any of my classes. I have not registered for spring classes yet either, and I wouldn’t know how I could possibly fare in them without knowing most of what was taught in the prerequisite classes I took this semester. From what I’ve found searching here, I can expect to be put on a leave of absence for a semester? I’m not sure, but I desperately do not want to go back home, and I’m afraid it’ll only make things worse to have to stay there when family was such a big part of the problem in the first place.

I felt so lethargic and depressed I literally did nothing most days, and it took a lot of effort to send the few early emails I did manage to send, which didn’t really go very far. I’m only just now even stabilizing my sleep schedule enough to be up at this time and I don’t know what to do at this point, if anything at all can be done. Who can I go to? What will happen to my financial aid status, or my status as a student? Should I even register for spring classes?",1575563289,1,0

"Oh, What a View.","You know, I haven't achieved anything significant in life. No particularly impressive sports records, no Olympiads, no out of the world scores in school or SAT. Then why would I try to be placed among immortals? Why did I spend all that money to get rejected? I don't know. I have some questions. I have a little something that drives me. It's those questions. I like the sciences. I like to study stuff. I like libraries. It's like this humongous collection of summaries of great people's life's works over hundreds, thousands of years. How wonderful does that sound. We won't get to know all of it. I was so sad when we had to choose our streams in grade 11 because I'll never know what studying microeconomics or geology is like, not in a classroom environment. We had this TV show on Nickelodeon where some dudes did some work in a workshop, and I have dreamt so many times of all the wonderful things I could do in there, of all the innovations that I could come up with, of how it's going to make life a little better for some people. I was going to choose the conventional Joint Entrance Examination path like every other High schooler in India and then I stumbled across Glorious to View, and my childhood self was like Holy shit these places actually exist! I scored terribly in class 11 because I was too enchanted by the wonderful world of CS courses on Coursera. I scored low on the SAT despite topping my maths class in school because they cut 90 marks for like 4 wrong questions in Math. I obviously don't like to think of it but deep down I know so well I'm not getting to go there. Missing out on not the academics but a community of higher thinkers, a group who's as imperfect and motivated and curious as I am. I've missed out on a lot of things in life, but this is a little different. The mods are gonna remove this for being antagonistic anyway. But to everyone who's in that place, busy being a God, and everyone who's on the other side of the fence, just trying to survive, I hope you do yourself proud, more than anyone else. The difference we seek for can come in a plethora of ways and methods. A Cornell education is just one of them. There's something in those gorges, something about that remote location, something humble about the air in that place. Something that invites you to dance. Something that beckons you to explore, something that tingles your curiosity to make you dig deeper and strive harder. I like that feeling. Ah, I'm romanticising this once again.

Winter is objectively the best month CMV,"Snow

Quiet

Everything is beautiful

This is my fourth winter in Ithaca, and the fourth winter of my life. I love it.

People get together to go outside and play. Not on their phones. Interacting with other people. You can’t keep your phone out for too long or your fingers will freeze! Cold weather forces people to interact with each other more which makes existing around Cornell and Ithaca that much better. People are willing to be social instead of just so hyper focused on work and grades.

People have fun, play games, and interact with nature and the world and people and architecture around them. The snow connects people. I don’t see this happening during the spring/summer/fall nearly as much.

I wish we had more of it.

Best part: it’s only just begun for this year. Get your sleds ready because we are in for some great times over the next few months!",1575347368,1,0

On the Quality of West Campus’ Chicken Wings,"Dear friends, fellow students, university faculty, and other lurkers,

I forgive whoever I may offend with this post, but my tastebuds can take the abuse no longer. 

Over the course of my life thus far, I have had over 20 years of experience tasting all sorts of chicken wings from all kinds of different restaurants, including but not limited to Buffalo Wild Wings, Wingstop, Wings over Ithaca, various pizza parlors, and Nasties. So you can say that my taste in chicken wings is perhaps one of the most refined there is. I therefore believe that I am qualified to testify on behalf of the university on the quality of West Campus’ chicken wings.

It appears to me that West Campus serves two types of chicken wings:

1. The good kind.
2. The bad kind.

It seems that the type of wings served on West alternates every day, completely irrespective of dining hall. I have had both types of wings in Cook, Bethe, Keeton, and Rose. 

Today’s wings, served in Bethe, were the bad kind. They were over-seasoned, excessively fatty and greasy, and devoid of all chicken-like taste. 

These type of wings are so over-seasoned that I can predict with 100% accuracy which type of wings (type one or two) are served in the dining hall on any given day just by walking in and sniffing the air. 

The wings served yesterday in Keeton, however, were the good kind. They were crispy, but not too crispy, and of quality taste. I place them on a pedestal above Wings Over Ithaca, but below Buffalo Wild Wings and Wingstop. They are of perfect quality for a university ranked 3rd in the US for campus food. 

The wings today, however, don’t even make the list and are so awful that Cornell should drop at least 10 ranks in the list of universities with the best dining hall food. 

I implore all of you to help me find a way to help rectify this wing situation so that we may all enjoy tasteful chicken wings on West on any given day. 

Thank you.",1575325888,1,0

The Decade in Review,"As the decade comes to a close and we draw 10 years closer to the impending climate apocalypse, the moderators of r/Cornell thought the timing was apt for a history lesson, because we know how much y'all love breadth requirements.   
  
The Cornell subreddit was, apparently, created roughly 10 years ago by u/drboda, who has been inactive for the last 10 years and has fewer posts on his account than I can count on one hand. It is truly remarkable that the spirit of this subreddit's founder has survived intact in its current users. Speaking of which, we have gone from just u/drboda and his alts to 16,674 readers at the time of writing, of which at this time approximately 22 AEP majors are active. We've also grown to a daily subscription rate in the mid double digits, and a monthly view rate of over 2 million for each of the last 2 months, of which, again, about 22 were unique. Through that time, we've seen moderators come and go, including u/laveritecestla (AEP '18) and u/TheD3xus (AEP MS '19), who recently graduated and who you may be familiar with. Some grad student and alumni lurkers may even be familiar with even older mods such as u/ConvexPreferences (unflaired), u/Enyo287 (graduation date unknown), u/TheIndigoSky (AEP '14) and u/SamuelGompers (EP '13), who had to be removed by force by reddit admins some time ago. He was actually so old AEP hadn't yet rebranded and was known as just EP. Some speculate this is due to Cornell's recent trend of grade inflation, before which there were no As given. Let that serve as a reminder: things could always be worse.     
  
If you're currently a Cornell student, you were probably between 7-14 years old at the start of the decade. Some of you probably spoke no English at that time or lived in a totally different country. Many of you probably didn't even know what Cornell was, or had never thought about going to college at all. We're 100% sure you were all fucking nerds tho.     
     
The world has changed a lot since 2010. Back then Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen was one of the most popular shows on television. People watched the Office on NBC, not Netflix. Snapchat didn't exist and Uber was a year old. The most popular song of 2010 was TiK ToK. Now it's an app, and owned by China.   
  
Cornell has changed a lot too. In 2010 our President was not Martha Pollack, a CS theorist, but James Skorton, a cardiologist. Imagine hiring someone to run a university who makes financial decisions like majoring in psychology. Martha has an h-index of 51. We didn't make that up, fucking chad she is. David motherfucking Gries has an h-index of 40. Who has more programming experience now, bitch?  
  
Some of the people reading this are probably ED admits or even RD applicants, so it seems appropriate to discuss how the university has changed in this regard, too. For the class of 2023, Cornell had an overall admission rate of 10.6%, and an ED rate of 22.6%. For the class of 2014, the statistics were 18.4% and 32.7%, respectively. By contrast, Harvard's admission stats were 7% for RD and no one knows the EA rate because they apparently didn't have it. Cornell's RD rate in 2018 was 8%, to put that in perspective. Idk about the rest of you, but this was actually more in line with current numbers than I expected. Notably, just 4 years earlier (Class of 2010) the admissions rate was actually 25%, with an ED rate of 40% for Cornell, and 9% and 20% for Harvard. I know this because I accidentally looked up these statistics instead of the relevant ones from a decade ago. Oops.    
    
Speaking of mistakes, let's go over some of the big ones. The 2010s looked so promising coming in, and yet we all ended up at Cornell. We are sincerely disappointed in all of you. More seriously, we made many mistakes this decade as a species, and learned from few of them. I'm going to get political for a moment. In 2010, we finally came together to give healthcare to the American people. 10 years later, we need GoFundMe to cover basic operations. In 2010, we elected the most conservative generation of politicians ever to the US government. Now, in 2019, we are poised to do the same again. Globally, Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring signaled a departure from the systemic oppression of earlier eras. Today, people in Hong Kong fight to defend their basic liberties from a dictator, and we deface even meager symbols of support for their people. But hey, at least we got some good memes out of it.           
   
Perhaps the greatest growth in the 2010s has been in the meme sector. One of the most popular memes of 2010 was a picture of Keanu Reeves. People still get massive karma with the same exact picture of Keanu Reeves. In 2010, people got their memes on reddit and cheezburger. Now, people still get their memes on reddit. Truly a transformative decade it has been.    
  
We want to give a shoutout to the r/Cornell community. Y'all are pretty dank. This community is by far the best Ivy shitposting subreddit, not that we really have any competition. But we are also helpful, welcoming, and insightful. Everyone in this subreddit contributes positively to the community, and we all really enjoy helping to keep this community spam-free for all of you.   
    
Here's to the continued perpetual growth of the AEP major, and another decade as the #1 Ivy shitposting sub. Whether you had a great decade or a shitty one, keep in mind: in just 100 more years, you'll finally be allowed to talk about 2110 finals on this sub again, and maybe Gries will even join you himself. Until then, shut the fuck up, and have a happy new year.

hometown dilemma (?) during breaks,"hi all! i have a question for anyone who might relate and can offer som advice!! :)

so first!! as some background information , im a freshman at cornell. i didn’t go to the best high school academically, and most of the people at my school either go to community colleges, local colleges, or the military (which isn’t bad or anything!! but it’s a detail that helps with my question!!). im an out of state student , too!

basically, ever since i got into cornell during senior year, a lot of my friends began treating me differently and kind of harshly (comments like “you only got into cornell since your black” or “you think you’re too good for us now”), so even going into cornell left a weird vibe for us before i left. and while there, it kinda sucked to see my friends back home hang out together all the time and even have classes together. buuut, each time i came home, id try to visit them and spend time with them, and they would stillllll only hang out together and/or it would just feel like a much different vibe, which kinda sucked and made me feel bad. this break has been the hardest since a lot of old high school drama was brought up by them and a lot of bitterness /resentment was shown from them.  i now pretty much have dropped a lot of my friends from high school and have been super bored with nothing to do in my hometown :(( it’s been sad because i guess things just feel so lonely and stagnant back home? like there’s never much going on and most people just stick to who they know from high school (since everyone basically stays here), hence leading them to still have high school like habits (a lot of gossip and rumors) :// like there are other friends from high school who i love too, but they mainly just party, smoke, drink, etc (which isn’t bad or anything!! i completely understand!!) when hanging with people and im not into that.  

i just really dislike the environment here. buuut i do love to see and spend time with my family during these breaks!! but i also feel like id be muchhh muchhh happier if i stay at cornell / maybe explore ny during breaks (plus itd probably save money tbh).

so my actual question!! do you guys feel this dilemma of your hometown not really feeling like home anymore? and for out of state students, how have you’ve been navigating being away from home (missing family, hometown friends, etc.)? also, for those who don’t go back to their hometowns or haven’t in the past, what do you do instead?

super sorry that was a lot!! and i hope this didn’t come off the wrong way at all!! things just have been making me kinda sad and stuff, so i just wanted to explore some options !! thank u guys!! 💞",1577700900,1,0

I know that sometimes students are not able to work for a number of reasons, but if it's in your control I would highly recommend getting a job somewhere that requires you to work with people (not like a desk job where interaction is usually discouraged). The dining services for example are always hiring. I've worked a ton of different jobs since high school and I have to say, the co-worker bond is super easy to develop. You're usually dealing with the same type of grueling work, the same terrible boss(es), the same terrible customers/patrons. 

My first two semesters here I was really lonely and had no ""go-to"" friends so to speak to eat with, study with, or hang out with. Then after I started working, one of my co-worker friends decided to grab dinner after a shift, and then she introduced me to her friends. It's all been uphill from there. Obviously this isn't a guaranteed experience, but if it's something that you've never considered, I just wanted to share in case it could help someone.",1577565684,1,0

The AEP plot thickens,"After taking some time last night to explore the AEP plot further, I decided it would be best to create a bot to do some digging into the concept of one AEP major controlling r/Cornell. After running through the last 300 posts on r/Cornell looking at every single comment, checking the flair of the user commenting I determined the following:

Number of unique CS vs AEP majors on r/Cornell:

CS: 44

AEP: 22

This number seemed suspicious to me, as I would argue that there is far more than a 2:1 ratio of CS to AEP majors at Cornell, but WHATEVER. Maybe it was just a coincidence. I decided to explore further. I then ran through those accounts to see what percent of each were created within the last year:

 Percent of the above accounts created in the last year:

CS: (6/44) = .1363636...

AEP: (16/22) = .72727272...

ODD. This seems like a statistically significant result to me. I took it one step further and logged the dates on which all of the AEP accounts were created, they are as follows:

Financial Aid,"  For early decision, I have been admitted to the College of Engineering class of 2024. I was celebrating this fact until the evening of Christmas Eve, when I received my financial aid offer. From what I can discern, my family is expected to pay the full price of $75,868 for one academic year. To be clear, I was expecting to receive minimal aid, but I have been all but blatantly rejected by the financial aid office. I understand that the university awards no merit-based financial aid, but I took my admission under early decision to mean that I was wanted on campus. I take offense to the fact that the university cannot offer me a dime. As far as colleges went, I was not ignorant to the fact that Cornell would be a costlier option, but I imagined a greater cost would be somewhat justified. There is no justification for a direct $300,000 expense over four years.

  I would not usually discuss the following details in a public forum, but, for background, they feel pertinent. I am an only child. My father, (who is looking to retire in the coming years) has an annual income of $90,000. My mother has an income of $10,000 - $30,000 from her investments. The problem lies within my mom’s assets, totaling approximately $1.3 million in said investments. I have never considered my family to be rich nor upper class. We live pretty conservatively, seeing as we could not recoup any major expenses through income. My mom worked hard to attain that level of financial security, and I take even greater offense to the fact that Cornell sees it as theirs for the taking, but I digress.

  Let me consider some hypotheticals for a moment. The cost above is strictly for undergrad. At this time, I am considering (or would at least like the option of) going to med school.  Forgive my rough estimate, but I would predict this to be an additional $300,000 (especially if it is at Cornell). For my mom to raise the combined total in cash, she would likely incur an expense closer to $1 million (accounting for hefty tax penalties and other costs associated with liquidating that quantity of assets). I cannot, in good conscience, ask my mom to spend the bulk of her savings on my education, nor would I be comfortable taking on that kind of debt myself.

  Perhaps I have been naïve in not paying enough attention to costs. I bring this to the subreddit in the hopes that someone can share a similar experience. Is this the expected (adjusted) cost of attending Cornell? Having just gotten this news, I have not been able to contact the office of financial aid due to the holiday. I fully intend on asking for my decision to be reviewed, but do I have any realistic recourse? Perhaps most importantly, is four years at Cornell worth $300,000? I had strong doubts that I would be admitted to the College of Engineering, but I never considered that I would be priced out of a school marketing itself as the most progressive ivy. I am questioning whether my admission was based on merit or merely my ability to pay. I hope to join you guys in the fall, but that may not be a possibility.

By the way, Merry Christmas everyone!",1577275692,1,0

This break, I realized why I love it so much and I honestly feel shitty for it.

I love it more because I'm away from my family. 

Small family, so we really 'rely' on each other. Guess in some way it can be taken as overbearing parents. Not academically, but just really really tight. mostly in a good way, but stressful nonetheless. 

I've never had this much freedom. My parents always gave me alot, but I've never taken advantage of it. being here with them basically stuck in this house is honestly frustrating. I already got into an argument with them earlier tonight. the worst part is that they are honestly wonderful and I know many would love to be part of a family like this.

I just miss the routine I developed there. Sure i have friends home too but honestly after making these cornell friends i dont really want to go back to some of my toxic 'friends'

I feel like an asshole wanting to get away from this family. I am blessed in so many ways and I feel ungrateful. My parents have been nothing but supportive all through my life but I just cant stand the independence I had there.

I was recently accepted ED for CoE and am probably going to end my first semester with a B in Calc BC and a C in AT Physics (our school rolls both AP Physics C courses into this one class).

I am mainly worried because both of these courses are related to engineering.

Dear Ithaca Campus Community,

Y’all know what happened last week on frat life drama. 

As I noted in my [November 19 community message](http://t01.list.cornell.edu/t/2925802/62429839/1204042/1044/), the unregistered fraternity party, during which freshmen were served alcohol and participated in drinking games, and all members got shitfaced and violated a number of Cornell’s Greek life policies. I find it particularly fucked up that Phi Kappa Psi had just attended a judicial hearing the day before for additional fuckery. The chapter has been placed on interim suspension pending a full review by the Greek judicial system because they never should’ve fucked with me. 

Regrettably, this is not an isolated incident as Greek life is just a bunch of assholes. We have on this campus, as do many of our peers on their campuses, a persistent culture of fuckery in the Greek-letter system; a pattern that dates back years, if not decades, and one that I have witnessed during my two-and-a-half years as Cornell’s president. Indeed, people tried to fuck with me over hazing back in the winter of 2018 and I announced a set of new Greek policies in May of that year. At that time, naysayers told me that the new policies would not shut this shit down. Unfortunately, those naysayers were fuckin right. In the 19 months since those new policies went into effect, fully six Greek organizations have engaged in behavior so problematic as to merit suspension of their recognition by the university. This number does not include the current interim suspension of the bitches at Phi Kappa Psi.

The full copy is attached for this reform, but I know once y’all see bullet points you stop reading so I won’t go any further. In conclusion, I’m trying and y’all are making this shit super fucking hard. Get your shit together. 

In the words of Lil Wayne, “If you ain’t gonna ride, fly, than you might as well hate.”

Sincerely,

Martha E. Pollack

Degrees of separation,"This has been on my mind lately

A couple days ago i was eating lunch with my friend, and his other friend sat down next to us. We'd never met before so i asked the usual like what's your name, major, where do u live, whatever. She was like ""i live on [dorm floor],"" and i mentioned i have a friend who lives there too. It turns out they live together! :0

One of the guys i live with has a girlfriend majoring in [less common major], and i have a friend also majoring in it, so i asked her if they know each other. Turns out they were partners together on a big group project this semester. 

I met someone in a club here. A few months later i found out my friend from high school is his cousin. Im also from the midwest so it's not like one of those from nyc everyone already knows each other stories.

Somehow everyone seems to know each other. 

Thanks for coming to my ted talk

To the individuals who took it upon themselves to destroy the snowman that we had built between Becker and Rose today:,"Why did you do this? What manner of negativity possessed you to perform such a cruel and selfish act? That snowman was the product of many hours of arduous labor in the cold, and my singular beacon of hope in the dark, stormy seas of finals—and he did not even survive the span of a full day.

I understand that this time of the semester can be difficult for most, and I hope the act of destroying our snowman was cathartic for you in some way, if only to know that he did not die in vain. But surely, there are better ways to deal with stress? 

This tragedy has deeply saddened me, but I shall persevere. My regrets are but twofold—that I may never again gaze upon the face of my creation, in all it’s glory, and that I know not the identity of his assailants, that I could express the level of disappointment I have towards you to your face

If this was you, I urge you to take a good, long look at your actions and how they affect others, and consider whether this is the kind of person you strive to be.

To every poor soul in PHYS 2213...,"Listen up, guys. I'm looking through the approximately 500 practice problems that Ivan the Terrible posted, and I've come to the realization that I simply don't have the mental effort to work through these, or to even attempt to just interpret the answer keys. 

This entire class really has been a team effort, from piggybacking off of each other's questions in office hours, to the lecture questions, and especially to the CO-OPs. The final for this class is frankly just one big annoyance at this point. So I say, let's keep that same energy going into the final, and let's collectively agree to make the mean really, really abysmally low. Like, I'm talking lower than your chances of getting that internship at Goldman or SpaceX, lower than your GPA, lower than your self esteem. To the tryhards/kids to whom electromagnetism just comes naturally, good for you, guys, but on the final, please just take one for the team and write down ""Jσε"" for every question, and maybe whatever poor unsuspecting TA grades your questions will have the particular misfortune of writing ""joe who?"" on your test. If you're not into that, you could always just do the test to the best of your ability, then do what you do for the Learning Catalytics in lecture and simply raise all your answers to the zero power at the end of the test.

The means for the prelims were both pretty low, the class is curved to a B+, we get 3 problem sets dropped, and it's really just not worth it to study at this point... I think we can all agree that this is the best move for everyone involved. If you have any specific questions on how to be really bad at physics, feel free to contact me, it's one of the few things I consider myself to be an expert at.",1576613303,1,0

It’s not all SA’s fault but the SA is at fault. Some thoughts:,"I agree with the sentiment that this is not entirely SA’s fault. The calendar committee is made up of mostly faculty/staff with the SA added on. However, if you read the report to the committee comments at the end, you can see that only 2 students (both I presume are SA) commented on the issue. The longest part of **both** students’ comments (pg. 36-37) is about how the new calendar would affect the amount of time IFC and Panhell members have to spend at home over break. Neither comment mentions the increased stress of fewer study days. As an IFC member, I would like to clarify to both members of the SA that commented that **I am here to learn first and socialize second.** I return to school early **by choice**. I study as much as I can because Cornell is a hard school and I am here to learn what I am being taught. The fact that nobody on SA dissented to switching the calendar because of student mental health (nobody on SA voted for the current [as it was] calendar) is horrifying. We elect you guys to represent the interests of the students and it is abundantly clear that you failed to do so. So, yes, the entire calendar committee is to blame for this travesty, but the SA is supposed to have our backs just as we had theirs during SA elections.

Student Assembly,"Admins are laughing at us all blame the exam scheduling crisis on the student assembly, most of whom graduated before the schedule changes went into full effect. Only a bunch of fools would let the students make any sort of meaningful decision (schedule, admin fees, etc.) by fools like the students. It is far too likely that the SA is a scapegoat organization that can be used to push these agendas without any backlash – they can just point back at the student body and say that we elected the SA. 

Even if there was a ""real"" vote on such decisions, there had to have been influence (direct or indirect) from the administration. Most people already are aware of the fishy circumstances regarding elections here, as we can recall candidates in the past being disqualified for reasons that to this day remain ambiguous. If I were a betting person (I'm not), I would place a good deal of cash on designating student elections as bullshit as the student assembly's role in making legitimate decisions. Remember when free printing began in October? Me neither. 

That's because the school realized it *cost money*, so rather than directly saying ""no"" after an approval was prematurely made, the administration launched a succession of committees, meetings, and other bureaucratic requirements designed to do nothing but slow the process down. Just wait until next semester, when it gets delayed again.

There are actually a fair number of probable ulterior reasons for a final exam schedule change (such as higher internship/job ranking, etc). Some bad ones are related to rush week, and reducing (HA!) the stress the final exam period puts the students. In fact, just about every other shit reason like this is listed in the well-known decision report, which is but another sad byproduct of the business-like, bureaucratic-based system that this place has running. Over 100 page report of what? Whoever got paid to write that was probably giggling the whole time at how fucked things were going to turn out. 

If you were as infuriated as I was to get kicked out of the library at 12 the day before an exam, rather than say, ""fuck the SA, fuck gov majors, fuck the frats"" keep in mind who actually has control of such decisions. A truly student-supportive school would have looked a proposal to *take away study time* and prevented such an idiotic concept at all costs. So write a letter to the registrar or somebody like CEO Martha and ask, what in the fuck is going on?
